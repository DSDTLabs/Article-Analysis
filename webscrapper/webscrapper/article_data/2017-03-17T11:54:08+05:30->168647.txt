PUNE: For  , the road to success was never easy. His farmer parents from Khadegaon village in Pandharpur had to sell five out of the seven-acre   they possessed to fund his studies. With Nede clinching the seventh rank in the   exam, everything has been worth the effort.

 Nede, who is set to become the first tehsildar from his village, knew his goal early in life. “Since my father is educated, many people seek his help for various works at the tehsildar’s office. I grew up seeing that and realised the importance of education early in life and the role it plays in people’s lives.”
 
 “I always wanted to study in Pune and thanks to my parents’ efforts, I reached the city in 2009. I have seen and been part of the struggle of a farming household so the exam preparations were relatively not as troubling for me,” he told TOI.
 
 Apart from the money given by his parents, Nede’s working friends from his engineering college days also helped him financially. They would collect and give him Rs 1,000 per month.
 
 “I spent many nights studying for my exams in the library,” he said, adding that he would now take up the work of serving people from backgrounds similar to his.
