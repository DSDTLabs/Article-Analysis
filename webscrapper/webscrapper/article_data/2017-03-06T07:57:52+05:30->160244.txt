SURAT: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) general secretary Suresh (Bhayyaji) Joshi said the problem of brain drain facing the country can be tackled if spirit of nationalism is inculcated in our younger generation. 

 Speaking on ‘Present world situation and our role in it’ at a seminar organized by   here on Sunday, he said a beginning has to be made from schools and for that the education system needs to be changed. Unless we come up with a system where the youth is inculcated with the values that evoke love for the nation, the issue of brain drain is difficult to tackle. When the youths develop a feeling of love for the nation during their formative years, there won’t be an issue of brain drain, Bhaiyaji said.
