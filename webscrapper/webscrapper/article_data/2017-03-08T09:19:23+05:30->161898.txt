DADUPUR: Forty-seven villages in Amritsar district are reeling under an acute water shortage and have been forced to use polluted canal water after   (PSPCL) disconnected electricity supply to tubewells installed by the department of water supply and sanitation over non-payment of dues.

 Though the water supply department has claimed that it is yet to get payments for paying power bills from villagers, locals have said that they have paid all the bills. A resident of one of the 47 villages,  , said there had been no water to drink in his village, Dadupura, for 10 days. “We have paid all bills. Nothing is pending towards us. All we need is the supply of water,” he said.
 
 In the absence of water supply, residents of Dadupura have been fetching polluted water from a nearby canal. “We boil the water before drinking it,” Gurbhej said.
 
 The situation is similar at the neighbouring Kullian village. A resident,  , said he and his family had been getting water from a local temple nearby for the past week. “We are using it for cooking,” he said.
 
 Dadupura sarpanch Dhir Singh said villagers had been regularly paying their bills to the water supply department. “It is the department that has not done its job,” he said.
 
 PSPCL’s Amritsar suburban circle deputy chief engineer Pardeep Saini said they disconnected electricity connections, as they had to get the dues cleared before the end of this financial year. “It is routine practice,” he said.
 
 When contacted, water supply and sanitation department executive engineer (XEN)   said they had now begun a drive to collect bills from the villagers. “We have also received Rs 50 lakh from the government and have paid it to the PSPCL. We had been paying the PSPCL regularly,” he said.
 
 Though no official was willing to come on record about the amount owed by the department to PSPCL, a source said the tab was around Rs 3 crore.
