MUMBAI: In a major setback to Churchgate's iconic  , the   on Wednesday directed it to remove within two weeks its entire outside enclosure, which includes a cake shop, a seating area and an awning. 

 A bench of Justice   and Justice Shalini Phansalkar Joshi passed the order after the restaurant undertook to itself remove the structures and   to the BMC. The court directed the   to decide on the application within four weeks. 
 
 The restaurant had challenged the BMC's rejection of its plea to regularize the cake shop, seating area and awning, saying they existed since it began in 1956. The structures were regularized by the collector then and in 2001 and a licence fee and penalty paid to the BMC. "All commercial establishments on this stretch of the road are using this space," said Gaylord's advocate. She also said the BMC allowed galvanized sheets to be used for the awning and is now opposing it.
 
 BMC's advocate said the enclosure is from the building line to the compound wall, and as per development control regulations no structure is allowed in the compulsory open space. When the judges said the collector permitted it and BMC too approved it, the advocate replied, "The structure allowed earlier was temporary while this is permanent.'' BMC argued the enclosure will affect fire safety operations and is also in the coastal regulatory zone area. "You are realising it now? In 2001 your assistant municipal commissioner did not realise this?'' asked Justice Patil.
 
 The judges asked if BMC is taking action on "similarly situated or just a select few". BMC said it is taking action against other restaurants in the area. Gaylord sought time to remove the enclosure saying it's a "running restaurant and it will disrupt the business". The judges, granting two weeks, said BMC can demolish the "entire thing" after that.
