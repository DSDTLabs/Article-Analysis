Ludhiana: Fire brigade officials on Friday concluded the week-long mock drills and events organized for the National Fire Services Week at Delhi Public School (DPS). Students, teachers, and other staff members of the school were given knowledge about fire prevention techniques. The fire brigade had planned to create an actual scene of fire inside the school premises, but it was dropped at the last moment, because there was duststorm on Friday, and the fire could have spread in the school.

 Fire officers said they had to drop the idea at the last moment, because it was windy and if they had created a fire scene, then there was danger for the students. The officials also said there was enthusiasm among students to learn about fire prevention, and they were not ready to go to the classroom. Students were shown the technique to use fire extinguishers, and they were given the chance to put water from fire tenders, while assuming that flames were there. 
 
 Meanwhile, a series of awareness lectures was held on Friday at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH), Hero DMC Heart Institute, and College of Nursing for the fire services week. DMCH Youth Club, along with DMCH Department of Fire, organized the event and made people aware about various precautions to be taken to avoid fire accidents. An impressive slide presentation was also shown to the public present in the OPD block and other areas.
