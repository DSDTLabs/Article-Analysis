THRISSUR:   hatched from the eggs laid by a migrant turtle at   near Chavakkad were released in sea by the activists engaged in the conservation efforts on Tuesday. 

 According to the activists, 47 turtle hatchlings had crawled out of the shells of eggs laid by the turtle 47 days ago. The olive ridley turtle, one of the eight species of sea turtles, had in fact laid 107 eggs. But only 47 had hatched and the rest were damaged.
 
 This was the first hatching of turtles along the Kerala coast this year, according to the activists.
 
 Volunteers of two NGOs --   and Mahatma Club - have been keeping a round-the-clock vigil to avert any damage to the eggs. They also got support from global networks like Turtle Action Group (TAG). 
 
 The NGOs have been engaged in the conservation programmes at the four nearby points, Panchavadi, Pappali, Edakkazhiyur and Blangad, where the turtles have been coming to lay eggs annually in the recent past.
 
 Usually, each turtle lays over 110 eggs at a time and then crawl back to sea. The eggs take 45 to 55 days to hatch and the hatchlings either crawl back to sea by themselves or are helped by the volunteers, said Green Habitat executive director N J James. "We erect fences around the eggs and deploy watchmen there. We have been doing this for the last 16 years," he added.
 
 Sea turtles, evolved millions of years ago, are considered an endangered species and disturbing them could invite punitive actions as per the Wild Life Act.
