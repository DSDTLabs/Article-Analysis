Experts and activists said that the None Of The Above (NOTA) option, introduced for the first time in this election, was used by many on Tuesday.

 Since it has been a multicornered fight, with all alliances going bust, parties have had to field candidates beyond their capacities, which did not give a good choice to voters, for whom NOTA was a great option.
 
 “In my ward there was a situation where I favoured a party, but did not like the candidate the party put up.So, rather than not vote, I tried the NOTA option,“ said a voter from Dadar.
 
 Activists also said they had urged people to come out and be counted, even if they did not find a suitable candidate. “I was getting text messages asking why we should vote as all candidates are useless. I told them that this year there is an option of NOTA which they can use to get counted,“ said activist  , from  .
 
 In 2009, the   had told the   to offer this option on electoral ballots, but the government had opposed to it. In September 2013, the SC ruled that every voter should have the right to register a `None Of The Above' vote. From then on, the option has been in the electronic voting machines.
 
 The   had clarified that votes cast as NOTA are counted, but are considered “invalid“, so they will not change the outcome of the election process. They are not taken into account for calculating the total valid votes and will not be considered for determining the forfeiture of security deposit.
