Visakhapatnam: Governor of two Telugu states   said that he will pay frequent visits to the state universities to check on their infrastructure and academic activities on Wednesday at a review meeting with vice-chancellors of all state universities in Andhra Pradesh. This was the first such meet that he chaired as the chancellor since the bifurcation in 2014.

 Speaking to the media after the meeting, Narasimhan stressed the need of connecting research programmes at   to societal problems. He said that chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu is set on turning Andhra Pradesh into a knowledge hub. “In the meeting, we discussed several issues, including installation of bio-metric machines and introducing online fee payments, common academic calendar and others. A quarterly report is also proposed to be prepared on the performance of the varsities and attendance of both faculty and students,” said Narasimhan.
 
 “The varsities must nurture the innovative ideas of students and mentor them; ensuring that innovative products come out of the higher education institutions for the improvement of the society. In the last 43 months, the state has taken strides towards excellence in the education sector,” said the governor.
 
 “The aim of education should be to produce good human beings. Several state universities have made it to the National Institute Ranking Framework (NIRF) ranking. Now, I want to see at least four state universities in the top ranks,” said Narasimhan.
 
 Narasimhan called Andhra Pradesh the pioneer and leader in the education sector. He also stressed that university outreach programmes must contribute to the society. “Several universities, as part of their outreach programmes, have become part of open-defecation free drive, blood donation camps and Swachh Bharat and others initiatives,” said governor Narasimhan.
