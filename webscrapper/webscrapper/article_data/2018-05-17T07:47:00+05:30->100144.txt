GURUGRAM: Driving down the   against the flow of traffic in this city is a bane. One can easily spot intense arguments and scuffles breaking out on roads at points across the city where people usually drive on the wrong direction. Commuters continue to ply in wrong lanes at rotaries and below flyovers, wherever traffic cops are not deployed. Residents appear to be losing the fear of getting a ticket from traffic police, resulting in greater frequency of traffic rule violations. Two-wheeler riders are among the most frequent violators, as they seem to know they won’t get caught.

 On the stretch between Paras Hospital in Sector 43 and AIT Chowk, commuters coming from Paras Hospital should ideally take St Thomas Marg and then turn left towards Golf Course Road to reach AIT Chowk. However, Jaspreet Singh, resident of Central Park 1 in Sector 42, said, “A major accident is waiting to happen right in front of the Genpact building. Vehicles coming from St Thomas Marg take a right turn and move towards the Genpact building to take a short cut to AIT Chowk — a stretch of 200m on the wrong side — where they face traffic coming from the Sector 53-54 Rapid metro station — to meet traffic coming on the right towards AIT Chowk. This reduces their travel by 2.2km, as they don’t need to travel till Global Foyer mall for a U-turn, which is 3.1km from St Thomas Marg, and then back to AIT Chowk, another 3 km.” If stern steps are not taken, a head-on collision is bound to happen soon, he added.
