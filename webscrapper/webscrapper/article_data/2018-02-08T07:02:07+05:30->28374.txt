AHMEDABAD: One and half years ago, the   (IITM) Pune had studied 38   in the city for a duration of 18 hours in a day and had found that on some of the busiest stretches where vehicles were around 1.7 lakh or a little less, four-wheeler petrol vehicles constituted 48% and diesel vehicles 30% of the total traffic while the rest were CNG and a small percentage of these were  . The   that is being injected into the city’s air is high says the IITM study

 The IITM study was documenting the emission inventory for Ahmedabad and found that 90% of most polluting light commercial vehicles (LCVs) and 86% heavy commercial vehicles were run on diesel. The high court has directed the state government to ensure that all vehicles plying in Ahmedabad roads should be converted to CNG to curb air pollution.
  
  
 
 Naresh Lamba, an environmental engineer in Ahmedabad says, “You may think that your car burns more fuel when you go faster. But the truth is that your car burns the most fuel while accelerating to get up to speed,” says Lamba. He adds, “The constant acceleration and braking of stop-and-go traffic burns more gas, and hence pumps more pollutants into the air.”
 
 In the last 10 years, Amdavadis have added 24.59 lakh more vehicles on city roads. Back in 2007, there were 16.3 lakh vehicles registered since early 1950s. The road network for the city has remained 2,600km and will not grow in length any further in near future. Today, the city has 43 lakh registered vehicles! This has put a tremendous burden on the city’s ambient air quality.
 
 If one looks closely at the year-on-year vehicle registration data it reveals that the change came in 2007-08 when the number of registered vehicles increased from 32,000 in 2007 to about a whopping 1.14 lakh in 2008. Jams became a reality in the city from then on.
