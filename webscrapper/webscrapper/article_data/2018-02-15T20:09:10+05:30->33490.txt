LUCKNOW: For 25-year-old  ,  , this was the perfect   as she and her long time friend  , who stood by her in the most trying of times, got engaged on Wednesday.

 Way back in 2009, in Odisha’s Jagatpur, a young Pramodini not only suffered 80%burns but even lost her eyesight when a spurned lover hurled acid on her face.
 
  
  
 
 
 Overcoming the physical and the emotional trauma was an arduous task. But Sahu’s undithering support helped heal her emotional scars while   helped her regain 20% eyesight.
 
 “I was critically injured in the attack on that fateful day when I was returning from college after appearing in an examination .... I had to be taken home from the government hospital where I was admitted after nine months as the family had no funds for treatment,” Pramodini said.
 
 After having spent five years in bed, Pramodini was admitted to a private hospital near her house in 2014 where she was introduced to Sahu, a medical representative by profession, through a nurse who brought him to show the problems the young girl was going through. Sahu, took it upon himself to help Pramodini get on her feet. And she did it, in four months, when senior doctors had declared it would take at least ten months. “He even quit his job to stand by me during those trying times,” Pramodini recalled. Pramodini, vividly remembers that it was on January 5, 2016 that she came to Delhi for proper medical treatment on after getting in touch with the ‘Stop Acid Attack Campaign’.
 
 Meanwhile, her departure made Sahu realise the meaning she had brought to his life. Days later, he called her and proposed marriage. “She was only a dear friend till then, but when she left Odisha, I found what she meant to me. And on January 14, I confessed my feelings for her over the phone and proposed to marry her,” Sahu said. But it was not a proposal that Pramodini found easy to accept. She felt her lack of eyesight and physical challenges would not allow them lead a normal life.
