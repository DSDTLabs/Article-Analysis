AHMEDABAD: The Government of Gujarat’s home department on May 3 sent a letter to the state DGP office, informing the senior police officials about suspension of IPS officer  , currently posted as   SP, and asking them not to allow his posting even after bail from police or judicial custody. 

 Patel is among five accused arrested so far in the bitcoin extortion case. Ever since his arrest, he is on police remand. When he was produced in the court, his remand till May 5 was granted.
 
 According to the letter, Patel is declared deemed suspended as per rule 3(2) of the   (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1969 after completion of 48 hours of his arrest. Patel was arrested by state CID (crime) in connection with the case from his official residence on April 23.
 
 “As majority of the plot is clear on the basis of investigation so far, the attempt is made to establish the evidences. Thus, the rule of the accused is crucial. From the search at residences of Patel’s confidante in Amreli, we found two briefcases from which digital and paper evidences including bank documents were recovered. Scrutiny of the documents is on as we are trying to prove the money trail from Patel to other accused in the case,” said a senior CID official.
 
 CID officials said that the trail is leading to events beyond the single case of bitcoin extortion and illegal confinement of February. “Surat remained hub of bitcoin transactions post demonetization and a huge sum of black money was converted into digital currency. We are working on the evidence we have found so far to identify key players,” said an official.
