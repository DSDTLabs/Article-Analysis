Madurai: Stating that it would not be possible to allow fishermen to go to Katchatheevu using mechanised country boats to attend the St. Antony’s church festival there due to shortage of time, the Madurai bench of the Madras high court has said that the government should give permission to them next year.  A division bench headed by justice M Sathyanarayanan and R Hemalatha had on Wednesday reserved its order on a batch of cases seeking to allow traditional fishermen living in and around Rameswaram to go to Katchatheevu in Sri Lanka by using mechanised country boats for the festival. It passed an order on Thursday saying that that as per the bilateral agreement between India and Sri Lanka, traditional fishermen have the right to attend the St Antony’s church festival which they have been attending for years.  Due to some internal disturbances on the island nation, they were not allowed for some years. As this year’s festival will commence on Friday, giving permission would not be possible this year. Next year, the government has to permit them and ensure necessary security and facilities, the bench said. The Katchatheevu church festival is very famous among fishermen in Rameswaram. This year, the festival is scheduled on February 23 and 24. The Vercode St. Soosaiappar church which coordinates people for the festival has decided to allow only 60 mechanised boats and not allow country boats.  The government had said that it did not allow mechanised country boats due to safety issue. However, the petitioners claimed that country boats being used by Rameswaram fishermen are safe to travel. Using the country boats, the fishermen can stay and fish in deep sea for up to five days.
