PUNE: The   has blocked about 400   propagating the   (IS) ideology since 2014.
Confirming the development, the state Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) chief,  , told TOI, “We have blocked 400 URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) in the past two years.This will certainly help us in controlling the IS activities in the near future.“
 
 The threat from these URLs was immense because they were used as a real catalyst by the perpetrators in encouraging the youths to join IS.
 
 Asked if the IS threats had reduced, especially when the outfit was in precarious situation against the Iraqi security forces, he said, “It would be premature to say that the threats had reduced from the outfit, but our conscious efforts are on to counter the menace effectively.“ The ATS sources stressed the blocked URLs had been used effectively to radicalise youths to follow the ideology of IS.
 
 A top source from the agency said, “All security agencies, including the central agencies, are working in tandem to counter the IS menace. Hence, we could trace the URLs and block them on time.“
 
 Another source said, “We have to work relentlessly because the IS activists work smartly and consistently introduce new platforms on regular intervals. It is a daunting task for us to keep a close tab on them and counter their strategies.“
 
 According to sources, blocking URLs or websites propagating the   is a cumbersome process.“Even if we want to block a single URL, we need to send a special proposal to the Union ministry of home affairs. It is a time-consuming process,“ another source said.
