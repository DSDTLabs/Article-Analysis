NEW DELHI: The city turned warm ahead of a predicted spell of rain, with both day and night temperatures rising sharply over the past 48 hours, giving an end-of-winter feel for Delhiites. 

 Monday's maximum temperature was recorded at 24.6 degrees Celsius, three notches above the normal for this time of the year. Likewise, the minimum temperature rose to double digits after many days. It stood at 10 degrees Celsius, two degrees above normal.
 
 Meanwhile, a thick fog covered some parts of the city in the morning. The   saw visibility drop to less than 50 metres around 8.30am, from 200m recorded at 5.30am. 
 
 It later improved to 900 meters at 11.30 am. Unusually, east, central and northern parts of the city only had shallow fog, with Safdarjung recording a visibility of 300m at 5.30 am, which improved to 500m three hours later, an official said.
 
 Early morning fog disrupted rail services, leading to delays in 45 north-bound trains and 20 others being rescheduled.
 
 Officials said a western disturbance had caused temperatures to rise in the city. "Tuesday will be warm too. But we are expecting rains on Wednesday and Thursday," an official said. 
 
 He added that Thursday, which is Republic Day, is likely to witness cloudy skies and moderate rains.
 
 "I was literally sweating in office. It felt better after I took off my jacket and sweater," said Avinash Rout, a marketing executive.
 
 However, the city hasn't seen the last of the cold weather yet, the Met office said. Temperatures are expected to drop by three-four degrees from Thursday, following the wet spell. 
 
 However, the temperature is likely to rise again a few days later.
 
 "This year, winter was short-lived. Just when we thought that it was cold, temperatures have started to soar," said Shikha Rai, a   student.
