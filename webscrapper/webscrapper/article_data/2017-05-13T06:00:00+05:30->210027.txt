Visakhapanam: Despite objections raised by students, TDP has decided to conduct its annual Mahanadu at AU Engineering College Grounds and conducted bhoomi puja at the venue on Friday. 

 “As many as 14 resolutions will be passed during the three-day conclave starting May 27,” deputy chief minister and home minister N Chinarajappa said adding that the Mahanadu will be held in AU so that no hurdles posed to students during the summer holidays.
 
 Addressing the media after the bhoomi puja, the home minister and energy minister Kala Venkata Rao said around 20,000 cadres are expected to participate in the conclave where the TDP national president and state president will be elected. The Mahanadu will also discuss strategies to retain power in the state and come into power in Telangana. Chinarajappa said 14 committees have been appointed for conducting the mega event smoothly. 
 
 Venkata Rao said the party has been giving top priority to Mahanadu in the wake of reports of early elections. 
 
 Various student wings had opposed the TDP conducting Mahanadu at the AU Engineering College Grounds claiming that the government had itself issued an order dismissing all political activities on the premises of educational institutions. An order issued by the AP State Council for Higher Education in September 2015 had stated that no college or university premises should be used for political and religious activities. Keeping this in view, the AU management had denied access to many associations, organisations and political parties when they approached the university for the grounds.
