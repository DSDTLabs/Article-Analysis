The beauty of Bengaluru lies in the eclectic blend of old-world charm and new-age mentality. With its increasingly young population, and tons of people from other cities coming in, some of the city’s historic places and landmarks are losing their significance. But thanks to app-based scavenger hunts and regional challenges organized as part of college fests, interest in landmarks is reviving. 
A city-based app organizes quests at popular spots in the city, such as   and Lalbagh, where users have to go around the entire premises to unlock clues to finish the quest, and, in the process, explore them in their entirety.  , content creator of the app, says, “The purpose of developing such an app was to have a fun way of discovering your own city.”
 Shruti adds, “On our app, when users choose to play, say, the Cubbon Park trail, they are provided with one of the 25-30 routes. We have to unlock clues on their phones as and when they get to a certain location. It’s been only three months since we launched the app, and we’ve already had close to 1,000 people take part in our quests. We even have specific tasks on special occasions, such as locating tanks and fighter-plane installations across the city on Republic Day. It’s not just quests that are popular, but also challenges such as Bengaluru Lakes or Malleswaram Food and Temple Challenges, for which users have to visit the given landmarks and experience the places before checking them all off the list to complete it.”
 To make things interesting, city college students add a task, in addition to the treasure hunts. Lokendra, who organized a   as part of Symbiosis Institute’s cultural fest, says, “For our fest, we added tasks such as tasting the food at old restaurants and clicking selfies in front of monuments, in addition to just visiting them, to unlock their clues. This not only helps participants explore the place, but also experience what’s good about these landmarks.”
 
 
  
 
 Tejasvi S, who took part in of the quests, says, “My cousins usually visit the city every winter, so we’ve gone to Cubbon Park many times in the past. But the treasure hunt was a very interesting and new way to explore the place. It turns out, we didn’t know certain parts of the park existed till we played the game.”
 Fun elements apart, there are a few added benefits as well. “Treasure hunts are a fun way to explore the city and learn about its history, and when it is app-based, you really don’t need anyone to organize it for you because it’s already there. It can easily be turned into fitness routine as well, as unlocking clues or ticking landmarks off your checklist require a certain amount of moving around to be done,” says Shruti.
