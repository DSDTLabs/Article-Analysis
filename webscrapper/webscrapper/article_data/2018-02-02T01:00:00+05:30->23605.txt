If you drive past  ,   or even   Bridge, there are chances of you seeing a sea of pink. And that's courtesy the lithe, beautiful flamingos that make Mumbai their home during this season. Watch the scenery turn a bright shade as they almost do a ballet as they flock about and feed on algae and other crustaceans here. Says   and animal rights activist  , “This is the time for flamingos to fly into Mumbai. They have already arrived and will make this city their home for the next one-and-a-half months. The habitat and the current climate conditions are just perfect for them now. The harshness of summer seem far away.” 

 
 
 
  
  
 
 Since the long-legged graceful birds make for a visual treat, several city groups organise programmes to watch them during the course of their stay. "The bird is a protected species, so one can watch them from far," adds Sunish. 
  Naturalist   has launched a campaign to save the pink bird as well as Sewri Bay. He asks,“Did you know that an estimated 15,000-20,000 flamingos come to this city every year?" He goes on to reveal more on the pink visitors, "Mumbai is their biggest feeding grounds, out of Gujarat (where most flamingos originally come from). These are habitat-specific birds. They made the city their home in the early 1990s and have been making their annual visit since. They used to come here by October, but have started arriving later now. They are also shy and keep a respectable distance; they come close to the land when there are tidal currents. We get two species here - the lesser   (smaller in size) and the greater one (larger). The lesser one is more common one. And it’s not just flamingos, if you head out to say, the mud flats at Sewri, you get to see other waders too, such as gulls, terns and other birds."
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 The city has been conducting Flamingo Watch programmes, wherein bird experts take groups to view the birds with binoculars. Adds Sunjoy, “The birds are there the whole day and they move with the tide. They go deeper into the water and will been as specks as the tide goes further in, so watch for tide timings when you see them… it’s a lovely sight!”
  Informs Isaac Kehimkar, who takes groups to   to watch these birds, “The   declared the Airoli-mangrove patch and the Navi Mumbai creek as a flamingo sanctuary, last August. This centre will also start boat rides to see the birds from February 2, which also marks World Wetland Day." 
 Most of the groups are often seen heading out on a Sunday morning. He adds, “The birds have been spotted here, but are yet to arrive in full force. We have seen them in full flamboyance (a term used for a flock of flamingos) as large as 10,000, so get ready to be greeted by that sight soon. What is heartening, is that more and more people are interested in flamingo watching. They are more than just an Insta-friendly bird, there's much to learn about them," he adds.
