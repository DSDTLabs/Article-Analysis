PUNE: Two persons posing as salesmen attempted to rob a std XII student in her   on Monday night. The duo gagged and tied the girl before searching the flat, but left empty handed on failing to find anything.

 The   occurred around 8pm, when the 17-year-old girl was alone in the flat. Her parents had gone out for some work, VP  , assistant inspector of the   police, said.
 
 Valvi said around 8pm, the duo rang the doorbell of the flat located on the second floor of the building. Assuming her parents have returned, the girl opened the door. “The duo posing as salesmen, pretended to make their sales pitch. Suddenly they barged into the flat,” he said.
 
 Before the girl could raise an alarm, the duo threatened her to keep quiet and demanded money from her. On learning that the girl did not have any money or valuables with her, they gagged her and tied her hands with dupattas. “The duo then searched the entire flat. They rummaged through the cupboards and scattered clothes and other things on the floor, but did not get anything,” Valvi said.
 
 He added the duo was in the flat for nearly 15 minutes, when they heard some voices outside. This made them flee. After they left, the girl walked to the door and alerted the neighbours. “The neighbours freed her. In the meantime, her parents had returned,” Valvi said.
 
 The girl on Tuesday lodged a complaint. “She has given detailed description of the duo. The suspects were around 25 years old and were speaking in Marathi,” Valvi said adding, “We have launched a manhunt for the duo.”
