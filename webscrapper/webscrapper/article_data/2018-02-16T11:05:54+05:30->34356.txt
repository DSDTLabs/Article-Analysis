CHENNAI:Two widows of a former MLA will now have to serve one-year jail term, as Madras high court upheld their conviction and three-year rigorous imprisonment in a case of disproportionate assets.

 On Thursday, Justice G   dismissed an appeal moved by two wives of former AIADMK MLA V Pannerselvam (since deceased) assailing an order of a sessions court convicting them for abetting their husband to amaze wealth by abusing his official position. 
 
 The trial court had sentenced P   and P Dhanapakkayam to one year of rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of Rs 5,000 each. Their late husband had, however, been sentenced to three years of rigorous imprisonment with Rs 10,000 fine.
 
 Upholding the trial court orer on Thursday, Justice Jayachandran said: “On considering the evidence let in by prosecution as well as the defence to explain the source of income, this court finds that no error in the conclusion of trial court. Spate of purchase of land in the name of the petitioners during the check period while holding a public office by their husband clearly indicates the source for purchasing those properties not being declared to the competent authority to be considered as unknown source.”.
 
 In so far as the three year rigorous imprisonment and Rs 10,000 fine imposed on Pannerselvam , the judge said, “admittedly as a public servant he was the kingpin of the crime. But, he has already met his maker and the remaining appellants are his spouses who abetted the public servant to acquire wealth through illegal means. Hence they are liable. Therefore, this court holds that there is no merit in the appeal and appeal dismissed and trial court order confirmed. But considering the ailments suffered by the duo, the rigorous imprisonment is modified as simple imprisonment,” the judge added.
 
 Pannerselvam was the MLA representing Bodi assembly constituency in Theni district, from 1991 to 1996. He died in February, 2012.
