BENGALURU: A bicycle ride around a clean and sparkling   and a bike sharing network are among the dream projects Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has for the city. The corporation is all set to submit its proposal under the smart city initiative to the Centre, and has drawn up plans for 17 wards in the   (CBD).

 Other proposals include app-enabled car parking in Shivajinagar, digital information boards for tourists, electric vehicle charging points, and revival of historic markets. The corporation's proposal focuses on 17 wards in Gandhinagar, Malleswaram,   and Chamarajpet.
 
 BBMP commissioner N Manjunath Prasad said the smart city plan ning report would be submitted to the Cen tre soon. “The CBD area has been taken up for redevelopment under smart city ini tiatives,“ he said.
 
 In its previous at tempt to get central funds, the civic body had proposed Mahadevapura as the smart city zone. “We found that most smart city projects approved by the Centre projected CBD areas for redevelopment. So we selected CBD areas in Bengaluru this time,“ said Manjunath. The area to be taken up for development, should approval come through, covers 21.8sqkm and the population is 5.24 lakh. “The proposed initiatives are likely to cost Rs 1,728 crore,“ said Manjunath. “We have also proposed development of 25 roads in CBD under the TenderSure model at a total cost of Rs 250 crore.“
 
 In addition to the central government funds of Rs 500 crore over five years, the corporation will get state government grants. “We have proposed some projects under the public-private partnership model such as Ulsoor Lake redevelopment, construction of skywalks and upgradation of bus shelters,“ he said.
