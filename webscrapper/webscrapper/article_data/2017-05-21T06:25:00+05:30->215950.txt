NAGPUR: With   fast approaching, a two-day yoga camp was especially organized for members of the Muslim community to help them sail through the month of fasting. Fifteen people attended the camp which was jointly organized by Chitnavis Centre and Sanatan Yoga Shrine at the centre’s premises in Civil Lines on Saturday.

 Shrine’s founder and yoga guru  , conducted the sessions and introduced the attendees to several asanas and exercises, which would help them to overcome hunger, dizziness and weakness caused due to extensive fasting. Several queries and doubts by the audience were also addressed by him.
 
 “Yoga is science and not a religious custom, though like laws of physics and concepts of chemistry it is often misunderstood as ‘Christian’ because of them originating primarily from the west. Yoga should not be considered as ‘Hindu’. Moreover, the presence of yoga can be found in every religion of the world for it transcends borders and barriers,” said Joshi.
 
 “Yoga is a way to gain complete self-control over both mind and body. The time of Ramzan can be difficult. I fast during the period too so I am aware of the concerns. Yoga can be extremely beneficial in significantly reducing the urge for hunger and thirst, which arise due to fasting,” he added.
 
 Event organizer and a member of the centre,   told TOI that her organization had worked with Joshi for several events before and he suggested that we should organize an event like this, as Ramzan is approaching.
 
 “We have noticed that there is still certain level of association of yoga with religion and we wish to change that and tell people that yoga is for everyone who wish to practice it,” said Choudhari.
 
 Zainab Khan, one of the participants, said, “Ramzan can be a tough time especially for women with all the household chores and little rest. I am delighted to be able to attend this programme and I hope the exercises and asanas I learnt today will help me.”
