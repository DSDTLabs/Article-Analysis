CHENNAI: Some of the Class X   students who appeared for the   paper on Thursday have found some questions ambiguous. Students said a few questions had more than one right answer and marks should be awarded to those who gave either of the answers.

 “We found sections A and B difficult as some questions were very confusing,” said Mathumitha, a candidate. “I felt at least five questions were twisted. The rest of the paper was, however,  .” Some teachers received feedback similar feedback about a few two-mark questions. 
 
 Kitheri Steella, a   English teacher, said that this time the paper was different and repeated questions weren’t asked as expected. “The abbreviation questions were asked for the first time and a few questions were wrong in the last section. Other school students would have found it more difficult than   school goers. Students who were expecting full marks are disappointed,” she said. 
 
 Deepa M, class X state board student from St. Michel’s Academy said, “The English paper overall wasn’t tough but had   questions. I found Section E to be most difficult as we were given a word and were asked to use the same word in three sentences, something never asked before. Two mark questions were also slightly confusing”.
