Traders across the district downed shutters from 6 am to 6 pm on Tuesday to extend support to the anti-Sterlite protest organised by the people’s movement. But the violence that followed left all the shops closed throughout the day. People had a tough time as hospitals, clinics and pharmacies also shut during the day.

 Public as well as the police had a tough time to find a tea shop or an eatery open as there was 100% closure due to the violence. “Even buying water to quench our thirst became difficult. We asked our friends who were coming from   to bring food and water,” said P Dhanapal. Traders were unsure of opening the shops on Wednesday.
 
  as well as private buses connecting   and nearby towns and districts stopped services completely as the situation was getting out of control close to noon. Taxis, auto rickshaws and other modes of public transport to Tuticorin were also taken off the road.
 
 This has forced people to seek lifts on the few vehicles that were heading from and to Tuticorin and its outskirts. Many could be seen walking on the highway as they could not get any vehicle.
