Jhargram: Forest officials are bringing in multiple drones to capture the movement of the tiger at Lalgarh forest. 

 The decision was taken after a high-level meeting of forest officials on Wednesday as fresh pugmarks were spotted at Lalgarh in the morning.
 
 It was also decided to install five new cameras in the forest to track the tiger’s movement.
 
 Forest officials said around 9.30pm on Tuesday, the tiger’s pugmarks were spotted at Murakati forest, around 8km from Midnapore town. On Wednesday, the pugmarks were seen again at Lalgarh.
 
 “It looks like the tiger has been moving in search of food,” a senior forest department official said.
