Panaji: Implementing the interim order of the high court of Bombay at Goa, the directorate of technical education (DTE) on Monday filled the MBBS programme seats as per the provisional merit list of students it had prepared.  DTE officials informed that around 10 students, of the 125 who had approached the court, have secured an MBBS seat as per the provisional admissions. Around 125 students had approached the court for relief after they missed the DTE’s deadline to apply for the MBBS seats. In an interim order issued in the case on July 10, the high court had asked the DTE to include the 125 late applicant students in the provisional merit list it was preparing for the MBBS seats.  During the case’s hearing last week, the high court asked DTE to give provisional admissions to students to the MBBS programme based on this merit list, which brought temporary relief to the 125 students. These provisional admissions, however, are subject to further orders of the court. The next hearing in the case will be in the coming week, as during the hearing of the case on Monday the state government asked for time to file its reply. “The interim order has taken care of our interest,” lawyer for the aggreived students, senior counsel Nitin Sardesai, told TOI. On Monday, the DTE filled the professsional degree seats in Goa for all the programmes for which entry is based on the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET). Provisional admissions were carried out for the programmes of medicine, dentistry, homeopathy and ayurveda in Goa. Around 2,000 students applied for these four programmes this year. The 125 students approached the high court as they said they were not aware they had to apply for the Goa medical seats before the NEET results were out.
