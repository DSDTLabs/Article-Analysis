 Warner was selected in the third round of the draft by the Winnipeg Hawks, who took West Indies' Dwayne Bravo and South African left-hander   in the first and second rounds.
 
 Smith was taken in the second round by the Toronto Nationals, where he'll play alongside West Indian star   and fellow West Indies allrounder  .
 
 The Canadian tournament will also feature teams representing Edmonton, Montreal and Vancouver, along with a Caribbean side.
 
 It runs from June 28-July 15 at   near Toronto.
