CHENNAI: There finally seems to be some movement in the appointment of a vice-chancellor for  . A decision was taken in the higher education department that the three-member   to finalise names for the VC post is all set to meet on January 23, highly placed sources in the department said.

 A member of the panel confirmed the development to TOI on Wednesday, while another member said, “things are moving in the right direction and there could be an announcement soon.” This is the first time the panel will meet officially after the 2016 assembly election.
 
 The vice-chancellor could possibly be appointed before January 31, sources in the state government indicated. At last week’s syndicate meeting, higher education secretary A Karthik had indicated something similar when 12 syndicate members petitioned him to reconstitute the VC-convenor committee. The committee is discharging the duties of the VC since R Thandavan retired in January 2015. Karthik is chairman of the committee.
 
 There has been a slowdown in academic and administrative decisions due to the absence of a VC at the university and even the convocation was cancelled.
 
 The search panel consists of P N Veda Narayanan, retired vigilance commissioner, Dr R Balasubramanian, faculty member of  , and  , former syndicate member of the university. They will submit the shortlisted names to the Governor of Tamil Nadu, who is the chancellor of the university.
 
 Sources indicated that a former syndicate member who was a member of the VC-convenor committee and has close links to AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala’s family is a strong contender for the post. A former vice-chancellor is also in the race, they said.
 
 The panel has not been bereft of controversies and could not submit the names just before the model election code of conduct for the 2016 assembly elections, as one member went absconding.
