MUMBAI: A special NIA judge on Thursday called for records from   after an accused in the 2008 Malegaon blast case pointed out that forged   had allowed co-accused Lt Col   prison hospital stay since January 2011. Judge S D Tekale ordered that a notice be issued to the superintendent of Taloja jail “for sending the true copy of the order informed to him from this court dated April 30, 2011”. The court will hear the matter next on February 28.

  made an application seeking a copy of an 2011 order which allowed Purohit to shift from the jail cell to the hospital within the premises. 
 
 Purohit was arrested in November 2008 and has been incarcerated since. Upadhyay, who is also housed in Taloja in a single occupancy cell, alleged that the court had on April 30, 2011, permitted Purohit’s admission to the prison hospital for a “limited specific period”. He, however, alleged that the “copy held by the Taloja jail, has only one para instead of the original two and in it the words ‘limited specific period’ are missing.” He said that “it altered the meaning and impact of the order, making it permanent instead of a temporary affair”. Referring to RTI queries, he further alleged that when tallied with the documents furnished by the additional IG prisons, he was shocked to find that the paragraph and the relevant words were missing.
 
 Upadhyay alleged that the difference between the authenticated copy and certified copy cannot take place without the active connivance and complicity of the court staff, Purohit and his escort party from April 30, 2011.
 
 The application also stated that if the allegation is revealed to be prima facie true then an inquiry should be instituted and harshest possible action be taken against the culprits. 
 
 Purohit’s lawyer Shrikant Shivade later said, “the application is frivolous” and there have been a “spate” of applications by Upadhyay.
