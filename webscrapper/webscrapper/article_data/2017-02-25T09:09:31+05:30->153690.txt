VISAKHAPATNAM: Two Maoists were reportedly killed in an exchange of fire on Friday in between Gorlemetta and Annavaram forest areas in Koyyuru mandal,  , on Friday morning. 

 Cops identified the Maoists as   militia commander Gemmeli Jambri (37) of Mettuguda village and dalam member Chittibabu (27) of   village near Erragedda GK Veedhi mandal. They also seized two kit bags and weapons from the encounter site. 
 
 Visakha   Rahul Dev Sharma said both the Maoists were killed in an exchange of fire. “The Maoists thought that our teams had returned from Koyyuru after arresting suspected militia members from various villages. But several of our teams remained in the mandal. The Maoists came out on Friday and were spotted by a combing party leading to firing from both sides,” said a senior cops involved in anti-naxal operations.
 
 The Rural SP said the incident occurred at around 8.30 am near a hill in Annavaram forest. “The security personnel spotted around 15 persons. While two of them were gunned down, the others escaped,” he said. 
 
 Jambri carried a reward of Rs 4 lakh and was the mastermind in the Busulu-Sagulu incident near Lakkavaram village in GK Veedhi mandal four years ago where he opened fire on villagers and killed two tribals.
 
 According to sources, Jambri was involved in 65 offences including 15 murders, eight exchanges of fire and 11 famine raids besides attacks on tribal properties. 
 
 Both the bodies were brought to Narsipatnam where a post-mortem would be performed on Saturday before they are handed over to the relatives.
