 On Tuesday, the ruling BJD appeared before the state election commission (SEC) for the third time in a week. This time, the ruling dispensation complained against an advertisement on Atal Jyoti Yojana in almost all leading local dailies with a photograph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
 
 "In spite of our repeated complaints, these advertisements continue to be published/ telecast in local newspapers and Odia TV channels though the model code of conduct is in force," said BJD general secretary Rabi Narayan Nanda, who led the delegation . 
 
 On the basis of complaints lodged by the BJD, the poll panel had earlier issued notices to the relevant Union ministries to stop broadcasting advertisements on Pradhan Mantri Ujjawla Yojana and Swachh Bhatat Abhiyan respectively.
 
 Meanwhile, a BJP delegation on Tuesday also moved the poll panel."The SEC had directed the state government to make the voters list available in all blocks, but they are yet to do it," said BJD vice- president Sameer Mohanty. He said a number of advertisements on state government schemes still have photographs of Naveen Patnaik. On BJD's allegations, Mohanty said the Centre's advertisements are meant for the entire country. 
 
 Officials at the SEC said they would take appropriate action after examining the allegations.
