HYDERABAD: The  , regarded as Asia’s biggest tribal congregation, is likely to be celebrated as a state festival this year too as the state government is yet to receive communication from the Centre on its request to grant national festival status to the jatara. The four-day festival, also known as   jatara, will be celebrated from Jan 31.

 Telangana endowments minister A   told TOI that they have done whatever required to impress upon the   government on the importance of the tribal festival. “We also met vice president M Venkaiah Naidu in this regard. The VP said he would positively try to secure national status for the festival. We even submitted a document about the importance of the festival to Union tribal affairs minister J Oram. Though we were very hopeful, so far, we have not received any communication from the Centre,” Indrakaran Reddy said.
 
 The TRS government is spending ₹80 crore to make the event a grand success. Nearly one crore people, mainly tribals, followed by those from the SC community and others, are expected to participate in the jatara. “Tribals from not only Telangana but other states in the country attend this event. Grant of national festival status would have given a further fillip to the TRS government’s efforts to take the event onto the global tourism map,” an official said.
 
 The KCR-led government has set up a folk museum and an amphitheatre at Medaram for display of folk art. Over 300 artistes will perform tribal dances like Dimsa and Gussadi. The museum will showcase tribal instruments, bow and arrows, axes and traditional artefacts of all the nine to 12 sects of Koya, Gond and   tribes.
 
 From Jan 28 onwards, nearly 4,500 buses will operate daily in all five routes to Medaram. Over 10,000 policemen will be deployed for security besides setting up of CCTV cameras.
