 Albeit a bit delayed, unlike other artistes (Marilyn Manson’s Say10), Pitbull finally dropped his tenth studio album 'Climate Change' this month. It starts off with the air-punching 'We Are Strong' featuring vocals by Kiesza. An unlikely collaboration between   and Travis Barker results in ' ' — a fast-paced, rock-inspired song that has all three artistes contributing the best of what they have, which makes it hands-down one of the best tracks on the album. Other numbers, which stand out among the 12 tracks are 'Can’t Have', an EDM-inspired pop track. It is something that the rapper hasn’t done a lot before. A mildly political track, it has Mr Worldwide collaborate with Steven A Clark and Ape Drums. If   was absent on Drake’s album, she makes an appearance here on 'Sexy Body'. It evokes a bit of nostalgia, but the way it has been packed with slick beats, deep grooves and a fast pace, it sure keeps you moving. The only problem with 'Climate Change' is the fact that, besides the tracks mentioned above, the rest fail to maintain their individuality and end up sounding like weak copies of Pitbull’s earlier songs. Few other notables include 'Dedicated', featuring  , 'Freedom', which has   as a writer and 'Messin’ Around' featuring  . A pure party album, this may not be the rapper’s best one, but it works.
