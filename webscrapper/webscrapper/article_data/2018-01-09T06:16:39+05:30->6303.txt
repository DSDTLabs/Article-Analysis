NEW DELHI: A 17-year-old girl was allegedly raped in a car on Saturday. 

 The girl said in her complaint that she had left her home at Ashok Vihar last week and had been staying at   gurdwara. Last Wednesday, she met a 21-year-old youth at the gurdwara and became friends. She even travelled with him to a friend's place, and the youth dropped her back at the gurdwara. 
 
  On Saturday, he returned with a cousin and offered to take her home. She said she had refused initially, but gave in later. 
 
 They drove in an SUV to a desolate place where the youth raped her for nearly an hour even as his cousin drove the vehicle around. They dropped her back at the gurdwara and threatened to harm her if she went to the police. 
 
  She went to Connaught Place police station on Sunday, and a POCSO case was registered. Additional CP, (New Delhi) B K Singh, confirmed the incident but refused to reveal further details. Police said the two youths would be arrested. 
 
 The girl had fled from her home twice earlier.
