CHENNAI:   and Siva Kumar ply autorickshaws for a living at Sembakkam. On Tuesday, when a TOI team visited   on the Medavakkam-Tambaram Main Road, the two rushed to ask why pictures were being taken.

 “Click pictures of the bus stop all you want. Don’t take pictures of our autos,” said Siva Kumar. The duo operate their autos from an illegal stand at the   bus stop, encroaching upon the space intended for buses and commuters. The irony was that the auto stand caters to officials and visitors to the Sembakkam municipality office located right behind the bus stop.
 
 The situation in Sembakkam is not an aberration. At the Tambaram terminus, MTC staffer Sekar said the menace was bigger. “Cab drivers park vehicles inside. Every morning, it is a painful job for us to knock on every car door and push them out. The police are of no help,” he said.
 
 The city police seem indifferent to illegally-parked vehicles. At the Chromepet bus terminus, a police patrol car was parked all afternoon alongside several private cars. But senior police officer,  , differs. “In the past three weeks, we have identified 120 spots in the city where traffic movement was a concern due to encroachment. We mobilised traffic personnel and have removed obstacles in 30 spots now,” he said.
 
 The reality, however, is that private vehicles parked inside Saidapet and   bus termini did not catch the police’s eye. “The problem of illegal parking is tough to handle. But nothing changes overnight. It requires improved coordination between corporation and the police over a period of time,” said a senior corporation official
