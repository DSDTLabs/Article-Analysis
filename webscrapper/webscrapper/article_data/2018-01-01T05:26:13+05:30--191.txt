QUEPEM: The wait for formally inaugurating the Quepem primary health centre (PHC) gets longer with each passing year.

 The foundation stone for the 24-bedded PHC was laid on March 19, 2007, and the project was subsequently completed five years ago. The hospital was finally set to be inaugurated on December 31, 2017.
 
 The decision to inaugurate the facility was taken in a meeting recently between health minister  , opposition leader and Quepem MLA Chandrakant Babu Kavlekar, Cuncolim MLA Clafacio Dias and health officials. Director of health department Dr   informed Kavlekar in a letter dated December 12, 2017 confirming the PHCâ€™s inauguration on Sunday, as directed by the health minister.
 
 Rane, during the previous assembly session, had promised the Quepem legislator that the hospital, equipped with all facilities, will be thrown open before the end of 2017.
 
 The new PHC has been partially functioning , after day-to-day functioning, including the casualty, was recently shifted owing to lack of beds in the old building. However, the new building is only equipped with four beds. 
 
 Official sources blamed the shortage of doctors for the delay in inaugurating the PHC. Presently, there are four doctors on duty. In addition, one radiologist will be available twice a week, while a paediatrician and gynaecologist will be posted on a weekly basis. Dalvi informed that five additional nurses have been posted.
