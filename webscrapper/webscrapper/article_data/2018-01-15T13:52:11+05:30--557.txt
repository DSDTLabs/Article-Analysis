MEERUT: In the case of 15-year-old daughter of a   priest, who was found brutally murdered in   on Friday, post-mortem report has corroborated the torture inflicted on the teen girl before she was finally strangulated by the assailants. The report, however, remained inconclusive on the family’s   charge. Her father had alleged that the class X student was gang-raped by her kidnappers before she was murdered.

  According to the autopsy report, there are close to a dozen bruise marks on her face and neck region as of result of repeated strikes by some blunt object. Mud on her body also suggests struggle by the teen girl who allegedly tried to resist the assailants.
 
  “There are several ante-mortem injuries on victim’s body. There is no external injury on the private parts of the body of the deceased,”  , senior superintendent of police (Meerut), said.
 
  Mud on the front portion of the body also suggested that the deceased put up resistance before she was finally overpowered. "The injuries were definitely caused by a blunt object. But the size and shape of the object cannot be conclusively determined. It’s likely that she was punched repeatedly,” said a medical practitioner who examined the report.
 
  The report remains inconclusive on rape with viscera sample preserved for further analysis "There seem to be no bruises around the genital areas, which is usually common in cases of violent sexual assault. With this report, we cannot conclusively say whether sexual intercourse occurred or not. Further examination of any semen residue will provide further clues,” said the medical practitioner.
