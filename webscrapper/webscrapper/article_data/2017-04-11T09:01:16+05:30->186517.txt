PATNA:   CM   on Monday slammed the Vasundhara Raje government in Rajasthan for denotifying its state highways to circumvent the Supreme Court ban on liquor sale within 500 metres of the  .
 
  Addressing a national conclave of Gandhian thinkers at the Samrat Ashok International Convention Centre to mark the beginning of yearlong centenary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi’s Champaran Satyagrah, Nitish said he was stunned to know that Rajasthan and a few other state governments were denotifying their state highways with an apparent intention to circumvent the Supreme Court order prohibiting sale of liquor on and around the national and state highways. “It is a unique case of remaining in power and trying to ‘manipulate’ the court orders,” he said.
  
  Nitish, who implemented total prohibition in Bihar in on April 5, 2016 and launched a nationwide crusade against alcoholism, said the denotifying of the state highways proved that they wanted to continue with liquor sale in their states.
  
  Expressing his disgust over the Raje government’s decision, Bihar CM said Rajasthan earns around Rs6,700 crore per annum from manufacturing and sale of liquor. “Bihar also earned a little less (around Rs5,000 per annum) from the liquor trade, but we didn’t care about the revenue and implemented complete ban on sale and consumption of liquor in the state after some women demanded prohibition,” Nitish said amid applause from the audience.
  
  He also said the Grand Alliance government in Bihar enforced complete ban on liquor just after four and a half months after coming to power on November 20, 2015. “We thought there would not be more appropriate time to ban liquor in Bihar than a year before the beginning of centenary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi’s Champaran Satyagrah,” Nitish said and added, “Coincidentally, it was also the year of 350th Prakashotsava of Sikh Guru Gobind Singh Ji Maharaaj.”
