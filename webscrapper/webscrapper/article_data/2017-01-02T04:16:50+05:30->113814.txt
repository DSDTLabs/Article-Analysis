LUCKNOW: After Saturday's show of strength, UP CM   appears set to extract political advantage out of his victory. Depending on how the power struggle plays out on New Year's Day , he could even seek complete control over the party by seeking SP's presidentship and the ouster of   member  , one of the central characters in the family feud. Such a move could cause fresh convulsions in the party.

 In fact, the friction could intensify as early as Sunday , with the   camp determined to go ahead with its emergency national convention, which, sources said, could take up several thorny issues, including Akhilesh being anointed SP president. The convention is also likely to adopt resolutions that may seal the fate of state chief   along with Amar Singh.
