A mysterious poster of hard rock band Guns N' Roses featuring all five original members of the band has been spotted in London's Camden area conceiving the reunion rumours. Several media reports stated that, the recent poster, featuring the original members  ,  , Duff,   and  , suggests that all five of them might be coming together for the first time since 1991.

 The billboard links to a site, which is blank, save for a message that says "Destruction is Coming" with, "#APPETITEFORDESTRUCTION" hashtag.It reportedly also provides links to the band's social media pages.
 
 The URL is reportedly registered to a Universal   Group, by virtue of which a few have drawn conclusion that the publicity campaign is meant to tease a reissue of Appetite for Destruction.Speculations are also rife that the billboard is teasing a full reunion of the Appetite-era lineup of Guns N' Roses.
 
 Appetite for Destruction is the debut studio album Guns N' Roses. Released on July 21, 1987, by Geffen Records to massive commercial success, the album topped the Billboard 200 and became the best-selling debut album as well as the 11th best-selling album in the United States.With about 30 million copies sold worldwide, it is also one of the best-selling records of all time.
 
 It is likely that the billboard has got nothing to little to do with the original lineup reunion. They could be promoting something else relating to the 30th anniversary of the record, according to the media reports.
