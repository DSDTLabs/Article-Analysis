LUDHIANA: Family members of the one and a half year old child who died allegedly after being administered polio drops staged a protest at the cremation ground when the child’s body was taken for burial. They held up the last rites for more up to 2.5 hours demanding a copy of the postmortem report and a copy of the letter sent by the police official to the civil surgeon demanding inquiry into the matter.

 One of the relatives,   said, "We want an inquiry to be conducted into this case. So we wanted all the documents, including a copy of the postmortem report and the letter sent by the police official. 
 
 The family, alongwith the police, reached the cremation ground around 1pm for the burial, but it could only be done by around 3.30-3.45 after police produced the documents demanded by the family. 
 
 Ravinder, the child’s father, who was sitting in a corner with the body, said, “I only want an inquiry to be done. That is why we have taken the postmortem report. A detailed inquiry should be done. I have lost my child due to negligence.”
 
 The family proceeded with the burial after   Dharam Pal   showed them a copy of the DDR alongwith the postmortem report and letter sent by the police to the civil surgeon demanding more inquiry and investigation. 
 
 Meanwhile, family members and neighbours who were at home, said, “The police was in a hurry to go ahead with the burial. They did not even allow the mother to see the child. They came with the body of the child and after a minute or two, they took his father and grandfather to the cremation ground for burial.
