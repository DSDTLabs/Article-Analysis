LUCKNOW: In an embarrassment for the   government in UP, several ministers, including the deputy CM and the state spokesperson, sent out greetings on Sunday on their Twitter accounts for the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak.

 
 They later realised that their greetings were seven months in advance. Guru Nanak’s birth date falls on November 23 this year. Social media was quick to notice the goof-ups by deputy CM  , health minister and state government spokesperson Siddharth Nath Singh, medical education minister Ashutosh Tandon and law minister Brajesh Pathak, some of whom later deleted their tweets.
 
 A day before the tweets, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had visited Gurdwara Naka Hindola in Lucknow as part of Baisakhi celebrations.
 
  
  
 
 Later,   posted an apology on Twitter. The “confusion”, he said, “happened due to Wikipedia”. He attached a screenshot of a Wikipedia page highlighting the incorrect date mentioned.
 
 “Sorry for Guru Nanak Ji’s birthday tweet. Confusion happened due to Wikipedia (enclosed). Apologies to everyone,” he tweeted.
 
 Despite several attempts to contact Maurya and Tandon, they remained unavailable for comment.
