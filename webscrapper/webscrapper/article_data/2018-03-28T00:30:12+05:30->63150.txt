Coimbatore: Probe into the incident of setting the sport utility vehicles of a BJP leader and a businessman on fire within a span of an hour on the early hours of March 21 has hit a bottleneck with the special teams formed by the city police to crack the case are yet to get any lead, despite scrutinising as many as 200 CCTV footages collected from various commercial establishments.

 BJP district president CR Nandakumar’s SUV, which was parked at his house at Balan Nagar in Peelamedu, was set ablaze at 2.47am on last Wednesday by two-motorcycle-borne men, while the SUV and a scooter of businessman Umapathi was set on fire at Selvapuram around 3.45am.
 
 In both the incidents, which the police suspect to have perpetrated by the same gang, miscreants poured petrol on the SUVs to set them ablaze.
 
 “So far, we have collected 200 CCTV footages from various commercial establishments from Indira Nagar in Selvapuram to Balan Nagar in Peelamedu. Two masked persons were seen pouring petrol on the rear side of the SUVs and the scooter and setting them on fire. But we could neither identify the suspects nor get the registration number of their motorcycles,” said a senior police officer.
 
 The special teams led by assistant commissioners of police R Ramesh Krishnan and D Suresh had picked up a few functionaries of Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam (TPDK), Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) and some other outfits for questioning, but they were later let off, ruling out their involvement in the case.
 
 “Thanthai Periyar statue was beheaded at Pudukottai and various outfits have staged protest against the VHP’s Ram Rajya Rath Yatra in the city. So, we are investigating various angles to find out the suspects,” the officer said.
