Coimbatore: A day after TOI reported on the plight of 29 children staying at the dilapidated   at   near  , a   from the   and the Tamil Nadu adi dravidar Housing and Development Corporation Limited (TAHDCO) inspected the facility on Tuesday.

 The team consisted of R Senthivel with the district adi dravdiar and tribal welfare department and executive engineer of THADCO Murugan. They reached the place at 8am and took photographs of the building. They also conducted enquiry with hostel warden R Ravichandran and the inmates.
 
 Later, deciding to shift the children to the community hall at V Chandrapuram village, the officials inspected the place. “However, as there was no toilets in the community hall, we had to drop that plan,” said Ravichandran.
 
 They later visited Selakarichal looking for a suitable place for the children. But they could not find a good facility.
 
 The officials then decided to allot special funds to renovate seven rooms in the hostel for temporary stay. THADCO plans to demolish the rest of the building and construct a new building.
 
 “For the time being, the students will stay in the seven rooms in the hostel, which will be renovated immediately using funds from THADCO,” a senior official told TOI.
 
 The hostel inmates are studying at the government-aided Sri Ramasamy Naidu Vidyalayam School at Lakshminaickenpalayam.
