SHIMLA: Six months after it took over the investigation of gangrape and murder case of a   in Kotkhai area of Shimla district in July last year, CBI team submitted the status report before the   high court on Wednesday. 
 
 The investigative agency sought another three months to probe the case, saying investigations need to be conducted outside the state. Allowing the request, the court has posted the matter for next hearing on March 28.
 
 CBI had also requested for the affidavits filed by police officials. While refusing to provide the record, the court agreed to provide the copies. During the hearing, the court was informed about the case links outside the state and requested additional time to complete the probe. The court was also informed about the lack of cooperation from the state government during investigation, especially during elections. The accused arrested by the Kotkhai police in this case have been given a clean chit in the CBI investigation.
 
 Not happy with the delay in completing the case investigation, the court, during the hearing on December 20 last year, had directed the CBI director to monitor the case. 
 
 The body of a minor girl was found in forest area of Kotkhai in July 6, 2017, and had led to violent protests across the state. More anger spilled on the roads after one of the accused arrested in the case had died in police custody. On the HC directions, CBI had taken over the investigations on July 22, 2017. During the investigation, CBI found that the five people arrested in the case by Kotkhai police were not involved in the crime.
