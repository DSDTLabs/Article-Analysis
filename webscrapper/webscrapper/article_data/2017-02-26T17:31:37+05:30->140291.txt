After making his debut as the energetic youngster Bharath in Mudhugauv, Suresh Gopi's son Gokul will next be seen as a teenager in debutant Sharon K Vipin's movie  . 

 Actress  , who is closely associated with the project says that the film has a blend of love and comedy, and it will be an out-and-out entertainer. She adds, 'It is a feel-good movie that focuses on entertaining the audience. It revolves around a school and an automobile company.' 
 The title is equally significant, Devi tells us. 'Paal Mittayi is an important element in the plot, just like the hero and heroine.'
 In the movie, Gokul will be seen in a totally trim look. 'He will be seen essaying the role of Rohan and he has undergone a transformation to play the character,' Devi says, adding that her interaction with the Mudhugauv actor in his debut is what prompted her to suggest his name for the role of the protagonist in Panjara Paal Mittayi. 'I played the character of the college examiner in Mudhugauv, and I found him a very versatile actor. Also, he is very expressive.'
 
 Interestingly, Devi Ajith will be stepping into the shoes of a dance teacher called Maya in the film.
 Panjara Paal Mittayi also has Alencier Ley, Paris Laxmi, and Vijay Babu in a guest appearance, among many others. However, the makers are still on the lookout for girls who can play the female leads.
