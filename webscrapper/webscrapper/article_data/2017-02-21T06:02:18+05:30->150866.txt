MUMBAI: The   on Monday stayed personal “strictures“ passed by the Bombay high court against Mumbai city collector   in January . The high court had censured Joshi for “misplaced enthusiasm“ in passing orders of seizure of property and freezing of bank account in case of land transfers. The order was passed in a case where a developer,  , had been transferred lease-hold land in Mazgaon and the city collector had last October demanded Rs 15.5 crore as government dues for the transfer and later frozen its bank account and sealed the property.

 The high court had noticed similar orders passed by Joshi after she had taken over as the city collector several months ago. “This enthusiasm is misconceived and misplaced,“ said a bench of Justice S C Dharmadhikari and Justice B P Colabawala. The judges said that even if government revenue is to be recovered it must be recovered in accordance with law, with proper adjudication and procedures, and “natural justice" being followed.
 
 Joshi moved the SC, contending that the high court had passed unwarranted strictures against her. Appearing for her, additional Solicitor general Tushar Mehta argued that she was merely doing her job on behalf of the government to recover its dues.
 
 Senior counsel   appearing for   said the collector was not justified in demanding the “unearned income“ when there was no adjudication on it. Such demands “amounted to harassment“.
 
 The state government too in a separate petition moved the Supreme Court to challenge the high court order of removing seal and other reliefs granted to Redstone.
 
 The Supreme Court bench said both matters -Joshi's and the state's SLP -will be heard next Monday and stayed the high court observations and strictures against her.
