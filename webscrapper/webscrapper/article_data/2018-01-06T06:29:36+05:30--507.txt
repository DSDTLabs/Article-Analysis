KOLKATA: Khichdi or ready-to-eat packaged meals as stop-gap arrangements didn't go down well with the passengers of Howrah and Sealdah-bound   which left New Delhi station after 2am on Friday. Most passengers insisted that   (IRCTC) serve them proper meals collected from Kanpur after 5pm. 

 "All schedules have gone for a toss. The Howrah and Sealdah Rajdhanis start from New Delhi around 5pm. At that time, the pantry cars only carry snacks, tea, coffee, bottled water and packets of ready-to-eat meals. Dinner is collected at Kanpur station after 9.30pm and served to passengers. Due to fog, trains are now taking nearly 13 hours to reach Kanpur from New Delhi. As the trains left after 2am and would reach Kanpur only around 5pm, we made arrangements to serve khichdi and also offered ready-to-eat meals. Most passengers, however, insisted that they would also like to have 'lunch' from Kanpur, even if it is served after 5pm," an IRCTC official said. 
 
 The official claimed that the food loaded from Kanpur was fresh and well received by passengers. But it wouldn't suffice. On-board catering staff realized that passengers would get hungry again around 10pm. 
 
 Normally, Rajdhanis take four hours to cover the 347-odd km from Kanpur to  . The same distance is now covered in around 11 hours. 
 
 "We expect the trains to reach Mughalsarai around 4am on Saturday and have directed catering staff to load vegetable biryani and raita for passengers. If people get hungry before the trains reach Mughalsarai, they will have to make do with the ready-to-eat meals. After Mughalsarai, we don't anticipate further trouble as the journey would be completed in the next eight hours and we carry sufficient snacks and beverages to meet passengers' demands," the official added.
