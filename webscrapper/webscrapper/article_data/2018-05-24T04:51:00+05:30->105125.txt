AHMEDABAD: Rumours of firing at Nishan-2 Bungalows in   area of the city created a scare on Wednesday. However, cops said that no shot was fired. The complainant in the case, Rahul  , has alleged that   and his son Vivek Shah arrived in a car near his house with a gun but fled — leaving a 12-bore gun behind — after he raised an alarm.

 Senior police officials said that they are registering an FIR under the Arms Act against the two accused. Soni, who is the occupant of the bungalow, owns a jewellery showroom. “He has alleged that he had purchased the bungalow from Subhash and Vivek Shah and Subhash’s wife  ,” said a police official. “Soni has alleged that after paying Rs 60 lakh as part payment, he came to know that the trio had sold the same bungalow to two others earlier.”
 
 Soni had lodged a complaint against the three at the Anandnagar police station. “The trio had obtained anticipatory bail, ” the official said.
 
 According to special commissioner of police, sector-1, K L N Rao, said: “We are inquiring whether the gun is illegal or licensed. If it is licensed, we want to know who owns it,”   said.
