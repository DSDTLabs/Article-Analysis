LUCKNOW: BJP has zeroed in on party’s saffron icon and   chief minister   to launch the Hindi version of a book authored by Prime Minister   for students on how to tackle exam pressure.

 The invite for the book launch, which will be held in   in New Delhi on Saturday evening, has been sent out by the publisher. The invite’s background colour has been kept saffron.
 
 “Pradhan mantri Narendra Modi dwara rachit pustak Exam Warriros Hindi sanskaran ke lokaparn samaroh ke avsar par aapko sadar amantrit karta hai. Mukhya atithi   Adityanath(We invite you to the launch of the Hindi version of ‘Exam Warriors’, written by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The special guest on the occasion is Yogi Adityanath),” the invite, written in Hindi, reads.
 
 It was Yogi who suggested that the 210-page book should be translated in Hindi and should have illustrations of yoga poses, one of the CM’s close aides told TOI on Friday. “The idea was to ensure that the book can be finished within twothree hours by a kid. Yogi suggested that a letter to parents and teachers should be included in the book. This is how he has taught his shishyas at the   math before taking charge as CM,” he added.
 
 
 
 
 At Gorakhpur, Yogi used to regularly hold sessions for the youth on time management and personality development. The book has a series of asanas and breathing exercises to overcome exam stress. “There are to-do activities included at the end of each chapter. The idea is to encourage the child to think through the mantra,” said a BJP leader. On the eve of the launch, websites and mobile apps across the Hindi heartland offered 10%-50% discount on the book.
