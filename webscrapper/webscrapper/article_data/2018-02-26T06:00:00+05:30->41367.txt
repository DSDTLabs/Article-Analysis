A   held at   on Saturday saw more than 4000 lanterns light up the night sky much to the delight of nearly 1500 revellers who gathered at the venue to witness the spectacle.
Organised to spread awareness on nature conservation, the importance of keeping the city clean and saving the girl child, thousands of Hyderabadis from all walks of life poured into the stadium from early afternoon armed with colourful lanterns. 
 The initial delay in the starting of the event did not dent the spirit of the crowd who waited patiently to release their colourful lanterns into the sky. And as darkness fell, thousands of lanterns went up, setting the sky aglow. 
 
 “What’s the point in flying lanterns if they are not drifting into the dark sky? And the wind too has to be favourable. Thus, the delay was
 understandable. And when we saw the sky illuminated with colourful lanterns — a breath-taking sight — it was worth the wait,” said  , one of the participants.
 Meanwhile, members of a Kochi-based band, Dream Track, delighted the audience with a mesmerising instrumental set at the event. There was also a performance by popular sand artist  , who depicted the rich natural and cultural legacy of India through his artwork.
 
 “More than 4000 lanterns were lit in the evening and we saw participants, including some foreigners, pouring into the venue from the afternoon,” said 
  one of the volunteers.
