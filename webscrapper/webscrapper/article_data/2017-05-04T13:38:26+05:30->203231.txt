PUNE: The   ( ) is set to introduce a new   number to handle customers’ complaints about the transport body.

 The new number is 02024545454.
 
 “Senior officials want one unique number to answer all their grievances. The new number has been connected with the bus   (BRTS) control room. The complaints section of the PMPML was formed in August 2010 and since then people have been calling 02024503355. With the senior officials stressing on the new number, we are working to give it a technological edge and make it popular before it is formally announced,” a senior official of the transport body told TOI.
 
 Officials said the move is in line with the PMPML’s aim to have a dedicated and modern call centre to address grievances, complaints and suggestions.
 
 “The call centre is also expected to have a system under which drivers and conductors can call and report a problem which might have cropped up during their trips. The new number will be integrated into different departments and will have parallel lines so that people can immediately get in touch when they call,” the official added.
 
 Officials said the existing helpline number will continue for sometime but will soon be stopped.
 
 Currently, once a   is filed, the complainant gets a reference number as a text message on their phone. This is followed by another message which says ‘in process.’
 
 On average, it takes around a week to 10 days for a complaint to get addressed. After that, the complainant receives another text message stating the issue has been resolved and the way it was done.
 
 Some common complaints included buses not halting at stops, being overloaded, not following a schedule and the bad condition of vehilces. However, officials say the perennial complaint about buses not halting at stops has gone down with the addition of more vehicles. Drivers and conductors not behaving well with people and conductors always asking for the exact change for bus fares were also common complaints.
