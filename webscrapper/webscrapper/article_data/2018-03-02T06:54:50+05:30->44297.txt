CHENNAI: Sri  , the 69th acharya of Kanchi Sankara Mutt who passed away on Wednesday, was laid to rest around 11am on Thursday, close to the 'samadhi' of his guru Chandrasekharendra Saraswathi on the mutt premises in Kancheepuram. 

 Junior pontiff   performed several rituals from 7am with the chanting of vedic hymns by priests. The rituals included abhishekam, puja and arati to the acharya's body, propped up in a sitting position. Finally, the body was taken around the brindavan (grave) before being laid to rest. Devotees from various places had been coming to the mutt through the night to pay homage. After 7am the gates of the mutt were closed. Huge television screens were placed outside the mutt for devotees to watch the rituals.
 
 After the ceremony ended, the Kanchi seer spoke to reporters briefly. "Jayendra Saraswathi attracted and blessed people from all walks of life through his love and affection as well as through philanthropy and good deeds," he said. Praising his senior for his concern for the welfare of the people, the Kanchi seer said, "The late acharya knew what is good for the people". He added, "People must live with bhakthi to God and self-confidence."
 
  governor Banwarilal Purohit, Union ministers D V   and Pon Radhakrishnan and other dignitaries had earlier paid homage to the acharya.
 
 Similarly, priests from Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, Chidambaram Nataraja temple, Kanchi Kamakshi Temple and other religious institutions too paid respects. Sources in the mutt said Vijayendra Saraswathi was now in charge of administering the institution.
