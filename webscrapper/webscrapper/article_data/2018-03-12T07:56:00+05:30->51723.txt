GURUGRAM: The health authorities have finally given instructions for renovation of the gynaecology ward of General Hospital,  , and sanctioned the budget for the same. The   and   will be temporarily shifted to   General Hospital and the psychiatry ward to the polyclinic in Sector 31 for the work which will begin from April. 

 On Sunday, principal secretary Amit Jha inspected the Sector 10 hospital and held a meeting with officials of health and civil departments.Jha said that the gynaecology ward should be repaired on a priority basis. 
 
 In 2015, chunks of the ward’s ceiling had fallen down while mothers and newborn babies were present in the ward but fortunately, no one was injured. At that time, PWD (buildings & roads) had inspected the building and asked for immediate evacuation of the ward which was deemed dangerous. The ward was vacated but in the absence of alternative space, nearly 2,500 patients still visit the building daily for treatment. 
 
 The renovated ward will have 60 beds for women patients. The civil work is expected to cost nearly Rs 85 lakh while at least Rs 15 lakh will be required for the electrical and plumbing work. A budget of Rs 1 crore has been sanctioned for now. 
 
 On an average, over 700 pregnant women visit the Civil Lines and Sector 10 hospitals in a week and more than 20 deliveries take place in these hospitals daily. “Over 2,500 people visit the Civil Lines hospital daily. The footfall is less in the Sector 10 hospital. We have to vacate the ward before starting the repair work. So, two buses will be provided to transfer pregnant women and other patients from Civil Lines to Sector 10. This Sector 10 hospital will also be upgraded and a neonatal care unit will be set up for newborn babies,” said Dr BK Rajora, chief medical officer, Gurugram.
