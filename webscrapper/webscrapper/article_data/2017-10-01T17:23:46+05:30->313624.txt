Brian   said his and  's daughter Molly has moved to   to study for her final year in school. Reportedly,the Boyzlife singer's 16-year-old daughter is living with his parents and is having a great time. 

  
  
 "She's doing good. It's very different for her. She's so used to being in a house with five kids."
 
 "But studying for her finals, it's important that she can get a bit of peace and quiet and she gets spoilt rotten by my parents as well, so she's loving it," McFadden said.
