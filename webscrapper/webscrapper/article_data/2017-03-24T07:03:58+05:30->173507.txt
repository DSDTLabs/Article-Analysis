NEW DELHI: The Centre has approved a proposal to set up a   with constitutional status, an initiative that carries the symbolic gesture of putting backwards on a par with  .

 The announcement, coinciding with the birth anniversary of Ram Manohar Lohia, a mascot for Mandal classes, underlined that BJP is looking at serious political messaging through the decision.
 
 The proposed OBC panel, to be named National Commission for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes, will be created through a constitutional amendment similar to the ones providing for national commissions for SCs and STs. It will replace the   (NCBC) and will have the power of “grievance redressal“ of backwards as exercised by the panels for SCs and STs.
 
 The first big task before the new commission will be deciding the demand of Jats for OBC status.
 
 In a crucial departure from the post-Mandal Commission paradigm, the Centre has proposed that Parliament will decide on inclusion and exclusion of communities in the central OBC list. Currently, the Centre can simply issue a notification to change entries in the OBC list based on recommendations of the NCBC.
 
 However, changes to the lists of SCs and STs can only be made through a legislation.
 
 It has been a longstanding demand of OBC champions that the Mandal classes should get a separate constitutional identity , with its own grievance redressal mechanism.The NCBC's mandate was limited to inclusion and exclusion of communities from the Central OBC list and OBC grievances were heard by the National Commission for SCs.
 
 OBC MPs belonging to BJP praised PM   for the decision. Hukumdeo Narayan Yadav said, “The decision has been hanging fire for long. The OBC forum of MPs made a recommendation for grant of constitutional status to the NCBC during the 15th   itself but the UPA government sat over it.“ BJP general secretary Bhupendra Yadav said the decision showed the PM's commitment to the cause of OBCs.
