AHMEDABAD: Two witnesses on Monday told the special court hearing the Naroda Gam massacre case that they had seen then BJP legislator   along with former minister and an accused, Maya Kodnani, at Sola Civil Hospital on February 28, 2002.

 Natubhai Vaghela, a social worker from Odhav, who appeared in Kodnani’s defence, said he went to the hospital on the morning of February 28, with his acquaintance Ujjwal Dave, whose relative had died in the Godhra carnage. They had gone to get custody of the body, and Kodnani helped them in the process. He said he knew Kodnani because his daughter-in-law was had been admitted to Kodnani’s hospital for her delivery before 2002.
 
 Vaghela said he had seen Kodnani, Babu Bajrangi and   at Sola Civil Hospital.
 
 Special prosecutor   cross-examined Vaghela, to establish that he had supplied this information for the first time since 2002. He never revealed this before Gujarat police in 2002, when Bajrangi was arrested and in 2009, when Kodnani and Patel were arrested by the SIT.
 
 Another witnesses,  , also corroborated Vaghela’s statement, when he told the court that as the crowd swelled at Sola Civil Hospital, he drove Kodnani and present BJP national president Shah out of the hospital. 
 
 His cross-examination may take place on Wednesday.
