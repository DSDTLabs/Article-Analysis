THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The   will organize protest within and outside parliament for implementing women reservation bill in parliament and assemblies, said CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan.“The Union government has taken an indifferent attitude towards the bill. Though   cleared it, the lack of interest of the government is a hurdle for presenting it in the Lok Sabha,“ Kodiyeri said while inaugurating a Raj Bhavan march organized by the party to press for the demand of passing women reservation bill for legislatures.

 The bill that recommends one-third reservation for women in legislatures was passed by the Rajya Sabha in 2010 and has been waiting for the consent of Lok Sabha.
 
 Kodiyeri said the de mand for women reservation is not one of women alone, but, of the entire society.
 
 “Though we have seen women becoming the president and Lok Sabha speaker, their representation in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha is still limited. We are even behind Pakistan in terms of women representation in Parliament,“ he said.
 
 While there is 11.8% wo men in Indian parliament, there is 20.6% women in Pakistan parliament.
 
 Kodiyeri said the women in the country are concerned about the future of the bill as the Centre is stressing on Manusmriti to rule than the Constitution.
 
 Last week, the CPM state secretariat which discussed the issue observed, “While the   government introduced the bill, all major political parties, including BJP, supported it. BJP leader Sushama Swaraj had vehemently demanded for introducing the bill in the Lok Sabha. BJP's attitude to the bill now is different from that of the party while it was in opposition. There is no logic for not presenting the bill in LS in the past three years of BJP rule“.
 
 LDF convener Vaikom Viswan, Haritha Keralam mission CEO T N   and CPM district secretary Anavur Nagappan also spoke.
