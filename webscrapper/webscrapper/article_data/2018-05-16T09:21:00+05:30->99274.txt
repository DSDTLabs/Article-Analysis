CHANDIGARH:   government's alleged move to rename   in Karnal has triggered a controversy. 

 The hospital was inaugurated by Union health minister J P Nadda and chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on March 15 this year. On the day of inauguration, the CM had announced to upgrade it to a health university. Sources said the government was trying to upgrade the hospital to a health university and name it Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Health University.
 
  "This is another irresponsible initiative by the Haryana government. What is stopping them from coming out with another project in some other area," said former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda in Rohtak on Tuesday. 
 
  INLD leader R S Chaudhary termed the initiative as part of 'naamkaran abhiyan' (naming drive) of the BJP and the Haryana CM. "They had promised one medical college in every district of Haryana. Since they could not construct these in the past three-and-a-half years, they have started renaming the colleges," he said. 
 
 Haryana health minister Anil Vij and principal secretary and commissioner of medical education and research Amit Jha could not be contacted for comments. Gurgaon MLA and BJP spokesperson Umesh Aggarwal termed it as a controversy created by those having little knowledge of the entire issue. "It is true that we have decided to have a health university to be named after Pt Upadhyaya in Karnal. It is a separate project and has nothing to do with the   Chawla hospital. This issue is the creation of the Opposition," claimed Aggarwal.
 
  "Kalpana was the daughter of the nation. It is unfortunate that the government has renamed the university after a politician," said Hemant Bakshi, president of Haryana Punjabi Swabhiman Sangh.
