NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court set aside on Tuesday an order of   (Aptel) allowing power generating companies and distributors -Tata Power Ltd and   --to charge compensatory tariff from consumers due to increase in the cost of coal.

 A bench of Justices P C Ghose and R F   turned down the plea of the companies that rise in price of coal should be considered a force majeure event (an event that is a result of elements of nature-superior force) making them entitled to claim compensatory tariff. 
 
 "The fact that the fuel supply agreement has to be appended to the   (power purchase agreement) is only to indicate that the raw material for the working of the plant is there and is in order.
 
 It is clear that an unexpected rise in the price of coal will not absolve the generating companies from performing their part of the contract for the very good reason that when they submitted their bids, this was a risk they knowingly took," the bench said.
 
 The bench said the court had no power to absolve a party from the performance of its part of the contract merely because its performance had become onerous on account of an unforeseen turn of events. 
 
 Referring to agreements signed by the companies, the court said, "This clause makes it clear that changes in the cost of fuel, or the agreement becoming onerous to perform, are not treated as force majeure events under the PPA itself."
