LUCKNOW: The   needs improvement, said governor  , adding that there is hope as the new chief minister Aditya Nath   is determined to bring about change. 

 Naik said the Opposition should not boycott Assembly sessions and instead engage in deliberations and dialogue with the government, which is the essence of democracy.
 
 Naik was addressing the media here on Saturday after releasing his “annual report card” on his performance in the last one year while completing his third year in Raj Bhawan.
 
 Asked to comment on the performances of the governments led by   Yadav and now by Yogi, Naik said people of the state have given their verdict on the performance of the Akhilesh Yadav government, while for Yogi, it is too early to assess and he should be given time to perform.
 
 Naik admits that he shares cordial relations with former chief minister Akhilkesh Yadav, but he had been unsparing on him on several issues including his reluctance in dealing with cases of corruption.
 
 He said Aditya Nath Yogi had begun acting on Lokayukta’s recommendations on corruption cases in various departments and against individuals but these were not entertained in the previous SP government.
 
 In reply to a question on the continuing stand-off between the ruling BJP and the Opposition in the state Assembly during the budget session, Naik said that he was of the view Opposition should be given a chance to speak and express its views while the government should be allowed to deliver and function. “The stalemate in the UP Assembly should end and Opposition should join the session,” he said.
