HYDERABAD: Four members of a gang involved in illegally diverting international calls were arrested by the   on Wednesday. They were   under the name 'Grey Call Set Up' at Chaitanyapuri, Nagole, Uppal, Ibrahimpatnam and Puthlibowli. 

 Briefing the media here on Thursday, Rachakonda joint commissioner of police Tarun Joshi said Harsha Kumar, B Sridhar, Saibaba and B Chandrasekhar were arrested, while six others -- US national Jason; Rafi of Miyapur; Ram Das and Ganesh, both residents of BN Reddy Nagar; Kamal, a resident of Afzalgunj; and Mahaveer, a native of Rajasthan, but now based in Kuwait -- are absconding. 
 
 Officials said Harsha and Sridhar are the prime accused in the racket, while Saibaba, Rafi, Ramdas, Ganesh and Chandrasekhar used to supply SIM cards, which were used for call diversions. 
 
 "Harsha Kumar and Sreedhar had established voice over internet protocol (VOIP) gateways in different places of the city. Using global system for mobile (GSM) communication SIMs, which would help them bypass international long distance (ILD) gateways, they would divert international calls originating from other countries using illegal network for cheaper call rates. This was causing a huge loss to the government exchequer. It was also a serious threat to national security,'' Joshi said. 
 
 Police said Saibaba and others supplied SIM cards to Harsha and Sridhar using fake ID. Pavan and Mahaveer were acting as hawala agents for Harsha and Sridhar. In the past, Harsha was arrested in a similar case by the Kachiguda police in 2007. 
 
 Police seized 12 gateways (32 port capacity), two gateways (24 port capacity), 21 gateways (16 port capacity), 21 routers and other related equipment from the illegal units. 
 
 They were booked under the Indian Wireless Telegraph Act, Indian Telegraphic Act and Information Technology Act, 420 (cheating) and 120 B (conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
