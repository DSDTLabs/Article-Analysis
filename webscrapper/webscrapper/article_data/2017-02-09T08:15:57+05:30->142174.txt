JAIPUR:   has asked the police department to give   to the wife of a constable who was given compulsory retirement due to mental illness.

 The single bench order of the court followed a letter petition by the wife of the constable.
 
  in her petition said that her husband Bhanwar Lal was compulsorily retired by the department on June 30, 1981 as he was declared mentally unstable. She said he joined the service on February 2, 1970. In the order terminating his service had mentioned that the petitionerâ€™s husband would be paid pension and gratuity as per rules but no pension or gratuity was paid to her husband.
 
 The department said Bhanwar Lal remained in service for 10 years three months and nine days and out of the same, 446 days have been treated as extraordinary leave and therefore the total service was treated as nine years 17 days. As the service was less than 10 years, pension could not be paid.
 
 Amicus curie Hanuman Chaudhary argued that the absence of constable Bhanwarlal could not be said to be professional misconduct as he was suffering from mental problem. Besides, he argued that as per the provisions of Rajasthan Service Rule 1951 as they existed at the time of his compulsory retirement as chapter XX section III, the petitioner was entitled for grant of invalid pension under Rule 228. 
 
 After the government counsel accepted it as a mistake, the court asked the department to provide invalid pension as well as pension for the period of 10 years of service to the petitioner.
