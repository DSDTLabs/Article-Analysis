NEW DELHI: Amidst the ego tussle between the   足 comprising  ,   and   足 and the newly-appointed Team India head coach   over the choice of the support staff, it has emerged that   is likely to get a 150-day contract as the team's bowling consultant. The   (CoA) had put the contract drafts for the three new appointees 足 Shastri,   and Zaheer Khan 足 on hold and will discuss the contracts at a meeting here on Saturday.

 A day after the CAC expressed hurt at allegations that the trio had foisted Zaheer and Dravid upon the team, TOI understands CAC and COA have reached an understanding over offering Zaheer a contract.
 
 "It is more likely that Zaheer will be offered a 150-day contract which is likely to start from the tour of Sri Lanka starting next week. That will take out the compensation for the loss of IPL job out of the equation," a senior   official told TOI on Friday.
 
 Speaking to reporters in Kolkata on Friday, Ganguly claimed that Zaheer was contracted to work 150 days a year.
