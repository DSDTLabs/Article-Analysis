  UK is one of the top most outbound markets for Indian travelers and the sharp fall of the pound from around Rs 99.47 on June 23 to around Rs 83 on Friday this week is expected to heighten traveler interest further.
  
    managing director at   said it is not just the weak sterling but weaker air fares too which offer a far better value for the coming summer than the previous year. “You can quite easily get a London fare around 30,000.   and other one stop carriers are running promotions.

The rankings were based on the popularity of shopping activities on TripAdvisor in key European cities. “We usually see user interest peak for destinations when currencies depreciate. Besides airfares, hotels too present more lucrative options,” said Nikhil Ganju, country manager,  .
  
  Yatra has also seen airfares to the UK come down dramatically over the past year. Fares from Delhi to London and Mumbai to London dropped to Rs 38,183 and Rs 41,987 respectively this month on the portal compared to Rs 48,548 and Rs 49,405 in January last year.
