 

  It was around 8.30pm on April 9, when I was returning home from my office at  . We were on Maa flyover. As I looked out of the window, I suddenly saw the cab veer towards the fylover side rail. Initially, I thought the driver was trying to overtake but there was no other vehicle around. I checked in the rear view mirror and found the driver's eyes shut. He had dozed off. I realized, we were about to crash into the side rail. I jumped up, climbed over the driver's shoulder and steered the vehicle away, screaming and waking the driver up. He immediately slammed on the brake, bringing the car to a halt. It all happened in a matter of a few seconds. 
 
 As I yelled at the driver, he apologized and admitted to have dozed off. "Madam AC cholchilo, tai thandaye ektu chokh lege gechilo (Madam, the AC was on and in the comfort, I had dozed off)," was his reply as he kept driving. For the next 20 minutes of the journey I couldn't keep my eyes off the rear view mirror to ensure he was not falling asleep a gain. Once I was home, I sent a complaint to the company against the driver. The next day, the company apologised on the driver's behalf and said he had been at the wheel for over 17 hours without a break.
