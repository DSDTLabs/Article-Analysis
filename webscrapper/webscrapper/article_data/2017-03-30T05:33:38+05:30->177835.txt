ASANASOL: A youth jumped 170ft into an abandoned coal pit   to rescue a   on Wednesday. The woman was lucky to be discharged from hospital after  . The saviour, Bahadur Kure, had no formal training in disaster relief. 

 The woman attempted suicide after an alleged quarrel with her husband. Around 7.05am, locals spotted two men running after a woman who suddenly jumped into pit No.6 of Jamuria colliery. Owned by Eastern Coalfields Limited (ECL), the pit has been emptied of coal and, hence, abandoned. Located near the Azad sporting ground here, the 170ft pit resembled a well with water till its halfway mark.
 
 By the time people realised what was happening, the woman had jumped into the pit. They saw she was holding on to a tree branch, looking upward with only her neck and head above the water in the pit.
 
  The Jamuria police were then informed. 
 
 Before cops reached the spot, local youths fetched ropes to rescue the woman. But the ropes weren't long enough. Bahadur, however, wouldn't give up. He tied the rope around his waist and jumped into the pit. By then, some of Bahadur's friends had brought a bamboo ladder which they lowered into the pit. Bahadur lifted the woman from the water and helped her climb the ladder. The other youths helped the woman get out of the pit.
