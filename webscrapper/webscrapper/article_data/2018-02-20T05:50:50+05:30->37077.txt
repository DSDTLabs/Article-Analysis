MUMBAI: The RTO officials conducted surprise checks on more than 2,000 autos during the last three days, specially in Kurla,  , Bhandup and   where complaints of   rigging were maximum in the past few years, sources said on Monday.

 This comes in the wake of a meter rigging case at Jogeshwari last week in which the   police has booked the driver for cheating. The RTO teams are keeping close watch on autos at stations, malls, markets and commercial hubs and the surprise checks will continue, officials said. TOI has learnt that 11 meter manufacturers from across   will now be summoned by transport department. Sources said that the department on Monday drafted a showcause notice, which will be served to the manufacturer whose meter was found rigged in Jogeshwari incident. The notice is likely to be issued by the transport commissioner’s office on Tuesday, an official said.
 
 
  
 “We are seeking a reply from the manufacturer who has to explain why the meter was not tamperproof. We will also call for a meeting of all manufacturers soon,”' a transport official, who requested anonymity, said.
 
 The department is also looking at replacing all meters with GPS gadgets, which will be able to calculate GPS-enabled distance, waiting time for an accurate fare for the journey. As for existing e-meters, the department wants that the device should hang or show an ‘error’ message if there is any attempt to tamper.
