KOCHI: With the new surrogacy law likely to be introduced in March, the   are worried that it may affect even the genuine patients and expose their identity.
“As per new surrogacy rules that will be introduced soon, only close relatives can surrogate for eligible couples. So one doesn't know how we will be able to maintain secrecy,“ said   A, MD, Kinder Women's Hospital & Fertility Centre.
 
 The Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2016 allows surrogacy for couples who have been legally wedded for a period of 5 years, where both of them are Indian citizens and at least one of them has been diagnozed with fertilityrelated problems.
 
 There is a complete ban on commercial surrogacy and close relatives of the couple, not necessarily related by blood, can act as a surrogate for eligible couples.Also there is ban on unmarried couples, live-in couples, and bisexuals and foreigners; they will not be accepted for altruistic surrogacy.
 
 With the law about to become a reality, inquiries regarding sur rogacy have also grown.
 
 “Inquiries for surrogacy have increased as people think that this might be their last chance.But, the number of locals who come for surrogacy is very few here. We see a maximum 7 to 8 cases at our centre. Everybody has this thing of trying to have their own child. Even patients whose uterus is completely damaged would like to have the baby in their own uterus. In Kerala, maternal instincts are much higher,“ said Dr  , scientific director,  .
