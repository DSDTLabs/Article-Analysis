LUCKNOW: The triangular contest between the SP, BSP and the BJP seems to be the reason for the high   in UP   polls this time.

 After a gap of 14 years, the BJP has made inroads into the political arena, hitherto dominated by the SP and the BSP. The 2017 polls recorded highest-ever voting percentage of 61% in UP. This is almost 1.6% more than the 2012 assembly   when the SP came to power with absolute majority. In the 2007 elections, the BSP came to power with absolute majority when only 46% polling was recorded.
 
 In 2007 and 2012, the anti-incumbency factor had played a key role in government formation. “On the past two occasions, people voted to defeat the ruling dispensation. There were only two options. This time, people voted to ensure win of a party. This has resulted in high voting percentage,” says JP Shukla, a political commentator.
 
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP managed to get nearly 42% vote share and won 324 assembly segments. Experts say the BJP is banking on consolidation of upper caste and non-Yadav OBC vote banks which together account for nearly 50% of the population.
 
 Similarly, the SP has played up its development agenda, trying to dissuade the anti-incumbency factor. Though hit by a prolonged bitter family feud last year, the SP relied on the consolidation of voters cutting across caste lines. In 2012, the SP won 220 seats with 29.1% vote share, a significant improvement as compared to 2007 polls when it had got 97 seats with 25.4% vote share. This time, it entered into an alliance with the Congress which won 22 and 28 seats with 8.6% and 11.6% vote share in 2007 and 2012 assembly elections, respectively.
 
 BSP chief Mayawati made an aggressive Muslim outreach in addition to her traditional core Dalit vote bank. Not just an anti-BJP move, Mayawati also worked on caste arithmetic in each assembly seat. Muslims traditionally vote en-bloc and might have contributed significantly to the higher turnout.
