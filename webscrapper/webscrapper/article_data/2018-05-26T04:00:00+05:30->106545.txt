Chennai: Sundaram Finance registered a 15.6% rise in net profit at Rs 532.9 crore in the year ended March 2018 (after considering the effects of demerger of the non-financial services investments into Sundaram Finance Holdings Ltd) as compared to Rs 460.6 crore last year. The quarter registered net profit of Rs 131crore as compared to Rs 139 crore for the corresponding quarter last fiscal.

Gross and Net NPAs reduced further to 1.3% and 0.50%, respectively, as against 1.5% and 0.5% respectively, in the previous year. Commenting on the performance, TT Srinivasaraghavan, MD, Sundaram Finance Ltd., said, “Notwithstanding the various disruptions faced by the automotive sector in the first half of the financial year, we were able to achieve a strong growth in disbursements of 18% as we deepened our presence in newer geographical areas and market segments, apart from growth in our core segments. As always, the focus has been on Growth, Quality and Profitability (GQP).”

This along with the interim dividend of Rs 5 per share declared earlier in the year takes the total dividend of the year to Rs 12 per share.
