NEW DELHI: Call it the   magic, Delhi will soon be linked directly to   in Israel.   is planning to start thrice-weekly nonstops between these cities by mid-March. So far, the only direct link between the two countries is by Israeli carrier El Al which operates on Mumbai-Tel Aviv route.

 "We are awaiting confirmation of slots from Delhi and Tel Aviv airports and are finalising our crew for this flight. The three days of operations will be Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday. As soon as the airports confirm the slots to us, we will finalise the flight in a day or two," said a senior AI official.
 The soon-to-be-privatised AI was earlier planning to fly between Mumbai and Tel Aviv, but finally chose the Delhi-Israel route. 
 
 Israel is not recognised by a majority of the Islamic and Gulf countries that lie between it and India. So El Al's flights between Mumbai and Tel Aviv flights do not overfly some countries on the direct flight path like Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
 
 The El Al flight taking off from Tel Aviv for Mumbai has to go to the southern tip of the country, fly over Red Sea, completely avoiding Saudi Arabia and then turn east from the "horn of Africa" that juts into the Arabian Sea straight to its destination. As a result, the distance of 4,057 km between Mumbai and Tel Aviv is covered in eight hours – almost the time taken to fly the 6,700-km-apart Delhi and London — instead of the about five hours it would take on the straight route. 
 
 It remains to be seen if Saudi Arabia allows AI flights to and from Tel Aviv to fly over its airspace. Prime Minister Modi also took the longer route when he flew to Israel last year.
 
 AI many years ago used to operate the Airbus A-310 to Israel but had discontinued the route which could now restart later this year.
