RANCHI:The new-look   in Ranchi’s Morhabadi area witnessed a grand re-opening in March this year by chief minister Raghubar Das. Ever since, the park has been drawing scores of visitors every day. And the reason for this   is a unique foot massage by fish. 

 The 10-acre lush stretch, which was rebuilt at a cost of Rs 4 crore by the forest department, houses a   centre. The 150-square meter pond sees a rush of visitors everyday wanting to avail of the spa. They can all be seen dipping their feet in the water while the fish nibble at their feet. 
 
 Kunal Dwivedi, a college student, is a regular at the pond. “I finish my jogging and come here. When they nibble at my feet I get a nice sensation that helps me relax,” said Dwivedi. 
 
 Rekha Sharma, another regular, says the spa has helped to treat her cracked heels. “They nibble away the dead skin,” said the housewife from Morhabadi.
 
 Though professional fish pedicure centres use doctor fish, Ranchi DFO   could not figure out what fish had been released into the pond. Doctor fish is commonly used for Garra Ruffa species and are natives of West Asian waters. “We are also sending a proposal for releasing the same species in another pond in the park,” said Bakshi. The park has two ponds of 150 square meters and 300 square meters each. 
 
 But skin specialists expressed concern at the beauty treatment. “It is important to replace the water at regular intervals in case of fish therapy, or else there could be chances of contamination,” said skin specialist A Lal.
