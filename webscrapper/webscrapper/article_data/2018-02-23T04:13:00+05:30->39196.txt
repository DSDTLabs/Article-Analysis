Vadodara: Congress leaders in the city have threatened to aggressively protest against a play on Nathuram Godse that will be staged at Sir Sayajirao Nagar Gruh on Sunday. 

 The party has alleged that show ‘Hey Ram Nathuram’ glorifies Godse who had assassinated Mahatma Gandhi. 
 
 The play organizers, however, slammed the Congress for trying to suppress their freedom of expression. 
 
 “The play on Godse will disturb the peaceful atmosphere in the city. It is an attempt to glorify the killer of Mahatma Gandhi. It is also an attempt to tarnish the image of Gandhi,” said Prashant Patel, city Congress president. The party has written to the police commissioner and municipal commissioner demanding that the play should be cancelled. 
 
 Chandrakant Srivastava, opposition leader in Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), said that if such plays are allowed to be staged then someone may stage plays on other terrorists or anti-national people. “We will protest peacefully but if the permission for this play is not cancelled, our agitation will be intensified,” he said
 
 Vikram Manekar, who has organized the play after taking police permission, said that the Congress is deliberately politicizing the issue. “This play is about views of both Gandhi and Godse. It, in no way, glorifies Godse. In fact, the play ends with Godse being hanged. Congress is resorting to political stunts and trying muzzle our freedom of expression. This play has been staged 1,000 times in Maharashtra without any issues.” 
 
 He added that the show is houseful and they have sought police protection on the day of the play.
