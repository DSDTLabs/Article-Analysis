In London, one of the most polluted cities in the world, 1 in 12 deaths are linked to dirty air.   in Delhi shortens the life expectancy of its residents by 6.3 years. According to the WHO, 3 million people die of pollution every year even as only 1 in 10 individuals globally lives in a city that complies with  's air quality guidelines. As the problem cries out for urgent remedy, a   report listed some innovative solutions.
 
  
  
 
  Seven-metre high structure built by Dutch inventor   with support from China's environment ministry opened in a Beijing park last September. It's a giant outdoor air purifier.
  
  
 
  - The way static electricity makes loose hairs stick to a comb, airborne particles are sucked into the tower where they get a positive charge.
  - The particles are captured by a negatively charged dust-removal plate and clean air blown out of the other end.
  - It captures more than 75% of particulate matter in an area the size of a football field.
  - Runs on 1,400 Watts, that is, less electricity than a desk-top air purifier.
  - Waste collected can be used as building material and to make smog-free jewellery.
  
  
  
 
  Also a Dring project, it involves the creation of building material out of a charcoal-like substance obtained by burning agricultural crop by-products or tree clippings in a pyrolysis kiln (in a process that induces decomposition through high temperatures).
  
  
 
  - Simply put, you take carbon out of the sky, convert it into a material, and then use it to build.
  - Trees too take carbon out of the air and trap it as wood.
  - Biochar is a mouldable, plastic type material that you can shape - which you can't really do with wood making it the perfect material for architectural design.
  - Dring's new building material, called Made of Air, will make its first appearance as industrial factory cladding in Berlin this year.
  
  
  
 
  They took to the sky from a north London hill last March wearing backpacks that monitored air pollution.
  
  
 
  - They sent live air-quality updates via tweets to Londoners' smartphones. Sadly, in most cases, the readings were not good.
  
  
  
 
  Tried out by Berlin-based architect Allison Dring in Mexico City in the early 2000s.
  
  
 
  - The idea is to tackle nitrogen dioxide from vehicle exhausts.
  - It uses the ultraviolet rays from sunlight to convert NO2 into nitric acid.
  - The nitric acid is neutralised into a harmless salt and washed away by the rain
  - Dring created a coral-like design to catch light and wind from all sides. Her project covered 2,500 square metres of a hospital in Mexico City, cutting pollution in the street below by the equivalent of approximately 1,000 cars per day.
