NEW DELHI: A court can’t replace opinion of the employer on an employee’s performance, the   has said. It said the final call whether a   are satisfactory or not lies with the employer, and upheld the termination of services of a teacher by a private school in the national capital.

 “This court cannot substitute its view for that of the employer with respect to satisfactory services or otherwise of employee with the employer,” the court observed while hearing a plea where the school had fired a teacher in March 2014 after keeping him on probation for nearly three years.
 
 The school cited “unsatisfactory work” as the chief reason behind the termination. The teacher had challenged the decision in the  , which on December 10, 2015 ruled in his favour by ordering his reinstatement, prompting the school to approach HC.
 
 Justice Valmiki Mehta said since the man did not complete three years of service in the school, he would not be entitled to be confirmed as an employee and won’t have rights of permanent employees. 
 
 The court also noted that the teacher was sent several memos regarding deficiency in his work, which showed that the school was not satisfied with his services.
