Navi Mumbai: The residents and local activists of   and   have organized a seminar on water preservation and   on March 26 at Youth Centre, sector 7. The seminar is an effort by the locals to ensure enough water during the scorching summer months. 

 “Last year, we had to bear with frequent water cuts as a result of shortage and colossal wastage. This year, we want all the citizens to wake up and start saving water in every possible way, including rainwater harvesting,” said Kharghar-based activist Ravi Srivastava.
 
 He added that only five to six housing complexes in Kharghar have set up systems for rainwater harvesting and there is an urgent need for others to start this practice.
 
 A   official said that the daily requirement for Kharghar is 72 MLD (million litres per day) but due to frequent repairs of the water supply system from Hetawane dam, the residents have to face cuts.
 
 Srivastava added that as per civic development control regulations (DCR), all new building proposals (since 2007) must show rainwater harvesting in their plans. “However, many builders merely show it on paper to get their building plans approved but do not actually set it up. Municipal bodies should physically inspect various new building projects,” he added.
 
 Jaspal Naol, Ulwe-based activist, said that sectors 19, 20 and 21 in Ulwe already have around 40 newly constructed buildings. “As more and more people start moving here, demand for water is going to increase, therefore, it makes sense to practice rainwater harvesting in monsoon,” he added.
 
 As per the market cost estimates, it take approximately Rs 4-8 lakh to set up a rainwater harvesting system in a housing complex, depending on the size and number of buildings.
