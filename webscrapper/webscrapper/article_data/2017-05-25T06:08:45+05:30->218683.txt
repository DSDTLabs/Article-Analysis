NEW DELHI:   minister   said on Wednesday that the Centre would like to swiftly roll out the new   (SP) policy, under which selected Indian private sector companies will partner with global armament companies to jointly manufacture fighter jets, helicopters, submarines and armoured vehicles like tanks under the “Make in India” framework. 

 After the Cabinet meeting, which “took note” of the new policy, Jaitley said there was a need to involve Indian private sector in defence production in a major way since India continued to import “a lot” of its military requirements.
 
 The “broad contours” of the SP policy, which has been under discussion for the last two years as a major step towards reducing India’s strategically vulnerable dependence on military supplies from abroad, were cleared by the Jaitley-led defence acquisitions council on Saturday, as reported by TOI. 
 
 Jaitley said on Wednesday the country’s defence preparedness necessitated that weapon systems were largely procured and manufactured indigenously. 
 
 Holding that “one private sector SP will be chosen for each platform”, he said tie-ups between private companies and foreign OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) would co-exist with the existing “capacity” of the defence PSUs. 
 
 Under the policy, one company will be selected as the strategic partner at a time in each of the four segments in “a   and competitive process”. 
 
 The defence ministry will select the companies on the basis of adequate financial strength (Rs 4,000 crore in annual turnover over the last three fiscals, capital assets of Rs 2,000 crore etc), demonstrable manufacturing and technical expertise, existing infrastructure and the ability to absorb technology from their foreign partners. The foreign OEMs will be selected on the basis of the “range, depth and scope” of the transfer of technology, indigenous content, eco-system development, supplier base and future R&D, among other things.
