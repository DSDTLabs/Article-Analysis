LUDHIANA: Acting on the complaint of an RTI activist, civic officials on Friday served a notice to a private restaurant  , to produce documents related to permission to construct the building housing the restaurant. The MC officials have admitted they did not give permission to the restaurant for the construction of the structure on the lines of an aeroplane and hence the restaurant authorities have been given three to produce the documents if they have any. 

 RTI activist   had brought the matter to the notice of the authorities enquiring if the restaurant constructed in the shape of an aeroplane had the approval of the MC. The MC officials denying giving any permission, have now issued a notice to the restaurant management for submitting the documents of approval. 
 
 Sources revealed as per rules there are only three authorities which can permit such a project including MC, Ludhiana Improvement Trust and Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority but this restaurant comes under the jurisdiction of MC. However the land belongs to the Punjab Agricultural University adjoining  . So, the officials claimed the restaurant might have obtained the approval from PAU or the irrigation department. 
 
 Assistant town planner   however said they have given three daysâ€™ time to the restaurant authorities to produce the documents and in case the management does not approach the department within the stipulated time, they will be taking suitable action in this case.
