GURUGRAM: Parts of old Gurugram will have to brace for eight hours of power outage on Sunday on the heels of a new feeder installation, said   (DHBVN) officials. Officials said that both residential and industrial areas will be affected by the power outage from 9am to 5pm.

 Officials said that installation of the new feeder would mitigate power woes by augmenting existing infrastructure and enhancing the capacity of the power distribution system.
 
 “It is intimated that 11KV HSIDC-I, HSIDC-II, HSIDC-III, Anjna Dhani, Pace City-II, Electroplating Zone, JBM, Cyber Park, Sector-37-I, Sector-37-II,   village, phase-VI, D-block feeders, emanating from 66 KV substation in Sector 10A, and BNC-I and BNC-II feeders, emanating from 66KV substation in Sector 9, will remain switched off on 04.02.2018 from 09:00am to 05:00pm due to erection of new feeder,” the official communication read. 
 
 This comes close on the heels of a string of blackouts in the city in the past few months for “preventive maintenance” work. 
 
 According to officials, the “pre-emptive” maintenance programme would avoid recurring blackouts during the upcoming summer season. Last week, DHBVN announced that it was revising the deadline of “preventive maintenance” from February 28 to March 31.
 
 Residents are miffed that the discom is taking the liberty to enforce shutdowns at its free will, without informing them. The discom, however, has denied such allegations, saying they have been issuing public notifications in advance, apart from uploading timings of scheduled power cuts on the ministry of power-supported Urja Mitra app.
