SHAHJAHANPUR: Enraged over SP chief Mulayam Singh’s move to expel the UP CM, a group of   supporters climbed atop a water tank in Lakhimpur city, 88 km from here. However, the workers soon called off their protest after Akhilesh’s expulsion was revoked on Saturday.

But when their protest went unnoticed, a group of party workers climbed atop a water tank situated near the Bhawan. The police tried to pacify the protesters. However, their efforts went in vain.
  
  Later, senior party leader Ashok Verma reached the spot and informed the agitators about Yadav’s reinduction, following which the workers withdrew their protest. They were let off with a warning by the police.
