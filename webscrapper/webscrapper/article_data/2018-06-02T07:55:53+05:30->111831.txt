LUCKNOW: Vibhutikhand police arrested four drunk youths near   on Friday, recovered   and cash from them and found that they were engineering graduates. 

 A police team on night patrolling arrested Durgesh Pratap Singh Chauhan, Dikshant Singh, Akash Singh and Rishabh Singh, all residents of Lucknow, in the wee hours of Friday and recovered two country-made pistols, Rs 20,000 in cash and four mobile handsets from them. 
 
 Vibhutikhand SHO Brajesh Rai said that all the four accused were found drunk. During questioning they revealed that they started selling arms and indulged in betting after failing to get jobs.
 
 Durgesh and Dikshant were found fixing deals for country-made pistols on phones while Akash and Rishabh were counting money they had earned through betting on IPL matches. 
 
 "We asked them to show licences of the pistols. They could not show the documents and were unable to give clear answers, hence were rounded up," said Rai.
 
 Later, Durgesh confessed that he and his mates had done BTech from a city-based engineering college in 2015. They went to New Delhi, Mumbai and other cities in search of jobs but got no success.
 
 "I came in contact with Abdul in New Delhi in 2016. He lured me into arms trading," Durgesh told police. He further revealed he was given country-made pistols from Munger by Abdul and his associates.
