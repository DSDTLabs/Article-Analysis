Do you eat healthy on weekdays, and then abandon the diet for a weekend binge? You’re not alone. A study that analysed 43 million food records of 1 million urban Indians has found that their Sunday meals are the most calorierich and fat-heavy, with the average kilo calories consumed by a person going up to 1,164. This number is at 1,099 on Monday, and rises through the week.

 According to self-reported data from 2 lakh locations mined by  , a weight-loss app, fats contribute 28.5% of the energy contribution on Mondays. On Wednesday, this rises to 28.8%, and to 29.9% on Sundays.
 
 The survey also found the lowest intake of fibre and the highest intake of sugar on Sundays. Of the four metros, Delhi consumes the most fat and Chennai the most carbs.
 
 Studies have shown that yo-yo eating is bad for health. An experiment by the   last year showed that a diet alternating between junk and healthy food made rats almost 20% heavier at the end of the 16-week study period, compared to the groups fed either healthy or junk food.
 
 Ritika Samaddar, dietitian and  , Max Healthcare, Delhi, points out that urban Indians like to sit and eat with their families on Sunday and treat food like a celebration. “You are allowed to have cheat meals, which include foods you like and don’t get to eat during the rest of the week.
 
 But cheat meals should also be consumed in controlled portions,” she adds.
