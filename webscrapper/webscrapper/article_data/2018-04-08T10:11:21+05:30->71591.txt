LUCKNOW: Countering the opposition’s smear campaign and refuting allegations of being anti-Dalit, the Yogi government on Saturday claimed that it has done more for Dalits and backward classes than any other previous government and released data to back its credentials.

 A week after claiming that more Dalit officers had been appointed on key posts in the present regime than during previous SP government, officials said that since it came to power in 2017, the BJP government had ensured that benefits of official schemes increasingly went to Dalits.
 
 “Out of the 8.85 lakh houses built under the  , 6.50 lakh have been given to Dalits. Besides, 37 lakh Dalits have been issued ration cards for the first time. While the previous government got no work done in most backward classes-dominated 1,556 villages, the BJP government has ensured that all amenities reached there. Under the  , 32 lakh power connections have been given to Dalits,” said an official. Data shared by the government further shows that out of 40 lakh toilets built, 36 lakh have been for Dalits.
 
 “The government’s loan waiver scheme has also benefited Dalits the most. BSP is worried that these people, who have benefited from various government schemes, will shift their allegiance to BJP, along with their families,” the official said.
 
 Earlier, Prime Minister   had claimed that no government has done more for Dalits that BJP while UP government said that 25 district magistrates and seven divisional commissioners are from SC or OBC categories, making up 33% and 39% of the total posts, respectively. Similarly, 25 top police officers are from Dalit community, said an official. Responding to the claims, BSP leaders asked why false cases are being filed against Dalits over April 2 protests and BR Ambedkar’s statues are being vandalised.
