 Jaipur: The month-long   on-the-pot fitment camp of Bhagwan Mahaveer Viklang Sahayata Samity (BMVSS) started in Myanmar. The camp will rehabilitate 300 handicapped persons with artificial limbs that would enable them to walk. 
 
 The camp has been organized jointly by the Indian embassy, Nu Daw Mya Yi Foundation and BMVSS.
 
 Indian ambassador Vikram Misri said that Indian government has supported the artificial limb fitment camp to rehabilitate the differently abled. He said 10 member team of BMVSS would provide the differently abled with one of the most dependable artificial limb Jaipur Foot which has its presence in 29 countries and has over 1.6 million beneficiaries. 
 
 Misri said it would be the endeavour of Indian government to hold such a camp every year. On first day, 12 differently abled persons, two of them above 80 years and a former army officer (73) walked comfortably with Jaipur Foot. Two youths who were provided with Jaipur Foot jumped, squatted before the large assembly of guests to show the manoeuvrability of the Jaipur Foot.
