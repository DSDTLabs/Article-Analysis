BENGALURU: Criticising the BJP has proven expensive for award-winning actor  . He said the Hindi film industry has stopped offering him roles after he started questioning Prime Minister  .

 “I’m being targeted after I raised my voice and started asking questions.   has virtually stopped offering me jobs. There’s no problem with southern film industries,” said Rai on the sidelines of the ‘Karnataka Now’ conclave organised by Times Now and Vijay Karnataka.
 
 Rai, who has acted in over ten Hindi films, is unfazed by the development as he still gets offers from southern films, including Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and Kannada. “They are not strong enough to make me poor. I have enough money and strength to earn further. They cannot stop me,” he said.
 
 Earlier, he said that ads featuring him were reduced after he started speaking about Hindutva forces getting emboldened by the ruling BJP at the Centre and they were out to silence dissent. His friction with the BJP intensified especially after he became vocal in seeking justice for his long-term friend and activist-journalist Gauri Lankesh, who was gunned down outside her residence in September last year.
