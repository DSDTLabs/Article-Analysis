JAIPUR: The   administration seems to be now trying to cover up the two infant deaths at the   of hospital that happened in the wee hours of Tuesday calling it a ‘coincidence’ which took place after the power went off for two hours in the post natal care ward of the hospital. 

 The power went off at the hospital for about two hours early morning on Tuesday past mid night from 12.40 am. Two children admitted in the nursery died due to ventilator failure. 
 
 The hospital constituted a three-member committee to look in to the incident and submitted its report to the district collector Jitendra Kumar Soni. However, the district collector said the report is not complete. “The report lacks some documents. After getting the full report it will be submitted to the principal secretary, medical and health,” said Soni.
 
 Superintendent of the hospital Dr Rajan Nanda said both the children who had died during this period were every critical and died of natural causes. He said one child was suffering from multi-organ failure while the other one was suffering from septicemia. But everybody knows only critical children were put on ventilator.
 
 He, however, denied reports that battery failure of the ventilator had led to the deaths. He claimed that the battery backup of the ventilator is for half an hour. The power went off for about two hours and the battery got discharged. However, the generator failed to start functioning during this period, he said to TOI over phone.
 
 But he could not give any reasons why the generator could not start functioning for two long hours.
