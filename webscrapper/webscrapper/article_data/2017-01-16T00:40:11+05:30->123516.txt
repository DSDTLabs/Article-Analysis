Coimbatore/Erode: After Ettimidai on Friday, a rekla event was conducted in Annur on Saturday with bullock carts racing towards the finishing line as dozens of villagers cheered them all along. Police, however, said it was not a race and that the bullock carts were just brought to the temple and taken back home. The villagers declared three winners and even distributed prizes. The event, usually held in several villages during Pongal, was withheld for the last few years due to the SC ban.
