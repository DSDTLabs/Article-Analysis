KOLKATA: It's been 138 years since this warrior of the country's first war of independence died in Kathmandu. And finally, the Centre has decided to honour her for her contribution during the Sepoy Mutiny. 

 A 26-minute documentary - produced by the Films Division, ministry of information and broadcasting, on the life of Begum Hazrat Mahal - is being taken to Kathmandu for screening by the Centre on April 7, her death anniversary. Begum's family, which shuttles between Lucknow and Kolkata, has been invited for this memorial service.
 
 One of the younger queens of Wajid Ali Shah, Hazrat Mahal ruled Oudh putting her minor son   on the throne when Wajid Ali Shah had reached Kolkata en route to London to meet Queen Victoria. But he was intercepted by the British and allotted a space to stay in Metiabruz.
 
 "All our lives we were sad that Begum Hazrat Mahal was not celebrated enough. But when we heard from filmmaker   that he has been asked by the Films Division to make a documentary on the queen, we were thrilled," said Manzilat Fatima, the great great grand daughter of Birjis Qadr.
