UDHAGAMANDALAM: The   spotted in the   by a   recently was not a   and it could be suffering from leucism, a genetic condition similar to albinism, said field director of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve Srinivas R Reddy.

 “We have to find out whether there could be any genetic implication. So we have to observe the big cat,” the official told TOI.
 
 White tigers cannot survive in the wild, Reddy said. “That is why they are sent to zoos. Generally, the skin of a tiger has three colours - yellow, white and black stripes. Each tiger’s expression of colours varies. While some have dark yellow, others have dark black stripes. It is just like pigmentation in human beings. More white pigments near the neck and the pale colour might be due to leucism,” he explained.
 
 The pale big cat, a sub-adult, was found with another tiger, said Nilanjan Ray, a wildlife photographer from Bangalore, who spotted it a week ago in the Nilgiris forest. “The image I captured of the pale tiger was sent to experts as well as to Sanctuary Asia. According to them, the tiger is pale and unique,” Nilanjan told TOI. “Experts also said a pale tiger was not spotted in the past 50 years anywhere in the country,” he added.
 
 According to Reddy, the image of the tiger looked pale may be due to lighting. “We are planning to install a few cameras at that place to capture more images of the tiger. Also, we are going to observe the big cat to find out genetical implications, if any,” the official said.
