NEW DELHI: The   Executive Council’s decision to   the Gender Sensitisation Committee Against   ( ) with a UGC-ordained Internal Complaints Committee has many criticising the decision.Others believe it is a step in the right direction.

 To get a better perspective, TOI spoke to Vidhu Verma, member of the first GSCASH and its former chairperson, and Vibha Tandon, JNU’s former chief proctor who has been appointed as chairperson of the newly formed ICC.
 
 Vidhu Verma, who was also GSCASH chairperson in 2005, said “GSCASH made JNU a zero tolerance campus when it came to cases of sexual harassment”.
 
 She said it was the Supreme Court’s August 13, 1997 judgment on the writ petition (criminal) Vishaka vs State of Rajasthan which gave the guidelines on the prevention and deterrence of sexual harassment at the workplace; it was adopted by JNU and a working group was set up. “The JNU policy which came out of this group’s report was not just about sensitisation of victims but also about inquiry and redressal.”
 
 However, Vibha Tandon, the new ICC chairperson, says the new committee is an evolution. “Hundreds of universities will be adopting the UGC’s ICC, surely there must have been a lot of thought that went into its formation,” Tandon said, adding it was an old institution “that underwent several experiments and had established itself, especially in institutes like DU and HCU. A number of academic institutions have contributed to the development of this body. It definitely is a good decision by the government,” she said.
