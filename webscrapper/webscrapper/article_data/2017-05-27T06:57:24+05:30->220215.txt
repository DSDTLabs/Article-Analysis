GANDHINAGAR: After choosing to allow   (ULC) Act land that has been occupied for housing to be regularized, Gujarat chief minister   has now allowed the payment for regularization or the impact fee, to be paid in  .

 The occupant will have to pay the first installment within a month of receiving the notice. Rupani has decided to increase the time-limit for the full payment from one month to two months, to make it easier for the occupants to pay and giving them another opportunity to regularize their land or residential property. Till now, more than 25,000 families have registered under the scheme. The process to hand over the charter to such families is under way.
