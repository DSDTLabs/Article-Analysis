MUMBAI: The consumption of country liquor, beer, wine and Indian-made foreign liquor ( ) has gone down in all parts of the state except Mumbai and Thane, though revenue from excise duty has exceeded the target for 2017-18. This seeming paradox is because the excise department tightened its entire bureaucratic machinery at all levels, halting illegal sale of liquor from neighbouring states, said a senior bureaucrat.

 
 
  
 
 Also, there was a minor increase in duty on country liquor and liquor supplied to stores for defence personnel. Across the state, the consumption of IMFL has reduced by 6.8%, beer by 15%, wine by 3.3% and country liquor by 4%—as per data compiled by the excise department. But in  , the consumption of IMFL increased by 1.3%, wine by 5.5% and country liquor by 4.9%, though the consumption of beer decreased by 2.6%. In Mumbai suburban, the consumption of all increased by 2.8%, 1%, 5.5% and 9.7%.
 
 “We ensured that trading in illicit liquor came to a grinding halt, particularly from outside  . So, we mobilised a greater number of excise duty personnel despite the fact that a large number of shops on the national highways were closed following a   order,” the bureaucrat said.
 
 Alarmed by a sudden spurt in fatal accidents on national highways, the apex court had asked all state governments to close liquor shops on such roads. As a result, in Maharashtra, out of 25,000 liquor shops, nearly 15,000 were closed. But following a clarification, 10,000 were reopened.
 
 For the financial year 2017-18, the excise department had set a target of Rs 12,500 crore, while it realised Rs 13,448 crore—almost Rs 950 crore more. The highest revenue from a circle, Rs 3,686 crore, was garnered from Aurangabad, followed by Rs 1,905 crore from  , Rs 1,674 crore from Pune, Rs 1,254 crore from Ahmadnagar, Rs 990 crore from Palghar, Rs 660 from Nagpur and Rs 663 from Raigad. From Mumbai City, Rs 123 crore was realized. The figure was Rs 377 crore from Mumbai suburban and Rs 201 crore from Thane city.
 
 The targets for Mumbai city, Mumbai suburban and Thane city were Rs 113 crore, Rs 306 crore and Rs 190 crore. “For 2018-19, we have set a target of Rs 15,343 crore. It should not be difficult to achieve this,” the bureaucrat said.
