Trichy: Alleging rampant corruption in the appointments of drivers and conductors in the state transport corporation, CPM state secretary G Ramakrishnan criticised the Tamil Nadu government for not disbursing benefits due to them despite receiving bribes for their appointment, here on Monday.

 “It is very particular in receiving Rs4 lakh from each candidate as bribe for appointing them as drivers, conductors and technicians. Likewise, it should be prompt in providing them benefits which are meant for them,” Ramakrishnan told reporters on Monday. 
 
 To a query that the government was roping in drivers on daily wages for operating TNSTC buses, he said the move would lead to unfavourable consequences such as accidents. “The CPM condemns outsourcing of drivers and conductors for operating the buses. The state government should not do such things. It may cause accidents due to inexperience of the drivers,” said Ramakrishnan while stating that the strike by TNSTC employees was the outcome of the inability of the state government to handle the issue. 
 
 Stating that the central government was attempting to stop the distribution of sugar and kerosene through public distribution system (PDS) , Ramakrishnan said that the step to eliminate the two commodities was an effort to eradicate PDS. 
 
 CPM criticised both the central and state governments for failing to release drought relief funds for Tamil Nadu which has witnessed the death of around 400 farmers due to frustration over crop failure.
 
 CPM also demanded the hike of wages to Rs400 in the Mahatma Gandhi national rural employment guarantee scheme(MGNREGS).
