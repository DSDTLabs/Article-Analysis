AGRA: Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar   Teachers’ Association has sent a 10-point complain letter to Prime Minister   against mismanagement by vice-chancellor Arvind Kumar Dixit. The association has also sent a detailed complaint letter against the VC to governor  , who is the university chancellor.
 
  The teachers’ association has alleged that university administration does not discuss or take required consent from them before taking any decisions affecting lakhs of students.
  
  Association general secretary Nishant Chauhan said, “University administration has failed to implement the academic calendar of 2017-18 but the vice-chancellor has been making tall claims in this regard. Students are confused over which all exams they will be taking on OMR (optical mark recognition) sheet. University administration had claimed to have completed practical exam process in January but the process is still pending.”
  
  President of the association Mukesh Bharadwaj said, “Sports players are not getting required support from university. They don’t even have proper kit to play in events. University administration has failed to properly manage civil services exam coaching facility for students. There is no scope for research work. Major companies have stopped recruiting students of Agra University.”
  
  Chauhan said, “The VC gives flowery speeches whereas the situation on the ground is getting worse. We will raise the issue of mismanagement by university administration with each and every authority concerned. If no improvement occurs then, we will sit on a protest with students and parents.”
