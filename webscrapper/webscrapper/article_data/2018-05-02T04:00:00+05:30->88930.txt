Rajkot: Port town Gandhidham was on the boil on Tuesday after an objectionable comment on the Maheshwari community’s religious leader on the social media sparked massive furore. 

 Community members blocked all the major roads in the town, burnt tyres and even targeted police vehicles. Police lobbed around 10 teargas shells to disperse the mobs that gathered in huge numbers on the roads.
 
 The mob vandalized nearly six police vehicle and pleted stones, leaving on cop injured. They gathered near Oslo Circle on Tagore Road demanding arrest of the miscreants behind the crass comments There was massive traffic jam of vehicles coming to Gandhidham due to the blockades. Gujarat STate Road and Transport Corporation (GSRTC) has suspended all its services to Gandhidham.
 
 Gandhidham MLA Malti Maheshwari and Kutch (east) SP Bhavna Patel rushed to the spot but could not convince the mob to disperse. Maheshwari said “I have asked police to lodge an FIR. I am in constant touch with police and trying to convince the people to protest peacefully.”
 
 Local media persons alleged that they were also thrashed by the police as they were covering the unrest. However, the SP did not respond to the calls made by TOI.
