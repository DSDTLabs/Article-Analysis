LUCKNOW: Incidents of big cats straying into human habitations are on the rise, but   seems unprepared to handle growing   as was evident in Aurangabad Khalsa village, close to Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University and Ramabai rally ground, under Aashiana police station, when a leopard ventured into the fields on Thursday morning.

 By the evening, at least five persons were injured in the resulting melee.
 
 Against the norms of wildlife rescue operations, the area should have been cordoned off but the crowd of people kept swelling. Police arrived much later but only to join spectators. The handful of forest guards and rescue team could put up nets and cage only by evening.
 
 “We can expect the feline to move out from where it is hiding only when it gets a little quiet,” said an officer on the spot.
 
 Locals said that the leopard attacked a villager watering his field at 7am and finally took shelter in abandoned sewer pipes after being chased. Since forest department lacks a full-fledged   of its own, the Lucknow zoo team was summoned.
 
 The news of leopard’s presence brought onlookers in hordes and women and children were moving freely.
 
 “It is for the first time that we have seen a leopard here. So many people have marched through my field that my crop is almost destroyed,” said a local.
 
 A member of rescue team was injured as the leopard ran amok on being chased by the crowd.
 
 At least five people, including the rescue team member, were injured, said locals. Though forest department’s team at the place did not confirm the number of people who got injured.
 
 The officers did not confirm if it was the same leopard that was recorded in a CCTV footage of an underconstruction building in Ganeshpur village on Faizabad Road near Chinhat.
