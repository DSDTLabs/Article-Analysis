Mumbai: The Congress will on Wednesday launch a   against the Devendra Fadnavis government’s failure to declare a complete   for farmers.

 The decision to launch the agitation was taken at a meeting of the state Congress committee presided over by  . “In our opinion, Fadnavis was misleading the farmers over the loan waiver. Quite a large number of farmers will not benefit from the scheme owing to stringent conditions. There will be no compromise on our demand for a complete loan waiver,’’ Chavan said. 
 
 Fadnavis had on June 26 declared a Rs 34022 crore loan waiver scheme for 89 lakh farmers. A week later, the scope of the scheme was widened to include farmers who had taken loan prior to 2009 and further, the CM declared a special package for those farmers, who were not defaulters. 
 
 The Congress says the scheme will benefit less than 15 lakh farmers and the financial burden will not be more than Rs 8,000 crore. Congress spokesperson   said, “Since the scheme was declared, the government made more than half a dozen changes in the scheme. It appears that government is not serious on providing relief to farmers.”
