AHMEDABAD: State government appears to have intervened in the case of a Dholka-based girl,  , who is trapped in the  . TOI reported on Thursday that Hafijabanu told the reporter over the phone, expressing her fear, “Every night the owner troubles me. Please rescue me from his clutches and from the family which is torturing me. I cannot bear it any more. I can get killed here.”

 “Soon after TOI report, state education minister,  , contacted me and collector of Dholka, Avantika Singh and asked us to try locating the girl. I approached the TOI reporter through Facebook who later brought me in touch with Sriniwas, the social worker from Hyderabad whom Hafijabanu contacted,” said Ruturaj Desai, deputy collector, Dholka.
 
 “Hafijabanu lost her parents. Two of her sisters are worried about her condition since she cannot be reached. Meanwhile, when I got in touch with her sisters, they said that the agent who sent Hafijabanu to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, has sought for Rs2.5 lakh to get her back and that they don’t have so much money to sort the matter out,” said Desai.
 
 “After further probing the matter and discussing with Sriniwas, we could touch base with Farheen Khan (name changed to protect identity), a resident of Juhapura who helped us investigate the case. She herself is a victim of such exploitation in one of the gulf countries and now helps trace such other girls,” added Desai.
 
 Desai claims that Chudasama has taken up the matter to the state home ministry who in turn have also informed the ministry of external affairs about the matter. According to him, Hafijabanu is in touch with Sriniwas, the social worker from Hyderabad and they hope to safely get her back. tnn
