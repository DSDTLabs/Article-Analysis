If you’ve been a fan of the serial   and are now left wondering why it hasn’t been on air recently, here’s some news. The mega serial has been taken off air and a new series has taken its time slot. Amrithavarshini, which held much promise when it began five years ago, boasted a stellar cast including  ,   and  , left fans swooning with its declining content. Social media buzz had it that the plot became illogical and became comical after a point. 

  “Sometimes, an actor was replaced by another with a claim that he had undergone plastic surgery; a child in the family who was made such a big deal of, isn’t part of the story after a few episodes; the matriarch of the family who otherwise makes major decisions started making rare appearances; the daughter of the family goes missing and on her return, the character is played by another actor,” these are some of the bizarre twists and turns observed by viewers. It isn’t surprising then that the serial whose plot seemed to be losing its sheen by the day was taken off air. 
 
  The channel though has a different take. “Amrithavarshini was appreciated for its content that delved into a positive aspect of the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationship. It has been on air for five years and now that we have new content, we took it off air,” says the source.
