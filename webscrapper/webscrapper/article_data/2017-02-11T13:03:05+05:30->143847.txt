PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Members of the Pimple Saudagar Rahatni Development Forum (PSRDF) appear to have developed differences.

 They have formed a panel of four independent candidates to contest in Panel 28 (Pimple Saudagar). They will lock horns with three of their own -candidates who have the backing of the  .
 
 Earlier this month, nine PSRDF members had filed nominations to contest the civic elections. Three of those were supported by Sena, while the others were independents.
 
 But the latest development could be detrimental to them, as it could split the votes.
 
 PSRDF members Sandeep Deore, Anita Tutare, Kamaljeet Kaur, Abhijit Parkhi, Indu Suryavanshi, Vivek Titarmare, Deepak Nagargoje,   and   had filed their nominations. Tutare, Patil and Nagargoje were the three Sena candidates.
 
 There are 36,625 voters in Pimple Saudagar, 70% of whom live in housing societies.
 
 “We wanted each political party to nominate two residents of housing societies. But only Shiv Sena gave nominations (to three candidates). A few members felt the forum must contest all four seats by forming an independent panel,“ Deore told TOI.
 
 The forum was formed with an aim to develop leadership qualities in the residents of housing societies.
 
 “If the major four political parties had nominated two candidates each, then eight candidates from housing societies would have contested the elections, and at least two would have won. So there will not be any split in votes of housing society residents,“ Deore added.
 
 “The constitution gives every citizen the right to contest the election. Just because we were nominated by a political party , we cannot tell others not to contest,“ said Rajesh Patil, one of the Sena candidates. “There will be some impact due to this decision by the PSRDF . It will affect everyone,“ he added.
