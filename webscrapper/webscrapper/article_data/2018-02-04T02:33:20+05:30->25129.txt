Ghaziabad: A 36-year-old   was shot dead by his neighbours in   late Friday night over a financial dispute. A case has been registered under Section 302 (murder) against four members of a family, but no arrested has been made.

 The victim has been identified as   Sharma, a resident of   area.
 
 Sunil’s brother Jitendra, who filed the complaint, said Sunil had given Rs 1.5 lakh to his neighbour Amit, six months back to buy a buffalo, but neither did he buy the buffalo nor did he return the money.
 
 On Friday, Amit came to their house around 11pm and asked Sunil to come with him to his house and collect the money. “Sunil had just walked till 100 meters from home when Amit’s family members grabbed him from behind and Amit shot him in his face from a point-blank range,” said Jitendra.
