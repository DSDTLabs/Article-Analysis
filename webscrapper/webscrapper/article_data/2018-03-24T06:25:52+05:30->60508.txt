KOLKATA: In one of the most bizarre cases of theft recorded in city, a group of burglars decamped with three beds, a dressing table, two gas cylinders, a gas oven, two wooden doors, five pairs of shoes, 10 sarees, six T-shirts, four pyjamas and two undergarments, along with cash and jewellery, collectively worth Rs 2 lakh from an empty house in  . 

 The incident took place sometime between last Sunday night and Thursday.
 
 The burglary was reported from   in Thakurpukur under   police station. The house belonged to the parents of state government employee Kamal Aich. The Aich family stopped living there since the death of Kamal's father.
 
 "I was there in the house last Sunday and everything was alright then. On Thursday evening, when my elder brother went there, he found the door broken. He went inside and found the entire house almost empty," said Aich, a resident of Satyen Park in Thakurpukur.
 
 The house situated on a 2.5 bigha area is in a shambles and according to locals, the courtyard was the den of several criminals and drunkards over the years. "We often hear noises from the house at night, but do not venture out to see what's happening. Over the last few days, we heard some noises at night," said Sandip Das, a local resident. 
 
 The house is at the end of a lane which is not wide enough for a truck to enter, but is just enough spacious for movement of cycle vans and rickshaws. 
 
 Cops probing into the case said they are checking CCTV footage on the main road and are questioning the neighbours for a lead.
