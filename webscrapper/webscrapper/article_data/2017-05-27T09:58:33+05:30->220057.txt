PUNE: Six men from Pimpri were arrested on Friday for repeatedly gang-raping a 21-year-old student from Nerul, Navi Mumbai, between March and May this year. The woman had come to Pimpri on a long visit to her grandmother’s house in December last year.

 In her complaint to the police, the woman alleged that the suspects threatened to kill not just her, but also her grandmother and uncle, if she did not agree to their demands for physical relations. 
 
 “When questioned at the police station, the suspects admitted to having exploited the woman,” said police sub-inspector  , who is investigating the case. “We have also got some witnesses who had seen the woman with the suspects on different occasions.”
 
 Police said the woman developed a friendship with the main suspect, who lived in the neighbourhood, during her evening walks at a nearby garden. “Their association developed into a physical relationship. Soon, he introduced her to his friends,” Sawant said.
 
 The woman said the main suspect and his friends started sexually exploiting her. She alleged that they would threaten her and take her to different places in three of their cars used for committing the crime. She also alleged that they would give her sedatives in coffee or cold drinks. Usually, they would take turns to drive her to an isolated spot near an engineering college in Pimpri and at the Pimpri industrial estate. “At times, they would also gang rape her in their cars,” Sawant said.
 
 The woman said she did not reveal anything to her grandmother because of the death threats issued by the suspects. “About a week ago, the woman started complaining of pain. Her grandmother took her to a private hospital in Pimpri and she recovered after a few days. However, when she again started complaining of pain, her grandmother sent her to her parents in Nerul,” said senior inspector   of the Pimpri police.
 
 Mugalikar said the woman’s parents admitted her to a hospital where, during medical examination, she told the doctors and her parents of the sexual abuse. “The woman lodged the complaint from the hospital with the Navi Mumbai police. An FIR was registered, which was later transferred to the Pimpri police for further investigations,” he said.
 
 Sub-inspector Sawant said all six suspects are educated. “A few of them are engineers working with private firms, while the others are commerce graduates. They have been arrested under sections 376(2), 306(D), 323 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code. We will produce them before the court on Saturday,” Sawant said.
