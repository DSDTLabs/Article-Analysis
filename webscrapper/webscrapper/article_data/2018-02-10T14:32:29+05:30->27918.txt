INDORE: Footprints of tigers have been found in two of the four ranges in Indore division, the recent census has revealed. The other members of the cat family whose pugmarks and faeces have been found include leopards. 

 A large number of hyenas, jackals, foxes and wild dogs have also been found in the region through their pugmarks. 
 
 The regions where tiger pugmarks have been found are Manglia, Badijaam and Nahar Jhabua. All these areas have a fairly dense forest cover helpful for the tigers. Trap cameras have been set up in   region, to capture the animal through lenses. 
 
 Formally the output from trap cameras will be considered in the third phase of the counting, which will be held after 25 days. The counting of carnivorous animals, as a part of All India Tiger Estimation 2018, began on Monday and concluded on Wednesday. The report of the same was compiled on Thursday to be sent at divisional level. 
 
 “We have found pugmarks in Indore and Mhow range. Whether these pugmarks are of the same tiger or different ones, will be decided after scrutiny by senior officials. Due to shortage of trap cameras, they have only been set up in the forests at Nahar Jhabua,”  , range officer at Mhow range said. 
 
 Apart from these, Indore’s forests have proved to be home to a large number of leopards, jackals, foxes, wild cats etc. whose pugmark molds made using PoP have been collected by the forest department officials.
