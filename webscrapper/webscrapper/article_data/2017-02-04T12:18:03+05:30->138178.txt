 and   apparently spent quality time together on the sets of their long-in-the-making film with director, and co-producer  . Nope, we’re not talking about the time the former lovers spent shooting their last few scenes for the detective musical. According to eyewitnesses, the exes bonded over forcibly trimming Anurag’s hair.

 It all happened a few days ago in Mumbai while shooting a few patch-work scenes with the lead pair. According to a source present on the set, Anurag had, in the course of his pranks, given two-three assistants a haircut that day. Eventually, Ranbir and Katrina decided to cut Anurag’s hair to help the assistants seek revenge for their lost locks.
 
 The source says, “Most assistants run scared of Anurag, so none of them mustered the courage to touch his hair. Instead, they approached Ranbir and he agreed. He and Katrina ganged up, and waited till the sun went down. Then they forcibly made Anurag sit on a chair, picked up a trimmer and took turns in chopping his hair. Since the cuts were quite random, Anurag’s hair looks quite odd now. He doesn’t have an option but to wait till it grows back and then give it a decent style.”
