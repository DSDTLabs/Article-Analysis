GURUGRAM: Haryana teachers are up in arms against the state education board’s order for mandatory   of teachers under the human resources management system (HRMS). 

 The teachers of government schools in the state have been asked by the education department to fill up their details in online form before September 30.
 
 Satyanarayan Yadav, state’s secretary of   (HSTA), said, “This process of online registration with HRMS is complex as in many schools there is no adequate infrastructure to fill up these forms. More than half the schools in the state neither have computer nor computer teachers. As they can’t fill the forms themselves, most teachers are getting the forms filled at cyber cafes, this costs them around Rs 1,000. On top of this, those who do not complete the process by September 30 will not get their salaries. Our association strongly opposes this move. “The association strongly opposes this move,” he said.
 
 Tarun Suhag, president of primary teachers' association said, “We have been left stranded by the authorities. Whose fault is it that most of the teachers are not computer literate? It is not possible for us to fill the form by the prescribed deadline. I feel that we need to be given more time at least till after October. The wages for October should be paid according to the old system as it is the festive month.”
 
 “ It is impossible to complete the HRMS work by September 30, especially in schools where there are no computer teachers. If the salaries are not paid on time, there will be protests,” added Tarun.
 
 Satyanarayana said that the department is not serious towards studies, "For the last two years there's hardly been any academic work in the schools. “Teachers are busy finding out about their online salary transfer procedure and can’t conduct classes properly.” Attempts to contact the   for comments were unanswered.
