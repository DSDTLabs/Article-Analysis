ROHTAK: Taking a dig at   (INLD) over its attempt to dig up the controversial Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal, Haryana former chief minister   on Friday said it was a staged attempt to seek publicity.

 Addressing a press conference at his residence in Rohtak on Friday, the former CM said the only way out to get SYL canal water for the agrarian state was to put pressure on the Centre. “After the Supreme Court verdict, it is the Centre’s responsibility to dig up the canal and give Haryana its share of water. The government and the opposition must work on this formula to persuade the Centre to be serious about getting water for Haryana,” said the   leader.
 
 Hooda said they would be raising issues about “several scams” in the BJP government in the upcoming state assembly session. Mocking the INLD over the march, Hooda said Abhay Singh Chautala went for digging canal, but dug a road and that proved it was nothing more than drama. He said Congress was mulling to hold a rally in Jind district in near future to expose the reality of saffron government before the public.
