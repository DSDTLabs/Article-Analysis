GURUGRAM: The stepwell has four tanks, of which tank no. 4, the smallest in the complex, was used by women. There is an arch separating tanks no. 1 and no. 2, and an arched partition wall between tanks no. 2 and no. 3. A corridor goes around tank no. 4, another around the west of the structure. There is an entrance from the south and from the east, and enclosures at the baoli’s southwest and southeast corners.

 The uncertainty over the baoli’s future cropped up in January 2017, when it became clear that this piece of architectural history had little chance of survival. 
 
 
  
 
 A year on, despite official guarantees of protection, it’s a case of déjà vu. But hopefully, the ending this time around will be happier, and the baoli can be restored to its former glory. For, in a region that faces a depleting water table, the conservation methods of the past can come to the rescue of the present – and future.
