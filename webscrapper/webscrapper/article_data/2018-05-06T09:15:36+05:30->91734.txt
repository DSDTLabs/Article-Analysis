CHENNAI: With more than 400 cases pending, the newly appointed insurance   for Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry has promised to clear the backlog by the end of the fiscal.

 The ombudsman office was without a head since July last year leading to piling up of cases. “We have 401 cases pending as of March 31, 2018 and my goal is to clear this backlog before the end of this fiscal,” said M Vasantha Krishna, who took charge on Thursday as the ombudsman.
 
 For the year ended March 2018, the ombudsman’s office received 1,720 complaints as against 1,545 it received in the previous fiscal. While across India, 60% of all complaints received relates to life insurance, in Chennai office, only 20% of them are about life insurance.
 
 The increase in the number of complaints is due to disputes pertaining to claims for damages caused by December 2015 floods. “In many cases the insurer paid the residual value of the vehicle and helped the insured buy a new one. But there are peculiar cases too. In a case, the car was completely damaged. The insured was sentimentally attached to it. He wanted the car repaired and restored instead of money,” an official at the ombudsman’s office said.
 
 “Within the   section, disputes with respect to   insurance policies were nearly 85%. The complaints are with respect to repudiation of claims or partial settlement or rejection due on the grounds of pre-existing disease,” the ombudsman said.
 
 The   ombudsman office was created in November 1998, to dispose grievances of insurance policy holders. The ombudsman is required to pass a decision within three months from receipt of a complaint.
