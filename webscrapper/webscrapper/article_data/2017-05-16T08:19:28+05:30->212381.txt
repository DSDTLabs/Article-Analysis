 Speaking after inaugurating a registration camp held under Kaushalya Karnataka scheme at JK Grounds here on Monday, Vasu said that he has discussed with chief minister Siddaramaiah and district minister H C Mahadevappa about organizing a job fair in the district for the benefit of youths.
 
 "Both have agreed, and the fair will be held in September or October on a massive scale," he said, and expressed that the lack of publicity by the district administration has led to poor response to the registration camp.
 
 Zilla panchayat CEO P Shivashankar said that this year, nearly 25,000 youths from the district will be trained in various skills as per their qualification. They will be employed in various sectors later. The department of skill development, entrepreneurship and livelihood will impart necessary skills so they are job-ready.
 
 "Even though youths get training certificates from training centres, they fail to get jobs due to employability gap. So the state government has introduced a uniform curriculum with advance syllabus to train the youths," he said.
 
 The CEO said that the   will be held across all taluk headquarters in the district. Youths in 18-35 age group can enrol themselves for the scheme, and the process will be done online.
 
 After the inauguration of the camp, joint director (training) Nagaraj told mediapersons that the district has about 590 industries. "But only 142 of them have registered to provide training to youths. Even though it is mandatory for factories to register themselves with the department, they have not done so," he reued.
