Vizianagaram: Responding to complaints regarding the flouting of rules by education authorities, District   Authority (DLSA) chairman Justice Alapati Giridhar warned them of strict action if they do not respect the rights of children and their Right to Education.

 In a meeting with district education officer (DEO) G Aruna Kumari on Saturday evening, Justice Giridhar ordered the DEO to submit a detailed report on various officials under the scanner by the end of July. He further urged the DEO to ensure that teachers and education officials take their duties seriously and attend classes regularly. 
 
 He pointed out that any teacher playing truant would be strictly dealt with. He also ordered the DEO to serve show cause notices to officials and teachers under the scanner.
 
 Responding to complaints that many teachers were not taking up classroom sessions, Justice Giridhar said, “ Such behaviour would tantamount to denying children their Right to Education and a violation by teachers appointed for the sole purpose of ensuring that children in school are taught well, would be tantamount to a criminal offence.” Justice M Sri Hari, secretary of District Legal Services Cell, pointed out that from now on teachers would be located with the aid of call data collected from the nearest cell tower and anybody caught lying, would be suspended with immediate effect. He added that the Child Friendly Legal Services to Children and Their Protection Scheme is being strictly implemented in the district.
