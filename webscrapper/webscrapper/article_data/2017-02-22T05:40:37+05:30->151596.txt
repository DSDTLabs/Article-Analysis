KOLKATA: A day after chief minister   announced the state would pay for the reconstruction of the school in Rajarhat that was vandalized by a promoter last week, education minister   Chatterjee visited the school to personally oversee the work on Tuesday. 

 Chatterjee reached the school at Dashodrone in Rajarhat around noon and stayed there for around half an hour, speaking to teachers and guardians and taking a round of the damaged school whose walls and roof were razed by a local promoter.
 
 "The promoter has done a heinous act. No one can demolish a school in this manner. If there is any controversy regarding the ownership of a property, the promoter should move court. He cannot attack the school like this," Chatterjee said.
 
 He added the school education department has already disbursed Rs 5 lakh for the reconstruction work of the school under the instruction of the CM. "If needed, we will spend more and get the school back to its previous state," he said.
 
 Local promoter   had entered the   in the early hours of Saturday with 80-odd men and run a demolition drive at the school for over four hours. Teachers, when they tried to protest, were assaulted.
 
 "Unscheduled holidays will be adjusted with scheduled ones and if needed we will take classes on Sundays as well," said school headmaster Kaushik Bhattacharya.
