LUCKNOW: Aiming to tackle the lack of correct and timely information and updates after any incident, like   tragedy on Thursday,   OP   on Friday sent out a fresh missive to the police chiefs of all 75 districts, telling them to set up a social media cell headed by an inspector rank officer.

 
 The social media cells will remain active throughout the day unlike the PROs who have eight-hour duty.
 
 “The objective is to disseminate crucial information correctly in times of crisis, to both press and public. The men posted in the media cell would also be active on social media and will be given a fixed tenure of at least one year,” said DGP Singh who further instructed that the transfers of police personnel deputed in social medial cell will be routed through DGP office.
 
 The circular also directs SPs to get latest equipment to shoot high-quality videos and also buy a tripod. “After dealing with the crisis urgently, local SPs would have to take out five minutes and post a video giving brief details about the incident. As numerous calls start coming up immediately after a tragedy, the best formula would be to share this video on Twitter and on WhatsApp groups,” said spokesperson of UP police, additional SP  , who is also the nodal officer of social media cell at DGP headquarters. So far, media cells were working round-the-clock only at two places — DGP headquarters in Lucknow and under Noida SP.
 
 On Thursday, information about the actual position at accident site in Kushinagar could be relayed only after three hours.
