 starrer 'Kuttanpillayude Sivarathri' seems to be a film that would put everyone on the nostalgia mode, with its rustic locales, earthy characters and moreover, vintage flavoured songs.

 The film's first track 'Chakka Paattu,' sung by Sannidhanandan and Nimmy was released recently and it's a story song, about Kuttanpillai and Sakunthala, who are working with Kerala Police. The song goes on to mention their three kids, and how the protagonist loves the jackfruit tree on his land, more than his children. 
 
  
 Poet Anwar Ali has penned the song, from the movie that's directed by 'Angels' fame Jean Markose.
