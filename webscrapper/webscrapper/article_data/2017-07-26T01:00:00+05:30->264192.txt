Work on director Vignesh Shivn’s action-thriller with Suriya, 'Thaanaa Serndha Koottam', is progressing at a fast pace and we hear that the team is looking at wrapping up the shoot by August. In fact,   and   are presently filming a song for the film in Puducherry.

 A source close to the film says, “Suriya and   are shooting for a duet in Puducherry. They have been stationed in the coastal state since the last two days. The plan is to complete the song and also a few scenes there. With this schedule, which will go on till August 10, it’s a wrap for the film.”
 
 Meanwhile, the makers are planning to launch a single — Naan Thaana Veena Ponaa — from the album tomorrow. The source adds, “The posters from the the film were launched to ring in Suriya’s birthday and now, the first single from the film will be launched tomorrow.”
 
 Interestingly, in April earlier this year, Vignesh and composer Anirudh shared a fun video, announcing that they were releasing a single, Oru Pattampoochiya, from the film soon. The video hinted that the number was penned by the director himself and sung by Anirudh. However, seems like there has been a change in plan and the makers are coming out with another single.
