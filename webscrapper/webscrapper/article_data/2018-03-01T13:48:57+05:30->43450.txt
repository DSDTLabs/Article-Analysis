MADURAI: The State Human Rights Commission ( ) has recommended the government to book three police personnel for causing the death of a dalit who died after returning home from the police station where he was allegedly tortured in connection with a theft case in 2008. It also recommended that Rs 10 lakh be recovered from the accused policemen, and paid as compensation within four weeks. 
 
 Addressing reporters here on Wednesday, A Kathir, executive director of Evidence, an NGO, who was pursuing the case, said that this was one of the first cases in which the SHRC had given a strong recommendation as the family had received compensation and also justice after 10 years. 
  
 Narrating the sequence of events that led to the death, Kathir said that on February 14, 2008, Jayapandian, of Vathalpatti village in Nilakottai taluk in Dindigul district, had gone to attend a funeral with his relative, Agni. As it was late in the night when they arrived in   from Coimbatore, they took an autorickshaw to their village. Viruveedu police inspector  , sub-inspector Pandiammal and head constable Jayaprakash had stopped them, checked their bags and found that Jayapandi had a long wire measuring about 30m in his possession. 
  
 The police personnel then dragged both men to the Viruveedu police station and chased away Agni, but allegedly tortured Jayapandian asking him to admit that he had stolen the wire. When the man begged them to check with his owner, they contacted him. He told them that he had given the wire to Jayapandian. They then let him go when. 
  
 On returning to Coimbatore, the man fell dead in the farm in which he was working on February 17, 2008. Evidence had taken up the case with the SHRC, after inspector Sakkarai dismissed the case as false on March 3, 2008. Sakkarai died during the inquiry period. 
  
 The SHRC, which conducted 36 inquiries with regard to this case, on February 26 (Monday) sent its recommendations to the state government.
