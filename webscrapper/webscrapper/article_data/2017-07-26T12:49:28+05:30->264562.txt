CHANDIGARH: Haryana’s policy to re-engage the retired teachers for teaching in the state-run schools has come under the scanner of Punjab and   high court, which has issued notice to the state government. The policy has been challenged on the grounds that engaging retired teachers is not in consonance with the constitutional scheme and the state should ensure filling up of the posts on regular basis.

 Justice G S   issued the notice after hearing a petition filed by  , a resident of  , and others.
 
 The government’s decision to engage retired teachers despite near completion of the selection process for appointment of 6,874 teachers by the state’s recruitment agency has aggrieved the petitioners. Terming the engagement of retired teachers as contrary to the Constitution, they have argued that retired teachers are already getting pension but the petitioners are educated youths facing unemployment. It was submitted that these youths should be given preference in teaching jobs by completing the ongoing selection process.
 
 The petitioners have sought directions to set-aside the state government’s policy, issued on June 28 and July 4, 2017 vide which it had decided to re-appoint retired teachers in state run schools. 
 
 The state had cleared the financial grant of Rs 22 crore for payment of remuneration to these retired teachers for their services during the academic session of 2017-18. Further directions have also been sought to make appointment of post graduate teachers after completing the selection process expeditiously.
 
 The case would now come up for further hearing on September 28.
