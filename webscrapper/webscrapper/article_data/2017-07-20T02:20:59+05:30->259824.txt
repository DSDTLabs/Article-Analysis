GURUGRAM: Friends and   of actor-singer   flooded social media with tributes to the 27-year-old, who was found dead in her Gurgaon flat on Monday evening. 

 Preety Priyadarshinee (26) was Bidisha’s junior at Cotton College in Guwahati. Now a journalist based in Guwahati, Priyadarshinee told TOI she admired her talented senior, a girl who could sing, dance and act. And who, most importantly, was a very nice person. “Bidisha was a mature girl and had always had a positive outlook. So, the suicide is a big shock for all of us,” said Preety. 
 
 Hriday Haloi, a close friend of Bidisha’s brother Kaushik, said she was like a little sister to her. “She was a very jolly girl,” he recalled. On Facebook, he shared his anguish at this “horrible” turn of events, and wrote, “It is impossible to think you could do this to yourself,” adding he hoped the truth would emerge.
 
 To her colleagues too, news of her death had come as a shocker. Simanta Shekhar (35), who sang with Bidisha, remembers her as a happy and brave person. Right before her marriage to Nisheeth Jha, on April 28, 2016,   had met Simanta in Delhi and had told him how she had met Jha and how they had fallen in love.
 
 “She was very excited about getting married to Nisheeth. It was a love marriage and within 14 months, his alleged affair forced her to end her life. I still can’t believe a person as affable as Bidisha could take such a step,” said Simanta, an Assamese singer.
 
 Nurul Laskar, one of Bidisha’s teachers at Cotton College, said it was sad that someone so intelligent and amiable was no more. “I don’t know how to react to this news,” said Laskar.
