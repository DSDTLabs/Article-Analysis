LONDON: The ethics watchdog for Members of Parliament has reopened its investigation into misconduct by the  's longest-serving Indian-origin parliamentarian  . 

 Vaz is being investigated for breaching the MP's code of conduct following a September 2016 sting operation which revealed that he was in a sexual encounter with two male Eastern European escorts at his London flat.
 
  At the time, the   MP who allegedly paid for the escorts was chairman of the   overseeing its inquiry into prostitution. The recorded tape showed him offering to pay for cocaine for the men, even though the committee scrutinises drugs laws. 
 
 Vaz resigned as chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, a position he had held for nine years, in September 2016, as a result of the allegations.
 
  Kathryn Stone, Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, began her investigation into allegations of breach of code of conduct but suspended it in December 2017 owing to Vaz's ill health. The inquiry has been reopened on the basis of "independent medical advice". 
 
 A spokeswoman for the commissioner said: "These inquiries take as long as they take. The commissioner takes written evidence. She might interview witnesses."
