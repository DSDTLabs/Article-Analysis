 Ashwini, (Vedavati after marriage), who is from Hirekerur and has done a diploma course in architecture, married Parathasarathi, who is from Hindupur, Andhra Pradesh and works in a private firm in Bengaluru after doing MCom. 
 
 Guests at the wedding shared their happiness and blessed the couple through gestures and sign language. Unlike the bustle at a normal marriage, there was a pin-drop silence at this event. 
 
 Ashwini's brother Amarnath Kumkumgar, who runs a grocery shop, said, "My sister couldn't speak from the time she was born. She completed her education in Mysuru. When it was time for her marriage, some men were keen to marry her but she wanted to marry only a speech-impaired person. Some of our relatives referred Parthasarathi's name and after meeting his relatives and parents, we arranged the wedding."
 
  More than a hundred friends, also speech impaired, came from Bengaluru, Andhra Pradesh, and other places to bless the couple. They decorated the main stage and brought the couple to the hall. "When people from surrounding villages came to know about the event, curious people turned up to witness the marriage and bless the couple," said Amaranath. 
 
  "When the marriage was arranged, my sister created a   and started sharing the details there. She also invited her friends through WhatsApp and even made a video call to invite her friends through sign language," he said. Many of their friends used WhatsApp to share the highlights of the marriage with those who couldn't attend the event.
