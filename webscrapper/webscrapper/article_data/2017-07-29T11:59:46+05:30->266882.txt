When quizzed about the title,   says,” I play a guy who works in local sandhai. The audience will know why he is called   in a few days.

The star cast comprises  ,  , Swaminathan, Yogi Babu and Sendrayan and I am sure their brilliance combined with such a hilarious script, is going to be a laugh riot in the theatres. We are all set to shoot the complete movie in and around Kumbakonam and Karaikkudi. Pistha is full of celebration, love and comedy. This is  's 25th movie we are glad to have him on board.”
