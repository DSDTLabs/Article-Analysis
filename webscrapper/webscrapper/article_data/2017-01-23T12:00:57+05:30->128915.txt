NAGPUR: ‘Be   and not job-seekers’ — these were the words from   that left a deep impact on the minds of the young people on Saturday at University’s  . Squatting on the stage, the   started his inspirational lecture by asking the common question students face usually. 

 “Why do you think of finding a job in Pune, Mumbai? Why don’t we think of giving jobs to others,” said the 37-year-old who started his journey with only Rs 200. 
 
 In 2012, TOI had carried a couple of reports about Chavhan’s success and how he overcame countless hurdles after being rendered 87% physically disabled at the age of two years.
 
 Sharing his experiences, Chavhan said, “I saved those Rs 200 from my pocket money in the form of Rs 1 or Rs 2 using which I started by developing a local brand of detergent. Gradually, I set up a factory. But, it got gutted in a fire. People extended support but I politely thanked them and moved on.” 
 
 Within years he set up Vidarbha’s first oil refinery at Butibori. “Today, over 100 people are directly and indirectly employed by us. We are making discarded oil reusable thus preventing pollution and making profit out of waste,” he said. 
 
  Chavhan’s final words for the students were, “If a person who is unable to walk can do it, everyone can. It is our laziness that prevents us from taking the big plunge.”
