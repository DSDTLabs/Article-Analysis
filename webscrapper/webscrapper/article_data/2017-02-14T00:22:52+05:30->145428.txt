New Delhi: Delhi’s roads are becoming increasingly unsafe but enforcement and challaning seem to have become less intense of late. In 2016, cops booked lesser number of drivers for offences, which endangered the lives of others, as compared to the previous year. They fined 86,771 drivers for   compared to 2,35,002 in 2015; 92,037 drivers were challaned for jumping   signals in 2016 against 4,01,033 in 2015; 2,05,470 cases were registered under sections of dangerous driving in 2016 as against 2,36,930 cases in 2015. 

 Traffic police officers claim that an increase in the vehicle numbers from 74.41 lakh in 2011 to more than 1 crore in 2016 resulted in more congestion and lesser challans. Drives were conducted to increase challans for drunk driving, triple riding and pillion rider without helmets though. 
 
 According to Delhi Police’s data, 2,42,250 drivers were booked for not stopping at a “stop line” in 2016 as compared to 1,43,727 in 2015. Cops also booked 2,621 drivers for wrong overtaking in 2016 as against 6,363 in 2015. However, the challans against drunk driving showed a marginal increase from 25,958 in 2015 to 28,006 in 2016.
 
 Officers said they had booked almost twice the number of people for driving without a licence last year compared to 2015. The police sent 1,78,578 licences for suspension for various violations, which is the highest among all the states in India.
 
 The police data show a dip in the number of fatal accidents compared to 2015. Last year 1,591 people had died in 7,375 accidents compared to 1,622 killed in 8,085 accidents the previous year.
 
 The traffic police launched a drive against the rogue public transport drivers last year in which 25,136 Gramin Sewa drivers, 4,972 DTC drivers and 1,87,991 TSR drivers were booked for plying without proper credentials.
 
 After the registration of e-rickshaws was made mandatory last year, cops booked 26,472 drivers for unauthorised driving and 2,80,888 for plying on the wrong side of the road.
 
 The traffic police sent 282 proposals to PWD to rectify roads prone to congestions. They also enforced pedestrian discipline on some stretches. They introduced 200 body-worn cameras and 50 variable message as part of the smart traffic management plan last year.
