NEW DELHI: Adding a new vaccine to its flagship  , the Union health ministry launched measles rubella (MR) vaccination campaign in the country on Sunday. The campaign will soon be followed by roll out of the vaccine in routine immunisation, an official said.

 The single vaccine will replace the currently given two doses of measles vaccine at 9-12 months and 16-24 months of age. The new single shot vaccine will be given to all children aged between 9 months and less than 15 years irrespective of their previous measles or rubella vaccination status or measles or rubella disease status.
 
 MR vaccine will be provided free-of-cost across states at schools as well as health facilities and outreach session sites.
 
 The awareness campaign targets around 41 crore children across the country, the largest ever in any campaign. In the first phase, the campaign will cover five states — Karnataka,  , Puducherry, Goa and Lakshadweep, covering nearly 3.6 crore children.
 
 “We have taken this as an achievable target. This shall be taken up in mission mode and rolled out in partnership with states, NGOs and development partners such as WHO, Uunicef, Gates Foundation, Lions Club, IPA, IMA etc,” Union minister of state for health Faggan Singh Kulaste said.
