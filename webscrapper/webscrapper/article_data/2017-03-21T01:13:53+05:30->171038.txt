NAVI MUMBAI: The   are now writing letters to the office of joint director of town planning,  , about including   in the integrated development control regulation ( ) for   under Mumbai Metropolitan Region. They are even asking the residents to support their efforts. The administration is neutral on NMMC’s non-inclusion.

 The elected representatives are not accepting the rationale that NMMC is not eligible as the city land is not free-hold. They claimed that NMMC, the local governing body, also issues NOC for any planning activities.
 
 “Not including NMMC in the final draft is a mistake as the city is facing many development issues and a comprehensive plan can resolve all of it,” said legal representative of corporator Kishor Patkar.
 
 Elected representatives are positive that the concerned authority will take citizens’ demands into account. Many have pointed out that slums and areas under grampanchayats don’t have any amenities when compared to the developed sectors. “This proves that there is a need for a separate DCR,” said mayor Sudhakar Sonawane.
 
 The last date for addressing suggestions and objections to the DCR plan is March 30.
