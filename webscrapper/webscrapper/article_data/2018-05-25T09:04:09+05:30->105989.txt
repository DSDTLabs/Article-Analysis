CHANDIGARH: The pavement situated between  , gate number 1 and   taxi stand has turned into mess with grease residue, mixed with wet soil and   lining the PU boundary wall. Heaps of garbage lie unscooped all around which are also infested with flies. Discarded rickshaws and old cars parked further contribute to the grim spectacle. 

 A large number of small-scale food stalls, fruitsellers and vendors selling clothings have also encroached upon the place and have further exacerbated the issue. 
 
 Piles of garbage and filth can also be seen heaped around the trees. Supply agents are also seen to be irresponsibly handling the delivery of goods there. They drop jute threads, cardboard boxes and other kinds of wrapping materials after unpacking the goods they are delivering. “I don’t know what happens here, but I have never seen this place completely clean,” said  , a PU student.
 
 Hawkers selling tea and other eatables in the open also attract customers in large numbers. “This is unhygienic. The place needs a complete sweeping operation at least once. The months of neglect have coated the the walls with darker tinge. The cars parked in the adjacent taxi stand also contribute to the issue,” said another PU student
 
 The food and fruitsellers, who were earlier stationed on the opposite side, next to the prepaid auto booth, were asked to vacate almost twelve days ago by the administration and the area was fenced with a barbed wire. Since then, they have moved onto the pavement. “Earlier the spot next to PGIMER was full of trash and now all of that has moved here,” he added.
 
 However, when asked about lack of cleanliness, the hawkers and sellers responded saying that the area is cleaned everyday except on Sundays as those are holidays for the sanitation workers.
