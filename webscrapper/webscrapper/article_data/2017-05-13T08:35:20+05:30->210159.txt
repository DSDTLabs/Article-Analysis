IDUKKI: The uncertainty over further eviction drives at Munnar has brought small-scale encroachers out of their hidings. 

 The initiatives by the revenue department in general and Devikulam sub-collector Sreeram Venkitaraman in particular, had been effective in controlling illegal construction and encroachments in and around Munnar for a while.
 
  The   ( ) was also successful in evicting small-scale encroachments at Devikulam, Munnar Colony, Chinnakanal and Pallivasal.
 
  However, the eviction preceded by removal of a giant cross at   had created a lot of hue and cry, with chief minister   criticizing the sub-collector and district collector over the incident. It had also widened the rift between the   and the CPI.
 
  Even though revenue minister   had said that the eviction process would progress smoothly, nothing has worked out, say sources.
 
  The CPM leadership in the district has strongly opposed the eviction move and it is to be seen how far the government can overcome this resistance from within the ruling front.
 
  The land mafia is also widely misusing the government stand to avoid strict action against small-scale encroachers (who keep less than 10 cents of land), revenue department sources said.
 
  A revenue official, on condition of anonymity, told TOI: "The revenue minister's promise that evictions won't be stopped has turned futile. Since the CPM workers had manhandled PPLF members, they are also afraid to openly take action against encroachments."
