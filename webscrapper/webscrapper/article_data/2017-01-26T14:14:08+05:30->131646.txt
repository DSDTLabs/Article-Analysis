PANAJI: Pointing out that there is no mention of revenue generation in the   manifesto,   on Wednesday challenged leader of opposition and senior Congress leader,   to an open debate on the same.

 “In their manifesto, the opposition is offering five litres of petrol to citizens if they come to power. They haven’t said anything about revenue generation. We are therefore inviting Pratapsingh Rane for an open debate on revenue generation,” said BJP MLA and party spokesperson, Pramod Sawant.
 
 Rane had recently mocked Amit Shah’s statement that Parrikar will run the BJP-led government in Goa from whichever place he may be in. Reacting to this, Sawant added, “BJP will come to power in Goa with love and support from the people. Rane need not worry because BJP has capable leaders. There won’t be anyone coming in from outside the state to lead us.” He added that the chief minister will be decided by the elected MLAs of the BJP and the   board in Delhi.
 
  When asked about the possibility of Parrikar returning to state politics, he said, “BJP is a national party. The decision of who will be chief minister will be done at the central level.”
 
 The BJP also released its campaign songs at the press conference, the music for which has been arranged by Dyanesh Moghe.
