PUNE: By putting as many as 37 members belonging to 11 gangs behind bars, police have succeeded in reducing   cases by 59 percent in 2016. 

 In 2015, the police had registered 352 cases of which, 237 were solved. The arrest of members belonging to more than 10 gangs resulted into a drastic reduction of cases — only 143 — last year. 
 
 Police commissioner   said that the detection rate of chain snatching cases was almost at 77% in 2016. Of the 143 cases registered, the police had detected 109. “We have recovered robbed gold ornaments worth Rs79.69 lakh from the arrested gang members,” Shukla said.
 
 Shukla said that there was also a decrease in street crimes like robberies and dacoities last year in Pune, and lauded the cops for arresting 166 suspects from 50 gangs of robbers. “We made efforts such as area-mapping, patrolling around hotspots and even increased our presence on the roads. This helped us in controlling the street crimes,” Shukla said.
 
 While welcoming the news, Narhe resident   said more needs to be done to curb the menace in the city. “Still there are chain-snatching incidents in the city. The police should intensify patrolling in the morning hours, when many senior citizens go out for a walk,” she suggested.
 
  on the rise
 
 Admitting an increase in crimes against women in 2016, Shukla said that the cases of rape have been increased by 26% when compared to 2015. Shukla also said in 97% of the rape cases, the crime was committed by person(s) known to the victim. Around 50% of such cases, Shukla said, involved false promises of marriage. 
 
 One reason for the increase in such cases, Shukla surmised, could be the fact that an increasing number of women have come forward to to lodge the complaint. “We have also planned to create awareness among the women this year,” Shukla said.
 
 The commissioner also said that of the 354 cases of rape registered with the police in the year 2016, 13% were committed by the relatives of the victim and in 16% of the cases, neighbours were involved.
