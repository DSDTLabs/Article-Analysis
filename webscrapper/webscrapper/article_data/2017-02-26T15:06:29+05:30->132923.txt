rGV's comments about  's no show at Vizag for the ##APDemandsSpecialStatus protest seems to have irked the Power Star. At a press conference on Friday morning, Pawan dismissed   as nothing but a 50-year-old pervert who collects porn films despite being the father of a married girl. 'Pellaina kooturini pettukoni pornography cinema collect chestha anna vyakthi gurinchi emi matladagalanu,' said PK, reacting to RGV who asked why he chose to hide behind his phone screen instead of leading from the front on the 'battle ground'. 
RGV shot back, calling PK out for making a below-the-belt remark on his personal life instead of answering his simple question ' where was PK? 'Oka abhimanigaa PK meedha expectationstho maatlaadanu gaani thanu chesukunna 3 pellilla laanti personal vishayalu neneppudoo maatladaledhu,' he tweeted. 
 Looks like RGV's won this one. but PK still hasn't explained why he stayed back in Hyderabad, after giving a clarion call to the youth of AP to fight for #APDemandsSpecialStatus.
