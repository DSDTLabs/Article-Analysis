NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Wednesday extended till July 10   Chidambaram’s interim protection from arrest in two cases filed by the   and the enforcement directorate (ED) in connection with the   deal. 

 
 Karti had filed a plea, seeking protection from arrest in the Aircel-Maxis matter, in which the CBI and the ED had lodged cases in 2011 and 2012, respectively. The matter pertains to grant of Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance to M/s Global Communication Holding Services Ltd for investment in Aircel. 
 
 The court had earlier discharged the Maran brothers and others in the same case. The ED has alleged that former minister P   was part of the ‘conspiracy’ to give FIPB clearance to Aircel-Maxis by concealing facts.
