NEW DELHI: Rajya   Chairman   on Tuesday said his discussions with parties over the dayâ€™s agenda were meaningless if the   was not being allowed to function day after day. 

 Expressing deep anguish over the   not being allowed to function for over one week,   made a fervent appeal to the government and opposition parties to enable normal functioning of the House.
 
 Naidu, addressing members during Zero Hour in Rajya Sabha, advised them to adhere to the sanctity of rules. Referring to notices received for discussion of banking irregularities, Naidu said he was upset that while opposition wanted a discussion, the government was ready and the Chair had allowed it, the House was still not able to function. 
 
 Naidu also urged members to not display placards and posters while protesting in the House. Earlier, during a meeting with floor leaders in his chamber, Naidu said protesting with placards would set a bad precedent.
