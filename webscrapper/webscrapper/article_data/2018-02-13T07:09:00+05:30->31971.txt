GHAZIABAD: In a massive anti-encroachment drive undertaken by   on Monday, an “ashram” belonging to followers of jailed   was razed. The drive was undertaken to rid   structures that have mushroomed on the floodplains of the Hindon river between the newly constructed Hindon Elevated Road and the Karheda bridge.

 Apart from the ‘ashram’ which was being run by the Dera Sacha Sauda, the congregation of followers of Ram Rahim, nearly 10 other illegal structures were also demolished. “The ashram alone was spread over an area of around five bighas. They had constructed toilets, bathrooms, gates, boundary walls and a big platform inside the premises apart from tin sheds. Rooms had been constructed near the ‘ashram’ by other encroachers. Among the structures that were razed was also a cricket training academy that was being run on the floodplains. The action was taken on the basis of the fact that the structures were all within the floodplains. Ownership of the land was not a ground for the demolition exercise,” executive engineer, GDA, RP Singh told TOI.
 
 According to officials, the ashram was demolished a few years ago by the GDA. However, followers of the congregation had returned to reclaim the land and erected the structures again. 
 
 Representatives of Dera Sacha Sauda said the structure demolished on Monday was not an ‘ashram’. “It was a meeting point where we used to have congregations once every month for prayers and bhajans,” said Dr Madan Lal, chief of Dera Sacha Sauda in Ghaziabad.
