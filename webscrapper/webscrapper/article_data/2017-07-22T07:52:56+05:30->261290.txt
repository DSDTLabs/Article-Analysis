NEW DELHI: A new police   at the   airport was inaugurated on Friday by   commissioner Amulya Patnaik who described it as the ‘model’ police station to emulate and upgrade others around the capital. 

 The new police station-cum-DCP office is located just 200 metres from Terminal-3 and is aimed at providing easier access to passengers and tourists who may be having any problem at the airport. The police station is also the first in Delhi to have a ‘child-friendly’ room with stuffed toys, puzzle games and painted walls to make children feel safe when recording a statement.
 
  
  
 
 “This is the first police station in Delhi which has a child-friendly room and we aim to replicate these at other police stations as well. We are already looking into the places where these can be accommodated. The environment of a police station can sometimes be too daunting for a child, but this room can make the child feel safe and secure,” said Patnaik while inaugurating the new three-floor building.
 
 Police said the officer sitting inside the child-friendly room will also be in civil clothes. In addition, the building has a number of other firsts, including the use of LCD TVs as a bulletin board and to give messages, a lounge for investigating officers (IO), a recreation room for officers and a business centre as well.
 
 “Most police stations have a lot of boards with notices and guidelines, but we have integrated all of that on these LCD TVs which will play these messages as a powerpoint presentation and reduce the clutter. IOs will also have a separate lounge with beds and cupboards, where they can rest,” said Sanjay Bhatia, DCP (IGI).
 
 The building itself has replicated the huge Mahatma Gandhi mural at the police headquarters with one if its own, which is 25-feet tall, engraved on the building. The police station will also have a contingency command centre where the police can coordinate with other agencies.
