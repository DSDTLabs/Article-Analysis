HYDERABAD: Former Congress MP Ponnam Prabhakar on Monday alleged that chief minister   was not raising his voice against the Modi government despite injustice done to   in the   budget because the Prime Minister’s Office has a list of irregularities involving KCR.

 Instead of taking up the issue with the central government, KCR is preferring to take rest in his farm house. “Even the   leaders in Telangana are not able to say anything against the injustice meted out to the state in the Union budget. They are scared of Modi,” he said.
 
 In a separate development, former Congress MP V Hanumantha Rao alleged large-scale corruption in the budget allocated to the BC Study Circle and staged a dharna at the Study Circle office in Banjara Hills. “The social welfare department is being headed by   whereas a minister from BC or SC community would have been a better choice,” he said, demanding an inquiry into financial irregularities.
