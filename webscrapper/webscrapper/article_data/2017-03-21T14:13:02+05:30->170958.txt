 showed no signs of slowing down despite confirming their top spot in the group as the 31-time champions blanked   2-0 in the   at Tilak Maidan in Vasco on Monday.
 
    put Bengal ahead in the eight minute while Manvir Singh added his name to the score-sheet with six minutes left for the final whistle.
  
  Bengal now await the result of Tuesday’s matches to know their opponents in the semifinals. 
  
  Meghalaya coach Khlainpyrkhat Syiemlieh had high hopes from his side after a comfortable win over Services in the previous game. But Meghalaya struggled to take control at the start.
  
  Bengal’s short passing game was pleasing to the eye and they surged ahead in the eighth minute when Manvir easily rounded off keeper Kenio Lyngkhoi and passed the ball for Ronald who guided it into an empty goal.
  
  Minutes later, Ronald tried to return the favour by setting up Manvir in an ideal position but the latter shot wide with only Kenio at his mercy. Manvir could have put the tie to bed before the break but simply lacked composure in front of goal.
  
  Meghalaya gave everything they had but found it hard to break through centre-backs Provat Lakra and captain Rana Gharami.
  
  The introduction of Fullmoon Mukhim and striker Bikyson Kharkongor sparked some life into Meghalaya’s game and the north easterners kept Bengal on their toes. But it were Bengal who sealed all comeback doors when Manvir made a swift move on the counter, sneaked past a couple of defenders and finished with a deft right-footer.
  
  Meghalaya had only themselves to blame. They could have easily restored parity but Bikyson first shot wide from hand-shaking distance in front of an empty goal and then Michaelson Kurbah did the same when he couldn’t keep his header on target.
