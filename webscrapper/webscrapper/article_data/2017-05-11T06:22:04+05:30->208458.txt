NEW DELHI: A unique combination of five   judges belonging to different faiths will start hearing final arguments on the constitutional validity of   from Thursday, the first day of the SC’s summer vacation.

 For a sensitive issue like this, the lead petition is aptly titled “Quest for Equality vs Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind”. And hearing the case will be five judges from five different communities — CJI J S Khehar (Sikh) and Justices Kurian Joseph (Christian), R F Nariman (Parsi), U U Lalit (Hindu) and Abdul Nazeer (Muslim).
 
 However, it needs to be mentioned here that a judge decides a case only on the consideration of merit and nothing else as s/he takes oath that “I will bear true faith and solemnly affirm faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India as by law established, that I will uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India, that I will duly and faithfully and to the best of my ability, knowledge and judgment perform the duties of my office without fear or favour, affection or ill will and that I will uphold the Constitution and the laws.”
 
 Tagged with the case are six petitions by Khuran Sunnath Society, Shayara Bano, Aafreen Rehman, Gulshan Parveen, Ishrat Jahan and Atiya Sabri.
