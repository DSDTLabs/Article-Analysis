Veteran actress   was recently in Jaipur and she made the most of the one-day visit to the city. Supriya was seen at the Sawai Mansingh stadium, cheering for team Mumbai as it took on the Jaipur team at the ongoing cricket league tournament. Talking about the match, Supriya said, “I’m a typical Mumbaikar and I can’t think of cheering for any team but Mumbai. I’m watching a live match for the first time. Usually, I prefer watching it from the comforts of my home.”

 Supriya visited Jaipur with her daughter Sanah. “We have few friends here, so we visited them. And as I am here with Sanah, so shopping toh banta hi hai. We went to an old jewellery shop, and picked up some beautiful pieces. After a long time, I went jewellery shopping with her,” Supriya told us. Supriya, who comes from a family of actors, considers her husband   as her biggest inspiration. “Pankaj is somebody who I look up to. He is my mentor and guide. He is one of the finest actors our country has,” she said.
 
 Be it playing the naive and happy Hansa Parekh in the   or the sinister   in  , Supriya has done it all. “Actors have a switch on and switch off mode, they switch their personality as per the role’s demand. But it’s not really a tough job for an artist. I believe every professional has the capacity to fit into a character.” Supriya, who is currently seen as Hansa in the third season of the show, Khichdi, said, “It was quite challenging to come up with part three of a show whose first two seasons have been a huge hit with the viewers. I love portraying the character of Hansa Parekh, who is pure and simple. She touches everyone’s life with her simplicity and gestures.”
