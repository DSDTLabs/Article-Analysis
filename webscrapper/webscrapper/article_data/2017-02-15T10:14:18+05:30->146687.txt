ALLAHABAD :   skill development and entrepreneurship (independent charge) and senior   (BJP) leader,  , said Prime Minister   is still the party's face in UP elections. 

 Rudy, who has been deputed to campaign for the party in Allahabad and Varanasi districts, said, "While visiting the rural and urban pockets of Western and Eastern UP districts, I learnt that Modi factor will click for the BJP in the state." 
 
 My interaction with the masses has also made it clear that the tide is in favour of BJP as people of state are done with the SP's family feud and petty politics being played by BSP. After seeing the working of Union government, people are now inclined towards BJP, added Rudy. 
 
 In an exclusive interview with TOI, Rudy also said that the party national president Amit Shah has always been the key source of energy and encouragement to party workers to achieve the goals. Shah has a dynamic and impressive style of working. 
 
 He knows the capabilities and proficiencies of his team members and only assigns work as per their capabilities, said Rudy, adding that "If he (Shah) feels that you can deliver, he knows as to how to mentor and groom you for the assigned job." Before assigning responsibility, Shah too completes ground work and selects the leaders or members for the selected zones. 
 
 Rudy, however, claimed that BSP has undauntedly dented the prospectus of SP-Congress alliance in Rohilkhand, where the polling would take place on Wednesday.
