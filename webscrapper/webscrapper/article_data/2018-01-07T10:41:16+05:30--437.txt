NEW DELHI: Four powerlifting players were killed, while two others including world champion Saksham Yadav were seriously injured after their car met with an accident near the Singhu border in outer Delhi's Alipur area in the wee hours of Sunday.  Yadav and his colleague have been admitted to a private hospital. Police say that the incident was reported around 4am when the players were returning from an athletic meet in Panipat in a Swift Dzire car. Locals told the police that the driver somehow lost control of the car, perhaps while overtaking another vehicle, and rammed into a roadside pole due to which it overturned. Eyewitnesses say that the vehicle toppled several times before coming to a halt. Police say that the deceased have been identified as Harish, Tinku and Suraj while the fourth person is yet to be identified. Yadav's associate Baali has severe head injuries. All the six athletes were taken to the Raja Harish Chandra hospital by a PCR team where four of them were declared dead on arrival while Yadav and Baali were referred to the Max hospital in Shalimar Bagh. Police have registered a case under section 304A causing death due to negligence and negligent driving against the driver. CCTV footages from the cameras installed at the Singhu border are being scanned to find out the cause of the accident.  "He had called last night to say he was coming home. In early morning hours we came to know about the accident," sister of Tikamchand, who died in the road accident, told ANI.
