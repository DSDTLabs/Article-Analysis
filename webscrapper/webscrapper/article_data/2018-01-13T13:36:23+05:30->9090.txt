PALANPUR: Around 200 students along with locals in   near   staged a protest rally over delay in the construction of a primary school building that was completely washed away in the floods that ravaged   in July 2017.

 During the 2015 floods, the school building was damaged, but there were no measures taken to repair it, so it collapsed completely in July last year.
 
 Since August last year the children of the village have been studying in the open for want of classrooms, a schoolteacher said. On condition of anonymity, he said, “There are 10 teachers, including the principal in the primary school, who are providing education to students from class 1 to class VII. It has been over six months since the building collapsed, but there is no sign of new building. Children have to sit in the open even in chilling winter.”
 
 Enraged over the snail pace of construction work, parents and guardians of students gave a memorandum to the village sarpanch   for district primary education officer (DPEO), Banaskantha, V R Darji, urging him to accelerate construction work. Students also shouted slogans against the government. 
 
 Talking TOI, Darji said, “The construction has started and the multi-storied school building will be functional within three months. The work was delayed as some villagers stressed on changing the construction site and had moved court, which delayed work by two years.”
