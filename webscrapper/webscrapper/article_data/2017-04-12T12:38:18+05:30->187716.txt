SURAT: Police have started investigation into the incident wherein a seven-year-old child was confined in the school premises by P R   authorities here on Monday. Preliminary investigation revealed that the child’s parents had not paid fees for the past few months which made the school authorities to take the harsh step to not let the kid go home until his father sorted the things out with them. 

 “We have started investigation. Action will be taken against those who had confined the child in the school premises. We are registering statements of all those related to the case,” police said.
 
 “The child’s father had failed to come to the school despite having been reminded several times in the past. He had given us a cheque towards fees of the child in February but it was rejected by the bank concerned when we presented it for payment,” P R Khatiwala School principal Shakun   said. 
 
 “We ensured that the student appeared in the examinations even though his parents had failed to pay fees for second and third semesters. He kept on making promises to the teacher but never came to meet us. Hence, we told the school van driver to get the child’s parents to the meet us,” Vashishth added. “The child’s father wanted to pressurize the school so he brought police with him. He levelled false allegations in his complaint that the school had forcefully confined the child in its premises,” she added. Some officials of the school were booked on Monday.
