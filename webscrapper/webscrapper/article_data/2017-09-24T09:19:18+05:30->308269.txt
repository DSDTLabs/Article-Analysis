AMBALA: An INLD leader from Ambala accused   cabinet minister Anil   of inciting Dera Sacha Sauda followers and appealed to the Supreme Court to take suo motu cognisance of the matter. INLD leader   said on Saturday, “Vij has lost his mental balance and is under trauma due to the violence by dera followers.”

 “Vij has stooped very low to capture the vote bank. It was very condemnable, he should have at least kept respect for his post. The Supreme Court should take cognisance of the matter and lodge a case against the cabinet minister as he has been inciting dera followers,” Onkar said.
 
 Haryana minister of state Karan Dev Kamboj also backed Vij’s demand for compensation to relatives of dera followers who were killed in the violence after dera head   was convicted of rape on August 25. “Innocent people have been killed during the riots. However, the agitators, who resorted to rioting, were being identified and should be punished,” said Kamboj.
