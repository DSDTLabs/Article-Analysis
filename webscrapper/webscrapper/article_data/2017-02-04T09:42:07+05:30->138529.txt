KOLHAPUR: The Kolhapur division of   ( ) that deployed Point of Sale (POS) terminals at Central Bus Stand ( ) and Sambhaji Nagar Stand reservation centres got very poor response as the service is being used by a handful of people.

 The state government had directed all its departments to adopt cashless mode of transactions to promote Centre’s digital India campaign. Following this, the transport corporation decided to make PoS terminals available at its reservation centres.
 
 The Kolhapur division got four PoS terminals and it was deployed at reservation and monthly pass centres. However, with enough availability of cash in market, the usage and demand of the POS terminals in Kolhapur has gone down.
 
 A CBS stand employee, on condition of anonymity, said, “We received the POS terminals about 15 days ago. The passengers were in great need of POS terminals during demonetisation and used to ask us about card payment options. We did not have POS terminals by then. We received the terminals after the restrictions on withdrawal of money were lifted.”
 
 He added, “We hardly get one or two passengers who book their tickets in advance and pay through debit or credit cards. The same situation is at the pass centre. Enough cash is available in the market and it has always been a preferable mode of transaction.”
 
 Abhay Kadam, in-charge of CBS, said, “We have three PoS terminals with us and have put up notices related to acceptance of debit and credit cards. We should have got them during the demonetisation period. Now, the people have turned to the traditional way of paying by cash. We will still put efforts to make the online payment system popular at our stand. We are optimistic about the change.”
