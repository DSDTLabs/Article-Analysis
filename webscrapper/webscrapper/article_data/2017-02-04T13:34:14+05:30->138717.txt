BHOPAL: Seven out of the 21 jail guards from Bhopal have failed to qualify for the screening test conducted by the   (NSG). The jail guards had volunteered to undergo a special commando training after one of their colleagues was murdered in a jailbreak by SIMI operatives in October last year.

 All the guards who had gone for training will return to Bhopal as the quota for training was full at the NSG training centre at Manesar in Haryana.
 
 “We are developing a high-security team of around 60 police personnel and these training commandos will be a part of it, along with other experts. Besides, a company of Indo Tibetan   (ITBP) will also be deployed at  . The ITBP will form the outer security circle, while the high security team will form the inner circle,” DG Jail, Sanjay Chaudhary told TOI.
 
 “This was the first batch of 21 but we intend to train around 30 such personnel. However, out of 21, 14 were selected in the screening test,” he added.
 
 The guards will undergo a rigorous training programme at Bhopal Central Jail before they apply for training at the NSG again in the month of July. A training ground is being prepared in front of the old jail premises, where they will be trained.
 
 “The conditioning before participating in the training programme requires several physical exercises. It includes 15 kilometres running, rope climbing and a host of other activities,” ADG (prisons),   told TOI. Meena is in-charge of training.
