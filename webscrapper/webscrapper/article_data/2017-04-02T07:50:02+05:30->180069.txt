 The land was taken over for providing parking facilities attached to the metro station at Kalamassery.
 
 The move follows a government order that the private firm should not be given market value for the land to be taken over for the metro project. 
 
 The state government had issued an order on Friday stating that the company should be paid only the original amount they paid while the land was assigned to the firm in 1962.

 In 2013-14, the revenue department started measures to take over 62 ares for Metro station and parking yard. 
 
 Heeding the Apollo Tyres claim of market value of the land as compensation, the district level purchase committee (DLPC) which met in 2014 decided to give around Rs 46.33 lakh per are as compensation. 
 
 Later, the state-level empowered committee (SLEC) approved the land value.
 
  The KMRL opposed this on the ground that the land was assigned to them by the state government.
 
 The Apollo Tyres moved Kerala high court challenging the KMRL stand but in 2016 the court ordered the state government to examine whether it had revisionary powers and take appropriate decision.
