Congress-SP released the full version of the alliance song ‘Je Hui Na Baat’ on Monday. Nearly four minutes long, the song focuses on PM Narendra Modi’s “suit-boot” fixation, a charge Congress has harped on since the PM wore a monogrammed suit to meet former US President Barack Obama, and allegedly large quantum of waived corporate loans. Sung by ‘Bulleya’ singer Amit Mishra, the lyrics, which peddle Congress-SP as the saviour of farmers and the poor, have been penned by Raj Shekar. It has been directed by Krsna Solo.
