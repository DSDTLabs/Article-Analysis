NEW DELHI: After deciding to cancel the licence of  ,   ( ) has now approached the high court seeking its final nod.

  issued notice to the hotel on NDMC’s latest plea where it has informed the court about the council’s decision and wants the green signal.
 
 In its plea, NDMC wants the high court to modify its May 2001 order where the court had stopped it from taking coercive action against the hotel. Appearing for the civic agency, additional solicitor general Sanjay Jain argued before the court that the 2001 order was conditional on the hotel paying its licence dues but since it had failed to do so, NDMC must be permitted to initiate proceedings to evict CJ International, which is the current owner, from the hotel.
 
 However, the hotel objected to the application and sought time to respond. The high court then posted the case for March-end when it may decide if NDMC can be allowed to act under Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants Act).
 
 NDMC had on March 2 decided to auction off one of the most luxurious properties – the Taj Mansingh hotel – and also cancelled Le Meridien’s licence over dues of Rs 523 crore.
 
 Senior NDMC officials maintained that the Le Meridien property is unauthorised and said its council cancelled the licence as the alleged compromise in the high court was termed a fraud. This was because it didn’t just settle past liabilities but also future licence fee for remaining 66 years in contravention of provisions of license deed and without obtaining the Council’s approval.
 
 “Under the Public Premises Eviction Act 1971, there is a provision if the licensee fails to pay the licence fee then the licence can be terminated by the governing body,” an official said.
