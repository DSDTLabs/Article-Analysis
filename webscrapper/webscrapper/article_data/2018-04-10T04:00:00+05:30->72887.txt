Ahmedabad: Nearly 17 years after Mahendra Mills — located on the Kalol highway — went into liquidation, its 1,650 workers will get a small portion of their dues, as the Gujarat high court permitted the official liquidator to disburse Rs 8.52 crore to secured creditors and workers.

 According to the advocate for the Textile Labour Association, Dhimant Vasavada, of the Rs 8.52 crore, about Rs 1.79 crore will be disbursed to workers. Till now, these workers have collectively received Rs 1.51 crore, which is 8.86% of their total dues. The textile mill had closed in 1999. Their dues, since the liquidation, amount to Rs 17.08 crore.
 
 Mahendra Mills went into liquidation in 2011. However, the high court found it difficult to dispose of its assets with a large chunk of mill land remaining unsold. One bidder backed out last year, citing a liquidity crunch because of demonetization.
 
 Vasavada, who has been fighting for workmen’s dues from all textile units in and around the city, said 38 textile mills had gone into liquidation, but in most cases, workers have not received their their full dues.
 
 The total dues payable to workmen by 36 textiles mills that went into liquidation was Rs 628.75 crore. The number of workmen retrenched was 77,585. Some of them have even passed away in the course of their three-decade legal battle for their dues.
 
 After these textile units went into liquidation and as their assets were sold on various occasions, a portion of the money realized from disposal of their property has been disbursed to workers. 
 
 Till date, workers have been paid Rs 343.58 crore, which is about 54.65% of their total dues.
 
 Vasavada said fluctuation in land prices in the city has been the biggest obstacle in realizing funds, because selling land parcels has become difficult lately. Mahendra Mills’ land was also divided in 11 plots to fetch a good price.
