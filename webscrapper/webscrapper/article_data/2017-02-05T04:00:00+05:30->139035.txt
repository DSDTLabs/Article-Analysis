Vadodara: In a move to galvanise workers and reach out to the electorate in the tribal areas of the state, the BJP will conduct an Adivasi Vikas Gaurav Yatra in the tribal belt of the state. 

 The yatra will cover all the 27 assembly constituencies dominated by tribal voters.
 
 The Congress had been traditionally the dominating party in the tribal belt, but the BJP has made inroads in the region. With elections round the corner, the BJP announced the programme even as Congress is also planning to conduct one.
 
 BJP state general secretary Bharatsinh Parmar, however, said that the yatra was not a show of strength and was not directed towards the polls. 
 
 “It is in line with the Garib Kalyan Varsh being celebrated by the party. We want to reach out to the heart of the tribal population and convey to them how much the party cares about them,” said Parmar.
 
 On being asked if the party was conducting the event as the Congress had planned one, Parmar said that the Congress had planned such events twice but was unable to execute them.
 
 The yatra that will kick off on Tuesday from Unai in south Gujarat will culminate at Ambaji in north Gujarat on February 18. 
 
 Chief minister Vijay Rupani will kick off the event led by state BJP president Jitu Vaghani. National BJP president Amit Shah will remain present at its culmination at Ambaji. The yatra will enter central Gujarat at Chhotaudepur on February 11.
