JALANDHAR: A number of   and some   in   have rallied behind   after she received rape threats for speaking out against   in Delhi. Gurmehar belongs to Jalandhar and it was here that her father, Captain Mandeep Singh, was cremated after he died in 1999.

 Among those who spoke out were AAP Punjab leaders, Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Managing Committee (DSGMC), Dal Khalsa, Istri Jagriti Manch Punjab and Sikh Sewak Society International. AAP Punjab spokesperson Sukhpal Singh Khaira on Tuesday demanded that ABVP be banned.
 
 He also questioned Union minister Harsimrat Badal's silence when “a daughter of Punjab“ was being threatened with rape by ABVP supporters.Senior Supreme Court advocate and AAP functionary H S Phoolka called up Gurmehar's mother Rajwinder Kaur to assure that they would extend all support.
 
 Khaira said targeting Gurmehar reflected the height of intolerance in the country . “How can opinions be suppressed like this?“ he asked. “The way ABVP and its patrons targeted a 20-year-old martyr's daughter exposes their fascist agenda.“
 
 On the other hand, the DSGMC jumped in to support Gurmehar. “Those threatening our own sister and daughter can't be nationalists,“ said the body's president Manjit Singh GK.
 
 Terming the incident as a sign of bad politics, GK said he was duty bound to stand by a girl whose father laid his life fighting for the nation.
 
 “Our Constitution gives all citizens freedom of speech and difference of opinion doesn't mean that attempts are made to muzzle voices with uncivilised threats. If Gurmehar Kaur stood for not waging a war on Pakistan, does this make her anti-Indian,“ GK added.
 
 Dal Khalsa leader H S Dhami, spokesperson Kanwar Pal Singh and Sikh Youth for Punjab (SYP) head Paramjit Singh Tanda said in a statement that power had gone to ABVP's head ever since the BJP government took over at the Centre. Dhami expressed solidarity with the student bodies which had challenged the ABVP.
