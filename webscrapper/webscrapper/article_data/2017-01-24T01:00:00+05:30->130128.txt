Television actor  , who recently broke up with his American girlfriend, says it wasn’t cultural differences that drove them apart. 
He clarifies, “We met while she was staying in Mumbai. We did not part ways because she could not adapt to our culture. In fact, she was very traditional and knew her 
 priorities. We shared great compatibility, too. However, she had to relocate to the US and wanted me to move, too. But that was not possible as I am pursuing my profession here. The experience taught me many lessons about relationships.”
 Now that he is single again, is there family pressure to get married? “As you grow older, the society puts a lot of pressure on you to get married. I am from Varanasi and in small towns like mine, the pressure is even more. People get married at a young age and after that, prefer hanging around with their own families. Unlike here, in the West, there is no pressure to tie the knot and you’ll find many single people enjoying their lives. Not that single individuals don’t have a life in India, but the pressure here is more. I feel it is more important to marry the right person than marry at the right time,” he says. 
 Siddharth is also clear that he doesn’t want to marry an actress. He elaborates, “Call me old-fashioned, but I would prefer a girl who is not from the same profession. That’s mainly because an actor spends 14-15 hours a day, working. If we are both actors, it will be difficult to spend quality time together.” 
 On the work front, the actor, who is known for his roles as   in   and Doli Armaanon Ki, is not unhappy about his show Krishan Kanhaiya not connecting with the masses. He says, “This show had a different concept. However, since a dragon called ‘rating’ rules TV, everyone has to walk the beaten path. I like the concept of finite shows and   is a good example of that. Also doing different roles establishes my range as a performer.”
