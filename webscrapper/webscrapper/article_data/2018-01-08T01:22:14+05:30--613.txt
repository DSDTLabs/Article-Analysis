GURUGRAM:   is finally expected to complete repair of roads in the   sectors it has recently taken over, by next month, almost a year after it took up the project, having already missed several deadlines, including its latest one of January 2018. 

 MCG officials claimed work under the project is almost done, that most roads in the Huda sectors it has recently taken over have been repaired. The project was originally slated for completion in December 2017. “We have covered 90% of the area. In the few areas left, work is nearing completion and should be over latest by next month,” said chief engineer M R Sharma of MCG.
 
 Asked about the length of roads covered under the project, Sharma said since the nature of repair work varied from one location to another, there isn’t an exact number than can be put on the length of roads repaired.
 
 The project will be completed after missing several deadlines. CM Manohar Lal Khattar had inaugurated the project in January 2017. MCG started reconstruction of roads in its areas, as well as Huda sectors, in February, and claimed it would complete the work by June-end. In all, 31 areas were identified, of which the maximum number of roads that needed repairs were in Zone 2. There were 11 roads needing repair in Zone 1, 12 in Zone 2 and four each in zones 3 and 4. Officials said the scope of work included two types of roads — bituminous and concrete. Although the deadline was December 30, officials had promised work would be over before 2017 monsoon. However, the project missed that deadline and work was postponed till after monsoon. It was delayed by the rollout of GST, as contractors were left unsure of applicable tax brackets.
 
 When TOI reached out to residents from some of the areas covered, they confirmed that road repair work in their areas has indeed been carried out. “MCG has repaired all roads in our sector,” said Bheem Singh, RWA president, Sector 22.
