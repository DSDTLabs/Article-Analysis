PUDUCHERRY: After June, the   party will have only   V Narayanasamy to showcase as a Congress CM in the country, said Prime Minister   on Sunday.

 
 “Narayanasamy will become a showpiece for the Congress party. Do you know why? After June, Congress will have only Narayanasamy to showcase as its chief minister in the country,” he said while addressing a public meeting in Puducherry.
 
 Modi sought the intellectuals in the country to analyse the reasons for the lack of progress in the country and asked them to compare 48 years of rule directly or indirectly by one family with the 48-month rule of the present   government at the Centre.
 
 “The country’s first Prime Minister (Jawaharlal Nehru) had been in power for 17 years, his daughter (Indira Gandhi) for 14 years and her son (Rajiv Gandhi) for five years. The there was a remote control government of the family between 2004 and 2014. Now the intellectuals must analyse what the one family, which directly or indirectly ruled the country for 48 years, achieved. They should compare it with what the present government did in 48 months,” he said.
 
 The Prime Minister said despite having great potential Puducherry “remains underdeveloped because of the Congress culture.”
