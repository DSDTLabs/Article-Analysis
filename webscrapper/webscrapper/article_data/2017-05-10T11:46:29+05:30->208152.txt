BHUBANESWAR: Former Koraput MP Jayaram Pangi, who was suspended by the BJD a month-and-a-half ago, joined the BJP on Tuesday, providing a major boost to the saffron party's consolidation of tribal support in the state. Welcoming   into the saffron fold,   petroleum minister   Pradhan said the tribal leader's entry will strengthen the BJP in the tribal-dominated region.

 Pangi, a four-time MLA, who served as a minister in  's council between 1990 and 1995, commands a strong grassroots connect in the tribal-rich district. Pangi said he did not set any condition for joining the BJP. "I joined the party because I am impressed with the party and its leadership," he said.
 
 Pangi joining the saffron party less than two years after another prominent tribal leader--former chief minister and seven-time   MP Giridhar Gamang--joined the party in 2015, gives the BJP an edge over other parties in the region, a political analyst said.
 
 Pangi came down heavily on his former party and said, "The regional party had drifted away from Biju babu's dreams of Odisha."
