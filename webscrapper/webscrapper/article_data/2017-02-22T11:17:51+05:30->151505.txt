PANAJI:   are probing a missing person’s case, after BJP’s   Vishwajeet Krishnarao Rane was accused of an alleged murder by his  .

 Satish, alias Ajay Ardalkar, who worked for Rane for 10 years, accused him of gunning down Shanu Gaonkar, a resident of Saleli, in 2006. Ardalkar claimed to be an eyewitness to the murder. Though he tried to flee, he was held back by Rane and threatened to keep mum, the police said.
 
 Ardalkar, who quit working for Rane three months ago, reportedly met a journalist and video-recorded his statement. The journalist then contacted the police and also circulated the video on YouTube, cops said.
 
 After the footage went viral, cops summoned Ardalkar on Tuesday and recorded his statement, and also took him to the spot of the crime to verify his claims and search for Gaonkar’s body. Statements of 10 other people have been recorded so far.
 
 Police said Ardalkar, in his statement, alleged that when Rane visited a bar located between Honda and Valpoi in 2006, he spotted Gaonkar around 3pm. Believing Gaonkar to be involved in his brother Prithviraj’s murder the year prior, Rane shot him dead. He and three others then dumped the body at Anmod Ghat.
 
 “Gaonkar’s family had filed a missing complaint a day after he went missing. We’re thoroughly probing every angle of the case,” said Karthik Kashyap, North Goa SP.
 
 Refuting all claims, Rane said, “Ardalkar’s statement is politically motivated,” adding that, “Bhai (defence minister Manohar Parrikar) has promised me a ministerial berth if I win, which will signal the end of veteran sitting MLA Pratapsingh Rane’s career in politics.”
