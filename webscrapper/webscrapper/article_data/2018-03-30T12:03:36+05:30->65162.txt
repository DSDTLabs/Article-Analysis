CHENNAI: Releasing an accused-turned-approver from a case is the prerogative of the trial court handling the case, and it can be granted at any stage of the trial, even to an accused who pleaded guilty of offence while framing charges, the Madras high court has said.

 Adivision bench of   N   made the observation while confirming the life term awarded to a duo charged with murdering a woman for gain in 2012. The bench also made it clear that treating such approver as a witness by the prosecution could not be faulted.
 
 
 The issue pertains to an order passed by the   on August 9, 2017 convicting Sathishkumar and Soundararajan for offences under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 302 (murder), 392 (robbery), and 364 (kidnapping to murder) of IPC and sentencing them to life imprisonment.
 
 Aggrieved by the order, the duo moved the present appeal. The primary contention of the accused was that the evidence given by their co-accused, who had turned as an approver, cannot be treated as prosecution witness since he was under the influence of police. The accused even produced a witness to prove that the approver was always with the company of police. Refusing to accept the contention, the bench said: “If such evidence (to prove that the approver was influenced by police) is accepted to discard a prosecution witness, no prosecution will survive in the court of law. Therefore, we have no hesitation to hold that the evidence of defense witness cannot be taken into consideration to discard the evidence of the approver.
 
 “It is rather strange to note that the defence witness   is the son of the defense counsel who appeared for the accused in the trial court. In fact, he stepped into the shoes of the accused which is against the professional ethics. We do not propose to say much in this regard.”
