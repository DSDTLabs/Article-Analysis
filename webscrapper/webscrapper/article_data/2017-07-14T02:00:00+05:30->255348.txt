PATNA: Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) president and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi on Thursday said CM   did not intend to sack deputy CM   Prasad Yadav to save his chair.

 Manjhi was the first minister to be asked by Nitish to put in his papers within four hours of being sworn in on November 25, 2005. He was still to be allotted a portfolio and was removed for his involvement in a fake BEd degree case of 1999 being probed by the state vigilance investigation bureau. He was re-inducted after getting a clean chit.
 
 Having earned the image of a clean neta with zero tolerance for corruption, Nitish has since removed at least four other ministers in a similar fashion.
 
 “There was no need of giving time to Tejashwi to offer his explanation. Nitish should have asked him to resign right away as he did with me. By not doing so even after a week of the CBI’s FIR in connection with a land graft case, Nitish has made it clear that he is exploring every possibility of saving his chair,” Manjhi told TOI over phone from Delhi.
 
 Manjhi, who is the lone   of his party, said the RJD was making a mockery of Nitish’s demand of point-wise explanation on corruption charges from Tejashwi. “Tejashwi is saying from day one that he would not quit. His party’s spokespersons are also parroting the same. It seems no one is paying heed to what the CM is saying,” Manjhi said.
 
 Manhi’s HAM-S is an ally of the NDA. “Nitish should get rid of all tainted people. The   has already offered support to the Nitish government from outside if Nitish sacks Tejashwi and RJD withdraws support to it,” he said and added he would also support Nitish in that case.
