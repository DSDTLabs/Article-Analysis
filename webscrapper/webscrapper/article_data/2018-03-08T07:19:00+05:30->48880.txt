Chandigarh: Kusum Jaglan, 30, created quite a stir when she joined an IT firm eight years ago. The notion of a woman being adept in a technical field was generally scoffed at. Eight years on, she has sailed through raised eyebrows and dismissive attitudes to be a project manager with an IT firm in Chandigarh. In the face of deeply entrenched bias, Kusum says she relied on hard work to prove her mettle. 

 “Women are more sincere towards their jobs and they follow processes to a T, leaving no room for errors. Men are more casual than women. Earlier, men used to be technologically updated but now women are more in tune with developments in the digital world. Sometime back, the perception was that women can do MBA but the tech world is a man’s forte. All this has changed now. There are more women in the IT field,” said Raman Aggarwal, president, Chandigarh Technology Park, BTS Association. 
 
 He has even instructed his company to hire more women than men. Reason: “women spend more years in an organisation as compared to men. I have asked my company to recruit more women because their association with an organisation is longer than men,” said Aggarwal. 
 
 On why we still don’t see more women in key positions in the IT world, Jaideep Bansal, Energy Access Leader, Global Himalyan Expedition, says, “Because there is no inclusivity at the workplace. Women should feel inclusive and inspired to work. Also the pipeline is not proper, tech colleges have very less intake and output of women engineers. So as long as the pipeline doesn’t exist, how can you have leaders? Women need to be encouraged to take up tech as a career, by showing them opportunities and giving them the aspiration.”
