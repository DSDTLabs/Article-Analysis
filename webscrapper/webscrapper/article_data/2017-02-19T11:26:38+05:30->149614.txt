In what sent shockwaves across the film industry, an  , who has worked in many South Indian films, including  , was   on Friday night by her former driver and was allegedly sexually assaulted. 

 Filmmaker  , who is close to the actress and her family, says that unlike some reports, there was no sexual assault. “I have spoken to her and her family. It was just a matter of extorting money from her. She is in a state of shock and is resting. Her mother and brother are with her. What is important is that she is safe. She is a fantastic girl. She needs time to get over this incident and it is our duty to give her support. I will be visiting her on Tuesday or Wednesday,” says Yogish.
