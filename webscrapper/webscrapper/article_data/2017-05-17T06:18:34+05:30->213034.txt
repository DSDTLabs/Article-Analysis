LUCKNOW: Firearms are of more value than money for bandits active in Bundelkhand. In a case reported to Chitrakoot police on Tuesday, Ram Gopal Yadav alias Goppa Singh, a dacoit carrying Rs 1 lakh reward kidnapped husband of a   and demanded his licensed rifle and cash as ransom. 

  is husband of a village pradhan and paid Rs 25,000 upfront for release. “Goppa made a demand of Rs 1 lakh and Yadav expressed helplessness to pay so much,” said of Bahilpurwa police station house officer   who is working on the case.
 
 After some villagers intervened, Goppa allowed him to go for Rs 25,000 but asked him to leave his licensed rifle along with money. Goppa had abducted Tulsi on May 13, when he had gone to get a borewell repaired in Karka village.
 
 Along with six armed accomplices, Goppa abducted Tulsi at gunpoint and took him inside the forest. As local villagers got to know about the kidnapping, they gathered and met Goppa’s men to broker truce. Rs 25,000 was collected and paid up and Tulsi was allowed to go after 10 hours.
 
 “But Goppa threatened he would not let Tulsi or his wife Asha Devi carry out development work in Kharka and Padharia village cluster unless they paid the Rs 25,000 more and a rifle. It is common for bandits to demand firearms as ransom in this belt,” added Yaddu. SHO of Manikpur police station, an area which is also infested by dacoits, R B Singh echoed similar views. “Relatives of a lot of bandits apply for arms licence which are sometimes approved and arms are later handed to ganglords,” said Singh.
 
 On Monday, Tulsi approached SP Chitrakoot and FIR against Goppa and his men was registered on Tuesday at Bahilpurwa police station on Tuesday under IPC section 386, 147, 148 among other sections. DIG   (range)   said that such cases have been reported in the past. “Criminals have an appetite for firearms in this region.
 
 We have intensified vigil to catch Goppa,” said Tiwari.
