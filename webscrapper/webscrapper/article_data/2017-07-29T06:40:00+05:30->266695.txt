MUMBAI: Insurance regulator   on Friday asked leading private sector life insurer ICICI Prudential   (ICICI Pru) to take over the business of beleaguered   ( ) with effect from July 31.   shall ensure that systems are integrated within a period of one year from the appointed date, IRDAI order said.

 Embattled   group chairman   had met IRDAI chairman to seek more time to resolve the crisis at his life insurance arm on July 24. ICICI Prudential had submitted a valuation report to the regulator to take over the company on the same day. It was last month that IRDAI had appointed an administrator to run the crippled Lucknow-based Sahara Life due to governance-related issues at the company.
 
 Based on facts reported by the administrator in a report dated June 22, IRDAI came to the conclusion that continuation of SILIC to transact life insurance business is not in the interest of the holders of life insurance policies in general, and considered it to be a fit case to transfer the life insurance portfolio of SILIC to some other insurer under Section 52B (1) of the Insurance Act, 1938, the order said.
 
 ICICI Pru will make available FAQs about servicing of policy holders of SILIC. A dedicated call centre-mail ID will be created to handle the concerns of policyholders of SILIC.
