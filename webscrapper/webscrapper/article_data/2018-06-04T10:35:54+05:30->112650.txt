If you thought that academic performance, discipline or technology addiction of children kept   on their toes, think again. According to a recent survey by a user-generated content and knowledge platform for women across the country, the eating habits of young ones gave mothers more stress than anything else. Worse still, Bengaluru tops the survey with ‘Food and Eating Habits’ the most stressful aspect with respect to bringing up kids.
 
  For homemaker Maitabi Banerjee, the issue lies in the vast number of unhealthy options available in the immediate external environment of the home. “Even if you try to set healthy eating habits at home, it becomes difficult to enforce, because kids are exposed to other options either on TV, social media, among their peers or when they step out.
  Most school canteens serve primarily   food items, as do the   outlets at malls. Once accustomed to having such unhealthy food outside, they may not like having healthy food at home and enforcing it becomes tough.
  
  Stay-at-home mother Rashmi Raj has found a cheat code to make snacking healthy. “If my son wants cookies, I make them at home, but as healthy options using jaggery and oats. I avoid chips by giving him vegetable crispies, so much so that now he prefers the snacks that I give him. It has been a gradual process, but one that has paid off,”she says.
  Mother of two young daughters, Ekta Shah says that maintaining a healthy diet for kids is difficult, given our metro lifestyle and long school hours, which inevitably tempt children to satiate themselves with junk food.
  
  The trick, she says, lies in setting limits on junk intake. “I don’t deny my kids junk food as they see all their friends having it. But I limit the quantity. For instance, if I give them half a chocolate or only one slice of pizza as against two, I explain why I have not given them more. They also know that most of the meals that they have in a day have to be healthy,” she sums up.
