NEW  : A 40-year-old vegetable vendor was run over by a PCR   near Burari on Friday night. 

 The   driver lost control of the vehicle in a bid to save an autorickshaw and rammed into the vendor’s cart parked near an intersection on the Burari main road.
 
  are trying to trace the errant autorickshaw driver who fled from the scene after the accident. Two policemen were also injured as the PCR van overturned after hitting the divider. 
 
 The constable, driving the PCR van, told the police that the autorickshaw changed lanes suddenly and slowed down in front of the PCR forcing him to swerve towards his left. 
 
 The gypsy hit the divider and overturned on the three-wheeler cart parked on the road side, crushing the vendor, Shiva, under it.
 
 Locals informed the police about the incident following which another PCR van arrived and rushed the injured policemen and the vendor to Trauma Centre in Civil Lines where Shiva died during treatment. ASI Kashiram and constable Daulat Ram suffered severe fractures on their arms.
 
 A case under section 279 (rash and negligent driving), 337 (Whoever causes hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life) and 304A (causing death by negligence) was registered at Burari police station.
 
 “We have requested the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) team for re-creating the scene of crime. Further action will be taken as per the evidence,” said deputy commissioner of police (north) Jatin Narwal.
 
 Family members of Shiva alleged that one of the vehicles was driving on the wrong side of the road leading to the accident. 
 
 “He was the only earning member of the family and was returning home after selling off his wares. We do not have enough money to even cremate him,” said Shiva’s wife, Meena.
 
 She also demanded actions against the errant auto-rickshaw driver or the policeman driving the PCR. Shiva’s family hails from a village in Uttar Pradesh.
