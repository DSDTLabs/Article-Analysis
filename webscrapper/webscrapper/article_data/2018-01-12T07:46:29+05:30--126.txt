CHENNAI: The Airports Authority of India (AAI) on Thursday began conducting trials for simultaneous operation of main   and second runway, also known as  , at the city   in a bid to boost aircraft handling capacity.

 Authorities kicked off a trial in which both runways will be used for landing and take-off for 55 minutes dailyy for three months. The operation was carried out between 10.28am and 11.23am, handling 22 flights in 55 minutes. There were eight departures from the second runway, five departures and nine arrivals from the main runway. 
 
 The operations helped minimise delay for departures and reduced conflicts in the airspace. As runways were alloted based on aircraft type and route, the track miles covered was also reduced, said an official. He also said a decision to make the system permanent would be taken after three months. 
 
 However, AAI may have to complete straightening of the   near the cargo terminal to ensure smooth movement of flights simultaneously on both the runways. “It will be ready in 12 to 18 months after which work to build a rapid exit taxiway will be started. When both taxiways are ready, we will be ready for full fledged simultaneous take-off and landing on the runways,” he added.
