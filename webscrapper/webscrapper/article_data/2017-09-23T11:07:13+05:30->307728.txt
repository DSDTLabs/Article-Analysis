In the latest episode of Sasural   Ka, Pari and Uma are seen fighting over the rituals and how they are to be done. Roshni and Piyush ask them to stop and tell them that Maataji is coming downstairs. 
 
 Prem and Simar continue to romance. They promise to be with each other till the end of time. Simar wears the sari given to her by him.   looks at her and is happy to know that Simar will die as a married woman in red. 
  
 Maataji is about to go with all of them to the temple but begins to feel sick. It is learnt that Bhairavi had given her adulterated water so she wouldn't be around when Simar is taking her least breath. Simar decides to stay back to be with her. However, Maataji tells her to go. 
 
  
  
 Before they start the car, Simar feels something is wrong and that they should stay back. But Bhairavi blackmails her emotionally. Prem finds 'Maata Ki Chunari' stuck in the car's engine and takes it out. Piyush then drives them to the temple. 
  
 On reaching there, they take out the 'pooja thali' and find stuff not for 'Maata Rani' but 'Shraadh'. Pundit Ji tells them they cannot do 'pooja' now as this is not a good sign. Simar prays to God to find a way. She spots a 'mauli' and decides to make clothes and decorate the idol with flowers. Bhairavi isn't pleased with the idea and resolves not to let Simar do the pooja.
