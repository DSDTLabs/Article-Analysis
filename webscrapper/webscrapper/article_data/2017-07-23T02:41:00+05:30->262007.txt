Nagpur: Last month BJP national president Amit Shah was touring across the country to strengthen organization network with an aim to winning 400 seats in next Lok Sabha elections. One of the points he stressed on was the demographic advantage that the party could exploit. By 2019 it is expected that the  , the first-timers and those below 21 make around 5% new addition to the total electorate of the country.

 “Anecdotal evidence suggests that the young voters overwhelmingly supported BJP resulting in the Modi wave in 2014. And if a large chunk of the new voters are again tapped, the BJP could easily achieve the new target set by Shah,” said a local BJP leader. The party has now roped in its youth wing Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha to register those who have attained 18 years or others below 21 who are not yet figuring in the voters list.
 
 BJYM president Shivani Dani and her team comprising Jitendrasingh Thakur, Rahul Khangar, Balu Rarokar, Kamlesh Pande, Nehal Khanorkar, Akshay Patil, Sarang Godbole will be felicitating the new voter registration. Two photographs, identity proof, address proof are to be submitted along with the requisite form at the polling centres on July 22 where the district administration will hold special camp for voter enlisting. The drive will continue till July 31.
 
 As per official data, there 1.61 lakh youth between 18 and 21 years of age as on July 1 in the district. But till date only 44,000 of them have managed to get their names in the voter list.
