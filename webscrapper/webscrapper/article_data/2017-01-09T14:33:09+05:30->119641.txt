INDORE: Actress  , who is also a sitting MP of BJP from Mathura has suddenly emerged as the centre of discussion of political activities at   (DAVV) campus. The topic of discussion is whether 'Basanti' will dance at the campus or not. 

 The controversy started after the executive council of DAVV decided to invite the actress for a dance performance at the South Asian Universities Festival (SAUFEST) to be held in February. Congress's student wing, NSUI, has demanded a roll back of the decision citing the amount that would be spent for inviting the actress. "They will pay Rs 25 lakh for Hema Malini to perform. We will not allow this huge amount of money to be spent on a dance," said Vikas Nandwana, NSUI representative at DAVV.
 
 Leaders of NSUI alleged that while the condition of buildings and hostels in the college was deteriorating, the amount should be spent on developing the college. The party has also approached the college administration over the issue.
 
 "She is not only an actress but also a member of BJP. If BJP or Hema actually care about the development of this college and the students, she should grace the occasion without charging any money," Nandwana said. ABVP on the other hand seemed to distance itself from the controversy. 
 
 "We have not called Hema Malini as a leader or member of our party. She will be here as an actress and she has full right to charge for her performance," said Dikshit, media incharge, ABVP.
 
 "It is clear they do not want the betterment of the college," Nayan Dubey, ABVP office-bearer said.
