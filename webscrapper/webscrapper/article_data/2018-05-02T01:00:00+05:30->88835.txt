Farah Khan, who is in-charge of choreographing Sonam Kapoor’s sangeet ceremony, has fractured her leg in the wee hours of Tuesday morning, while shooting for a TV show at a suburban studio. Farah started shooting at about 9 am on Monday morning and wrapped in the early hours of Tuesday around 3 am. She injured her leg while heading back to her vanity van.

 A source close to her told BT, “Farah had committed a time for the show and for the rehearsals. So, her hours got a little extended. She was rehearsing with some contestants till late on Monday night. It was in the wee hours of Tuesday when she was walking back to her van in a tired state when she injured her leg. She was immediately taken to a doctor and it turned out to be a fracture, following which she has now been advised bed rest and medication for a week, at least.”
 
 It’s a well-known fact that Farah was choreographing Sonam’s sangeet ceremony, scheduled for May 7. With less than a week to go, will her injury impact the celebrations? “Not much, because she has already choreographed the sequences,” says our source, adding, “So, now the family just has to rehearse. Of course, it would have been great had Farah been on her feet because that could have been a huge help in the last phase of the rehearsals. Though Farah is still pretty determined to see the sangeet through.”
 
 When we contacted choreographer  , who often assists Farah, she said, “Yes, Farah has sustained an injury on Monday night. I haven’t met her yet, so I don’t know how bad the situation is. But knowing how determined she is, she will try and do whatever her body permits her at this point for Sonam’s sangeet. She will not let them suffer. I’m not part of the sangeet choreography team but I know they’ll do a good job.”
