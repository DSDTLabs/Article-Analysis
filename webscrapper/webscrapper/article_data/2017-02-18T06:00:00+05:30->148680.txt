Kolkata: A complicated two-phased surgery, performed 16 hours after the patient was injured, has managed to save the severed hand of a 40-year-old woman at CMRI. Kalighat homemaker Sarala Jain had been assaulted with a knife along with her husband Narendra on February 12. Jain received serious injuries on her hands, face and scalp, and her left wrist was severed. 

 A follow-up procedure was carried out on Wednesday. Incidentally, the hospital was being ransacked at that time.
 
 Jain could not be operated upon immediately since her condition was not suitable for surgery, according to plastic surgeon Anupam Golash, who operated on her. “She had bruises and cuts on her face, arms and scalp. She was unconscious and had to be stabilized before we could consider an operation. It took us 16 hours to get her ready for the surgery. It’s a rare instance since such surgeries are usually conducted immediately after the injury,” the doctor said.
 
 Jain will now be able to use her left wrist normally. “But it will take her some time to use the hand since the injuries are yet to heal. But she is recovering fast.” 
 
 One of the prime accused of the attack on the couple, Roshan Lal Bordoi, was found dead in a Howrah lodge a day later. Bordoi was an associate of Sarla’s husband, a bookie. Cops said the two had fallen out. tnn
