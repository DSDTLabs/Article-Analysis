NEW DELHI: CBI on Friday arrested   businessman   Tottempudi and his wife Kavita Tottempudi, known to be close to a senior state politician, in its probe related to a Rs 1,400 crore fraud, allegedly committed by them on eight banks through their firm Totem Infrastructure Ltd. The couple, sources said, was arrested as they were planning to flee the country. 

 
 Salalith and Kavita Tottempudi had managed to escape the notice of banks and the Income Tax department, which announced a reward of up to Rs 15 lakh in 2015 for providing information on their whereabouts. They were wanted for defaulting on tax payment to the tune of more than Rs 400 crore. “After cheating the banks led by   (UBI) in 2012, they went underground and kept changing their addresses, without changing their identities. The intelligence agencies finally tracked them and informed CBI,” said a senior official. 
 
 
 The couple had cheated a consortium of eight banks by availing credit facilities for projects and also sub-contracted the work to various companies. The accused repeatedly defaulted on payments and diverted funds to different accounts. 
 
 CBI officials are surprised over why RBI and UBI took six years to file a complaint as the loan account was declared a non-performing asset in 2012. UBI has an outstanding of Rs 313.84 crore with the company, while SBI (Rs 357.64 crore), Syndicate Bank (Rs 64.48 crore), OBC (Rs 79.96 crore), IDBI (Rs 174.47 crore),   (Rs 208.67 crore) and   (Rs 126.30 crore) were also affected.
