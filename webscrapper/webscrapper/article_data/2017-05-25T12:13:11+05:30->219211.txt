HYDERABAD: Taking a serious view of a tribunal for its failure to look at the larger impact of the death of a young breadwinner of a family , Justice N   of the   has set aside the order of the tribunal that granted a compensation of `2.5 lakh to the parents and other members of the family of the deceased. The court increased the compensation amount to `14.88 lakh. The judge directed the   to pay the amount along with an interest of 7.5 per cent from November 2006.The judge was dealing with an appeal filed by the aggrieved parents and other relatives of Sheik Karim of   who was killed when an   bus mowed him down on September 13, 2006.Karim completed his training at an Industrial Training Institute (ITI) and landed a job as kalasi in Saudi Arabia's National Contracting Company Ltd. He was sending `10,000 every month to his parents.

 When he had come to his native Vizag on vacation, he met with an accident and lost his life. The motor accidents tribunal in Visakhapatnam made an erroneous estimate of the salary drawn by the victim and decided on the compensation accordingly . The parents felt let down by the tribunal and moved the high court seeking higher compensation.
 
 Justice Balayogi went through the records and concluded that Karim was a skilled worker. Had he been alive, he would have served for another 36 years and would have risen in career.
 
 The judge found fault with the tribunal for relying on baseless material and presumptions and assumptions for its unrealistic conclusions.
 
 The record of remittances through bank as shown by the parents of the deceased proves the fact that he was sending `10,000 every month from Saudi Arabia, Justice Balayogi said.
 
 The judge termed as perverse the observations made by the tribunal in its judgment that workers in Saudi Arabia were suffering a lot from lack of employment. “You cannot import your personal knowledge into the judgment without there being any pleadings by the parties,“ the judge told the tribunal.
