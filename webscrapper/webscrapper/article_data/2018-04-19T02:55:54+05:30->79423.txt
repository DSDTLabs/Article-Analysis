MUMBAI: The promoter of a   who allegedly cheated more than 500 people of at least Rs 5 crore was arrested recently from Navi Mumbai. The police said that the accused, Naresh Navale (35), a   resident, was absconding for more than a year. 

 Navale's company, S M Motors, had started a 'car rental business' and its office was located at  . 
 
  In January 2015, he floated a scheme inviting investors-most of them from middle-class families-to invest Rs 1.95 lakh each. "He said he would purchase swanky cars and give them on hire to five star hotels and big companies. Each investor was promised Rs 20,000 a month," said a police officer.
 
 "Initially, investors were paid handsome monthly returns which made the scheme gain popular among others. Navale also lured his investors by promising a commission of Rs 20,000 for each new investor introduced to the scheme," said an officer from the economic offences wing.
 
 Nearly two years after the scheme was launched, investors failed to get monthly returns. "When they went to the Bhandup office, they found it shut and Navale's phone was switched off," said the officer.
 
 Over time, at least 300 investors approached the police with complaints. Navale, who was booked under the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors Act, is now in police custody till April 23. 
 
 The police have attached three of his flats in Navi Mumbai. His high-end cars are likely to be confiscated soon, said a police officer.
