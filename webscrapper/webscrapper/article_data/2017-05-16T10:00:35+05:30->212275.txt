PUNE:   officials said on Monday that monsoon was unlikely to hit the Indian mainland (  coast) early, after the rain system reached south Andamans three days before the normal date.

 The officials expect a normal monsoon onset date over Kerala. A K Sahai, climate research and services, IMD, Pune, told TOI that an anti-cyclone in the lower levels over the   was hindering the further advancement of monsoon towards the west coast and Kerala. "Extended range fo recasts show that the anticyclone is expected to dissipate by May-end, leading to strengthening of the westerlies. This will translate in to a normal monsoon onset date over Kerala," said Sahai.
 
 Monsoon normally reaches Kerala on June 1. A late or early onset by a day or two is considered normal.The southwest monsoon had advanced into some parts of southeast Bay of Bengal, Nicobar Islands, south   and parts of north Andaman Sea on May 14, a day prior to its onset date. But there was no progress on Monday.
 
 On how monsoon is expected to fare this year, Sahai said with models showing weakening of   and strengthening of   Dipole conditions, hopes for rains close to 100% of the 50-year average were becoming more plausible.
