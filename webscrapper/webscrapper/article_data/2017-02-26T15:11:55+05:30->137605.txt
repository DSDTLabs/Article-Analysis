Celebrated Telugu writer, Dr  's bestselling 1984 novel,   will be made into a film. Hyderabadi documentary filmmaker  , who has acquired the film rights for the novel, is planning to start shooting for the film by June this year. 'Even three decades after it was written, the book still remains 
relevant. It's a brilliant piece of writing that follows an elderly man, who ventures into the forest looking for his pregnant pig, which is lost. The narrative, that begins at sunset and ends at sunrise, is filled with profound questions on life, death, existence and more,' shares the filmmaker, who aims to take his film to international festivals.
 'The success of films like Tithi has shown that there is a market for such films in the international film festival circuits. We might set the story either in Ontillu forest,  , where most of Reddy's novel are set or in Dhandakaranya, Adilabad. I will be attending the   this May and I'm hopeful of zeroing in on the crew by then. If all goes well, we will start shooting for in June,' says Satyanarayana, signing off.
