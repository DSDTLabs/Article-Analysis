PUNE: The woman and child development department will update the number of child marriages it has prevented under the   Prevention Act with the help of a software.

 The department will gather details from all police stations and link those to  , the software already in use for various other schemes.
 
 The   (PAC) had taken a dig at the department for the records not being updated and pointed out the poor implementation of the Child Marriage Prevention Act in Maharashtra. A report on the poor implementation of the statute was presented in the assembly last week. 
 
 The report mentioned that the Act came into force in 2007, but it was notified almost a year later in September 2008. The committee also highlighted the late appointment of the child marriage prevention officers.
 
 Secretary (woman and child development)   told TOI that the department would have a separate process to update the software with reports on prevention of child marriage cases sought from various districts. Anganwadi workers and assistants will report the cases and the police will furnish additional details.
 
 “We get reports from every district from officials and the police. A consolidated report, however, not in place. We are working on a software. It will be linked to our main software, Savitri, where information can be accessed immediately,’’Singhal said.
 
 On the delay in appointment of the child marriage prevention officers, she said they would have to have a local person who is within the community to work in the sector. “A child marriage prevention officer may not get to know all such cases. An anganwadi worker and helper will be of better help,’’ Singhal added.
 
 Statistics with the government revealed that 378 children in the age group of 10-12 years and 627 children aged 14 and above in the state have been married off in the past couple of years.
