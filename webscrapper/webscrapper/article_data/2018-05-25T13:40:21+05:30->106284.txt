Eight women have accused actor   of sexual harassment and misconduct. And so, Visa, the multinational financial services corporation, has decided to end its relationship with the 80-year-old. The actor, who has featured and given voice-overs for the company’s commercials over the years, will no longer be associated with it. In a statement issued by the company, they stated that they are aware of the allegations and will be suspending their marketing that features the actor.

 Freeman has previously apologised for his actions. He had said that anyone who knows him or has worked with him knows that he is not the sorts who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy or disrespected. The women revealed that Freeman has made remarks about their body and touched them inappropriately. A production assistant on the sets of the comedy-crime movie ‘Going In Style’ claimed that he repeatedly tried to lift her skirt and asked her if she was wearing an underwear. 
 
 In addition, Screen Actors Guild‐American Federation of Television and Radio Artists ( ) – the American labour union, which represents film and TV actors, journalists, radio personalities, recording artists, singers, voice actors, and other media professionals worldwide – is currently reviewing these claims as well. Incidentally, Freeman is the union’s choice for their upcoming Lifetime Achievement Award, which will be held this upcoming January. The union has released a statement that reads: ‘Any accused person has the right to due process, but it is our starting point to believe the courageous voices who come forward to report incidents of harassment.’
