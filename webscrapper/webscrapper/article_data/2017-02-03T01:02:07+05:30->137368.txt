NEW DELHI: When   shifted to a flat on the first floor in Mehrauli’s A-Block with this wife and two children from Sonepat, nobody from the colony imagined that he would be charged for waging a war against the nation.

 Sain masqueraded in the area as a businessman and teacher. However, many were surprised at how his fortune multiplied as within four years he allegedly purchased two more flats in the building costing Rs 20 lakh each, one for his brother and another for his parents. 
 
 “He had even asked me about the rates of the fourth floor saying he would buy it within a year,” said the owner of local property shop.
 
 The building’s residents recalled how the police raided Sain’s house and arrested him last week. On Thursday, the police raided the house again and seized equipment allegedly used in the SIM box fraud. He had set up an office with routers and electronic equipment in a room on the terrace to provide internet service.
 
 His father Matadin and mother Kausalya, who stay on the third floor, had told the neighbours that Sain worked in a Kolkata-based firm and had to travel frequently. He had also visited Afghanistan to work for a NATO-funded project.
 
 “I only knew that he worked for a telecom company and helped students prepare for IIT exams. He rarely discussed work, but I know he cannot be involved with a spy agency. He has been teaching ever since he passed out of Delhi University. He also has an office in Badarpur, but I’m not sure about what he did there,” said Saroj, Sain’s wife.
 
 Sain’s children, aged 8 and 10, study in a private school in south Delhi. “Cops must prove that he worked for a spy agency. He must have been framed by someone,” Saroj said. The family has planned to relocate to a relative’s house in Sonepat.
