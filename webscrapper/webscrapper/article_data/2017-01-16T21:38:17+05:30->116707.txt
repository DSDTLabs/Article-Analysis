Debutante   made her co-star   feel comfortable while filming some intimate scenes in upcoming Tamil action-thriller 'Enai Nokki Paayum Thota', a source said.

 "There are a few lip-lock scenes in the film. Although they have been shot aesthetically in a way that it doesn't look vulgar, Dhanush wasn't really comfortable doing these scenes. But it was   who made him feel comfortable," said a source from the film's unit.
 
 If not for Megha, the source said, these scenes would have been a pain to shoot.
 
 "If Megha didn't make Dhanush feel comfortable, it would have been very challenging for the makers to make these scenes look authentic," he said.
 
 In the film, Megha plays an actress who falls head over heels for Dhanush, to be seen as a college-goer. Directed by  , the film has music by Darbuka Siva, and is gearing up for February release.
