AHMEDABAD: The   government announced on Friday that the new common   (GDCR) for construction activities will come into effect from Saturday onwards. Till now, every city or local body in Gujarat had its own  . Now, there will be a common set of construction rules for all.

 The new rules will be applicable in all eight municipal corporations, 162 municipalities and areas governed by 23 urban development authorities in the state.
 
 While approving the new and improved GDCR, chief minister   said the new regulations will remove discrepancies and bring greater transparency and ‘ease of doing business’, said an official release.
 
 A height of up to 11 metres will now be permissible for houses in  , an earthquake-prone region, against up to 10 metres permitted earlier.
 
 To facilitate ‘stack parking’, where cars are parked one above another using a mechanical platform, the GDCR allows raising the height of the parking floor from the present 2.8 metres to 4.5 metres, said the release. To avoid congestion on roads near commercial complexes and malls, use of basements for loading and unloading of goods will be allowed under the GDCR, it added.
 
 For new houses on a plot smaller than 25 sq metres, the requirement of leaving a margin space all around will be waived. Such constructions will need to leave a margin space only on the side of the common road.
 
 To save water, the new rules mandate use of double-flush system in toilets instead of the single-flush system, said the release. The double-flush system has two different buttons or handles which release different amounts of water. (Agencies)
