While there is no standard definition, 
  is generally called high speed. 
 
 
 
 
 Sixteen countries have 
  . Of them, China boasts the world's longest network, with 27,000 km of such tracks. Japan, Spain, France and Germany have network of 1,000 km or more.
 
 
 
 
 Japan inaugurated its high-speed line between Tokyo and Osaka in 1964. The famous 
  could reach a speed of 210 kmph.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 Although in most countries these trains operate on dedicated tracks, many can also run on conventional tracks, but at reduced speeds. In fact, most high-speed trains run on conventional tracks similar to conventional gauge systems, but built with stronger material. 
 
 
 
 
 In addition to bullet trains, the high-speed rail system includes   trains. The word 'maglev' comes from 'magnetic levitation'. 
 
 
 
 
 Maglev trains use magnetic levitation, while conventional trains use wheels. Electromagnets raise the Maglev just above the tracks and create the thrust that moves it. Compared to conventional trains, Maglev have superior controls, but are very expensive to construct. 
 
 
 
 
 Currently, only three commercial Maglev systems are operational. They are located in Japan, China and South Korea. 
 
 
 
 
 The Shanghai Maglev has the highest run speed of 431 kmph, covering a 30.5-km distance in 7 minutes and 20 seconds.
