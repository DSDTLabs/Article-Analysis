BENGALURU: In a first, a Chinese delegation will be participating at  , and what the delegation may look for is already a topic of discussion.

 The Chinese delegation will have five officers from the air wing of the People's Liberation Army (PLA). The five, according to sources are: Maj Like Yiu, Col Huang Xinyang, Lt Col Joan Jiaji, Maj Gen Wang Qiang and Sr Col Gao Zhikuan.
 
 Terming this a major development, officials said that until now there was a cautious approach and now the government has become proactive.
 
 In the 2011 edition, Chinese journalist Li Miao had stormed into the defence minister's press conference and interrupted ASK Antony's (then defence minister) speech.
 
 Complaining about her struggles, she had said: “…Mr Antony, I coungratulate you on the show, which I think is a great success, but I want to tell you that I had not received passes until this morning and I still do not have passes to cover the remaining of the show, are we (China) really invited for this show?”
 
 Chinese had never participated in the show and with even the Chinese media never really entertained wholeheartedly, the delegation this time is likely to garner a lot of attention.
