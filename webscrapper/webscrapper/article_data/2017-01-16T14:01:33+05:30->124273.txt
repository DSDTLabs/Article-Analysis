PATNA: The state government, it seems, failed to learn lessons from past tragedies and ignored basic safety norms by not providing life jackets to people crossing the Ganga on country-made boats, which led to death of at least 24 persons on Saturday. This is the third incident in last four years when safety measures were ignored by the administration.

 The first incident took place on November 19, 2012 when 22 persons were killed on the banks of the Ganga at Adalat Ghat in a stampede. The incident had occurred when thousands of Chhath devotees were returning from the ghat after offering ‘argya’ to the setting sun. The makeshift bridge at Mahendru ghat had collapsed and the panicked devotees started running for safety, leading to the stampede. Of the 22 victims, 17 were children. More than 40 persons were injured in the stampede.
 
 In another incident, 32 people were killed and 29 injured in a stampede during ‘Ravan Vadh’ at   on October 3, 2014. The stampede was triggered by rumours that a live electric wire had fallen to the ground where people were standing. The then CM   had immediately transferred Patna divisional commissioner  , DIG Ajitabh Kumar, district magistrate Manish Kumar Verma and SSP Manu Maharaaj. However, all these officers were given a clean chit in an internal probe initiated by the government after the incident.
