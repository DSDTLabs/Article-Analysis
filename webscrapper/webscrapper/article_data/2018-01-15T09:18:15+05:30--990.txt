PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation ( ) will seek the merger of nine villages, including the   (IT) Park spread in Hinjewadi, Maan and Marunji, into its limits.

 The civic body will urge the Pune divisional commissioner to recommend to the state government the merger of these villages into its limits, Prakash Thakur, deputy director, town planning, PCMC, told TOI.
 
 If the merger is allowed, the area under PCMC will increase by 30%. The civic administration has prepared a proposal in this regard and it will come up for approval during the civic general body (GB) meeting on January 20. 
 
 As per the proposal, the civic body seeks to merge Gahunje, Jambe, Marunji, Hinjewadi, Maan, Nere, Sangawade, Dehu and Vitthalwadi villages into its limits. Incidentally, the civic GB had given its approval in February 2015 for the merger of Gahunje, Jambe, Marunji, Hinjewadi, Maan, Nere and   into its limits. This proposal was sent to the state government for approval in June 2015.
 
 In June 2016, the state urban development department (UDD) had told the civic body that there was no need for the merger of these seven villages into the PCMC limits as PMRDA had been formed through a notification in March 2015.
 
 “It is appropriate for the merger of seven villages on southern boundary and areas of Dehugaon and Vitthalwadi, excluding   limits up to Indrayani river, as it will ensure planned development of these villages. It will be possible for the PCMC administration to provide the residents of these villages with civic amenities,” stated the civic body’s proposal.
