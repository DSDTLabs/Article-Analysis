NEW DELHI:   leader Hanumantha   demanded on Tuesday that Mani Shankar Aiyar be expelled from the party for his remarks that India had not reciprocated to Pakistan’s push for resolving bilateral issues through dialogue. 

 As per reports from Pakistan, Aiyar is stated to have said the two countries needed “uninterrupted and uninterruptible” talks and that he was proud Pakistan had accepted the talks proposal but India had not. 
 
 He also said he received more love in Pakistan than in India. 
 
 With his statement coming just when Congress was seeking to corner BJP, ex-MP Rao said, “Aiyar should stop giving such remarks, he has already been suspended.” He added, “I am writing to   asking him to expel Aiyar.”
