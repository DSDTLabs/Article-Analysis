Panaji: The road for the construction of a Rs 350-crore superspecialty block within the premises of Goa medical college (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim was finally cleared on Saturday after the removal of a dozen encroachments on GMC land following a court order. A plot measuring about 5,000 sq meters had been earmarked for the superspecialty block which was sanctioned about three years ago under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Seva Yojna — a central government scheme for building health infrastructure. But, due to the encroachments, the state government could not make headway even after the Centre approved a sanction of Rs 150 crore as part of its share towards the expenditure to be incurred. The rest of the cost is to be borne by the state. On Sunday, health minister Vishwajit Rane said, “With encroachments removed, they can now move ahead in putting up the project. I’ve already spoken to the Union health secretary.”  Dr S M Bandekar, medical superintendent, GMC said a Parliamentary board members will be in Goa next month in relation to the project. The government has already announced that all existing superspecialties operating in GMC will be moved into the new block and a few new specialties including liver transplant will be introduced. The space freed up as a result would be put to use for other departments which are currently facing shortage of beds once the superspecialty block becomes operational, said a health official. The GMC premises is also set to house a regional cancer center — another central government project. Rane said they are in the final stages of signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Centre for setting up cancer center. “The Centre has already sanctioned the first instalment for the project and we will be receiving it shortly,” Rane said. The regional cancer center was sanctioned in 2013 but Rs 100 crore project did not materialize due to administrative delays.
