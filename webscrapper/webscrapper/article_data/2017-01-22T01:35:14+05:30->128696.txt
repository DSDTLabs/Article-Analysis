THANE: The talks of   between the   and   have apparently reached its final stage and the latter may take most from the Kalwa-Mumbra belt, as the parties are believed to have come to a consensus on whom to nominate to the 131 seats for fighting the Thane municipal  . 

 A meeting between senior leaders of the party led by Congress leader and MLC Narayan Rane and MLA Jitendra Awhad from the NCP was held on Saturday where a consensus was apparently reached about the distribution of seats. The parties have come to a mutual understanding of fielding the right candidate irrespective of the party especially in Thane city where they have a direct tussle with the Shiv Sena and the BJP.
 
 While the NCP is likely to field majority of seats from Kalwa and Mumbra areas, the parties are likely to reach a deadlock in selecting candidates from the city and the decision is likely to be taken by the senior party leaders. 
 
 Party insiders say the NCP is running strong in the Kalwa Mumbra belt, but needs more muscle in the lake city and even Diva where they could work out an arrangement to rout the saffron parties.
 
 “We had a fruitful meeting over the seat sharing for the Thane Municipal Elections. We have analyzed our strengths in each wards and have assigned the same between the two parties. There is a stalemate in few seats which would be ironed out soon by party seniors,” said a NCP functionary.
 
 It is believed the NCP is likely to get a lion’s share in the seat allocations as the party has had a better tally of corporators in the TMC house as compared to the Congress. 
 
 While around 34 NCP corporators were elected in the 2012 panel, Congress managed to get around 18 onboard. The situation was more or less the same in the 2007   also where the NCP managed to retain the upper hand in the tally.
