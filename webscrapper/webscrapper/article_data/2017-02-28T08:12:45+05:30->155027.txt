HYDERABAD: Burglars struck at the   at Jawaharnagar on Sunday night and decamped with eight silver plates and the hundi collection of the last three months. The   occurred between 12.30 am and 2 am. The thieves snapped the   cables and stole the digital recorder too.

 The   police said the burglars stole silver ornaments worth Rs 2 lakh. The hundi collection had not been counted for the last three months.
 
 “The thieves entered the temple by breaking the lock. Subsequently, they opened the door of the sanctum sanctorum and stole the silver plates. Then they broke the hundi and stole the donations made by devotees,” sub-inspector T Satyanarayana said. 
 
 According to police, the temple has a watchman, but he was sleeping in a room attached to the main hall. In the morning, the authorities found the lock broken, hundi prised open and the valuables missing. “It could be the handiwork of professional burglars. The way the culprits took away the DVR shows that it might not be the case of an insider’s role. We are investigating the case based on clues recovered from the scene of offence,” police said.
