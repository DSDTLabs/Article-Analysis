KOLKATA: The   (Class X) 2017 results declared on Saturday threw up several firsts, including the highest-ever aggregate score in the exam which was secured by a candidate who bagged a whopping 690 marks out of 700, thus surpassing all other previous records. And it was a girl — Anwesa Pain of Vivekananda Shiksha Niketan High School of Bankura — who achieved the feat, leading a pack of girl toppers. 

 After a gap of eight years, a girl topped the merit list, with 21 more among the top 10. This year also saw the highest ever pass percentage in the state board examination. From 82.74% in 2016, the pass percentage has jumped to 85.65% this year.
 
 On the flip side, grades in science subjects dropped sharply. The number of those securing above 90% in mathematics, life science and physical science slid significantly. 
 
 Among the districts, East Midnapore topped the chart with the highest pass percentage of 96.06%, followed by South 24 Parganas at 90.54% and West Midnapore with 90.18%. Kolkata secured the fifth spot in terms of successful candidates by managing to get 88.93%. In 2016, however, Kolkata stood second among districts in terms of successful candidates.
 
 “This was the first year when candidates appeared in   Pariksha on a new syllabus. A huge surge in marks shows that the curriculum is now more student friendly and that they have adopted the syllabus well,” said Kalyanmoy Ganguly, President of West Bengal Board of Secondary Education. When asked if introduction of multiple-choice-questions (MCQs) have aided students to secure a good score, Ganguly added, “MCQs require a lot of concentration and thorough reading of text books. This proves that candidates have successfully adopted to the new question paper format.”
 
 According to syllabus revamp committee chairman Avik Mazumdar who was instrumental in ushering in the new syllabus, three steps led to a high score in Madhyamik Pariksha 2017. “The questions were mostly asked from text books which required answering by students in a specific and to the point manner. Marks allotment was accordingly done so that higher marks can be secured. It was also a very positive approach from Madhyamik Board to instruct examiners and head examiners not to penalize candidates for wrong causes. MCQs and very short questions consisted of 40% of the question paper,” Mazumdar explained.
 
 This year 10,61,123 candidates took the Madhyamik exam out of whom 5,87,654 were girls and 4,73,469 were boys. However, in 2016 higher number of examinees - 11,44,097 appeared in the exam. The Madhyamik Board authorities however claimed in 2016, the end of old syllabus had triggered the jump of 1,16,407 candidates from 2015. "Usually, there is an average 15,000 increase in the number of Madhyamik examinees every year. But, if any academic year sees the end of old curriculum, there is always a huge jump in the number of examinees. That is what had happened in 2016," said Ganguly. A similar trend was noticed when there was a switchover from old to new syllabus in 2009-2010.
 
 This year the number of students scoring AA (above 90%) from Kolkata in subjects like Mathematics, Physical Science and Life Science dwindled while in History, Geography, first language and second language more candidates have bagged above 90%. 
 
 After Bipasha Pal in 2007 and Ronita Jana in 2008, there was a lull of eight long years before Anwesha Pyne from Vivekananda Shikshayatan High School again bagged the first rank in Madhyamik this year. Anwesha is now aiming to become a doctor and fulfill her deceased grandfather’s dream.
 
 “This year female Muslim candidates have outnumbered their male counterparts. While 161617 girls took the exam, number of boys were 98571. It indicates a positive trend amongst the female children of the minority community to join the main stream,” said the Madhyamik Board President. 
 
 Despite the trend of announcing the exam schedule of next year’s exam after publishing the results, this year Madhyamik Board has not mentioned the dates for 2018 exam. “We have few issues to settle and shall soon announce the dates,” Ganguly said. According to sources Panchayet polls next year may be one of the reason to postpone announcing the 2018 exam schedule.
