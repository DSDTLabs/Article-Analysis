Actress   took the podium during the  's March in Washington DC, to speak about females health issues. 

  
  
 Declaring that it was time for even a private person like herself to get personal, the 32-year-old star delivered a passionate speech about the role Planned Parenthood has played in her life from her first visit at the age of 15.
 
 "'Have you been to the gynecologist yet?' That was the question my mom asked me at 15 when I informed her about a change that I noticed in my body. I'm not the type to divulge facts about my personal life, but I feel that in the face of this current political climate, it is vital that we all make it our mission to get really personal."
 
 "So, yes, at 15, I had been to a gynecologist. I was living in   and had visited a Planned Parenthood there. It provided a safe place where I could be treated with gentle guidance," the 'Lucy' star said. 
 
 Johannson then made a public plea to the new US President  , saying she would support him if he would support her, her daughter, her family and all American women. "President Trump, I did not vote for you. That said, I respect that you are our President-elect and I want to be able to support you."
 
 "First, I ask that you support me, support my sister, support my mother, support my best friend and all of our girlfriends, support the men and women here today that are anxiously awaiting to see how your next moves may drastically affect their lives," she said. 
 
 The actress went on saying, "Support my daughter who may actually as a result of the appointments you have made grow up in a country that is moving backwards, not forwards, and who potentially may not have the right to make choices for her body and her future that your daughter Ivanka has been privileged to have."
