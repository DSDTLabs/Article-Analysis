CHANDIGARH: Haryana   Anil Vij on Monday said that private aided and   of the state would be made to sign a bond of Rs 10 crore so that they do not close down anytime they want to just like what Faridabad-based Goldfield Medical College did and leave the students at the crossroads.

 Vij said students had to face many adjustment difficulties after colleges closed down. He further said the matter of acquiring Goldfield Medical College was under consideration with chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and a decision would be taken soon.
 
 He further said the fee limit had been fixed for MBBS, BDS, BAMS, BHMS and other courses in private aided and unaided medical institutions. “This would bring uniformity in the fee structure and end financial exploitation of students,” he said.
 
 The health minister said the CM had given his approval to fix fees of private aided and unaided medical institutions. “Earlier,   used to take exorbitant fee from students, this will not happen in the future. Besides this, private universities and deemed universities will also be covered in the Haryana Private Health Sciences Educational Institutions (Regulations of Admission, Fixation of Fee and Maintenance of Educational Standards) Act, 2012,” said Vij.
