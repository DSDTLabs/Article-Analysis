VISAKHAPATNAM: Allegations of abusive behaviour and extramarital affairs against police officers have dented the image of the department in a big way in recent days.

 The recent suspension of a circle inspector of   police station is the latest incident in a series of incidents that showed the police department in poor light, with senior officers saying off record that the suspension is a major embarrassment for the department.
 
 Circle inspector B   was suspended by city police commissioner B Yoganand on Wednesday for allegedly harassing a woman. The woman had come to the police station to lodge a complaint and Venkata Rao allegedly struck a friendship with her and later began harassing her over phone, the woman had said in a WhatsApp complaint.
 
 The incident is the third in the last few months to embarass the police department. First was the sensational arrest of DSP-rank officer Dasari Ravibabu, who is the prime accused in the twin murders of former MPP Padmalatha and notorious rowdy-sheeter   last year. The DSP was in an extramarital relationship with Padmalatha and had hired rowdy-sheeter Gedela Raju to eliminate her. Later, with the help of two accomplices, he also eliminated Gedela Raju to avoid having to pay the contract sum of Rs 50 lakh, according to a confession he made to police.
 
 A few months after this incident, a four-member police team that had gone to Rajasthan to recover stolen gold was arrested by the   ( ) in that state for allegedly trying to conspire with the acccused. 
 
 According to the ACB, the policemen from AP reportedly partied with the accused and were planning to bring back some money in lieu of the stolen gold. The four policemen continue to be behind bars and their repeated bail pleas have either been rejected or deferred by the Rajasthan High Court.
