THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Talks are on in Delhi to find a new president for the Kerala Pradesh   Committee. AICC president   met senior Congress leader   on Thursday and will be meeting   on Friday to seek their opinion on selecting the new   chief.

 Even though Gandhi is insisting on choosing a leader below 50 years of age to the president’s post, the two senior leaders from the state have urged him to reconsider the decision.
 
 
 Both Chandy and   are of the opinion that senior leaders should be given due consideration while choosing the new president. Chandy is learnt to have also urged Gandhi that the president should be the one who can bring all the constituents under the UDF together.
 
 However, the AICC president is not interested in appointing the new president based on the group affiliations even though the ‘A’ group has staked claim for the post. Both the ‘I’ and ‘A’ groups have submitted a panel of names separately to the AICC to be considered for the post of the KPCC president.
 
 Sources said that Gandhi was not ready to accept this list and has urged the state leaders to arrive at a consensus on a single leader for the post. If they cannot find such a name then they have been asked to submit a panel of three names.
 
 It has become certain that the new KPCC chief will be announced only after the Chengannur bypoll, a suggestion made by Chandy. He told the AICC president that the present system should not be disturbed until the bypoll was over.
