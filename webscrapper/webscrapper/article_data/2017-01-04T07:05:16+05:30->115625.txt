AHMEDABAD: A few days after realtors associated with   (GIHED), an Ahmedabad chapter of Confederation of   Developers’ Association of India (CREDAI), boycotted upcoming Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit (VGGS)-2017, real estate developers from across the state have now decided to give the biennial summit next week a miss.

 Members of CREDAI-Gujarat, the state wing of the national body of real estate developers, in their meeting held on Tuesday agreed to extend their support to CREDAI-GIHED and decided to stay away from the summit to voice their concerns over delays in project plan approvals and non-cooperation from local authorities.
 
 “In order to protest against the indifferent approach of local authorities, our members have decided to boycott the summit and they will also not be inking any memorandums of understanding (MoUs) during the event,” said  , president, CREDAI-Gujarat.
 
 The Gujarat chapter of CREDAI members include real estate developers operating in cities such as Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, Rajkot, Mehsana, Bhavnagar, Palanpur and Gandhinagar. According to the real estate sector estimates, realtors from the state were expected to sign MoUs worth thousands of crores during VGGS-2017, which will be kicked off on January 10 by Prime Minister   in Gandhinagar.
