NAGPUR: District and additional sessions judge   on Saturday held Santosh   guilty of   of eight-year-old Yash Borkar at Khapri in June 2013. Patil had demanded a ransom of Rs2 lakh from Yash’s father. The court will pronounce the quantum of the punishment on Monday.

 Patil, who worked with a private company, had Yash stoned to death an later buried his body under concrete blocks. He had apparently made a call to Yash’s father after four hours of the murder demanding the ransom. Patil was later traced by Sonegaon police following which the boy’s body was recovered.
 
 Additional public prosecutor Vijay   said that the prosecution witnessed 27 witnesses including two minors to establish the theory of kidnap and murder. “Prosecution had proved the case beyond doubt corroborating the facts with witnesses and evidences following which the court nailed the accused as a convict in the case,’ said Kolhe.
 
 Despite being appointed as a special public prosecutor, Kolhe did not charge any professional fees from the government for his efforts. “The prosecution had also proved the fact that the victim’s body was discovered from the place shown to the police by the accused. The mud stained clothes of the victim too was discovered from the place of the crime,” he said. Kolhe indicated that the court may bracket the case in ‘rarest of the rare’ category.
