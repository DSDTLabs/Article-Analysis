Pune: Nearly 500 restaurants in Pune and rural areas have shut shop indefinitely following the Supreme Court’s highway liquor ban.

 Sources from the state excise department told TOI that the ban has made it impossible for these restaurants to operate, as most of them depended on liquor sales for revenue.
 
 The excise department had on April 1 sealed 1,600 licences of vends and permit rooms along the highways in Pune district, following the apex court verdict banning liquor shops, permit rooms and bars within 500m of national and state highways.
 
 Licences of all liquor-serving establishments within the 500m radius along highways passing through the city, like Deccan Gymkhana, Jangli Maharaj Road and Swargate, were also sealed.
 
 An excise department official told TOI that nearly 300 restaurants and bars in the city voluntarily downed their shutters, as it was no longer viable for them to run without serving liquor. “In the rural areas, the number is 200,” the official said.
 
 The official reiterated Pune collector Saurabh Rao’s recent assertion that a proposal for denotification of the highways passing through the city was sent to the state government. Denotification is the only way out for the affected establishments. “The state highways in Pune city are practically under the ambit of the   (PMC), though not on paper. PMC takes care of the maintenance of these highways, hence they are not highways but district roads,” the official said. 
 
 Ganesh Shetty, president of the Pune Restaurant And Hoteliers’ Association ( ), pegged the losses incurred by the Pune restaurant industry at Rs12 crore.
 
 The highways where liquor licences were sealed include Ahmednagar Road, Mumbai-Bengaluru Road, Solapur Road, Katraj-Dehu Road, Katraj-Mumbai Road and Pune-Saswad Road, among others.
