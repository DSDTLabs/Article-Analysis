Surat: Controversies have become synonymous with Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT) ever since two female students filed complaints of sexual harassment against two male associate professors in 2015. 

 The associate professors were found guilty of sexual harassment and dismissed and in-charge registrar and director made to leave the institute, which has since been witnessing some or the other unfortunate incident at regular intervals. Three students ended their lives in the hostels on the campus and now a sexual harassment allegation has been levelled against a daily wage employee of the institute, which not in the too distant past used to witness ragging cases. 
 
 Urvashi Gaekwad (20), daughter of a fire brigade employee of Surat, was found hanging in her room in April 2016. It is still not known why this MSc student committed suicide. Kancham Shamukha Reddy (21), a BTech student, was found hanging under mysterious circumstances in the common bathroom of the hostel building within five months of Urvashi’s suicide. In February 2017, Chirag Agarwal (20), a BTech student was found hanging in his hostel room on the campus.
 
 SVNIT was adjudged second in the country among the educational institutes in 2016, but slipped to 50th position in 2017. 
 
 In-charge registrar D P Vakhariya was not available for his comments. SVNIT director S R Gandhi said, “The inquiry is continuing in the fresh sexual harassment complaint. It will be premature on my part to comment.”
