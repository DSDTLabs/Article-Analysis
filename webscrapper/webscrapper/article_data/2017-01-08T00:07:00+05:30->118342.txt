KOLHAPUR: It is everyone’s responsibility in society to promote   and help make the “Mission   Kolhapur” initiative a success, additional district collector   said on Thursday.

 He was speaking at a workshop organised by the district administration in association with the district information office for mediapersons in Panhala .
 
 The additional district collector said the cashless system needs to be promoted at the village level too, and the government will make available various facilities. The availability of point of sale (PoS) terminals is one of the important aspects of this initiative, he said.
 
 “Citizens too need to come forward to learn about the cashless system. We are taking assistance from everybody — administration, bank officials and citizens, especially youths, are all part of it,” said Katkar.
 
 Satish Lalit, deputy director of divisional information office, said cashless system is rather easy and Prime Minister   has taken a historic decision, which will yield good results.
 
  representative S S Shinde gave information on various cards and apps that can be used for cashless transactions, including the recently launched Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) app.
