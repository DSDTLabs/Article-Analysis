CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government on Friday gave the go-ahead for integrated   for planting clonal-eucalyptus and poplar plants along with sweet oranges. In a meeting with officials of the horticulture department at  , the chief minister   asked the additional chief secretary (horticulture)   to bring a formal proposal in this regard.

 The proposed scheme would cover 160 hectares of sweet orange plantation and 6,000 hectares under agro-forestry during 2017-18. For this purpose, 50 lakh eucalyptus and poplar clonal plants would be supplied to the farmers by the forest department as a pilot, to be further extended if found to be successful. It is also proposed to supply sweet orange plants free of cost under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), besides including drip irrigation for sweet orange cultivation under RKVY, according to an official spokesperson.
 
 Amarinder directed the ACS (horticulture) to make this programme time-bound so that the entire schedule of plantation based on the inter-cropping models is implemented to promote horticulture. 
 
 As there was no income till the fourth year under eucalyptus model and highly reduced income from intercrops up to the sixth year under poplar model, the scheme envisages that the government should take up with Punjab National Bank, under the sanctioned scheme of National Bank For Agriculture And Rural Development (NABARD), to provide special incentive for drip irrigation. It was also proposed that the state government may consider enhancing its share of subsidy on drip irrigation from 35% to 55% along with 45% centre subsidy.
 
 As per plan, 15,000 plants of sweet oranges would be planted initially during 2017-18, 80,000 in 2018-19, 2 lakh in 2019-2020, 4 lakh in 2020-21 and 7 lakh by 2021-2022.
