CUTTACK: With summer holidays in full swing, the city's parks are in great demand. Yet children and elders alike cannot seem to be able to make the most of the parks as most of them are in a deplorable condition. 

 Even though the   (CMC) had announced that it will renovate parks in a phase-wise manner under the Centre-sponsored Atal   (AMRUT), the project has been progressing at a very slow pace. So far, the civic body has taken up renovation work in only three parks (Biswanath Pandit Park at Khannagar, Akshaya Mohanty Park at Kanika Chhak, Chandan Pokhari Park near the CMC office) out of the 38 parks in the city.
 
 Citizens allege that due to poor maintenance by the CMC, a majority of the parks in the city can only boast of rusted swings, defunct fountains, broken benches and wrecked lights. "There is an acute shortage of playgrounds in the city which has turned into a concrete jungle. There is absolutely no place for children to play outdoor games," said Mamata Bisoyi, a mother of two.
 
 CMC sources said under AMRUT the civic body has been allocated over Rs 6 crore in the last three years for development of parks in the city. As per the guidelines of the AMRUT project, the parks will be equipped with toilets and drinking water facilities. The parks' green cover will also be increased and a special jogging track will be created. The broken and rusted amusement rides will be replaced and measures will be taken to make the parks attractive.
 
 CMC officials claim that measures are being taken to renovate the parks at the earliest. "Renovation of the three parks are in their final stage. We have identified 22 popular parks which will be restored and beautified at the earliest," said the CMC's engineer, D R Tripathy.
