GURUGRAM: A Delhi-based man, who used to work for an outsourcing firm in Gurgaon, has been booked for fraudulently utilising   to book air tickets worth Rs 1.11 lakh for his friends.

 After conducting a preliminary investigation, Gurgaon police said Avinash, a resident of Molarband Extension in Delhi, used to work at Udyog Vihar-based Radical Minds Technologies, which provides travel management services like ticket bookings, to   group — an online travel portal. 
 
 In January, he had booked seven flight tickets in the name of his friends using company money for a trip to Goa on January 12. And, he stopped coming to work from the next day.
 
 In his complaint filed at the Udyog Vihar police station in January, Ratan Kumawat, the head of finance and accounts at Radical Minds, said Avinash, who had joined the outsourcing firm in July last year, used to book train and flight tickets for Ibibo clients and thus, had access to the company accounts.
 
 Kumawat also named in his complaint seven people — Nicky, Vikki Nirmaaan, Rishi Pal, Rahual Rawat, Aman Saraswat, Rajiv Sharma and Kavish Kawatara — on whose names the tickets were booked, accusing them of being hand in glove with Avinash. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, Kumawat said, “During an internal inquiry, we found out that Avinash had come to office on January 12, booked the tickets for a trip to Goa the same day and stopped coming to work from January 13. His brother told us that Avinash did travel to Goa, but his tickets (to and fro) were not booked with the company funds. Also, despite booking the tickets, only two of the seven people ultimately went to Goa while the rest did not go.”
 
 Inspector Arjun Dev, station house officer, Udyog Vihar police station, said an FIR had been registered under relevant sections of the IPC and the Information Technology Act. “The matter is being investigated by the Gurgaon police. But no arrest has been made so far,” inspector Arjun Dev said.
