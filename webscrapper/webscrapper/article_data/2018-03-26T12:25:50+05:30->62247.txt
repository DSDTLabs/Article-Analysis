DEHRADUN: The district court complex in Dehradun that was to be completed by April 11, will miss its deadline yet again due to fund shortage.
 
  The project that dates back to 2015 has been extended by another year due to lack of funds.
  
  The state government had tied up with the   ( ) for constructing the brand new multistory building with 58 courtrooms, four family courts, conference hall, a guest house and other utilities and as per the plan the existing courts would have shifted in the phased manner before April this year.
  
  The district court complex that is supposed to cater to the entire state is only 30%complete.
  Finance department sources said that the total project costs over Rs 206 crore and only Rs 30 crore has been released. Fund clearance is stuck as utility certificates have not been submitted to the central government. “The money would be released after the utility certificates are cleared by the central government and that is not going to happen in another month,” a finance department official said.
  
  The official added that the NBCC has given up on the project. The official said, “Work worth Rs 27 crore has been done but payments have not been made yet and that has stalled the construction work.” 
  The matter of sluggish fund release has reached the office of finance minister   who told TOI that he was getting the entire file reviewed. Pant said, “It is a Centre-funded project and I am looking into the details of the spending of the previous funds released.”
  
  Meanwhile, the delay in the completion of the new courts complex has made lawyers anxious as the existing unit lacks facilities such as parking, better room and other utilities.
  A lawyer  , said, “Everyone thought that the new building would end miseries faced by lawyers, visitors and litigants but given the tardy pace of work, the new court complex would take another year to complete.”
