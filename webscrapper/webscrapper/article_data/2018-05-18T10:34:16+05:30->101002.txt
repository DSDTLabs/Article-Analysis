LUCKNOW: Deputy chief minister   removed Rajan Mittal from the post of managing director in   (UPSBCL) following his widespread criticism over laxity that led to Varanasi tragedy but still retained him on the same post in   (UPRNN).

 
 Maurya, who is also minister of PWD, the parent department of UPSBCL and UPRNN, and is the ex-officio chairman of both, divested Mittal of the charge of MD, UPSBCL and replaced him with  , chief engineer (externally aided projects) in PWD.
 
 Mittal had been holding the charge of MD of both UPSBCL and UPRNN. Ever since the Varanasi tragedy took place, the government was being targeted for posting tainted Mittal as UPSBCL MD even though he had been shunted out earlier from the same post over irregularities.
 
 The decision to sack him as MD of one corporation for laxity and still allow him to continue as administrative head of the other punctures the rationale behind divesting him of charges in bridge corporation.
 
 Mittalâ€™s failure in preventing Varanasi tragedy even though he claims to have sounded multiple alerts to the team expose that he lacks the leadership and authority to get his orders implemented. The decision of letting him continue as UPRNN MD also comes under the cloud hence.
 
 Maurya also announced a list of officers of special secretary and joint secretary ranks who would be nodal officers on days of   when the deputy CM meets public to hear and redress their grievances.
