CHENNAI:   became the first Indian paddler to win the men's singles gold in the Chile Open beating compatriot   4-2 (8-11, 13-11, 11-6, 11-9, 4-11, 11-7) on Sunday.

 He then went on to win the doubles with Amalraj to complete a double in  .
 
 Ghosh became the third Indian to win a men's singles title at an ITTF Challenge Series or ITTF World Tour tournament. Chennai's   was the first to make it, winning the Egypt Open beating Hong Kong's Li Ching in the title clash in 2010, while another Chennai lad   claimed the gold, defeating   in the ITTF World Tour Belgian Open last year.
 
 "I had to start the sixth game aggressively because I kept thinking about my first big international title. It was hard to win against Amalraj. It took some time to adapt to the ball, harder than the one we use at home, before imparting more power but less spin," said an elated Ghosh after the win.
 
 For Ghosh, who has been playing club table tennis abroad for a long time, this win comes as a huge boost. Currently, he is ranked 84 in the world and he believes this victory will take him up further. "Now I'm the third to win such a tournament. I'm really happy. But being the top seed, I felt the pressure all through," he added.
 
 The No. 3 seed Amalraj began brilliantly in the final, winning the first game but lost a close second which swung the momentum towards Ghosh. It was important for Amalraj to hold his nerves and make a turnaround in the remaining games but the Chennai lad wasted a golden chance of coming back into the fourth game. Though he won the fifth game, it was not enough to stop Ghosh from running away with the title.
 
 Amalraj was happy to win the doubles gold and said: "For me, it was the first final and first gold. In more than 10 years of my international career, it has always been China, Japan or Germany. Now that India has won, it is good for the future of table tennis in the country," said Amalraj.
