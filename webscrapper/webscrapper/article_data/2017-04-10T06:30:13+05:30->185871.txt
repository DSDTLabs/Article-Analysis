INDORE: Vegetable prices have started to climb due to limited supplies in summer months. Supplies to the city’s wholesale market from nearby villages and neighboring states have slowed down, putting pressure on green  .

 The rise in transportation costs of vegetables from nearby areas to Indore has contributed to the rise in prices.
 
 Whole sale vegetable suppliers from Choithram vegetable market said prices of green vegetables are going up and would further rise with the mercury going up.
 
 Mohan Singh Goud, president, Devi Ahilyabai Holker Harisabzi Vayapari and   said, “Prices of bhindi and other green vegetables have gone up in the past few days. The supply of vegetables reduces in summer months.”
 
 In Indore, green vegetables come from nearby villages and states such as Maharashtra and Gujarat, wholesale vegetable sellers said.
 
 Vegetable dealers said the production of greens drops in summers due to inadequate water and reduced yield.
 
 They said proximity to Nimar and Mandleshwar has prevented any sharp rise in vegetable prices in April as supply of vegetables from these areas is still good.
 
 Goud said, “These areas contribute a major share in total vegetable supply in Indore. Production and supply is still satisfactory from these regions, helping prices to remain stable.”
 
 Vegetable suppliers said prices are expected to rise further in the coming weeks as supply will dry up further creating a shortage in the local market.
 
 Vegetable prices have risen by about 8 per cent in the retail market, wholesalers said.
 
 Piyush Tiwari, a vegetable supplier in the retail market said, “Retail prices have jumped higher in proportion to whole sale prices because transportation costs have increased.”
 
 Vegetable sellers said in summers the shelf life of vegetables reduce drastically, putting more pressure on vegetable prices.
 
 “Cost of preserving vegetables also increases in summers as vegetables get spoiled early,” Tiwari said.
