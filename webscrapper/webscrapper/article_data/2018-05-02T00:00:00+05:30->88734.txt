What’s the best way to unwind after a long week of work? For starters, you can get your friends together and hit the dance floor. At least, that’s what these workaholics did over the weekend — catch up with their loved ones over some short eats and drink, and shake a leg to some upbeat tunes, churned out by the DJ. While Shruthi and Aashika twinned in black, Shirin and Midhu kept it cool and casual in shades of white. We spotted Akshata, Dyson and Ram indulging in some fun banter. Looks like the evening was dedicated more to friends, what with Vanchitha and Malavika, and Jatin, Klinton and Johan giving us some major BFF goals!
