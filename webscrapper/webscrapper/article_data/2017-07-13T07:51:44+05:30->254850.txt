RAJKOT: On the anniversary of   incident, there was another brutal attack on Dalits by upper caste members in Mevasa village of Kalyanpur taluka in   district on Tuesday evening. Four Dalit men were injured after a mob of over 20 people from the upper caste opened fire with country-made guns over a land dispute. 

 The injured -   (21),   (23), Rahul Rathod (18) and   (35) - who own about 32 bigha land on the outskirts of Mevasa village were attacked by a group of men led by Masri Ahir while they were working in the farm. Police said the Rathods and Ahir were at loggerheads over ownership of the land since quite some time. They have had altercations over the issue earlier.
 
 "On Tuesday, Ahir with his men fired over a dozen rounds on the Dalits when they were working in the farm. Nobody was critically injured, but four people have sustained bullet injuries," deputy superintendent of police SC/SC cell J K Patel told TOI.
 
 After firing at the Rathods the accused escaped from the spot. The injured were first rushed to Khambhalia civil hospital and later shifted to Jamnagar's GG Hospital for treatment. The victims have suffered injuries on the arm, legs, shoulder and other parts of the body, but none of them is critical, said Patel.
 
 An FIR was lodged by Kiran and others against Ahir and 20 others for attempt to murder and under the Arms Act. The accused have escaped from the village and a manhunt was launched to nab them, added Patel.
