PATNA: State DGP   on Thursday asked the policemen to handle cases pertaining to children and women more sensitively.

 Speaking at a function to mark the inauguration of   2018 at Adhiveshan Bhavan here, Thakur said, “In some cases, children committing crime are not being sent to the juvenile justice board. If a young person lands in jail in the company of notorious criminal, he can also become a notorious criminal,” Thakur said. 
 
 The DGP asked the policmen to turn friendlier towards people, spend time in the field and develop community policing. “This will help in changing the perception of policemen in people’s eyes. You will also be able to develop more sources,” he said.
 
 Thakur appreciated the efforts of anti-terrorism squad (ATS) of state police, which was formed a year ago. “These days, even criminals are using technology. Policemen should strive to be a step ahead of them,” the DGP added.
 
 Bihar Police Week started on Thursday with indoor classes on 14 different topics, such as investigating interstate liquor smuggling racket, emerging security scenario in Bihar, developing soft skills, child labour and human trafficking, public grievance redressal mechanism and changing patterns of crime.
 
 The weeklong programme will witness band show, mounted police show, dog show and street plays on prohibition, dowry and child marriage.
