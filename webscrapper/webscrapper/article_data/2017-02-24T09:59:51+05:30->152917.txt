PUNE: After Suresh Kalmadi’s exit from the political scene, the   in Pune has struggled to find a credible face that would keep party flock together. The present city chief Ramesh Bagwe, once a close aide of Kalmadi and now a loyalist of former CM Ashok Chavan, couldn’t galvanize the party workers as other leaders did not cooperate with him. 

 Youth leader Vishwajeet Kadam also tried his best to mobilise the party workers, but faced a similar problem like Bagwe. Local party seniors are apprehensive of giving Kadam a free hand, believing that he will upstage them in future. Abhay Chhajed, who held the post of party chief, has now stepped out of the organisational setup and also decided not to contest the  .
 
 “The Congress in Pune is full of backdoor leaders who have entered the state legislative council and have now taken front seats in the city unit. They want to run the city unit despite having no mass base. They are seen at the Congress office only when state or central leaders come visiting. The state unit must ask these leaders to sit at home or the party will be finished in future,” a senior party leader said.
 
 Bagwe appeared confident that the party would regroup. “The Congress is not dependent on any one local leader. We have a mass leadership at work under the guidance of Rahul and Sonia Gandhi,” he said.
 
 The Congress is virtually headless in  . Senior party leader Bhausaheb Bhoir joined the NCP just ahead of polls. City chief Sachin Sathe and others have failed to provide the required leadership to the party cadre and workers. Of the 14 Congress corporators who got elected in the 2012 civic polls, seven have quit to join the NCP.
