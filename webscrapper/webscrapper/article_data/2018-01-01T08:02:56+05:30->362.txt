HYDERABAD: Clean water bodies and lakes is still a distant dream for denizens as locals at   in   complained of garbage dumping and sewage water discharge in the lake. Several local residents of Alwal explained how sewage water being discharged into the lake, is resulting in mosquito menace. “The rancid smell is also haunting us,” said K Srinivas Varma, general secretary, Loksatta Greater Hyderabad and a resident of Alwal.

 Apart from the mosquito menace, garbage dump near the lake has turned out as an eyesore to locals. The garbage is being discharged into the water body through nalas and manual dumping.
 
 Locals said that the   (GHMC) officials are not taking any action against people who are the dumping garbage near the water body.
 
 “The civic body should take strict action against people polluting the water body,” said a resident living near China Rayudu Cheruvu Lake.
 
 Another grievance pertaining to a water body was aired by SOUL NGO on Sunday. Activists demanded the demolition of a makeshift crematorium near the   Kunta lake. They said encroachers, ignoring a high court stay order, have been constructing a crematorium with support of local politicians.
 
 “Funeral pyres constructed inside the Yerra kunta, inspite of High Court stay orders with open support from   and other politicians officials,” said  , an activist.
