PANAJI: A day after chief minister Manohar Parrikar announced that 1,000-odd   vendor licences will be renewed, the state government also roped in the public works department to identify stretches of highways passing through the state that can be denotified to circumvent the apex court’s order banning sale of liquor within 500m of state and national highways. 

 “The order has been issued and the file has been received by the department. We will take the necessary action tomorrow,” a senior official from the excise department said. 
 
  Goa   president, Dattaprasad Naik, said that the renewal should be complete within 3-4 days. 
 
 A joint meeting addressed by the Liquor Traders Association and Bar and Restaurant Owners’ Association, on Wednesday, ended with protest from various members who demanded a quick solution to their problem and slammed leaders of both associations for doing nothing in the last three months.
