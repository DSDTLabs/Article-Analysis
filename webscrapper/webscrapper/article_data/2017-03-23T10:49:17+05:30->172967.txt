JAMSHEDPUR: In a bid to ensure the completion of the ongoing bridge construction over   (which is a  ) ahead of monsoon, the state government is likely to take up the proposal of acquiring the remaining three kilometre stretch of land on market rate in the cabinet soon. 

 Saryu Rai, food, consumer and parliamentary affairs minister has instructed state road construction department principal secretary Mastram Meena to formulate a draft in this regard and table it for cabinet approval at the earliest. 
 
 Rai said the purpose of the exercise is to speed up the construction work and make the under-construction bridge operational, to check the rush of heavy commercial vehicles on Jai Prakash Setu (popularly referred to as Mango bridge) on Subernarekha during the rainy season.
 
 "Given that land losers will have to be compensated on present market price, the department concerned has been asked to work out the calculations and furnish the draft for approval at the earliest," Rai said.
 
 The 252 metre-long four lane bridge with two carriageways, each with a width of 8.5 metres, linking Sonari (in Jamshedpur block of East Singbhum) to Kanderbera (in Chandil block of Seraikela Kharswan), aims to reduce the travel time by 45 minutes between Steel city and Ranchi.
 
 Being built at an estimated cost of Rs 42 crore, the construction work which commenced in March 2016, is expected to get completed by the end of the year. 
 
 "By the time the monsoon arrives, one lane of the bridge will get completed but the issue is with the approach road that links Kanderbera with NH-33. For this, a three kilometre stretch of land is required on immediate basis to construct the road," an official of the road construction department, Jamshedpur circle, said. 
 
 Out of the 6km stretch required for the approach road work on 3km is complete while remaining 3km land is required to finish the approach path.
 
 The project is being built on engineering, procurement and construction mode.
