Mangaluru: He is hailed in judicial circles for being a no-nonsense judge, who goes purely on merit of the case. His ability to soak in pressure in high profile cases, be it charges of rioting against then   in Hubballi Idgah Maidan case in 2004 or convicting then Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa in the disproportionate assets case, is widely acclaimed. Yet none of this seems to faze John Michael D’Cunha, additional judge,  .

 This came to the fore at a felicitation function organized by his alma mater, SDM Law College and Centre for   in Law, on Sunday. None other than Justice S Abdul Nazeer, judge, Supreme Court and also an alumnus of the college, made a direct reference to the rising stock of ‘Cunha’ following his ‘sensation’ (of convicting Jayalalithaa) in Karnataka. “Your name is being discussed in Delhi circles also,” Justice Nazeer told his junior.
 
 When Justices A S Bopanna and A N Venugopala Gowda, judges of Karnataka High Court, made a glowing reference to Cunha, as they fondly referred to him, Justice Michael D’Cunha was humble in reflection. When his turn to reply to the felicitation came, Justice D’Cunha true to his nature, merely said he had just done his job. “I have done what any judge is required to do,” he said, without once referring directly to the case that drew national spotlight on him.
 
 Hailing from a humble background in Gurupur-Kaikamba in Mangaluru taluk, Justice D’Cunha, added, “I have dispensed justice (based on evidence) presented to me. It (convicting Jayalalithaa) is not an achievement at all. It is part of justice dispensation system. If the society has accepted it (the verdict), I take it with a sense of gratitude.” His measured approach could also be gauged from the fact that not once did he mention to SC upholding his original judgement later.
