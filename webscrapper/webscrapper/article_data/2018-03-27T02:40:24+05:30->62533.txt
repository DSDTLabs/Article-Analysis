KOLKATA: At least two people died and an unspecified number, including police personnel, were injured on Monday as the administration struggled to quell violence in the wake of   processions across West  . 

 
 West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee asked police to revoke permission for processions and vowed action against the perpetrators of violence.
 
 “Did Lord Ram fight Ravan with swords? It doesn’t matter to me whether a Hindu or a Muslim is the victim of violence. The victim, to me, is a human being. These people have no right to enter localities of other communities, spreading panic with firearms and swords. They are maligning the image of Ram,” she said, adding: “It goes against our culture.” The Bengal CM, without naming BJP, referred to a party that was “thinking of dominating the country with this sort of religion”.
 
 State DGP Surajit Kar Purakayastha informed Banerjee that police had gathered video clips and other evidence of people carrying dangerous weapons in Ram Navami rallies that would enable them to take strong action under the Arms Act. 
 
 Monday’s deaths in Raniganj and Kakinara followed one in Purulia on Sunday. “No more rallies from today, there is no permission for rallies,” Banerjee said on Monday. She sounded a warning against the “politics of religion”. “Did Ram ever ask his followers to carry pistols?” the CM asked. Banerjee ordered “all superintendents of police and other police officers” present at the meeting “to go back to their areas and take charge”. 
 
 The West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights summoned two Purulia Bajrang Dal activists for handing over arms to children and getting them to join Sunday’s rally, from where the violence started.
