PUNE: The state education department's initiative to upload selfies of all students with   on the department's official website has hit a  . 

 Officials claim that the mobile application, which will help take pictures and upload them, is still in a testing phase and would be available from next Monday. The plan to link students' Aadhaar card numbers with corresponding selfies will also take more time, said officials.
 
 The scheme, which aims to monitor out-of-school children, was to start on January 2. 
 
 According to the government resolution (GR) issued in November last year, a teacher must take selfies among groups of 10 students. Along with the picture, students' names and corresponding Aadhaar card numbers also have to be uploaded on the Saral website. After following the exercise for the first two Mondays, the class teacher was to upload selfies only with out-of-school children who were readmitted to the school and students whose attendance was considerably low.
 
 "As of now, the testing phase is on. The app will have a camera which needs to be integrated with the user's mobile camera and the pictures taken will be uploaded on the Saral website, which is the official website of the department," said director of Balbharati Sunil Magar, who has been closely associated with Saral.
 
 While the GR has been out a long time, there has been no communication with the teachers about the same. 
 
 Talking about linking Aadhaar numbers with the selfies, Magar said that it will not be done simultaneously as announced previously. 
 
 Once the Aadhaar card numbers are linked, every second week, teachers will have to send a report on students with less attendance and those who were previously out-of-school to higher officials. As per the GR, a separate action plan has to be made on how to integrate the students so that they do not miss out on school days.
