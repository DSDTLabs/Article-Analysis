 "He (Kumar) even accused Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi for the disruption in the House by naming them. He has been repeating this accusation for all these days.
 
 "The minister was deliberately misleading the house by naming the Congress leadership, thereby hiding the fact that it was the government who was actually stopping any kind of discussion on these issues including the no confidence motion," Venugopal said in his notice.
 
 The Congress has been demanding a discussion on the no confidence motion moved by its leader in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge.
 
 Some other parties have also given separate notices of no confidence against the council of ministers.
