Tirupur: After the parents of a 19-year-old girl raised suspicion over her death in Bangladesh, the Tirupur rural police have sent a report to the state government seeking further action. Police sources said that they may approach the Bangladesh embassy for assistance. The victim, M Poornima Devi, daughter of U Muruganandham and Selva Gomathi of Attayampalayam near Avinashi, had fallen in love with Rimu Sheikh of South 24 Parganas district in West Bengal when she was working in a garment factory in the dollar city, police sources said. She was a minor when she eloped with Rimu. Though her parents filed a missing complaint, they withdrew it after Poornima informed them that she had married Rimu and was leading a happy life. In his complaint, Muruganandham, said, “Though we were told that our daughter and husband settled in West Bengal, they went to Bangladesh. Along with our daughter, Rimu also used to speak to us over phone. But, on February 9, he informed us that Poornima died due to an illness. Since then he has stopped picking up our calls. So, we suspect that there could be foul play behind the death of our daughter.” A senior police officer told TOI that he conducted inquiries with Rimu over phone. “He said that he was residing 10-15km away from Dhaka and was operating an autorickshaw. According to him, Poornima was three-month pregnant when she died due to an illness. As he feared that his life would be in danger if he brought her body to Tirupur, he conducted the burial in Bangladesh. The preliminary inquiry ruled out foul play as the parents were in constant touch with the girl, who did not show any signs of discomfort. But, a detailed investigations is needed to bring out the truth,” he said. Police also plan to send personnel to the native place of Rimu.
