WASHINGTON: After leaving the   nuclear deal,   wants to move forward by offering to build a "coalition" to counter the multiple "threats" posed by the Tehran regime -- but Europeans intent on saving the 2015 accord may thwart that effort.

 
 US Secretary of State Mike   on Monday will unveil a new "diplomatic roadmap" for Iran -- how   plans to "address the totality of Iran's threats," according to the State Department's director of policy planning, Brian  .
 
 Washington is looking to draft a "new security architecture and a better security framework, a better deal," Hook told reporters ahead of the speech, the first major policy address by Pompeo since he became America's top diplomat.
 
 "The US will be working hard to put together a coalition," State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said, flagging Washington's bid for a multilateral approach after its unilateral withdrawal from the accord.
 
 President Donald Trump has long trashed the deal with Iran -- concluded under his predecessor Barack Obama, together with Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia -- saying it did not do enough to curtail Tehran's nuclear ambitions.
 
 The Republican leader also said it did not go far enough in restricting Iran's ballistic missile program, or its intervention in regional conflicts from Yemen to Iraq and Syria. "We need a new -- a framework that's going to address the totality of Iran's threats," Hook said.
 
 So far, the guidelines of this new strategy are unclear.
 
 The big unknown is whether European leaders, who were bitterly disappointed by Trump's decision to ditch the deal, would be willing to return to talks with his administration any time soon.
