  Even though he was the only performer on stage, the National Award-winning actor was able to smoothly conjure up imagery of 1980s’ Lucknow’s bylanes, the sprawling haveli, and even get into the skin of each of the characters.

  Pankaj, a Gurgaon resident, who came to watch the performance, said, “Even though he was the only man on stage, it was so emotional. We could feel and visualize every scene from the story and every character like they were real. It was incredible.” For many in the audience, it was their first experience watching a one-performer play. Tina, another audience member, told us, “It was so beautiful to see the emotions of so many diverse characters reach us from just one man. It was my first time seeing something like this.” The audience gave the performance a standing ovation as it ended and a moved Kapur responded by saying, “I must say you have been a wonderful audience. You have reacted very well to every nuance of the performance. Thank you!”
