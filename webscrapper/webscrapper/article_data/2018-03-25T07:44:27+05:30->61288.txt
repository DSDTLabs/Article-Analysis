LUCKNOW: By questioning   for raising the 1995 UP   episode of murderous attack on her by   members, Mayawati disassociated SP chief Akhilesh Yadav from the assault case and further indicated that she could be in as much danger under current BJP government.

 “When they are trying to remind people of this episode, BJP should also remember its own poisonous and casteist behaviour towards BSP and its leadership. In its blind opposition, it has forgotten that the police officer who allowed that incident to take place, who was present there when I was being attacked, has been appointed DGP by   government. By appointing him as the chief of  , is BJP attempting to get me killed and finish off the BSP movement?”
 
 
 Mayawati said that by making this appointment, BJP had added salt to the wounds of her people and to BSP movement. “BJP’s conspiracy has been no less heinous and it has also hurt BSP movement on several occasions,” she added.
