Ghaziabad: The government has identified land for a health centre in   and a full-fledged hospital in Loni after years of impasse, leading to speculation that the trans-Hindon area will get the two facilities in three years.

 The health department has planned a 30-bed community health centre in Khoda and a 50-bed hospital in Loni. Although Ghaziabad has three government health facilities, there is none in trans-Hindon area.
 
 “We had been looking for land for a government hospital in trans-Hindon area for a long time. We have finally identified 1,500sqm belonging to the Nagar Palika in Khoda, where the health centre will come up,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad. “It will be a multi-storied building that will come at an estimated cost of Rs 8.25 crore. If things go as per the plan, the health centre will be ready in a little over two-and-a-half years,” he added.
 
 The 30-bed health centre will cater to a population of about 4 lakh. “Since there is no government hospital in trans-Hindon area, residents had been demanding such a health facility for long. But there was a stalemate over land. No agency was willing to give land for free, which is mandatory according to government rules. This had held up the project for long,” Gupta said.
 
 In Loni, the health department has identified 2.8 acres for a 50-bed full-fledged hospital. “The 50-bed hospital will come at a cost of Rs 17.63 crore,” said Gupta. “Apart from regular OPD facilities, it will also have a separate obstetrics and gynecology department and will cater to a population of over 5 lakh,” he added.
 
 The official said 60% of the funds would be borne by the Centre and the remaining by the state government.
