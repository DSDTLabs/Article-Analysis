Panaji: The Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) on Tuesday rejected an application by South West Port Limited (SWPL), a unit of the JSW Group, for consent to handle   and iron ore at the Mormugao port. The board’s chairman, Ganesh Shetgaonkar, told TOI the application was rejected because   didn’t have a valid environmental clearance (EC) to handle coal.

 The GSPCB stated that the unit was granted an EC in 2001 under the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification 1994, and that in view of a Supreme Court decision, an EC issued under this notification was valid for only five years.
 
 Although SWPL had later applied for an EC towards an increase in iron ore   at berths 5A and 6A, its application continues to remain pending before the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change, even as the state pollution board voiced its objection towards granting such an EC.
 
 The pollution control board had earlier revoked SWPL’s consent to operate as the latter was found to have exceeded its handling capacity. SWPL was also directed to close its facility, following which it filed a petition in court seeking permission to handle cargo that was in the port area, a matter in which assent was subsequently granted for a period of 15 days only.
