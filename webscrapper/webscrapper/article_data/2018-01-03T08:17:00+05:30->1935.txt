LUCKNOW: With features that make it disabled-friendly, the official   of   will be relaunched on Wednesday. Students will no longer have to struggle to   about their respective departments, emergency contacts and other important information as the upgraded website will provide them easy navigation options, enhanced content and link-based advance search option. 

 "The new version has been customized with related information about a department, examination and course. It would be a student-friendly and easy-to-access website," said Data Resource Centre director  .
 
 The website boasts of special features, like screen reader that enables people with visual impairment to access the website and information in audio form for the hearing impaired. He said the upgraded version will be more decentralized with department heads and deans having access to update and upload information on their own after it is approved by the security channel.
 
 Mishra said the university website has been partially upgraded before providing student login facility where he/she can rate teachers, seek information and report about the problems faced. Similarly, teacher, and later college, login will be made available to hold the record of teacher and college respectively.
 
 The website will offer students latest news from the campus. Many pages on the current website have incomplete information which would be simplified and updated, he added. The website, in its current version, is of around 700 pages which makes it tough for the students to locate the desired information.
 
 "Many a times, we are told that revised syllabus and timetable have been updated but we have to contact the teacher concerned to note it down as it's almost impossible to locate the information on the website," said BSc student Aditi.
