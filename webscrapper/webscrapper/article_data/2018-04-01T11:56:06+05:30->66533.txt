HYDERABAD: The concept of rainwater harvesting (RWH) may not have struck a chord with denizens in a big way but the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) is going ahead with its plans to set up a unique RWH theme park in the upscale Jubilee Hills area on the lines of a similar park in Bengaluru.

 The water board on Saturday called for tenders for the theme park, which will come up at the   on Road No 26, Jubilee Hills, at a cost of ?1.8 crore. “We have received a detailed project report (DPR) and tenders have been called for to estalish the park which will be spread over 3.5 acres,” director (technical), HMWS&SB, PS   told STOI. “We intend to construct the theme park in six months,” he said. GHMC is maintaining the Butterfly Park.
 
 The main aim behind the theme park is to popularise rainwater harvesting and also train citizens on how to go about it. AR Shiva Kumar, principal scientific officer, Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Science, and the brain behind the RWH park at   in Bengaluru, was roped in by HMWS&SB to prepare DPR to develop India’s second RWH park in Hyderabad.
 
 Initially, the authorities identified two parks at   and Srinagar Colony but with locals raising objections over losing daily walking space, they plumped for the Butterfly Park in Jubilee Hills to set up the RWH theme park. “We have increased penalties on those who are yet to set up RWH pits in their apartments. The citizens should realise that there is no future without RWH,” a senior official said.
