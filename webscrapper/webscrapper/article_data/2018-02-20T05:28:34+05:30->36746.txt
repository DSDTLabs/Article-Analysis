MUMBAI: Cash-strapped national carrier   will put up its prime Pali Hill   for   on Tuesday with a reserve price of Rs 200 crore.

 The half-acre plot with a building having 14 apartments is probably the most lucrative real estate that Air India has been trying to sell to shore up its  , estimated to be around Rs 50,000 crore.
 
 But property market sources told TOI the plot auction “flopped’’ last year and the airline was putting it back on sale. “The last time, builders backed out when they found out that the land falls under coastal regulation zone (CRZ) II,’’ said a developer, who was interested in buying the property.
 
 
  
 It is learnt that one of the interested clients was a top Bollywood actor, who is believed to have offered Rs 150 crore at the last auction. But since the offer was way below the reserve price, it remained unsold. The actor has been scouting for land in   for several years to build a bungalow.
 
 “The development potential is limited because of CRZ restrictions. Builders say the property’s redevelopment will not fetch much as the floor space index (FSI) is limited because of CRZ,’’ sai d a property consultant.
 
 It is learnt that only two of the 14 flats are currently occupied. The apartments were built for Air India employees. Recently, the airlines sold six apartments in Sterling Apartments at   for Rs 132 crore to State Bank of India. Four apartments were sold in the first phase, fetching Rs 88 crore, and another two for Rs 44 crore in the second phase.
 
 Sixteen more apartments in Mumbai will also be auctioned with a reserve price of around Rs 60 crore on Tuesday.
 
 Air India earns an annual rent of Rs 80-90 crore from its properties across Mumbai.
