DUMKA: A three-member   (NAAC) team inspected  , Dumka, on Saturday.
The team headed by  ,   arrived here on Friday.
 
 Apart from interacting with faculty members and students of S P College, the team inspected different departments and infrastructure facilities.
 During inspection, the NAAC team pointed out the lack of suitable infrastructural facilities for running the National Service Scheme (NSS) and   (NCC) units.
 
 "It is surprising that the NSS units do not have a separate room in the college," the NAAC chairman pointed out while inspection and expressed surprise that none of the programme officers turned up to meet the team.
 
 The college library, which was recently shifted to a new building, also lacked proper facilities for students.
 
 Due to the lack of NAAC accreditation, SKMU colleges throughout the state have been stopped from using the fund allocated to educational institutions, under Rastriya Uchchatar Siksha Abhiyan (RUSA) of the central government, which was introduced in 2013.
