BATHINDA: Four days after Jaito   Baljinder Singh Sandhu shot himself dead during a protest by students of Punjabi University regional centre over alleged thrashing of three of their mates, Faridkot   Nanak Singh on Friday agreed to inquire the case of abetment of suicide registered against unidentified persons following the DSP’s death and reexamine the case registered under Section 107/151 (breach of peace).

 Following the talks with the representatives of students and farmer organization, Faridkot SSP Nanak Singh said an SP-level officer will be entrusted to inquire into the case of abetment of suicide registered against unidentified persons.
 
 All this started on January 12 when then SHO   allegedly picked up three students, including a girl, from Jaito bus stand and thrashed them at the police station.
 
 Punjab Students Union state president Rajinder Singh, said, “Students approached the DSP to get justice but the SHO did not agree to resolve the issue. Students supported by farmer organisation BKU (Dakonda) held a protest on January 29 where the DSP ended life and cops beat up girl students and damaged a car of farmers.”
 
 The bullet after piercing DSP’s head had hit his gunmen Lal Singh, who succumbed to injuries a day later. The police had registered a case under abetment of suicide charges against unknown persons.
 
 Meanwhile Rajinder and Manjit Dhaner, BKU (Dakonda) vice-president, claimed that the police have also agreed to make SHO Gurmeet Singh, who was shifted to police lines following the thrashing allegations, tender an apology to students of Punjabi University regional centre at Jaito on Saturday,
 
 Faridkot SSP Nanak Singh said, “The abetment of suicide case will be investigated by an SP-level officer and breach of peace case too will be examined again.” He, however, declined to comment about the SHO tendering an apology.
