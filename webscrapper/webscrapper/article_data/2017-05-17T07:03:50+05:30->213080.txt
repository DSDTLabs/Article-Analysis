CHANDIGARH: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday demanded allocation of rupees three crore annually to each   of Punjab as Local Area Development Fund (LAD). Addressing the media, AAP MLAs Aman Arora, HS Phoolka, and others demanded from the government to pass the MLA Local Area Development Fund Bill 2017 in the coming session of the  .

 Arora said MLA Local Area Development Fund has been introduced in many states, and is similar to that of MP-LAD Fund introduced by Government of India in 1993. He demanded that a fund of rupees three crore per constituency must be provided in the state’s Plan Budget every year to meet the demands of the people of Vidhan Sabha. He said at present, along with MPs, MLAs of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh,  , Maharastra, Kerala, Karnataka, and Delhi were getting Rs2-4 crore each under the MLA Local Area Development Fund, but the concept had not been implemented in Punjab. He said Delhi Vidhan Sabha had passed the bill to raise the fund to Rs14 crore, which is awaiting the nod of lieutenant general of Delhi.
 
 Arora, who is co-president of Punjab AAP, said he had written a letter to the Vidhan Sabha speaker in that regard to seek his permission to introduce the private member’s bill in the coming session of the assembly. He also requested the MLAs of Congress, BJP, and SAD to support the bill for the overall development of the state. He said that with the passage of the bill, the disparity in spending funds in specified constituencies would end.
 
 Phoolka said it was surprising to know that no private member’s bill had been introduced in Vidhan Sabha in the past 15 years. He said chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, who used to accuse the previous government for step-motherly treatment to the constituencies related to members of opposition parties, must avail the opportunity to fill the gap. He said the bill’s implementation was the need of the hour for the state’s overall development.
