When they came together for   in 2001, they created magic on screen. And now, 17 years later, we hear that   and   are all set to team up for a trilingual. The film, which will be made in Tamil, Hindi and English, is expected to go on floors once the two of them are free of their present commitments.

 A source in the know tells us, “Gautham Menon debuted in the industry with Minnale, and it turned out to be one of the biggest hits in both   and Madhavan’s careers. They even worked in its Hindi remake, Rehnaa Hai Terre Dil Mein. A few years ago, Gautham had plans of making a multi-lingual film with four stars from the four south Indian film industries. Madhavan could be a part of this film. Things are, however, in the nascent stage, and nothing has been formally finalised.”
 
 While Gautham is currently working on Dhruva Natchathiram with Vikram, Madhavan has Sarkunam’s untitled film among other projects in Kollywood.
