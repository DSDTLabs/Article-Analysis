 Once in Saudi Arabia. Marthamma was allegedly made to work from early morning till late in the night. "They beat her up every day if she asks for some rest. Not just that, they are starving her," Chittibabu said, explaining the problems that his wife was facing in Saudi Arabia. In a desperate attempt to get her back to India, the family has been trying to get in touch with the agent who had taken her there but his phone is switched off.
