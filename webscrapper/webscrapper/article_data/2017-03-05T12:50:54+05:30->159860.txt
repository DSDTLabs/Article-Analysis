Actress-singer   says "there's a reason" she is no longer with her ex-husband   Anthony. 

  
  
 The 47-year-old songstress, who divorced the record producer in 2014, says there is no romantic reconciliation on the horizon as they both believe that they have parted ways for a good reason. 
 
 "Marc and I are good how we are right now. There's a reason we're not together, but we're great friends. And we're parents together. We're even working on a Spanish album together. 
 
 "(And) that has been even better for us. We met working, and that's where we're really magical, when we're on stage together, and so we leave it there. That's it," Lopez says on 'The View'.
