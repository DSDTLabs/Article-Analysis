Margao: A surplus budget of Rs 84 lakh was unanimously approved by the   gram sabha, held on Sunday.

 Ilha-de-Rachol sarpanch   informed TOI that “despite the Rachol village being adopted under the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Sansad Adarsh   (SAGY), with development works sanctioned to the tune of Rs 12 crore, only 50% of the works could be completed due to the lack of cooperation from the government and the lethargic attitude of the government officials to expedite the proposal files. The Salcete block development officer-I (BDO) delayed the clearance of Rachol panchayat file or else we would have completed 100% of the developmental works in the village”. 
 
 “Moreover, after constituting the Rachol bio-diversity village committee, all the necessary exercises of documentation and collating data of the bio-diversity in the village has been done with the assistance of the technical support group and has been sent to the   (GSBB), but till date, we have not received any approvals,” Vaz said, as he assured to complete the ongoing works, before the election code of conduct comes into effect for the panchayat elections.
