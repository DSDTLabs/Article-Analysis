BENGALURU: Major  , who was martyred 16 years ago, will be honoured with a new bust at the memorial park named after him in   on Saturday. 

 An alumnus of the city's St. Joseph's Boys' High School and a   graduate, Major   was commissioned into 21st Battalion, the Jat Regiment, from the Officer Training Academy, Chennai in 1998. He was martyred while protecting three other jawans on the Line of Control (LoC) on August 2, 2002 and were fired upon by Pak soldiers. 
 
 The jawans from the 21st battalion were unaware about the firing in the neighbouring sector and were busy repairing the communication lines damaged due to bad weather. Major Sylvester realized the imminent danger and disregarding his own safety, he rushed out of the bunker to alert the jawans. As these jawans hurried back to the safety of the bunker, he once again set his own safety aside and let them get in first. An enemy shell landed near them and Major Sylvester took the burnt of the splinters as he shielded the jawans. TNN
