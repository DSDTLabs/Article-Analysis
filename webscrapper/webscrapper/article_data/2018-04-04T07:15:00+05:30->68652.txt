GREATER NOIDA: Four men were detained for trying to abduct a woman in Greater Noida on Tuesday. However, they were later released as the woman — an ex-girlfriend of one of the accused — refused to file a police complaint.

 Amit Kishore Shrivastava, circle officer, Greater Noida I, said the woman is a BTech student at a private university in  .
 
 “In the afternoon, she was travelling in an autorickshaw with a male friend. The girl’s ex-boyfriend, who was travelling in the same direction in a Maruti Baleno with his three friends, spotted her and waylaid the autorickshaw. Then they asked the girl to get into the car. When she refused, the four started dragging her inside,” he said.
 
  The girl’s friend, who was traveling with her in the auto, dialled 100, informing the police that four youths were trying to “kidnap” his friend. 
 
 The police control room immediately flashed the message and PCR vans from Surajpur and Knowledge Park police stations started chasing the suspects’ vehicle. A police team intercepted the Baleno near the Surajpur roundabout after a chase and detained the accused.
 
 The four accused and victim were brought to police station for questioning. Shrivastava said that one of the accused, a resident of Sahibabad, was an ex-boyfriend of the girl. The couple parted ways over some differences in the last few months. The students were released in the evening since the victim did not file any written complaint.
 
 “The accused and the victim were brought to the police station for questioning. One of the accused, a resident of Sahibabad, is an ex-boyfriend of the woman. All of them were released in the evening,” said Shrivastava.
