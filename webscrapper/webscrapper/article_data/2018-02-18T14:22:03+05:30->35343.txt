PATNA: The members of students wing of Jan Adhikar Party (JAP), Chhatra RJD, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad ( ) and National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) protested outside   on Saturday as they alleged that JD(U) spokesperson   was convincing students to vote for Chhatra JD(U) candidates.

 After the police failed to act on their complaints, the students tried to break the college gate. More police personnel were deployed to control the situation.
 
 “After the voters informed us, we asked the police personnel and SDM to stop Suheli from forcing the students to vote for her party candidates, but they didn’t respond,” ABVP’s state office secretary Subodh Kumar alleged.
 
 NSUI member   said Suheli was inside the hostel during voting. “Some students spotted her at the college asking voters to support her party contestants. University should take action against her,” said Sharma.
 
 Suheli, however, denied the allegations. “I was not even at the college at that time. Patna University’s VC Rash Bihari Prasad Singh instructed me earlier not to be the part of the election. Honouring his words, I kept myself away from the election,” said Suheli, who is also the warden of Hostel Welfare, MMC.
 
 According to college officials, around 100 students were not able to vote after the clash and deployment of police personnel at the gate.
 
 College principal Prof Shashi Sharma said the voting went off peacefully. “Some mischievous elements tried to obstruct the voting process, but they failed. The ruckus was created at the college gate, but it was peaceful on the campus,” she said.
