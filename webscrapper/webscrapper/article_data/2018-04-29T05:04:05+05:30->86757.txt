MUMBAI:   president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday asked former chief minister and state party chief Ashok   to personally visit   in Ratnagiri district to understand the woes of the villagers, who are opposing the proposed Rs 2.5 lakh crore oil refinery project.

 “Rahul expressed concern over the proposed acquisition of large tracts of fertile land. Barren land should have been selected for the project. He has asked me to visit Nanar on May 2 and brief him on the plight of the villagers,” Chavan told TOI.
 
 A delegation of   called on Rahul to seek his support for their agitation against the project. “It was brought to the notice of Rahul that if the project is allowed, besides adverse impact on the environment, it will result in large-scale displacement of families in Nanar village,” Chavan said.
 
 According to a Congress leader, notwithstanding the opposition, the BJP-led government signed an MoU with Saudi Aramco for setting up the refinery. While the investment will be Rs 2.5 lakh crore, the project will provide jobs to 1 lakh people at the cost of displacing 3,200 families and 8,000 farmers. “It has been proposed to acquire 15,000 acres of fertile land,” he said.
 
 Significantly, a week ago, industries minister Subhash Desai had, in the presence of Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray, declared that a notification for acquisition of land for the Nanar refinery issued in June last year will be scrapped in the larger interest of the villagers. “We are with people of Nanar, we are scrapping the notification for land acquisition,” Desai had said.
 
 On the same day, Fadnavis declared that Desai or the industries department has no powers to scrap the notification and that the decision has to be taken by a high-power committee headed by the chief secretary. “We will examine all issues and then taken a decision,” Fadnavis had observed.
