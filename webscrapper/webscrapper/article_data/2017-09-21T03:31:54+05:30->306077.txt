GURUGRAM: A 25-year-old domestic help from Assam was found dead inside her employer’s flat in   in the upscale DLF-I area, hanging from a ceiling fan with a dupatta tied around her neck, on Wednesday.

 Police believe the woman,  , ended her life when she was alone in the flat though no suicide note has been found. They have taken the body into custody and said an autopsy will be carried out on Thursday.
 
 Cops said Anu was working as a full-time help in the twelfth-floor flat (number 102/122) of Ranjeet Mehta, who is the principal director at PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Delhi. Her body was found by Mehta’s teenage son around 2.30 pm when he returned from school.
 
 Mehta’s son found the main door of the apartment open after he came back from school and when he went inside, he was shocked to see Anu hanging from the ceiling fan of a room. Hearing his screams, neighbours came out and informed the police. The apartment building’s security guards also came and locked the flat till cops arrived.
 
 Mehta lives with his son and nephew in the rented apartment in Silver Oaks apartments. Anu had been with the household for the past five years. No one was in the house when Anu allegedly took the extreme step, cops said. Mehta’s nephew, who works with a private firm in Gurgaon, was at work at the time.
 
 Inspector Devender Kumar, SHO of   said prima facie it seemed that Anu committed suicide, “but we are waiting for his family”. “However, no suicide note was found. The post mortem will be carried out on Thursday,” he said.
 
 After getting information, Mehta also reached his flat in the afternoon. “Mehta started crying after seeing the body. He told us that Anu was very soft spoken and friendly and he never saw her in any type of stress. We are investigating the matter from all angle,” Kumar said.
