CHANDIGARH: The chief judicial magistrate has dropped charges of sedition and attempt to murder filed against 53 persons, including three key functionaries of   from Panchkula on Saturday. This comes as a major setback to the special investigation team (SIT) probing the violence. 

 All the 53 persons will face trial in the case of violence and other sections in the court of chief judicial magistrate, Panchkula. The accused, including dera media coordinator Surender Dhiman Insan and in-charge of Panchkula Nam Charcha Ghar Chamkaur Singh were arrested in two cases (FIR numbers 335 and 337) registered against them at Sector 5 police station.
 
 Sources said those booked in the case were also arrested in the main case of violence unleashed after the conviction of dera head   in two rape cases on August 25, 2017. The case was registered on the directions of Punjab and Haryana high court. Sources said those arrested in the case were involved in the violence. They manned crowds and organised community kitchens.
 
 Commissioner of police (CP) A S Chawla confirmed the development. He, however, maintained, “We are studying the order of the court. It will be legally examined and appropriate action will follow.” He also said it would not have any impact on the main case. 
 
 A total of 41 dera followers died in the violence, including 36 in Panchkula, where police registered more than 200 cases of violence and criminal intimidation. The cases were registered on the directions of the high court. Honeypreet Insan, Aditya Insan and key Dera functionaries are among those booked.
