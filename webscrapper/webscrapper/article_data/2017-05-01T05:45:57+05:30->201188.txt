PUNE: A 13-year-old boy, Pritesh Kamble, was electrocuted when he touched an iron rod while climbing onto the tin roof of his house at   in Khadki to fetch a cricket ball late on Saturday night. 

 While the reason for the electrocution is yet to be determined, Pritesh's father, Ganesh, apprehends that a halogen lamp installed on a tree outside the house may have been the source of the current. Officials from the state energy department inspected the spot but could not immediately locate the source of the current.
 
 An electrical inspector from the department, N I Patil, told TOI, "We have inspected the spot and need to do a couple of more checks. We will prepare a report within a couple of days."
 
 Pritesh's cousin Nishikant and other boys from the area rushed him to the  's   hospital, where he was pronounced dead by the doctors.
