Chennai: India-focused offshore equity funds and ETFs (exchange traded funds) recorded net inflows of $2 billion for the quarter ending March 2017. This is the highest quarterly net inflow for the category since the first quarter of 2015, when it received $ 5.6 billion.

 Robust inflows, coupled with a rally in Indian equity markets, expanded the asset base of these funds significantly. Incidentally, India-focussed offshore funds and ETFs witnessed net outflows of $4.39 billion during October-December and $2.5 billion during 2016.
 
 India-dedicated offshore funds witnessed higher net inflows than India-dedicated offshore ETFs during the quarter ending March. Of the total quarterly net inflow of $2 billion, India-focussed offshore funds registered net inflow of about $1.5 billion whereas India-focussed offshore ETFs witnessed net inflows of $508 million.
 
 Flows into India-dedicated offshore funds are generally considered to be long-term in nature, whereas flows into India-dedicated offshore ETFs indicate predominantly short-term money. The higher inflows into offshore funds compared with offshore ETFs suggest that foreign investors are regaining confidence in
 
 Indian markets and are viewing India as a long-term investment option.
 
 Their combined assets stood at $50.1 billion as of the end of March 2017, compared to $40.8 billion at the end of December 2016. While ETFs accounted for $10.8 billion of these assets (versus $8.7 billion in December 2016), India-focussed offshore equity funds contributed $39.3 billion (compared to $32.1 billion in December 2016).
 
 FIIs (foreign institutional investors) went on a buying spree in February and March. In February, they were net buyers to the tune of $1.48 billion. They pumped in another $4.7 billion during March. As a result, the benchmark Sensex increased 11.2% during January-March.
 
 The India-focussed offshore funds and ETFs category registered a gain of 19.5% (in US dollar or USD terms) during the quarter, thus outperforming the USD-denominated MSCI India USD Index, which grew by 17.1%. The category fell by 8% (in USD terms) during the quarter ending December 2016.
 
 iShares MSCI India was the favourite among investors during the quarter as it garnered net inflows of $431 million, data compiled by Morningstar India, an investment research firm showed. This was followed by Nomura India Equity (net inflows $257 million) and Franklin India I Acc (net inflows of $254 million).
 
 The total assets of the 10 largest India-focussed offshore funds and ETFs at the end of March 2017 were estimated to be around $25.4 billion, compared to $20.3 billion recorded during the quarter ended December 2016. They constitute almost half of the overall assets of the offshore-India universe.
 
 The top-10 funds comprised three ETFs — iShares MSCI India, WisdomTree India Earnings ETF, and Lyxor MSCI India ETF C—contributing about $7.8 billion to the total assets of top-10 funds. The total assets of India-focussed offshore funds and ETFs however are down by 10% from a peak of $55.8 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2010.
