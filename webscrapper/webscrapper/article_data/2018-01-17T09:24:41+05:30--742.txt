KANNUR: Amid allegations that   prisoners have influence at the central prison in  , one matter has raised eyebrows. Many accused and convicted prisoners in some sensational murder cases (including   and TP Chandrasekharan murders) have undergone treatment at the district ayurveda hospital without sufficient security.

 Though prison authorities said the prisoners were sent to the hospital as directed by ayurveda doctors visiting the hospital, suspicion arose about the transparency of the entire 'treatment vacation' as all patients belong to the CPM, and there was not much police security at the hospital.
 
 Hospital records show that KC   (awarded life imprisonment in TP murder) and Sunil Kumar (accused in Manoj murder) are still undergoing treatment at the hospital. Five others-TP murder case convict T K Rajeesh, Thrissur Sureshbabu murder case convict Balaji, and three others accused in Manoj murder (Jijesh, T Prabhakaran, and Riju)-underwent treatment here. The duration ranged from 18-45 days.
 
 Ramachandran, admitted to room number 211, has only namesake police protection and the condition is such that he is living a free life there, said sources attached to the hospital. Rajeesh underwent treatment from October 11 to November 25 (as per hospital records) and the security was same, said sources.
 
 When contacted, Kannur central prison superintendent   said prisoners were referred to the ayurveda hospital and it was the responsibility of the police to ensure their security.
 
 "When doctors usually refer a patient to a particular hospital, we cannot deny treatment, and when police security is available we send them for treatment," he said.
 
 However, when it was pointed out only prisoners belonging to only one political party, who are accused and convicted prisoners in murder cases, have been given such treatment, he replied that their doctors can give a clarification.
