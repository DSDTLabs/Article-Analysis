JAIPUR:   is such in the state that   each year are more than the cases disposed of.   (CAG) in its audit report highlighted the swelling  ,  , and lack of infrastructure of consumer forums and disputes redressal commissions.

 As per the audit report, total 46,266 cases were pending as in March 2016 and pendency of the cases has been increasing from 2012. It was also observed that in addition to old pending cases, the number of new cases filed each year are more than the cases disposed of, leading to further accumulation of pending cases.
 
 Moreover, disposal of cases within the prescribed period was 9.89%. “During 2012-16, 90.11% complaint/appeal cases were pending beyond the prescribed period of three-five months at the state commission” noted the report.
 
 The quasi-judicial bodies observe the principles of natural justice and are empowered to give relief and to award compensation to the consumers.
 
 In addition to state consumer disputes redressal commission (SCDRC) at Jaipur, the state government sanctioned establishment of seven circuit benches. Aim was to reach out to the consumers in vast territory of the state and reduce the heavy pendency.
 
 However, barring Jaipur, Jodhpur and Udaipur, no benches were properly functioning. Benches at Ajmer and Bharatpur were not working since their creation and in Kota and Bikaner they were not sitting since November 2014 and February 2015, respectively. Out of 37 district forums, only one district forum at Karauli has adequate infrastructure facilities.
 
 The report also mentioned that purpose of increasing consumer awareness could not be fulfilled as adequate manpower could not be posted. Even though consumer forums were set up, about 99% of the complainants were not confident of filing the case without an advocate to support them.
