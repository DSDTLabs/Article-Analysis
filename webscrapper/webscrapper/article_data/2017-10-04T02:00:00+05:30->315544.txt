PATNA: The Bihar government’s schools will participate in the cleanliness campaign to be undertaken in the run-up to the declaration of Swachh Vidyalaya Puraskar (SVP), launched by the Union ministry of human resource development ( ).

 Through the award, the MHRD recognises the government, government-aided and private schools that have undertaken significant steps to fulfil the mandate of the Swachh Vidyalaya campaign. 
 
 Sources said Bihar Education Project Council (BEPC)’s director (state project) Sanjay Singh sent a letter last week to the district education officers and district programme officers (under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan), asking them to ensure maximum participation of schools from their respective areas in the campaign.
 
 “The registration for Swachh Vidyalaya Puraskar will close on October 31. The process of selection of schools for the award will be online. The awards will be given on the basis of different categories, including water, sanitation, handwash with soap, operation and maintenance, behaviour change activities and capacity building,” Singh said.
 
 Around 1,200 schools from Bihar participated in the countrywide exercise last year. None of them figured among the 177 top-scoring schools across the country. “This year, however, we will work harder,” said Singh.
 
 The Central Board of Secondary Education has also directed its affiliated schools to take part in the cleanliness drive. CBSE’s deputy secretary (affiliation) J P Chaturvedi issued a letter in this regard on September 29. 
 
 The letter says the MHRD’s exercise will grade schools, based on infrastructure and upkeep of their premises. The participation of schools affiliated with the CBSE in this ambitious and innovative initiative would be appreciated.
