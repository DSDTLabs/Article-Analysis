NEW DELHI: Five days after nine jawans of CRPF’s 212th battalion were killed in an IED blast in  , triggered by Maoists, the central paramilitary force has transferred its commandant Prashant Dhar.

 
 Dhar, sources said, has been punished for ignoring the orders not to allow any movement towards Palodi on Tuesday, when the CoBRA battalion had already faced an attack in the morning.
 
 TOI had reported that Chhattisgarh Police’s Sukma SP,  , insisted on going to Palodi despite a warning by  , but Dhar didn’t stop him and sent two MPVs along with the SP. Officials said that Dhar, the commanding officer (CO), was transferred to the north-east sector late Friday evening, pending inquiry.
 
 They said the role of the officer is under scrutiny for alleged lapses that led to the killing of the nine CRPF jawans in Sukma on March 13 as their mine protected vehicle (MPV) was blown off the Maoists. 
 
 Dhar, officials said, was directed by the CRPF director General (DG) R R  , through field commanders, to exercise caution and not allow any movement on the 5-km under-construction Kistaram-Palodi road after an encounter between the Maoists and forces in the morning on the fateful day.
 
 But Sukma SP Abhishek Meena visited the area and CRPF, the state police and district reserve group contingents accompanied him and Dhar for their onward movement to some newly established security camps, including Palodi. 
 
 A Court of Inquiry will probe why and how Dhar allowed movement on the stretch. A total of 11 CRPF men were travelling in the MPV that was blown off by the Maoists by detonating an IED.
