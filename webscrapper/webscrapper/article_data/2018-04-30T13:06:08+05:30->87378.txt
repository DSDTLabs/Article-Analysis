PATNA: Bihar chief minister (CM)   on Sunday wrote a fresh letter to Prime Minister (PM)  , reviving his demand to confer the country’s highest civilian award —   — to socialist leader Dr Ram Manohar  .

 In his three-page letter, Nitish also highlighted Lohia’s long association with the Goa liberation movement and urged the PM to name Goa airport after the socialist leader.
 
 Highlighting the role of Lohia in the country’s freedom movement, uniting opposition parties in the post-independence era and strengthening the socialist movement, Nitish pointed out, “Such a great freedom fighter should be conferred with the Bharat Ratna on his death anniversary on October 12.
 
 It is my personal request that the proposal... should be considered and direction given to the ministry concerned for taking necessary steps in this regard,” the CM said in his letter.
 
 Earlier in August 2014, when he was working as a senior JD (U) leader after quitting the CM’s post in favour of Jitan Ram Manjhi, Nitish Kumar strongly pitched for conferring of the Bharat Ratna to Lohia and former Bihar CM Karpoori   for their contributions to the country.
 
 Conferring the highest civilian award on Lohia and Thakur would increase the prestige of the award, Nitish had said.
 
 Later in December 2014, the state legislative council passed a unanimous resolution demanding the Bharat Ratna for Lohia and two former CMs Sri Krishna Sinha and   for “their outstanding contributions in nation building”.
 
 Moving a resolution in the council as a JD (U) MLC in the last week of December 2014, Nitish Kumar had then hailed the Centre’s decision to confer the Bharat Ratna on BHU founder and freedom fighter Pt Madan Mohan Malviya and former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Nitish, in his resolution, had said, “Lohia, Sinha and Thakur also deserved the Bharat Ratna.”
