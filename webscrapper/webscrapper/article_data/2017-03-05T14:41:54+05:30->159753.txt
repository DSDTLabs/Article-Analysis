CHANDIGARH: Olympic bronze medallist   on Saturday embarrassed the   on Twitter for not keeping its word on the many promises it made after her historic win. 

 "Announcements made by Haryana Government after my OLYMPIC MEDAL win were for MEDIA ONLY,'' Sakshi wrote on her Twitter handle.
 
 
 
 Although the wrestler did not comment after that, her mother   told TOI: "The chief minister had made certain announcements (after Sakshi's win) and it was followed by sports minister Anil Vij on September 3. This included a job as sports director at Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU), but she is still waiting for the appointment letter."
 
 The mother added that besides the job, the government had announced a residential plot, a wrestling hall in Rohtak for her to train in and a promotion for herself (mother) as supervisor in the woman and child development department.
 
 Sudesh also regretted that the government had not released prize money of Rs 10 lakh to Ishwar Malik, Sakshi's coach.
 
 Haryana sports and youth affairs minister Anil Vij said Sakshi's appointment at MDU was being processed. "She was given a cash reward of Rs 2.5 crore on the day she landed in New Delhi (from Rio)," he said. "As far as her appointment is concerned, formalities are almost complete. We have already sanctioned Rs 80 lakh for constructing the wrestling hall."
 
 The minister added that he had met mother and daughter only last week. "For the plot, Sakshi has to apply before the appropriate authorities," he said. "The government is equally concerned about not just Sakshi but all sportspersons."
 
 On prize money for her coach, Vij said that the family or Sakshi must clear who had coached her for the Olympics and the money would be released. "We have got requests from four people who claim to be her coach," he said.
