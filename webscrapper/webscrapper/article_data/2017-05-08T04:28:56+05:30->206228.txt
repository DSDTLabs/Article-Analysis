NEW DELHI: Delhi   chief   on Sunday demanded the immediate resignation of chief minister  . Terming the allegations of “corruption” levelled by Kapil Mishra a “witness testimony of sitting minister”, Maken said his party would carry out a five-day referendum on the right to recall the CM. 

 He said the party aimed to secure at least 10 lakh signatures from the people of Delhi.
 
 Maken called the “AAP experiment” a failure. He said: “The Aam Aadmi Party was created on November 26, 2012, with the aim of fighting corruption, bringing in lokpal as well as establishing inner party democracy. Within five years of its creation, all central pillars on which the party was created have been dismantled.” 
 
 Maken claimed that of the seven ministers who took oath on February 14, 2015, six already had serious corruption allegations against them.
 
 The   chief said the “Rs 2-crore transaction” between Satyendar Jain and   was “not a mere allegation, but a witness affidavit of a sitting minister who saw the transaction himself”. He slammed AAP for “giving excuses” that Mishra had made the allegations because he was removed from the party. “Grave charges against AAP leaders were made in the Shunglu committee (report), which had no such interests,” he said. 
 
 Calling AAP the “B-team” of BJP, Maken alleged that the latter would ensure that no concrete action was taken. “What happened to the charges made by the Shunglu committee? The Centre has done nothing. Not a single FIR has been filed under the prevention of corruption Act,” he said.
 
 On the water tanker “scam” involving former Delhi CM  , Maken said : “They don’t have an iota of evidence against any Congress leader. If they had anything substantial, why would they be sitting on the report for over a year. These allegation were made just because there were talks of Sheilaji being made Punjab in-charge.”
