(Daughters of our houses are not safe and can’t go out for studies or jobs because poor law and order situation here). My daughter and I have faced the same. I am here for contesting election to ensure social security to the women of Sarojininagar.” 
 
 The BSP workers allegedly passed lewd remarks on Swati’s daughter in July last year in response to Swati’s husband BJP leader   had passed derogatory remarks on BSP chief Mayawati.

Later, she was noticed by BJP and given a ticket to contest from Sarojininagar . 
 
 Travelling through 27 villages in one day, Swati asked Rubeena, a local of Rajakheda village whether she was able to send her daughters to school. Rubeena said she felt worried for her daughters when they stepped out. Singh said, “I am the only women candidate from this constituency and mother of a girl so only I can relate to such safety concerns. I want to make it safer for girl students to study and facilitate an earning through small cottage industries.”
 
 Sarla Devi of Sewain village claimed that though women of her villages were stepping out every day for farming, providing opportunities to open small-scale manufacturing units in their own homes would be much safer.
