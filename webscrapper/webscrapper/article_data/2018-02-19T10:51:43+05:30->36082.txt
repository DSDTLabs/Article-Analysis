TIRUNELVELI: From constables to inspectors, memo has been served on 30 police personnel in   district in less than two months for failing to answer questions pertaining to the law. “As law enforcing personnel, they should know the law to serve people better. Explanation has been sought from them. Action will be taken based on their reply,” SP P   told TOI.

 The exercise began about three months back when the SP asked questions over in the evenings when he got the daily situation report (DSR) from over 70 police stations in the district at 9pm. 
 
 It initially began with random questions on sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedures, Indian Evidence Act and important judgements on directions or guidelines to the police.
 
 Department sources said that this saw many police personnel landing in trouble. On a request by the personnel, they were informed of the specific sections of the law or the judgement from which questions will be asked the next day. But in due course when the exercise was taken lightly, the SP started issuing memos last month.
 
 Police personnel then started taking the exercise seriously and even began sharing details pertaining to the next day’s questions through WhatsApp. At the DSR session that lasts for 45 minutes to an hour, the SP randomly asks a question to constables, sub inspectors, inspectors and DySPs of various sub divisions.
 
 “The questions are mostly basic, such as when and how a woman can be detained? If force should be used if a person cooperates during arrest? This exercise is not to victimise our personnel and officers. It is to help them stay empowered and serve people better with better understanding of the law. On Monday (February 19) we will review replies we have got for the memos. The replies will be perused and action will be taken,” the SP said.
