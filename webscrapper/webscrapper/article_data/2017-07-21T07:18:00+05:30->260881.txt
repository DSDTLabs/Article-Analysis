Amritsar: Two cellphones were seized from gangster Jagdeep Singh alias Jaggu Bhagwanpuria’s barracks at the central jail in Amritsar. Five more cellphones were found near the barracks number five close to Jaggu’s cell. The gangster has been kept in a high security zone inside the prisons.

 The seizure came two days after a special task force (STF) team arrested five members of Bhagwanpuria’s gang with 500g of heroin in Ajnala. During the investigation cops found out that Jaggu was passing instructions to his men through a cellphone from the jail.
 
 A jail official on condition of anonymity said, “Jaggu has been activating his contacts for quite some time and ordered his aides to receive consignments from different sources and pass those for sale in the market.”
 
 Police hope to get crucial leads from the gangster’s cellphone which would help track huge consignments of drugs in the local market. The investigation officer, sub-inspector Manjinder Singh said, “An FIR has been lodged against Jaggu and the cellphones seized from the barracks have been sent to the cyber cell for investigation.”
