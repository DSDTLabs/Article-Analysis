A ladies club in the city recently threw a dance party for its members. Not in a mood to miss any moment of fun, most ladies came bang on time, despite heavy rainfall on the day. A huge cake was cut for the successful completion of the club’s term.

 Soon after that, everyone headed to the dance floor. The DJ mostly belted out remix songs of various   tracks. The party which started in the evening continued till late in the night, with none of the members were in a mood to go home.
