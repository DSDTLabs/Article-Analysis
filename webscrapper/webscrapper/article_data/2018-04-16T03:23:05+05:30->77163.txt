BENGALURU: After missing several self-imposed deadlines, the   released a list of 218 candidates for the May 12 assembly polls late on Sunday. The party has re-nominated 107 of the 122 sitting MLAs, keeping three pending and accommodating eight party-hoppers.

 
 Chief minister   will contest only from Chamundeshwari, ending speculation that he could contest from Badami too, while KPCC chief G Parameshwara, who came third in the 2013 assembly election, has been given a ticket to contest from Koratagere.
 
 Siddaramaiah’s plan to contest from two constituencies was shot down by the party high command. AICC chief   is believed to have said that it will send out the signal that the CM was not confident of winning Chamundeshwari.
 
  
  
 
 The CM’s stamp was all over the first list as a majority of his loyalists, including Bidar South MLA Ashok Kheny, have been accommodated. 
 
 Shantinagar in Bengaluru is also among the six constituencies for which a candidate is yet to be announced. The sitting MLA from the constituency is N A Haris, whose son Mohammad Nalapad was arrested in connection with an attempt to murder case.
