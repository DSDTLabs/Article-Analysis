BENGALURU: With the public private partnership (PPP) in two museum projects failing to take off, the tourism department is now all set to renovate the Visvesvaraya Industrial and Technological Museum. 

 While the   and tourism department had collaborated to restore   at a cost of Rs 9 crore, the proposal to partly privatise   had to be dropped following public outrage.
 
 The Visvesvaraya Industrial and Technological Museum that's housed within the   premises needed several clearances from the forest department for renovation and rebuilding. "There have been delays in getting clearances; there were also some communication hiccups between the Jindal Foundation, tourism and archaeology and museum department at a very early stage. Now we have decided to start restoring the building. But the museum interior has to be curated by experts and we will float tenders for that soon," N Manjula, commissioner of archaeology and museums department, pointed out.
 
  Bengaluru has eight museums, but they are maintained by different stakeholders. May 18 marks International Museum Day and this year the theme is - Museums and contested histories: Saying the unspeakable in museums. Also, it'll be for the first time that the tourism and   and culture departments will celebrate the day. 
 
 Tourism minister Priyank Kharge told TOI: "In all cities and tourist destinations, museums play an important role. They speak of a place's history, origins of its culture, art, heritage and technology. The State Archaeology Museum on Kasturba Road has artefacts from Mohenjodaro. We only have to realize how priceless these museums are and cash in on them to increase the tourism potential of Bengaluru."
