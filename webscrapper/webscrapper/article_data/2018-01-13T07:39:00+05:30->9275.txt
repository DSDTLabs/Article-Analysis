MOHALI: Greater   Area Development Authority ( ) is all set to e-auction 15 property sites worth Rs 435 crores in Mohali. The e-auction will be held from January 13 to January 24.

 The properties that would be offered via this e-auction would include commercial chunk sites, nursing homes, group housing sites, hospital sites, commercial sites (booths, scos, built-up booths, double storey shops) and residential plots.
 
 Riding on the success of its earlier two e-auctions, Gmada offers major sites in IT park and other sectors in Mohali.
 
 “After the new government, the department has made several changes in the conditions related to auctions such as rationalization of prices of properties; payment plans; reduction in percentage of amount to be paid initially; considerable cut in the rate of interest charged on payment of installments and penal interest. The whole idea behind the move is to give a push to the real estate sector, which has remained bearish in the last few years,” said Gmada chief administrator  .
 
 “The e-auction process has spurred the participation of bidders. Around 200 bidders have already registered on puda.e-auctions.in – a website conceived for the participation of the bidders,” he added.
 
 Bhagat aslo said that the department had moved forward from the traditional way of conducting physical auctions. “While the department earned Rs 295 crore in its first e-auction, it generated a revenue of 418 crore in the second e-auction that was held in October 2017,” he said.
 
 In both the earlier e-auctions, bids were received not only from different areas within the state but also from the neighboring states.
 
 Details of properties offered in the auction; mode of payment; land use; terms and conditions of auction; location plans; pricing would be hosted on the portal puda.e-auctions.in. The terms and conditions of the e-auction would be common for the properties offered by various development authorities in the state.
