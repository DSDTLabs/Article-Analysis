 Around 60 boats had sailed from Pamban in Rameswaram Island on Sunday. One among them was detained by the Sri Lankan navy on Monday morning. 
 
 According to Sri Lankan navy website, navy personnel on a fast attack craft belonging to the North Central Naval Command arrested five Indian fishermen while they were allegedly engaged in illegal fishing 15.5 nautical miles north off Mannar coast within the International Maritime Boundary Line. The country boat was also taken into the custody and handed over to the assistant directorate of fisheries at Mannar for onward action, the website observed.
 
 The fishermen were later produced before the Mannar court which remanded them in judicial custody till May 15. The fishermen were lodged in Vavuniya prison.
 
 As Sri Lankan naval agencies usually don’t apprehend country boats since they don’t indulge in destructive trawl fishing, the arrest on Monday has sparked fear in the fishing community.
