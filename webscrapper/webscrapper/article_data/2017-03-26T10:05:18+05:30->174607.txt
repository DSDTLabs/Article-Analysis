Panaji: The   (GFA) has been on the back foot for a while.
 
  For decades, Goa, along with Bengal, dominated Indian football, contributing maximum players to the national team, winning all honours in club competitions and enjoying a pride of place among the decision-making bodies of the   ( ).
  
  Now it’s different; Goa hasn’t won anything of note since Churchill Brothers grabbed the I-League title in 2013, has just one team in the I-League and does not have a representative in the AIFF executive committee for the first time in more than three decades. Clearly, not the best of times for Goan football.
  
  “Let’s not get into a debate why Goa does not have a representative in the AIFF or why Goa has just one team in the I-League. Those facts are known to all, but as far as the GFA is concerned, we will continue to do our job to the best of our abilities. Look at the Santosh Trophy team, we have two under-19 players (among the six U-21 registered) and if we win against Bengal, which I am pretty sure, it will be a just reward,” said GFA president  .
  
  When Goa agreed to host the Santosh Trophy for the first time in 21 years, many were surprised. GFA’s relations with the AIFF were at its lowest ebb but on the eve of what is surely going to be a hotly-contested final, the mood has changed.
  
  “In Goa, the trophy still holds a lot of significance. Goa’s rivalry with Bengal and those fierce battles of the past are still fresh. The present generation may not be aware (of the history) but a Goa-Bengal clash, particularly in the final, will always remain special.
  
  “There cannot be a more fitting finale to this tournament than a Goa-Bengal final. A win for Goa will boost the football ecosystem in the state,” said Gomes.
