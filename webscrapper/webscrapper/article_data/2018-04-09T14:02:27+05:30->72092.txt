PANAJI: Incidents of indulgence in malpractices by students or others involved in the class X and class XII examinations under   of secondary and higher secondary education have reduced nearly to nil in recent years as a result of the board’s efforts over the years.

 The newest addition to the board’s slew of anti-cheating measures was introduced in 2018. It was decided that teachers engaged by the board will be fined for upto Rs 25 for every mistake they make while conducting the exams. The penalty amount will be deducted from their remuneration and the board’s executive council will deal with the errors made.
 
 The introduction of flying squads in 2016, to conduct surprise checks at examination centres was yet another succesful step in cutting down malpractices. Initiated during the tenure of the board’s former chairman  , the move saw the constitution of three flying squads — one each for north, south and central education zones — comprising retired principals of higher secondary schools.
 
 Some years ago, the board also decided that students arriving over 30 minutes after the commencement of exam will be disqualified from taking the test. Also, to prevent paer leaks, examinees were barred from leaving the venue till an hour elapsed from the start of the test.
 
 Under the Goa Prevention of Malpractices at Universities, Board and other Examinations Act, 1991, intimidation or cheating at exams is a cognisable and non-bailable offence. If found guilty, students can even be imprisoned for six months or fined Rs 500 or both. The results of such students could also be held back.
 
 Early on, the board also introduced unique bar codes and holograms for each answer sheet. These stickers prevent even the impression of the seat number from appearing on the answer sheets when a candidate writes it down.
