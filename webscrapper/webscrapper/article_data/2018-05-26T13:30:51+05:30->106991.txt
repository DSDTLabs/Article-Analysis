The cradle of his incredible creativity is his abode at Jorasankho. In each nook and corner of this house lies Bengali’s heritage, culture and art. Tagore penned his last work in this house. Right from literature to ways of draping a sari, everything of Thakurbari has influenced the culture of Bengalis, transcending the geographical boundaries of both Bengals. His songs has lasting impressions on the brave Muktijoddhas who fought for the liberation of Bangladesh, spearheaded by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. This house in Jorasankho has remained a witness of the extraordinary chapter of Bengal’s history. I am overwhelmed to find an opportunity to visit this house.”
