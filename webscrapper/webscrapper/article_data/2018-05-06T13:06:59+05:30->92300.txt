KOCHI: When R Raghuraman arrived with his father and mother at the Ernakulam Junction Station from Madurai to write the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test, he was relieved to find a group of people from his native state waiting at the station. They guided him regarding the route to reach the examination centre and the accommodation the family had arranged. 

 "While listening to the news last night we realized that many would be travelling on short notice and knew that they would need help," said  , from Tiruchirappalli, working with an IT company in Kochi for the past five years. Some of her colleagues offered to open their homes for them as it would have been tough for the NEET candidates and their family members to find accommodation in the last hour.
 
 Raghuraman said the  's decision to stay Madras high court's order directing CBSE to set up centres in   itself so that local students would not have to travel outside the state, came as blow to him.
 
 Nandini said she has provided accommodation to three students writing the examination. Few of her colleagues have also done the same.
 
 "One of the biggest concerns for NEET candidates from Tamil Nadu was figuring out the route to reach the examination centre. We assured them that we would arrange online taxis and ensure that they reached the destination on time," said Nandini, who was waiting at the railway station with her colleague.
 
 Similarly, B   and his wife  , who are originally from Chennai, arrived at the station around 8am to help the visitors. They offered them assistance to get into buses and find accommodation in various parts of the city depending on the examination centre. "They are quite confused, as many of them were not prepared to travel," said Karthikeyan, a senior manager with a petroleum firm in Ernakulam.
