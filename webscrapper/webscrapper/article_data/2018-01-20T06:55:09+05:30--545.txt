JAIPUR: The Rajasthan high court cancelled the state government’s order renaming Bharat Nirman   Sewa Kendras as   on Friday. The single-judge bench of Justice M N Bhandari issued the order on a petition by former   Sayam Lodha who had called the decision of the state government illegal and arbitrary.

 Puneet Singhvi, counsel for the petitioner, said the court agreed that the state government’s administrative order dated December 28, 2014 renaming Rajiv Gandhi Sewa Kendras as Atal Sewa Kendras was illegal.
 
 The petitioner contended that a Central gazette notification cannot be superseded by an administrative order of the state government. The court also suggested that in order to avoid such controversies in future, such schemes should be named after freedom fighters.
 
 Singhvi pointed out that the Central government, through an amendment to the National Rural Employment Act of 2005, made a provision for the construction of   as village knowledge resource centres and gram panchayat bhavans at the gram panchayat level, and it was promptly notified through an extraordinary gazette in 2009.
 
 
 
 
 Petitioner had also argued that both Rajiv Gandhi and   were former prime ministers and Bharat Ratna awardees and no disrespect should be shown to any of these respected personalities. The government decision has shown the late former PM Rajiv Gandhi in poor light. Besides, there should be sufficient reason to make such a change which had cost the state exchequer a significant amount. The petitioner said that barring Rajasthan, the name had not been changed in any other state.
