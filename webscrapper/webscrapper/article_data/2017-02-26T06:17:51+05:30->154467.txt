BENGALURU: After the state Congress unit released a diary, allegedly seized from former   treasurer, MLC Leher Singh Sisoriya containing entries of payments made by the Karnataka unit of the party to its central leadership, the leaders of the saffron party dismissed the allegations.

 KPCC working president Dinesh Gundu Rao told reporters on Saturday that the diary in question was seized by the income tax department in 2013. However, BJP spokesperson, and MLC Ashwathnarayan argued that the word, Namo had not been coined at the time when the diary in question was seized.
 
 “Narendra Modi was not the Prime Minister when the raid in question took place, and the diary was allegedly seized. He assumed the office of the Pm in 2014. Also, Namo, as a word had not been coined then. How can there be a diary with his name?“ Ashwathnarayan asked.
 
 Ashwathnarayan pointed out that Amit Shah and   were not part of the national leadership in 2013. “Sisoriya's diary is a fabrication,“ he added.
 
 “Sisoriya has made it clear that he did not maintain the diary, and the signature was forged,“ Ashwathnarayan said.
 
 Meanwhile, BJP MP from Bengaluru Central PC Mohan has written to the CBI, seeking an inquiry into charges of Rs 1,000 crore made by   leaders to the high command. The letter suggests that these payments were made during the 2015 Bihar elections, and for the BBMP elections.
