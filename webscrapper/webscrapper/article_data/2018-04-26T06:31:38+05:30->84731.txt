 CHENNAI: A 72-year-old British national awarded three years imprisonment by a   court two weeks ago for sexual abuse of a teenage boy in his NGO is suspected to have fled the country. While Adrian Philips, legal head of Justice and Care whose complaint led to Jonathan  's arrest in 2011, said he left for home on Wednesday, the Tirunelveli police said they were not sure. 

 Robinson was convicted on April 13 by Valliyoor judicial magistrate M Senthil Kumar and granted bail the same day as the sentence period was only three years and had now left the country without spending a day in jail, thanks to the loopholes in the criminal justice system, Adrian said.
 
 "It has been eight years of hard work and somebody who is convicted is never going to return," said Adrian, adding that he should be considered a fugitive now and efforts should be taken for his extradition.
 
 "We received an email from him saying he wishes to travel out of the country. We are not sure if he has left," D Kanagaraj, deputy superintendent of police, Valliyur told TOI. The police rescued the boy and other children from Jonathan's Grail Trust on August 16, 2011 and filed a case two days later. But the trial began only in May 2017 as Robinson managed to leave the country then too.
