And the reason is that he had never signed up for the project to begin with. This is the truth that   has, if we may say so, from the horse’s mouth.  , reportedly, was to bankroll the project with   (of 'Agneepath' fame) as the director. Hrithik and Malhotra even met a couple of times over the last few weeks, but a deal is yet to be cracked. 

 Reportedly, Saif Ali Khan’s daughter Sara was expected to play Hrithik’s leading lady, and had walked out of the project, too, leaving it shelved. But the truth is far from this. An insider, close to Hrithik, reveals. “Hrithik hasn’t signed the film to begin with, so how can he walk out of it? Some reports even claimed that the deal fell through because he demanded a hefty fee. But the industry knows that a script matters to him the most.” 
 
 Hrithik, in a recent interview to BT, had said, “We (Karan Malhotra and I) have spoken about it, but it’s not official. I haven’t signed the film yet.” 
 In the midst of conspiracy theories, when BT contacted Malhotra, he said, “I’d like to make it clear that the film hasn’t been shelved. It’s too early to say anything else.”
