MARGAO:The   party on Saturday defended it’s election manifesto as a ‘realistic election manifesto’ and not a election jhumla (empty promise) as that made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding providing ‘special status’ to Goa.

 Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee (HPCC) president Ashok Tanver along with All India Congress Committee (AICC) spokesperson Pawan Khera, Congress members Swati Kerkar, Avinash Tavares and others said that they had toured Goa, interacting with the public who are extremely annoyed with the many U-turns made by the state   government headed by chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar.
 
 While the Congress took a dig at BJP’s failure to declare their chief ministerial candidate for the upcoming 2017 polls, Congress leaders were themselves unable to announce their chief ministerial candidate. To this Tanver said, “Congress is one united family fighting together under a collective leadership to root out the BJP government in the state. Congress is the oldest party in the country and has many good, capable leaders (to be the Goa CM), but the Centre will decide (who Goa’s CM should be).” 
 
 “The Congress party believes in the democratic process and will arrive at a conclusion over it’s CM choice, unlike the BJP where the chief minister cannot take a single decision without consulting Union defense minister Manohar Parrikar. BJP national president Amit Shah and Union highways minister Nitin Gadkari are not convinced of Parsekar’s performance and hence, have already announced that their future Goa CM will be remote controlled from Delhi,” he said.
 
 Attacking both, the central and state BJP government over their failure to fulfill the various assurances made the electorate, Congress leaders said that they are hopeful that their party will form the government in all five poll-bound states due to ‘their policies of empowering the people’. They also reiterated that new entrant, the   (AAP), is actually BJP’s B-team.
