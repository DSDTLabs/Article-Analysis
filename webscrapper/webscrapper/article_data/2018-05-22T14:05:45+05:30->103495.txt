JAIPUR: The death of national bird, peacock listed under schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, has continued unabated in Rajasthan. After deaths were reported in   (STR) this month, a total 23 birds including 10 peacocks and 13 peahens were found dead under mysterious circumstances in Banswara district on Sunday.

 
 The reason of their deaths has not been ascertained yet. However, prima facie forest department officials believed poisonous water could be the reason of death.  , forest ranger at Banswara said, “Post-mortem of the carcasses was carried out on Monday at the government veterinary hospital. On Tuesday, viscera samples will be sent to Jaipur for examination to find the exact cause of the deaths.”
 
 The forest department initially had ruled out the chances of poisoning. In other parts of the state, during seed sowing season farmers generally sprinkle pesticide on which peacock feeds and then gets killed. However, forest department at Banswara claimed this trend is not practised. “There is no reason why villagers will kill these birds as crop is not sown yet and there is no threat of damage. Also, water is available in abundance in forest and possibilities of peacocks entering the field is negligible. In our area there are thousands of peacocks but such incidents are not common.”
 
 Animal activists in the state alleged that despite this high figure, the state government has failed to curb the increasing death toll of peacocks in the state. Many alleged that Rajasthan is no more a safe place for the peacocks, as daily cases of poaching are being reported from different parts of the state.
 
 Babu Lal Jaju, state coordinator, People for Animals ( ) alleged, “The reason for the constant rise in their deaths is that peacock is the only bird whose feathers are allowed to be sold. Peacocks are killed also rampantly for their meat. Since the police and forest department do not take any action, there is no fear among poachers.”
