Jr NTR,   and   starrer ‘Jai Lava Kusa’ has not just joined the Rs 100 Cr club; it has managed to rake in Rs 132 Cr worldwide in the seven days since its release on September 21, 2017. 

 
 
 The movie that has received rave reviews from audience and critics alike, especially for Jr NTR’s performance, has proved to be a smashing hit at the box office. This is the second film this year, so far, to be fetching in good revenues after Prabhas and Rana starrer ‘Baahubali 2’. Umair Sandhu, a trade analyst, posted on his social media, “#JaiLavaKusa is the 2nd Biggest Blockbuster of the Year after #Baahubali2. It collected Fantastic " 132 cr " Worldwide after 1st week.” (sic)
 
 ‘Jai Lava Kusa’ is directed by Bobby and produced by Jr NTR’s brother Kalyan Ram, and the actor enthralled audience by portraying three different avatars in the film. While the movie opened to good reviews, word of mouth portraying mixed reviews was expected to affect the film’s business for a while. 
 
 
 
 Having crossed the Rs 100 Cr mark within the week, ‘Jai Lava Kusa’ is now enters its second week. With the release of ‘Spyder’ on September 27, 2017 and ‘Mahanubhavudu’ on September 29, 2017, it remains to be seen if ‘Jai Lava Kusa’ will still go strong.
