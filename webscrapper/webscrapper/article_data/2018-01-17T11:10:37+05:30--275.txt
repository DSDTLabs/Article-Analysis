BENGALURU : While teens in rural   may exhibit poor foundational learning skills, their understanding of out-of-textbook contexts remains spot on, ‘Beyond Basics’, the   (ASER) for 2017, found. The report also found that the aspirations of students to study further were undeterred. 

 For the first time, ASER, which provides reliable estimates of children’s learning outcomes in rural districts of the country, focused on the educational status of youth between 14 and 18 years of age. It surveyed 1,084 teens from 60 different villages of Mysuru district, which has a literacy rate of 72%.
 
 The study found that the gap between foundation and ability continues to persist. One reason is, perhaps, because 18.3% of the teens surveyed in Mysuru district had not enrolled either in schools or colleges and a mere 11% were able to read a Class I textbook. On a slightly brighter note, 28.2% of them were able to perform subtraction and 20.3% were able to read a word.
  
  
 Yet, when it came to deciphering their general financial knowledge, 82.9% of the youth were able to count money and 61.8% were able to manage a budget. In all, 96% of the youth surveyed were able to recognize the map of India, 70% of them were able to name India’s capital and over 82% of them were able to identify their own state on a map. This suggests a high understanding of general knowledge.
 
 This, however, was in stark contrast to more than half (50.8%) of the youth being unable to read and understand three out of four instructions. Also, boys seemed to outperform girls in most categories.
 
 The report found that nearly 38% of the Mysuru youth in the age group of 17-18 aren’t enrolled in either schools or colleges. However, 50.2% of youth in the same age bracket have worked in the last 15 days besides tending to household work. While 8.2% students between 14 and 16 years has not enrolled in school, 47.4% of them were engaged in non-household related work.
