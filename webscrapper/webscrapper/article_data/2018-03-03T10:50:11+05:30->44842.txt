SALEM:   Rajya Sabha MP T K Rangarajan on Friday demanded the central government to order a   inquiry into the drowning of five Salem-based tribal workers in   district in  . “A full-fledged CBI inquiry would bring all the hidden facts behind the tragedy into light,” he said.

 A six-member team of the central committee of the CPM, led by Rangarajan, visited Kerangkadu and Keelaavarai villages near Karumandurai on Friday to inquire with the family members of the tribal workers, who lost their lives in AP. The team also comprised senior leaders A Soundarrajan and P Ramamoorthy, former MLAs U   and P Dellibabu and state committee member P Shanmugam. Salem district functionaries of the party also accompanied the team. The team members met all the five families in Kerangkadu and Keelaavarai villages. They also consoled the family members of the victims. 
 
 Speaking to reporters, Rangarajan said migrant workers especially from Tamil Nadu were being killed under suspicious manner in Andhra Pradesh and other states. 
 
 “Tribals are the major victims of red sanders mafia,” he said. He said touts and agents lure these tribal workers by giving false promises of getting jobs in pepper plucking works or plantation estates. But, the tribals were forced to chop red sanders. “When they refused to do so, the touts and their henchmen torture these tribal men,” Rangarajan said. This menace should be curbed, he added.
 
 Rangarajan also urged the state government to initiate talks with the Andhra Pradesh government to prevent deaths of tribals in future. He also demanded the state government to issue Rs 25 lakh as solatium to kin of each of the five workers.
