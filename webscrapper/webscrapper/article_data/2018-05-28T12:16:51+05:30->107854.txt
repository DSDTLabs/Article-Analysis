TRICHY: The Uyyakondan canal cleanup campaign that began in January marked its 20th week on Sunday, with authorities successfully completing works along three stretches in the district.The campaigners completed the works on Uzhavar Sandhai-Maruti Hospital stretch near MGR roundabout, half a kilometre at   and from behind the collectorate to SBI Officers’ Colony. 

 
 Over the course of the next few weeks, the volunteers have planned tree plantation on the banks of the canal, treatment of sewage water and conducting awareness about the cleanup drive by organising street plays. The drive was launched on the first Sunday of January this year to clean the centuries-old canal every weekend with over 100 volunteers from various walks of life taking part in it.

One of the volunteers of Citizens of Uyyakondan, Manoj Dharmar, said that a walking track has been setup at the   roundabout stretch where the cleanup drive has been done.
 
 “We don’t intend to stop work after cleaning up the canal and preventing plastic wastes dumping. But we need it turn into an entirely habitable eco-system by planting trees along its bank,” he told B. Manoj said that the team had been working towards treating the sewage water and conducting water testing in few weeks’ time. “Not only that, we would want to reach out to the masses in a better way. Hence we would be conducting a street play next Sunday,” he said.
