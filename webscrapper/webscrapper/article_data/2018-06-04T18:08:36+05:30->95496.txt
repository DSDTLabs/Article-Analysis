MARGAO: A coconut tree fell on the tiled roof of a house at Shirvodem,  , in the early hours on Thursday during the heavy downpour.

 The occupants of the house, septuagenarian   and his wife   (in her 60s), had a miraculous escape, with the latter sustaining minor injuries on her arms. 
 
 “My mother, Zaibun, woke up when the power went off at around 1.30am. She went to the next room and within minutes, the coconut tree crashed onto the roof above the bedroom. It was sheer divine providence that saved them,” said the couple’s daughter,  , who rushed from   with her teenaged children, to see her aged parents.
 
 The bedroom, dining room, kitchen and main pillar of the hall were severely damaged.
