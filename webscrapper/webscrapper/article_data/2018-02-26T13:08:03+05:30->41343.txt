MYSURU:   D Randeep was visibly upset with the officials for the delay in allowing public to use the swimming pool at the Chamundi Vihar Stadium.

 While the project was delayed for over five years, people are not allowed to use it even after being inaugurated recently.
 
 On February 20, replying to a tweet, Randeep tweeted that if the pool was not ready in another two days, the district administration will take over and action will be taken against officials concerned.
 
 Within two days the authorities managed to take up registrations for the practice pool and baby pool and 42 people registered their names. But the 50-metre competitive pool, which was inaugurated by chief minister   six months ago, is yet to open for public.
 
 Randeep, who inspected the pool on Sunday, called upon the Department of Youth Empowerment and Sports to open the entire facility for public by March 5.
 
 Randeep told TOI, “The reason for delay is that it took time to get qualified life guards and trainers.” Regarding hike in fee structure, Randeep said, “The pool doesn’t get any revenue, they should run the show with the money they get and hence the fee is on the higher side. If there is lukewarm response, we will think over reducing the fee.”
 
 Siddaramaiah, who had sanctioned the international standard pool when he was the deputy chief minister 13 years ago, inaugurated the facility on July 15, 2017. The administrative approval for construction of pool came in 2012-13.
