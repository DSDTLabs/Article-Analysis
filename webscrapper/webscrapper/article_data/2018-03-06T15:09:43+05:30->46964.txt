PUNE: The proposed ropeway between the   and the foothills is expected to receive   soon, trimming the journey time to just 5-7 minutes.

 The ropeway, which will be built using the technology from Australian, had been on the backburner for many years. Once approved, it will become the second after the one at Raigad fort to come up in the state.
 
 “Visitors will no longer have to brace the huge traffic jams and bad roads to reach the fort. Once the ropeway is in place, they will be able to reach the fort in 5-7 minutes,”   CEO Kiran Gitte said on Monday.
 
 He said the ropeway will be on the lines of the one at Raigad and will be operated by a group of private developers. “The total investment expected for the project is Rs 116 crore,” Gitte added. “It will be developed in a phased manner after the clearance,” he said.
 
 The ropeway project was discussed at the recent Magnetic Maharashtra summit, which was held in Mumbai.
 
 The proposed ropeway is expected to start from Atkarwadi village (foothills of Sinhagad) to Doordarshan towers, Gitte said, adding that the forest department has already given its clearance for the 1,800 meter ropeway project.
 
 The Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) will give clearance for 5-7 hectares of land acquisition at the foothills from Atkarwadi village, besides other clearances, Gitte added.
 
 Union minister Nitin Gadkari had pitched for a vast network of ropeways and stated that the implementation of such projects would be a game changer for the transport system.
