Panaji:   ( ) mahila morcha president   on Saturday said there is not a single woman member with the morcha who could have been a candidate for the February 4  .

 Asked whether injustice was being done to women with only one ticket given to a woman candidate in BJP, Sawant said there was no question of injustice.
 
  “When it comes to elections, the party always considers whether a person is likely to win as a candidate, irrespective of their gender,” she said. BJP has given a ticket to incumbent Cortalim MLA and RDA minister Alina Saldanha.
 
 She also said that   will always fight for the 33% reservation for women in politics.
 
 Questioned why the mahila morcha did not support former zilla panchayat member Shilpa Naik who was trying to acquire a BJP ticket to contest from Bicholim, Sawant avoided the question saying it is the parliamentary board who takes a call on candidates for the elections. 
 
 “Naik did not make a representation to mahila morcha for ticket,” she added.
