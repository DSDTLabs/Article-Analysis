NASHIK: A resident of Panchvati has pointed out a discrepancy in the educational qualifications of   candidate from prabhag 3 Machhindra   based on the affidavits he filed in 2012 and the upcoming elections.

 Sachin Daptare lodged a written complaint against Machhindra, son of BJP city chief and MLA Balasaheb Sanap, with the returning officer alleging misleading information about his educational qualifications. 
 
 In his complaint with the returning officer Ajay Charthankar, Daptare has said in the 2012 civic polls Machhindra had filed the nomination as an independent candidate. 
 
 “In 2012 civic polls, he had mentioned his educational qualification as standard X pass in 1996 from Sriram Vidyalay, Panchavati. In the affidavit filed this year, Sanap has mentioned his educational qualification as standard V pass in 1996 from Kakasaheb Deshmukh Vidyalay, Panchavati. Kakasaheb Deshmukh Vidyalay was earlier known as Maharashtra Vidyalay managed by  ,” alleged Daptare.
 
 Balasaheb Sanap insisted that his son studied in Kakasaheb Deshmukh Vidyalay. “It was Pune Vidyarthigruha earlier. Now, it is renamed as Kakasaheb Deshmukh Vidyalay,” Balasaheb said.
 
 Machhindra initially denied filing nomination form during the 2012 civic election. After being quizzed, he admitted that he had filed the nomination but withdrew from the race before the 2012 polls.
 
 Machhindra said, “I have completed standard VI from Kakasaheb Deshmukh Vidyalay. Frankly, I cannot remember what I had written in the educational qualification column in my last affidavit.” 
 
 Charthankar said it is not necessary for the RO to cross-check the validity of the affidavits submitted by the candidates. He said there is nothing much he can do about the complaint at this juncture.
 
 “Such objections should have been raised during the scrutiny of the nomination papers. We will be writing to Daptare apprising him about the election commission’s guidelines on such issues,” he added.
