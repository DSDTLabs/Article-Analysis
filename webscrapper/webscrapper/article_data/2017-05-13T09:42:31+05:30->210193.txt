HUBBALLI:   of Banahatti, Jamkhandi taluk in Bagalkot district, was relaxed and confident when the SSLC exams began, and scored 625 marks.

 But this success did not come easy -she dedicated 4-5 hours a day for study, before and after school. The Kannada-medium student of SRA High School, Banahatti, told TOI, “I didn't take any chances but started revising each lesson the day it was taught in school. I'd do my homework and followed a strict timetable through the academic year. I didn't spend much time studying when the exam neared.“
 
 Pallavi took tuitions for English as she found it difficult to under stand some lessons, while maths was her favourite subject. “All my teachers helped me with their time. Our family is involved in weaving and some financial problems. Despite that, my parents always encouraged me to do well in studies.“ Pallavi wants to be a doctor and serve the poor in villages.
 
 Pallavi's mother Bharati said, “Since childhood, Pallavi has been a bright student and worked very hard for SSLC. But we never expected she would be a state topper.“
 
 M M Homberdi, headmaster of  , said, “Pallavi is a hardworking student and never missed class. She would take suggestions and help from teachers when she found a lesson difficult. It's a really happy moment for us.“
