Noida: The homebuyers association of Noida Extension on Friday started an online poll for voters of Gautam Budh Nagar. It has sought responses from aggrieved homebuyers till February 10 about how many of them are willing to cast a   (None Of The Above) vote in the upcoming assembly polls.

 The online poll is part of Noida Extension Flat Owners Welfare Association’s ( ) ongoing social media campaign #NoHouseNoVote that is aimed at dissuading aggrieved homebuyers from voting in the assembly election slated for February 11 in the district. However, the online poll is only for those buyers who have invested in Noida Extension apartments and have voting rights in Gautam Budh Nagar.
 
 “We have initiated the online poll to get a realistic estimate of how many people may finally cast NOTA vote in the upcoming polls. The entire campaign has been driven to discourage aggrieved homebuyers from participating in election as no political party has taken up their cause,” Abhishek Kumar, president of Nefowa, told TOI.
 
 Nefowa said it had expected delivery of at least 1 lakh apartments by 2016, but so far only over 10,000 apartments have been handed over to homebuyers in the region.
