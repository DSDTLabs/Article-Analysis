JAIPUR:   on Tuesday summoned   ( ) chairman over failure to submit full report on the recruitment of school lecturers' examination 2013. 

 The division bench of Chief Justice Pradeep Nandrajog and G R Moolchandani order followed an appeal petition by the RPSC.
 
 The HC in September 2015 asked the RPSC to conduct the recruitment based on the revised answer key instead of the first one due to dispute over some questions.
 
 However, the RPSC filed an appeal against the single bench order on the ground that already appointments have been made based on the first merit list and he high court order would unsettle whole process of appointment.
 
 The division bench then asked the RPSC to furnish the detailed report on all the questions and answer keys. But the RPSC only filed report only on disputed questions which had not satisfied the court. The court then asked the chairman to be personally present in the court on January 25.
