PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The Khadki and   cantonment boards (KCB and DCB) are staring at yearly losses of Rs 10.41 crore and Rs 23 crore respectively with the scrapping of   (VEF) and octroi. While the KCB used to charge only VEF till June 30, the DCB would levy both VEF and octroi. Both boards have no information about whether the union finance ministry will compensate them for this loss.

 KCB had started allotting contracts for vehicle entry fee (VEF) collection in 2009. The highest VEF contract bid that the board received for 2017-18 was Rs 10.41 crore, which it stands to lose now.
 
 It has now sought guidance from the principal director of defence estates (PDDE),   on the matter.
 
 Amol Jagtap, chief executive officer (CEO), KCB said, “Jojneswar Sharma, director general of defence estates (DGDE), New Delhi during his visit to Khadki around a week ago had informed that the defence ministry is trying to get compensation from the Union finance ministry for the cantonments.”
 
 For the DCB, octroi was the major source of income, even after its abolition in the municipal corporations and councils in the state as the board had its own octroi department and staff. DCB justified its octroi collection as it was governed by the Cantonments Act and defence ministry rules, under which it could collect octroi in its limits.
 
 Shrirang Sawant, office superintendent of DCB said, “We received around Rs 22 crore from octroi, VEF and other charges last year. Collection of octroi, VEF and other charges was stopped from July 1 causing a big loss of revenue to the cantonment. We were expecting to rake in around Rs 23 crore in 2017-18 from octroi, VEF and transit fees this year.”
 
 If the cantonments are not compensated by the Union government for the loss in revenue, their income will reduce significantly leaving lesser amount for implementing civic development works.
