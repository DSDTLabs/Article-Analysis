NEW DELHI: International Finance Corporation ( ), a part of the  , has finalised plans to provide fresh funding of close to $1 billion (over Rs 6,400 crore) for affordable green homes, including creation of a joint pool of $800 million (over Rs 5,100 crore) with   (PNBHFL).

 
 The pool, for which a part of the funds will be raised through Masala bond issue, will finance the construction of affordable homes. IFC is also in negotiations with two other housing finance companies to invest another $150 million (around Rs 1,000 crore), as well as with property developers to aid the  , sources told TOI. This comes on top of the $800 million facility IFC created with HDFC last year to fund construction of affordable homes.
 
 "There is a major demand for affordable homes and it creates a virtuous cycle and creates jobs," said Mengistu Alemayehu, IFC's South Asia director. He said that IFC had identified affordable housing as a focus sector and the funding will meet only a small part of the demand but it will help encourage institutions to do more in that area.
 
 He said that the construction of affordable homes generates jobs, which creates income and further demand, apart from providing fillip to demand for cement and steel.
 
 Excluding PNBHFL, IFC has invested $550 million in six affordable housing finance and construction companies and several other partnerships are in the pipeline.
 
 Of the pool with PNB Housing Finance, $400 million will come via a masala bond issue by the mortgage player. Of this, $150 will come from IFC, which will be the anchor investor to help mobilise the remaining $250 million from other players. PNB Housing Finance will provide the remaining $400 million for the pool.
 
 The funds will be used to finance retail buyers and developers of affordable green housing in line with the PMAY scheme and to developers of green buildings. This proposal with now go to the IFC board for approval, said sources.
