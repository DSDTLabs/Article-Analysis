In terms of exports, construction of the Madurai-Tuticorin Industrial Corridor; Maduravoyal elevated express highway and   international airport in Chennai will do a lot towards boosting TN’s economy.

 Many of these projects have been on the anvil for more than a decade and the government needs to clear the bottlenecks. Yearly, the Tirupur knitwear industry exports ₹26,000 crore worth of goods — 90% via ship and 10% airlifted.
 
 Construction of the Maduravoyal elevated express highway, will improve traffic towards Ennore/Kattupalli ports and reduce congestion at Chennai harbour. Periphery ports today are underutilised and do not handle much commercial cargo; mother ships do not berth at the smaller ports but only at Chennai or Visakhapatnam. Development of infrastructure will prove a huge boost to the logistics, warehousing and exports. The   would help manufacturers in Tirupur, Madurai,   by cutting down on transportation time. The state government should carry out more road shows and investment meets to attract foreign and domestic investors.
