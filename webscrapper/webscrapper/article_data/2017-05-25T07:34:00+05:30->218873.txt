Gurgaon: A local court has refused to release the passport of former Haryana minister Sukhbir Kataria, who is facing trial in a case related to the fake voter list scam.

 Kataria has been facing trials under sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (Using a forged document as genuine) and 120B (conspiracy) of the IPC since July 2014 for using forged and fake documents to prepare bogus voter lists to win the 2009 Assembly elections. His passport was impounded by the police last year after an FIR was registered at Sector 5 police station.
 
 Out on bail, Kataria filed an application before civil judge (junior division) Sukhdev Singh on May 19, requesting him to release his passport. In his application, the former minister claimed that his son Nitish had completed his bachelors in law (LLB) from Maharshi Dayanand University in Rohtak. Now, Kataria wants to take his son abroad for admission to a foreign university for higher studies. 
 
 Hearing the plea, the court then sought replies from the police and the state government on the application submitted by the former minister.
 
 In reply, the police requested the court to not release Kataria’s passport. During investigation, it was found that Kataria’s son Nitish has not cleared his bachelor’s degree, and is accused of cheating during exams. “Nitish, who has not cleared his bachelor’s degree, is not eligible for higher studies,” stated the police report.
 
 Taking note of the police report, the court on Tuesday rejected the application and pulled up the former minister for misleading the court.
 
 Kataria could not be contacted for comments.
