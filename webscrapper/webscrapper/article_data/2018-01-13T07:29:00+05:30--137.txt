AMRITSAR: Throwing his weight behind former   ( ), Rajneesh  ,   leader and former   minister Anil Joshi alleged that he was arrested for breaking the spine of education mafia that was operating on a large scale in the field of distance education till 2012 and that a   investigation should be carried out to look into PTU’s functioning.

 In a release issued here on Friday, Joshi alleged even the   (UGC) had taken note of several gross violations but the education mafia had continued to operate till Arora began tightening noose around them.
 
 Joshi alleged that many officials in the distance education and examination branch of the PTU had issued a large number of fake degrees during 2010-2012 through distance education by opening more than 2,500 learning centres across various states in India.
 
 While demanding a CBI probe in the scam, he alleged that a scandal on such a large scale couldn’t take place without the patronage of top officials and when Arora plugged the loophole, they conspired against him after the change of government in Punjab.
