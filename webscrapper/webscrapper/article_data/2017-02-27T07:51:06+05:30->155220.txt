NEW DELHI: Fates of 335 candidates vying for the 46 seats of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) were decided on Sunday after more than 1.75 lakh   appeared in 560 polling booths across the capital. DSGMC is a 55-member body with 46 elected members, 10 gurdwaras and 30 educational institutions under its jurisdiction.

 The final voter turnout this year was 45.76%, with a noticeable rise in women voters. Out of 3,80,091 registered voters, 1,75,523 votes were polled. Out of these, 88,713 were male voters while over 86 thousand were female.   recorded the highest turnout at 65.98% while the lowest was Santgarh ward with 26.14%.
 
 Apart from the two traditional parties, Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) and Shiromani Akali Dal Delhi, a new contestant ‘Panthak Seva Dal’ also participated.
 
 The current president of DSGPC from SAD Badal, Manjit Singh GK, complained about voter-rolls revision leading to many “genuine votes being cut”. “Some of our supporters, who are genuine voters, were barred from voting. Nevertheless, we expect to get more than 37 seats out of 46,” he said. Paramjit Singh Sarna who leads SAD Delhi also seemed confident, “We expect to win 35-36 seats”.
 
 The directorate of gurdwara elections had designated 119 polling booths to be “sensitive”, while 63 booths had been marked as “hyper-sensitive”. Over 8,000 Delhi Police personnel were deployed and no major violence was reported. “There were minor scuffles at few centres but overall the elections went by peacefully,” said Vikas Ahlawat, the officer on special duty.
 
 Counting of the votes polled on Sunday will be carried out on 1st march and results should be out by 3-4pm, said an official from the directorate.
