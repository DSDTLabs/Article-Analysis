Panaji: In a record of sorts for the state, the two district consumer disputes redressal forums have disposed of more than 100 complaints in the month of August. The North Goa forum alone cleared 83 complaints, thus reducing the pendency of cases from 254 to 180 in a single month. The appointment of presidents and members at both forums on full-time positions for the very first time in July this year has been a boon for aggrieved consumers whose cases were otherwise heard by presidents and members who worked on part-time basis. Since July, the two full-time presidents and members have disposed of close to 150 cases, including some pending as far back as 2007. The pendency of cases in both forums has now been brought down to 325 as compared to 435 cases since they were appointed. The cases disposed of relate to general insurance, banking, medical treatment, investments, housing society and construction matters, among others. Last month, nine fresh complaints were filed with the forum in North Goa and eight in South Goa.  Consumers approach the two district forums if the cost of goods and services, or the compensation they ask for, is less than Rs 20 lakh.  Consumers can go in appeal to the Goa state consumer disputes redressal commission at Junta House, Panaji and can also directly approach the commission in cases where the value of goods or services is greater than Rs 20 lakh, but less than Rs 1 crore.  The commission disposed six complaints in August. Consumers can approach national consumer disputes redressal commission, New Delhi, if value of goods or services is over Rs 1 crore.
