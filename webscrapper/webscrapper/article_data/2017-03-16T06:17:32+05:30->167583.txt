INDORE: With a rise in the menace of   on streets, IMC commissioner   on Tuesday issued fresh orders to keep the city free of stray   by having them sent to the IMC cowshed. At least seven teams have been constituted to address the issue.

 “The civic body has given cattle owners till March 20 to move their sheds and cattle to the outer limits of the city. It does not mean that they have been given the liberty to allow their cattle to roam freely in the city till then. The teams will visit different areas of the city and catch stray cattle and send them to the IMC cowshed,” said  , deputy commissioner, IMC
 
 He said close to 150 IMC employees are involved in the drive. All seven teams are working in different parts of the city.

Each team is provided with two loading trucks and other required equipment.
 
 Chauhan said cattle owners are allowed to rear only one cow and one calf within the city limits. “Every owner will need to inform the IMC about rearing cattle by providing and affidavit and Rs100 stamp. An IMC official will inspect the location and permission will be given accordingly,” Chauhan said.
 
 Learning from the past and to avoid any untoward situations with cattle owners, the team leaders were suggested to report any conflicts to the police control room and IMC control room immediately.
 
 “We have made arrangements to protect our team members. The drive continued smoothly as cattle owners are allowing the civic body to continue their work,” Chauhan said. He added that only one person was handed over to the police.
