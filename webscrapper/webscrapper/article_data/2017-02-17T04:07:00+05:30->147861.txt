Nagpur: Chartered accountants (CAs) have raised concerns over the proposed amendment in Finance Act exempting the   department from disclosing reasons before the appellate tribunal for conducting a raid against any person. This will give a free hand to the income tax’s investigation wing, leading to inspector raj, said tax practitioners.

 “To make it worse, the amendment has been made effective from 1975 onwards. The root cause is a case filed by an assessee in the Supreme Court following a search in 1974. Now, tax officials need not disclose any reason for searches conducted in last over 40 years,” said Kailash Jogani, a chartered accountant and president of Nagpur Chamber of Commerce Limited (NCCL).
 
 The assessee should have the right to know the reasons why a search has been carried out against him. There have been instances when Commissioner of Income Tax (CIT) Appeals or the Income Tax Appellete Tribunal (ITAT) had asked the investigation wing to disclose basis of action. The proposed amendment does not make the taxman liable to disclose the reasons to either of the authorities, he said.
 
 At times, the search conducted by department’s investigation wing fails. In such cases, the assessee files an appeal complaining of harassment. Often, the investigation wing is asked to disclose reasons for conducting the search. With no accountability till the ITAT, there is a likelihood that searches may be conducted to victimize people, said Julfesh Shah, who heads the economic advisory council of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI).
 
 Rajesh Loya, former chairman of ICAI’s Nagpur branch, said under the new law reasons for conducting the search can only be disclosed before the high court. If the case is lost at the ITAT, it can be further appealed till Supreme Court.
 
 “In case of CIT-Appeals, there was always an argument from the investigation wing side that the commissioner is of a lower rank and the search is approved by an officer of director general rank. So the CIT-Appeals asking for disclosure of reasons for the search can amount to questioning higher officer’s authority,” said Loya.
 
 Once a search is conducted, the assessee can start filing an appeal before the CIT-Appeals going till the Supreme Court.
