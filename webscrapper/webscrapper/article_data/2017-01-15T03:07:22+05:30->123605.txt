NEW DELHI: The   has asked chief ministers, ministers as well as political appointees to statutory bodies in the five poll-bound states not to hear appeals filed by the people under existing Acts and laws until the poll process is complete.

 In a missive sent on Saturday to the chief secretaries and chief electoral officers (CEOs) of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand and Manipur, the poll watchdog opined that such appeals could give the ruling party an unfair advantage.
 
 “Since the model code of conduct has come into force after announcement of the general election to legislative assembly of your state on January 4, 2017, any such hearings by CM or minister or politically appointed officer bearers of statutory bodies may have direct or indirect influence on voters and disturb the levelplaying field,” the   stated in its communication to the pollbound states. 
 
 While directing all such hearings to be deferred till polling concludes in all the constituencies of the state, the EC, however, left a window open for “hearings in compliance with mandatory provisions of law/a court order”.
 
 “If any such hearing is required... such hearing in lieu of CM/minister or politicallyappointed office bearers of statutory bodies, should be held by a secretary level officer nominated by the chief secretary of the state, where the law provides for delegation of power to such officer,” it stated.
 
 In yet another letter on Saturday, the EC also reminded the chief secretaries and CEOs of the poll-bound states about the ban on sale and distribution of liquor within 48 hours prior to the poll.
 
 EC also barred sale, storage and consumption of liquor during the counting exercise. “The Commission is of the considered view that in the interest of free, fair and peaceful conduct of election process, the date on which counting of votes is to be taken-...should also be declared a ‘Dry Day’ under the relevant laws in the state,” it stated.
