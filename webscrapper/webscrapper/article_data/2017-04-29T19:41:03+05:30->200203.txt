ISLAMABAD: In an unusual move, Pakistan's powerful army on Saturday "rejected" Pakistan Prime Minister  's decision to sack his trusted 
  for "leaking" information to the media, saying his action is "incomplete".

 Nawaz Sharif approved an inquiry committee's recommendation to remove Fatemi, the special assistant on foreign affairs, from his post after he was found guilty of "leaking" information to the media about a 
  during a high-level security meet.
 
 Hours after the Pakistan Prime Minister's Office issued the directive, the   said the Army had rejected the notification, calling it 'incomplete'.
 
 
 In October, a columnist for Dawn newspaper wrote 
  between civilian and military leaderships over militant groups that operate from Pakistan but engage in proxy war against India and Afghanistan.
 
 The army took strong exception to the Dawn story and relations between army and the civil government deteriorated.
 
 The PML-N government was forced to remove then information minister Pervaiz Rasheed but a probe was also initiated at the demand of army to fix the responsibility. The report was submitted to the prime minister this week.
 
 According to the inquiry report, Fatemi was primarily responsible for leaking the report of the key meeting, and Sharif took action against him.
 
 Analysts have termed the cropping of differences as detrimental to the civil-military relationship.
 
 "The government should move fast to address the grievances of the army and fully implement the findings of the report," former Air Marshal Shehzad Chaudhry told Geo TV.
