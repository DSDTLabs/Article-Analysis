AHMEDABAD: A   before   on Wednesday challenged state government’s decision to   from Jamnagar’s Gurugobind Singh Government Hospital as patients were not getting proper treatment in the hospital.

 Petitioner Harshad Pabari has requested the high court to direct   and health commissioner to ensure presence of doctors in adequate numbers so that patients can be taken care of. 
 
 A bench of Chief Justice RS Reddy and Justice VM Pancholi sought from the government details of strength and vacancies in the Jamnagar hospital. Further hearing is posted on February 1, said petitioner’s advocate Pratik Jasani.
 
 Petitioner submitted that on December 9, the state government transferred 43 doctors from the hospital to different places and the vacant posts have not been filled since. This has resulted into improper functioning in the 1,300-bed hospital, where there are 23 different departments. The inflow of patients on an average is over 3,500 with around 700 indoor patients per day.
