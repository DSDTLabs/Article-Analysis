BENGALURU:   national president   
  exuded confidence that his party will be back in power with an absolute majority and bag 130 seats or more. 

 
 “Over the last one month, I have travelled over 50,000 km in the state. And every time the media kept asking me about the number of seats BJP would secure. Today, based on the feedback from BJP workers, I can confidently tell you that we will come back to power with 130 seats and more,” Shah told a press conference in Bengaluru. 
 
 On an alliance with JD(S) in case his party fails to get the required number, Shah said there is no question of any alliance as the party is confident of securing absolute majority.
 
 Shah also hinted that the 'rising star' of   BJP, B Sreeramulu, may very well become the deputy chief minister. “I would only say this much, when we achieve victory, all the leaders from the party will sit together and have a frank discussion on all possibilities,” he said.
 
 On whether Yeddyurappa will remain the CM for the entire five-ear term, considering his age and the previous experience of the party having three CMs between 2008 and 2013, Shah said there is no doubt that Yeddyurappa will be CM for the whole tenure.
 
 “Last time, at the Centre, there was a government which was keen on bringing down state governments. This time, the   government at the Centre will stand by Yeddyurappa like a mountain and he will complete his term if BJP comes to power,” said Shah.
 
 On AICC president Rahul Gandhi indicating his readiness to become PM, Shah said: “There is no harm in him aspiring. His aspirations of becoming PM have as much a chance as any common man at this point of time.” Shah said Congress’ ideology was to join hands with communal forces and anti-national outfits like SDPI and PFI.
