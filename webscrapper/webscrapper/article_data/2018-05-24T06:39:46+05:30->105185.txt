HYDERABAD: The total number of engineering seats in private   was slashed by 15,000 for the academic year 2018-19. This was confirmed by   registrar N Yadaiah. Only 82,000 B Tech seats will be available this academic year, against 97,961 seats last year. The verdict on 17 colleges with less than 25% admissions for the past five years, is yet to be out. 

 
 " Despite the   giving its nod to allow colleges with less than 25% admissions to offer courses, JNTU-H officials are not ready to clear them. So, the 17 colleges have approached the court. It is likely that judgement will come in favour of the colleges," said  , President, Telangana Engineering Colleges Management Association. 
 
 For pharmacy courses, about 1,000 B Pharmacy seats will be reduced this year as 15 colleges did not make the cut. But for  , all the 52 colleges will continue to offer the course.
 
 The college managements said the varsity officials have checked for lab deficiencies and verified qualification of all the principals of the private colleges in the last one week and added that most of them have been granted affiliation for the academic year 2018-19.
 
 The engineering and pharmacy counselling will begin on May 25 and the first phase of counselling is expected to be completed by June 8 and second phase by the first week of July. The new academic session will most likely begin from June 16.
