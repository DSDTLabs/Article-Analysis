NAGPUR: Apart from using potable water to douse fire, the   ( ) also uses drinking water in suction jetting machines to flush city’s choked drains and sewerage lines.

 On an average, every day the NMC’s sanitation department attends to at least 8-10 complaints pertaining to choked drains and sewer line with 10 suction jetting machines (one each with 10 zones) with a capacity of 3,000 litres each. This means, it uses over 74.88 lakh litres water per annum.
 
 However, now onwards, the NMC will use ‘contaminated’   to flush choked drains and sewerage lines, said health officer (sanitation) Dr  .
 
 According to Dr Dasarwar, the decision was taken by additional municipal commissioner   and it will be implemented from tomorrow.
 
 Currently, the department fills water from either elevated storage reservoir or from hydrants of the fire department.
 
 On the contrary, the fire department attends to at least 10 dewatering of wells in the city every day and they drain the water in drains. This contaminated water will be used by the health department by using pumps and will be used for flushing of blockages in sewerage lines, said Dr  .
 
 One ESR has a capacity to store 22 lakh litres of water and can caters to 15,000 consumers, which means 2.4 lakh people can get water supply in a single day. “This way, we will save potable water to a great extent,” he said.
 
 A spokesperson from Orange City Water, the private firm entrusted with supplying water in city limits, said, “Such tankers were filling potable water from NMC-OCW hydrant. After this came to light, we now don’t allow such tankers to fill water from our hydrant in any case. We have strictly instructed tanker supervisor and security personnel to stop such tankers to take potable water.”
