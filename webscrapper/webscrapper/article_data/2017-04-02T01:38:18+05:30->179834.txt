The   has however counter complained that the threat mails were sent out by the school management by hacking into its account. 

 Jesus Lall, chairman of Universal High School registered a complaint with Dahisar police station against Forum for Fairness in Education, an NGO, which is often approached by parents in times of a fee  . “I received an email on my official email ID from fairnessineducation@gmail.com asking us to transfer Rs 25 lakh to the account of the NGO. I promptly replied saying that the request won’t be entertained. After this, I received an email with details of an unnamed bank account and was told that if I acted otherwise the author will continue and escalate the fight against me and the school,” said Lall.
 
 Officials from the Dahisar police station said a case of attempt to extort was registered. “We are verifying the email id, finding out who uses it and will proceed with the investigation,” said an official. 
 
 However,  , president of the forum has denied the allegations and claimed that the account was hacked by the school to set him up. “I have received a security alert from Google on my alternate email at 2 am on Monday stating that the forum’s email was accessed from an android phone. I suspect it is done by the school management because I created awareness among the parents on how they were being overcharged. The school has been collecting fees which are illegal,” said Jain. He has complained to the Mumbai cybercrime cell.
 
 Lall has however denied the allegation. “The forum is trying to extort money from schools by instigating parents. Jain does not advice parents to sort out fee hike issues through discussions with the management or approaching courts because that will not serve his ulterior motives,” said Lall.
