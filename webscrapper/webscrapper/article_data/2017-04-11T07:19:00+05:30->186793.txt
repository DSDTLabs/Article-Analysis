PATIALA: Patiala MP Dr   has announced to challenge the Punjab accord or Rajiv-Longowal accord that was signed between the then Prime Minister   and then   president Harcharan Singh Longowal before the Supreme Court.

 Questioning the legal sanctity of the accord, Dr Gandhi said it was invalid as Longowal was the head of a political party and thus had no legal right to sign any agreement with the government or the Prime Minister. He said the main purpose to file the petition against the Punjab Accord was to fight against the injustice done to Punjab on the river water issues, especially the Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal.
 
 Dr Gandhi said, “Longowal was not at all authorized to sign the agreement, and I am going to fight the case of Punjab in the Supreme Court by taking along senior most advocates. Longowal had no locus standi. We are in the process of collecting more papers about the agreement. The SYL issue has been raised many a times by courts, political parties, governments and neighbouring states. However, other issues like giving Chandigarh to Punjab, All India Gurdwara Act, rehabilitation of deserter soldiers during   and others mentioned in the Punjab Accord had been completely ignored.”
 
 “The riparian principles were also ignored while reorganizing Punjab. I will also challenge in court the sections and various clauses of the act that are invalid. We will raise separately other provisions and demands mentioned in the Punjab Accord in favour of the state. The injustice is done to Punjab first in 1955 and then in 1966 during reorganization when the rights of Punjab over water and hydro-electric projects were given to non-riparian states under Sections 78, 79 and 80 of Punjab Re-organization Act that were in contravention,” he said.
