SURAT: The concept of rural mall, mooted a couple of years ago, began to take a firm shape at Vees Daliya village of   taluka of Surat district a month ago. 

 The rural mall, which is supported by the forest department, provides employment to 70 Kotwaliya tribals. The focus of the rural mall project is economic development of rural areas by converting community facility centres into enterprise facility centres. 
 
  belong to a small primitive group and have around 1,200 houses in Dang, Tapi and Surat districts. They are experts in making bamboo furniture. 
 
 “They have been making bamboo furniture, but lack marketing infrastructure,” DFO, Surat forest division,   said. There are 32 villages under this area and the forest division plans to make each of these villages self-sufficient within three years. 
 
 A joint forest management committee (JFMC) was formed three years ago with the support of Surat forest department. 
 
 This JFMC set up a bamboo craft shop and a workshop where over 70 Kotwaliya tribals now make more than 135 varieties of bamboo items, including furniture. 
 
 “We are happy that in the last one year we were able to sell Rs 21 lakh worth of bamboo items, helping each worker earn a monthly income of Rs 15,000 plus bonus. We also have a paper craft workshop, a masala (spices) workshop, a vegetable grading unit and a unit for making small modern farming tools for locals. The brand name of our spices is ‘Mother’s Spice’. The vision behind setting up of this rural mall is to make our villages self-sufficient,” said  , who is facilitator of rural mall at Vees Daliya village. 
 
 “Our plan is to expand these activities in the whole area and provide employment to at least 100 people in this cluster by the year-end. Locals will also be trained in the production of Nagli papad and biscuits and in mushroom cultivation. This will help people earn a decent livelihood here,” Nayyar added.
