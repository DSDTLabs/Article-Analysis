NEW DELHI: A day after a woman and her two-year-old daughter were found dead at their residence in east Delhi’s Mandawali, police said that the woman’s  , who has been detained, is the prime suspect. They are questioning him further.

 Police said that Geetanjali and her daughter Ananya were alone at home after the man left for office in the morning. Relatives told police that the man often returned home late and fought with his wife.
 
 Police suspect that the killer tried to make the murders look like murder-suicide and left a “fake“ suicide note before alerting the neighbours.
 
 Neighbours told police that the man, who works in the railways, didn’t react the way he should have when he saw the bodies of his wife and daughter. They also said that a day before the incident, the man had pasted newspapers on the entry gates so that no one could see what’s happening inside. 
 
 Both Geetanjali and Ananya had multiple stab injuries on their chest and stomach. “We are looking into the electronic evidence,” said Omvir Singh, deputy commissioner of police (east). 
 
 Police are yet to recover the murder weapon. “It is impossible for a person to hide the weapon after killing oneself so brutally,” said a senior officer. 
 
 Police said that the woman and child were apparently killed at least six to seven hours before the incident was reported.
