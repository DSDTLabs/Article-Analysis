Bengaluru: The makers of the Rajinikanth-starrer Kaala have warned that they will move court and also seek the assistance of the Competition Commission of India if the movie is not screened in Karnataka. The movie has run into a political storm due to Rajinikanth’s stand on the Cauvery water sharing row.

 Vinod Kumar, executive producer of the movie, said he and others involved with the movie will move the high court. Speaking to TOI, Kumar insisted that the film industry is a business and one should not look at it politically. 
 
 The Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce (KFCC) claimed distributors have backed out from releasing the movie in the state and Rajinikanth’s pro-Tamil Nadu stand on the Cauvery river dispute has raised law and order concerns. KFCC president Sa Ra Govindu revealed that if the producers filed a case against the chamber over the movie’s release, the chamber will fight back. 
 
 During Rajini's visit to the city last week to resolve the issue, there was a discussion on facilitating the release of the movie if the superstar apologised to the citizens of Karnataka. Asked if the release of the movie would be allowed if Rajinikanth apologises, Govindu said: "It would be incorrect if the star apologises. It will be a shame to Tamil Nadu.”
 
 Pro-Kannada organizations, however, say they will continue to oppose the release of the film, regardless of the legal consequences. “We are against the release of the film,” said Vatal Nagaraj, a Kannada activist. “Rajini is a Kannada drohi (betrayer) and a Kannada virodhi (anti-Kannada).”
