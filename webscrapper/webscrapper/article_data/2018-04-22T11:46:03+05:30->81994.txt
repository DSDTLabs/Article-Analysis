The high court order allowing 74 schools to approach   regional office to seek permission for conducting vacation classes would not make much difference as there are 1,000 schools in the state under the CBSE board.

 K Unnikrishnan, president of the Confederation of   Sahodaya Complexes, said summer classes are crucial for schools to equip students for the board examination.
 
 "For the past several years we have been following the continuous and comprehensive evaluation (CCE) evaluation system for the examinations but this has now been changed. To prepare the students it is important that we have the adequate number of classes. Though everyone expects the school to produce 100% pass results every year, it is not easy anymore. The students are not used to deal with this sort of pressure," said the Unnikrishnan.
 
 TPM  , president of the Kerala CBSE  , said schools in Kerala gets only an average of 190 working days while in other states they get 220.
 
 “These students would have to compete with CBSE students from other states. If they are not given adequate number of classes they will not be able to compete with them," said Khan, adding that schools in Kerala should not be robbed of their autonomy.
 
 The court has asked the schools who want to hold vacation classes to make a request to the CBSE regional office. “The regional office would have to confirm if the school has the required infrastructure to conduct classes during the summer. Once the whole process is complete, there won’t be much time left and students may not be prepared to attend extra classes on short notice. It would be ideal if schools are allowed to conduct summer classes and authorities run a random check on school facilities," said Unnikrishnan.
