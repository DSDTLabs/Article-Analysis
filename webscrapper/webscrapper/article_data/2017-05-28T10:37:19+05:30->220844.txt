LUCKNOW: Taking lessons from the past,   has instructed private company   devices in all   and place   inside Shivri's treatment plant to keep tabs on the daily functioning of the waste management system of the city. 

 LMC had had a bitter experience with the previous company which missed most deadlines and didn't collect garbage regularly. The new company, Eco-Green, will track all garbage collection vehicles for location and timing daily. 
 
 The waste treatment plant at Shivri will also be under constant surveillance of CCTV cameras so that LMC can see that garbage is being daily treated and not just dumped in landfill. 
 
 The previous company had dumped almost 50,000 tonnes of garbage near the plant as it was not operating it for many months. The new company has committed to clean all collected garbage in the next 10 days to begin treating garbage afresh.
