The operation, codenamed ‘Operation Pratibandh’, will be undertaken across all police station areas of the district over the next three days.

 The operation will track 970 criminals who have been granted bail in   between January 1, 2015 and April 30, 2018, to ascertain if they are still committing crimes.
 
 “Our teams will monitor the activities of these criminals irrespective of the fact whether their places of origin falls within the territorial limits of Ghaziabad or not. The monitoring will be done to ascertain if these criminals are planning any crimes or have been actively executing them after they got bail. Their families and neighbours will be questioned,” said Ghaziabad SSP Vaibhav Krishna.
