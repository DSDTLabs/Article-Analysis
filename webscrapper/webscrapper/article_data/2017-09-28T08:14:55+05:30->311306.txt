LUCKNOW: Two students fell ill at Lucknow   on the second day of the indefinite hunger strike and had to be rushed to the civil hospital on Wednesday night. As many as 13 students began a fast-untodeath on Tuesday till the varsity declares dates for the students' union polls and the alleged false cases of violence against them are withdrawn.

 The students have been on the protest for the past 11 days.BSc student Himanshu Yadav began vomiting in the evening and could not stand up. An ambulance was called and he was sent to the hospital. An hour later, another student, Gaurav Tripathi of BCom, fainted and was taken to the hospital.
 
 “Both the protesters had given up food and water and were facing severe health problems. No university official has turned up to help in the past two days and fellow students had to rush them to the hospital,“ said a student, Ashish Mishra.
 
 Another student, Anurag Tiwari, said, “The health of all protesting students is at stake, but the university doesn't seem to care for them. Students are fighting for their rights in such hot and humid conditions, but the university officials haven't turned up to talk to them.“
 
 After the students fell ill, there was heavy police presence at   and three PAC trucks reached the spot. Police asked the students to end their protest.When they refused, the students were asked to write an application to the district administration sharing their problem.
 
 “The pro vice-chancellor UN Dwivedi, dean students' welfare EK Singh and proctor Vinod Singh requested the students to end their fast. The varsity cannot declare LUSU election dates as the matter sub-judice,“ said   spokesperson NK Pandey .
