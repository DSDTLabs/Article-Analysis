NEW DELHI: Four days after the mysterious disappearance of a   rider on DND Flyway, police have zeroed in on two brothers, one of whom was at the wheels of the Toyota Etios car that had rammed the motorcycle. Both of them are absconding. 

 The two suspects have been identified as Nishant and Pravesh, DCP (southeast)   said. They are residents of   and relatives of the car owner, Bhappe Singh.
 
 Sources said Nishant and Pravesh, when contacted by their family members, had blamed each other for the accident. Both claimed the other one was at the wheels when the accident happened. "We have sent teams to apprehend the brothers. The search to find the body of the motorcycle rider is still underway," Biswal added.
 
 Police have found an eyewitness and asked him to join the investigation. The man, Kailash, said the car was being driven from Noida to Delhi in a zigzag manner at a high speed. "It hit the motorcycle that was going at a slow speed on the bridge. Later, the car brushed against the road divider and stopped," the eyewitness said.
 
 Kailash said that the driver came out of the car after the accident to ascertain the damage caused due to the accident. Passersby gathered and started quizzing him. The driver was roughed up when he tried to drive away. Someone then called the PCR. The car driver managed to slip away when the focus of the crowd shifted from him to the missing motorcycle rider.
 
 Cops suspect that the accident happened due to drunk driving. They are also planning to go through the call records of the biker, Anshuman Puri.
 
 "Teams have been sent to Noida to ascertain the place from which Puri was coming from. The information will be corroborated with facts gathered from his friends and his cousin who arrived in the capital from Leh on Tuesday," said a senior police officer.
