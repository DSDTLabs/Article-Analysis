VADODARA: Brace yourself for a harsh summer this year. Even before summer, Barodians got a blast of what is in store for them in the days ahead with the   to 37.4 degree Celsius on Sunday, which was five degrees above normal. 

 The maximum temperature is expected to hover around 35 degrees Celsius in the coming days. 
 
 It was in February 2015 last that the maximum temperature in the city had touched 37.8 degree Celsius. The last time the city recorded 37.4 degree Celsius was in February 2010. 
 
 Even the minimum temperature - 18.4 degree Celsius - that the city registered on Sunday was three degrees above normal which is the highest that it has registered in a decade. The minimum temperatures usually hover around 12 to 14 degree Celsius. Indian Meteorological Department’s records show that it was only in February 2008 that the minimum temperature in the city had dipped to 6.3 degree Celsius. Weather officials said the sudden rise in temperatures was caused by western disturbance. 
 
 As mercury zoomed, Barodians scurried for relief. “A few days ago, I was using blankets at night. Suddenly, it is too hot to sleep with them. I have even started keeping the windows wide open during the day for ventilation,” said  , who works with a private firm.
 
 Some even switched on their air-conditioners that are yet to be serviced for summer while stalls selling ‘golas’ started doing brisk business. 
 
 “The sudden rise in the temperature has made me change my plan of making a leisure trip from a coastal destination to a hill station now,” said  , a property dealer. 
 
 “Just last month, we were enjoying the chilling breezes and now all of a sudden we are sweating,” said  . 
 
 Many elderly people suffered borderline dehydration as they are yet to get acclimatized to the fluctuating temperature. Doctors advise people to keep hydrated.
