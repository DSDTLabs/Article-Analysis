CHENNAI: The number of primary health centres (PHCs) offering incentives to in-service candidates seeking PG medical seats is likely to come down drastically. But, some district headquarters hospitals and a few tough positions in medical college hospitals that were never on the list may be included.

 A six-member committee under   chairman  , listing out difficult and remote areas so marks can be awarded as incentive when PG admissions begin, is likely to submit its report to health secretary   on Tuesday. 
 
 Umanath said they used “hybrid” methods to work out difficult and remote areas based on terrain, reach and kind of work, but refused to reveal the number of institutions on the list. 
 
 This year, the state will add 101 PG seats across 14 government medical colleges, taking the total seats to 1,585 and give 50% to all-India quota. 
 
 In 2017, the process, caught in a battle at the Madras high court, was stalled twice and admissions had to be cancelled. The state had given 50% seats to all-India quota and the reserved half of the rest to government doctors.
 
 Government doctors in difficult or remote regions were given additional three marks for every year of service, while those in PHCs got an additional two marks. The court struck it down saying there can be no reservation for government staff.
 
 Barring a few positions in select medical college hospitals, a senior health department official said, no medical college will make it.
 
  “We don’t want MBBS students or diploma holders to work in medical colleges. If we have PGs it will keep the institution better placed when seeking additional seats from MCI. Also, if these people leave the college after they get admissions we have to fill in the seats,” he said.
