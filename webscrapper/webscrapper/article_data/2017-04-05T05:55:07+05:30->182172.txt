JODHPUR: Dismayed over the decision of the   (MCI) to not increase   in various departments,   of   in Jodhpur have now approached the   for help.

 The doctors say that if the seats are not increased this time despite the departments fulfilling all parameters, then it would be difficult in the future also.
 
 Despite all the required resources and teachers needed for getting an increase in PG seats, not a single seat has been sanctioned in the paediatric, medicine and surgery departments of the college, they rued.
 
 According to HoD of surgery department Ajay Malviya, they have four professors, three associate professors and 13 assistant professors, which are adequate to have 18 seats of post graduation.
 
 “Despite adequate infrastructure with the department, the MCI did not sanction the required seats,” said Malviya, adding that currently there were 11 seats and MCI was expected to give nod for seven more seats, taking the total number of seats to 18.
 
 Similarly, the paediatric department has 18 teachers but only 10 PG seats and medicine department has 24 teachers against 14 seats with all the required infrastructure. Both of these departments had been expecting a nod for 8 and 7 more seats, respectively, but not a single seat was sanctioned in any of these departments.
 
 HoD paediatric department Pramod Sharma said that colleges at Ajmer, Jhalawar and Bikaner, which are smaller in size compared to the one in Jodhpur, have succeeded in getting the seat count increased despite limited resources.
 
 According to the doctors, Jodhpur has the second largest medical college after Jaipur and caters to a very large area of western Rajasthan with three big hospitals constantly progressing in terms of size and facilities.
