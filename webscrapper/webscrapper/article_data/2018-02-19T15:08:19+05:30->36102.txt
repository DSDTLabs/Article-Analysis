KANPUR: Close on the heels of the Rs 11,360 crore PNB scam, another top businessman -   from Kanpur -has been accused of defaulting on repayment of more than Rs 800 crore loans from five government banks. While reports of Kothari, whose Mall Road office is closed for the past one week, fleeing the country started doing the rounds on social media and channels, he issued a statement on Sunday saying he was very much in Kanpur.

 
 Kothari, who is the chairman & MD at  , had taken loans of Rs 800 crore from Allahabad Bank, Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Indian Overseas Bank and Union Bank of India. However, as per the   and   sources, Kothari has not paid back either the interest or the loaned amount.
 
 Insiders in the banks said rules were "compromised" to give loans to Kothari. The banks officials and many other business clients, who did not wish to come on record, revealed that they have been making rounds of   office on Mall road for the past few days, but it was locked. They also alleged that they tried to get in touch with Kothari on phone, but in vain.
 
 Kothari, however, in a statement on Sunday said: "First of all, don't call it a scam. Also, I am not leaving the country and I am very much in Kanpur. Banks have declared my company nonperforming asset (NPA), but not defaulter. The matter is still sub judice with National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). I have taken loans and will repay it all soon."
 
 Allahabad Bank manager, Rajesh Gupta said: "If the party won't be able to repay the loan, we will recover it by selling Vikram Kothari's properties."
