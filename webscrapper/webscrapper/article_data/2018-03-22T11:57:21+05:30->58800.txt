JAIPUR: State higher education department has decided to introduce 12 language courses online in three colleges from the coming session.

 The move is intended to make students employable is different sectors related to tourism. The languages under the programme are German, Japanese, Spanish, Russian, Portuguese, Italian, French, Turkish, Chinese, Polish, Arabic and English. It will be introduced in Maharani’s College (Jaipur),   in Udaipur and   in Jaipur.
 
 A degree or diploma in language courses, especially in French, Spanish and German is considered 'highly' exclusive courses as they are not available in any government college. Even if it is available, it is very expensive and beyond the reach of the commoners. A diploma course in French cost up to Rs 80,000 per year. State higher education minister Kiran   said that these courses will be available online. “These courses will make students employable in hotel and tourism industry,” said Maheshwari. The fees of these courses are not yet decided but sources have said that it will be nominal and likely to be free for girl students.
 
 Rashmi Jain, vice-principal, Maharani’s College, said that the introduction of courses will help girls find jobs in a new sector. “It will be an opportunity for the students of any stream to enroll for the language courses. The travel and tourism sector is growing leaps and bounds and offers job with good pay packages," said Jain.
 
 Students coming from the traditional families having business in gems and jewellery require translators to deal with the clients abroad.
 
 She hopes that many girls will show interest in the online language learning. Education sources said that decision was taken after carefully studying the feasibility of the courses. Rajasthan is a tourist spot which attracts tourist from across the globe. The acute shortage of translators in the popular languages forces the travel agents or companies to hire translators form bigger cities.
