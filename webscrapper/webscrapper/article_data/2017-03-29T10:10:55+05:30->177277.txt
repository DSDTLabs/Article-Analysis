CHENNAI: It took seven months for a 55-year-old woman in Avadi to realise that a   had conned her into parting with a   of 6 sovereigns (48g) worth 1.3 lakh. 

 The woman believed the chain was in a sealed utensil in her puja room only to discover last Sunday that it had been swapped with pebbles. 
 
 Police said Nagammal, a flower vendor of Bhavaniamman Koil Street, was pious and visited temples. She had health problems and was unable to manage her flower business. During a temple visit, she was told that witchcraft was ruining her life. She was asked to perform a puja to drive evil forces from her house.
 
 So Nagammal went looking for a godman to perform the puja and met the suspect at a Thiruninravur temple. Raji, 26, of Kamarajar Nagar, Kancheepuram, ran a garland business and looked for easy targets in temples. Raji claimed to be able to drive away evil forces.
 
 He showed Nagammal photographs of his earlier pujas to impress her. When Nagammal invited him home, he asked her to remove her chain and put it in a utensil. Asking her to close her eyes for half-an-hour, the man filled the room with smoke.
 
 Nagammal, engrossed in prayer, failed to notice him the swap chain with stones and seal the utensil.
 
 Raji told her not to open the utensil until her health improved. Nagammal grew suspicious on finding no change in her health and opened the utensil. She was taken aback to find stones inside and lodged a police complaint on Sunday. A team headed by deputy commissioner, Ambattur, R Sudhakar, scanned temples in the locality and nabbed Raji.
