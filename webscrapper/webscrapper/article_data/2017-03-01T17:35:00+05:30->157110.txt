Some have even got addicted to it. People across all age groups have become addicted to it. So, I have decided to give up these things for 40 days.Besides, I will be taking part in the prayer services that have been organised by the church during Lent.'' While some have decided to abstain from things they love doing, there are many others who have taken up social causes to help the society.

I was also planning to start a gardening and waste management project in my society .Feeding strays in my society is also on my list,'' said Jolina Mathias, a resident of Vishnu Nagar.
