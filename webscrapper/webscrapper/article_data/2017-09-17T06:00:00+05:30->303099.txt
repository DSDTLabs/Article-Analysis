KOLKATA: For these 15-odd women who live on Bhowanipore’s Kedar Bose Lane, life revolves around the ‘baroari’ Durga Puja they have been organizing for the past 13 years. This group of 60-somethings, who had come to Kedar Bose Lane as daughters-in-law and call themselves ‘Mohila Mahal’, keep track of the minutest details of their Puja — right from collecting subscriptions, to keeping tabs on how the idol is shaping up at Kalighat patuapara, co-ordinating with the pandit, dhaaki, decorator and the supplier. 

 It started in 2005, when the group of neighbours came together to start a club and organise a puja of their own. “It was initially a challenge because we had decided to do it all by ourselves,” recalled  , club president. “Our husbands had retired and we thought it was time for us to retire too. So what if we were housewives, we had done our bit to keep our husbands going for so long and our children had grown up. So we wanted some distraction from our monotony,” said  , secretary. 
 
 The biggest challenge they face is to budget the expenses so that enough prasad and bhog can be distributed in the whole neighbourhood. The group members stay fit through exercise and have their medicines on time so that they are able to withstand the Puja workload. “The only men in our Puja are the purohit and the dhaaki,” said member  . 
 
 And they keep up with the beat of the dhaaks right till the Goddess in immersed at Ramrik Ghat. 
 
 “We are no longer demure young women and have kicked off our shyness. While some of us dance on the truck that carries the idol, others dance in front of the vehicle,” added Kajol Ghoshal, another proud member of  .
