Surat: Sardar Bridge over Tapi river that connects Adajan and Athwa areas of the city has proved of immense value to commuters since 1990. The four-lane bridge which used to cater to around 6,000 passenger cars per unit (PCU) in an hour is now handling only 1,500 PCUs due to ongoing expansion work. The expansion work from Adajan to Athwa is likely to be completed by October 2017. The fact that the cable-stayed bridge and Jillani Bridge are not yet operational make travelling difficult on this section. The reason behind pressure on Sardar Bridge is people living in the newly developed areas of Pal, Adajan and Palanpur. 

 Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) officials say an estimated 30,000 PCUs move from Adajan in the morning toward Athwa and half of them pass through Sardar Bridge. Nearly four lakh vehicles move daily from Adajan to Athwa and return after work. It takes at least 25 minutes for commuters to pass through this bridge during peak hours. 
 
 “Everyone coming to Athwa, Ring Road, Ghod Dod Road, VIP Road, Vesu, City Light and other places make use of Sardar Bridge. This is why we are expanding the bridge,” a SMC officer said.
 
 Municipal commissioner M Thennarasan said, “We hope to make Jillani Bridge and cable-stayed bridge operational in August and November, respectively. This would ease the traffic flow as all the three bridges over Tapi here will be operating to their full capacity.” 
 
 Rakesh Kumar Singh, a transport expert from Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology, said, “These bridges would be ready by year-end and would solve the issue of traffic on this section to a great extent. However, effective traffic management would have to be ensured at the three bridges.”
