NAGPUR: Swimming enthusiasts will have to wait a little longer before they take a plunge in Nagpur Improvement Trust’s (NIT’s) Ambazari swimming pool.   had missed the deadline of December 2017 for opening at the warm-up pool.

 NIT’s superintending engineer   said the pool will open in February. However, PP  , executive engineer (west), refused to specify any time limit for opening the pool.
 
 NIT had closed the pool in February last year. At that time, the authorities had promised to complete the renovation work in six months. However, due to various reasons, this deadline was missed. NIT chairman Deepak Mhaisekar then promised the pool users that the warm-up pool would be opened in December 2017 and the main pool in February 2018.
 
 Dhankar told TOI that the warm-up pool was ready while the main pool would be completed in another 10 to 15 days. “We will open both the pools together. It won’t be long,” he said.
 
 The executive engineer said the work was yet to begin on the diving pool and baby pool. “We will start the work after completing the main pool. We will open the two pools while work on these two will go on,” he added.
 
 Manmohan Bajpayee, president of Ambazari Pool Users’ Association, said he had problems with both pools being opened simultaneously but work should not be delayed further. “NIT has decided to go in for re-tendering for the ozone unit. How will they start the pools by February?” he said.
 
 In reply, Dhankar said, “We have decided to re-tender the ozone unit installation work as the company which was awarded the work by NIT has been blacklisted by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. Its equipment in Mumbai was not functioning since years. However, filters have been changed and the ozone unit is just an appendage. It will not affect the opening of the pool.”
