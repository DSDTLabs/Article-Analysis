BALASORE: For more than 90 years in   district's Bhandaripokhari police station, the   has drawn revellers on the second and third day of the month of   on the Hindu calendar, making it a celebration of   with a difference. 

 In 1925, the station in-charge Lala Saheb began a festival on the police station premises that would see hundreds participate in one of the rare situations where both local residents and law enforcement come together. Lala Saheb was the universal 'Munsi', so the festival of colours that would take place in his honour came to be known as the Munsi Melana. 
 
 "More than 35 idols of Radha and Krishna are placed inside a decorated awning in a festival that has stood the test of time," said Laxmidhara Nayak, president of the  .
 
 The story behind the festival goes even further back. "On August 17, 1942, during the time of Quit India Movement, the Bhandaripokhari police station was burnt by the public to protest British rule. The festivities in the region were not held the next year. The Munsi Melana was threatened and would stop. But with the help of locals Ghanashyam Sahu and Shyamsundar Mohapatra, the fair was started once again by Lala Saheb," Nayak added.
 
 This year marks 93 years of Munsi Melana. True to custom, the Bhandaripokhari police station arranged for everything. "Police wear civil dress for this one day and invite the public to observe it with ritual pomp. We distribute prasad and smear colours on each other to maintain the brotherhood between the police and the public," said Trilochan Sethi, the current in-charge of Bhandaripokhari police station and the secretary of the Munsi Melana Committee.
