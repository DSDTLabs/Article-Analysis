INDORE:   and trust authorities have filed their preliminary objections before the Indore bench of high court on a petition alleging that the medical facility was not fulfilling the land lease clause that mandated it to offer free treatment to certain percentage of low income group patients.

 The trust, through their counsel  , has claimed that the statutory remedies available with them have not yet exhausted, as the trust is registered with the   Act 1950, under which any dispute that takes place regarding any public trust must be referred to the charity commissioner. 
 
 “We have also claimed that in case a petition is registered against the trust, all its trustees must be implicated which has not been done in this plea. Also, the questions posed in the petition are disputed, since the petitioner himself does not have authentic information validating his questions,” Chhabra said. 
 
 Such disputed questions must first be subject to discovery, admission and inspection procedure under the civil procedure code, before they can be used as a base to a writ petition, the hospital trust has said. 
 
 Petitioner Dheeraj Mohaniya, through his counsel  , had claimed that Bombay Hospital trust had been given land at a prime location for subsidized lease rent for the construction of a hospital on the condition that at least 15 per cent of total patients should be of low income group, treated for free, or else, the land lease will be cancelled. 
 
 As per the plea, this condition is not being followed by the hospital as they are charging fees from all patients. Under such circumstance, as per the contract, the lease of the hospital should be cancelled. However, no such action is being taken by the IDA or the government. 
 
 The notices were issued to the trust,   (IDA), municipal corporation commissioner and public health and family welfare department in August 2016 regarding the same.
