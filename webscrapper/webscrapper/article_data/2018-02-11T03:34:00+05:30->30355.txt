AHMEDABAD: A youth befriended a man from Delhi and acquired his mobile   earlier this week. He then shopped for Rs 3.54 lakh from different websites installed on the man’s mobile phone which were linked to his bank account. Kalupur police have arrested the accused in the case.

 According to the complaint filed by Virendra Kumar, a resident of Delhi, he had stayed at   near Kalupur railway station recently when he had come to the city to represent his company. He had then come in contact with Kevin Patel, a resident of Kanthariya village in Anand district, who was also staying in the same guest house.
 
 A police officer said that on January 29, Kevin asked for Kumar’s phone to watch movies. 
 
 “After two days, Kumar was surprised to learn that a total of Rs 3.54 lakh were missing from his bank account. He checked his online shopping accounts on different portals and came to know that there were multiple transactions of high amounts. He then realized that on the night he gave his phone, Kevin Patel had accessed his online accounts from his phone to purchase goods and had paid from his account,” the police officer said.
 
 Police said that Patel had been arrested and further questioning is on.
