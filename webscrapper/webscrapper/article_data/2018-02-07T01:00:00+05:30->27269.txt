 looked every bit glamorous on the red carpet of a recent awards show. When BT met her, though she didn’t spill the beans on her big plans in store for the shore, she seemed happy to be back in the bay. “Invite me with a big smile and I will always be there. Actually, I have been travelling quite a bit but now, I am back,” she said.

 Rightfully so — after spending almost seven years on studio floors, her film ' ' with   has wrapped up. The shoot concluded in the last leg of 2017. A lot changed between the time the film went on floors and was completed. While Sunny wrapped a string of films and is in the process of launching his son Karan Deol, Preity went from being a single girl in Mumbai to a married lady in the US. Even her first Christmas after marriage was spent in India, shooting 'Bhaiyyaji Superhit' in 2016.
 
 When asked if such a long journey with the film became tedious, Preity replied, “I just have the dubbing left. In a few months, you will see what the film looks like. You must also ask Sunny what he feels about spending these years on the film. You know, everything takes its own time. Once in a blue moon, things happen the way they do, but it’s all turned out fine. Let’s hope people like what they see.”
