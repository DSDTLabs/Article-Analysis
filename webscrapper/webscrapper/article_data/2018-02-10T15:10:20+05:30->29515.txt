RAJKOT: Bhachau police in   detained two people for allegedly selling stolen groundnut from a government godown in the local market yard on Friday. The duo was selling groundnut stock which was procured at a minimum support price (MSP) by National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed) and Gujarat State Co-Operative Cotton Federation Limited (Gujcot). Police have also seized the stock of 1,000 kg groundnut from them. After verifying the stock, the traders smelt something fishy and informed the police. 

 Police found the stamp of Gujcot on the bags. The accused came to sell 25 bags groundnut each of 40 kg. Police have detained the duo identified as   (20) and   (38), both residents of Gandhidham, and seized their stock. Police suspect that this groundnut may have been stolen from a godown in Gandhidham, which was gutted in a massive fire last month or from other godowns of Nafed. The agency has hired a bigger godown in   having capacity of 2 lakh tonnes to stock the procured groundnut from various parts of Saurashtra and Kutch.
