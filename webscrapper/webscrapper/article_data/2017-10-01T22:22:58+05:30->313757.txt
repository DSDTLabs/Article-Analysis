NEW DELHI: A   aircraft flying from Chandigarh to Mumbai on Sunday had to make emergency landing in Delhi due to a bird hit that damaged one of its engines. The   737 made a safe landing here.

 Jet Airways, which did not give the number of passengers on board, said the bird hit happened when the flight 9W 469 took off from Chandigarh. “This happened during take off. The plane was later diverted to Delhi where it landed safely. The engine fan blades were found to be damaged,” said a Jet spokesman.
 
 Bird hits are a growing menace for flights in India. Activities that attract birds and animals continue unchecked near airpots despite being banned. The Aircraft Act, 1934, specifically prohibits any slaughtering or flaying of animals or dumping garbage in a way which could attract animals and birds within a 10-km radius of airports. And, in turn pose a risk to approaching aircraft. 
 
 “Such activity is a cognizable offence under section 10(1B) of the Aircraft Act, 1934... airfield environment management committees at airports (which are headed by chief secretaries) should take proactive measures on time-bound basis to ensure that no illegal slaughter houses, garbage dumps exist in the vicinity of airports. (these) are source of increased bird activity and may lead to wildlife strikes to aircraft during approach/take off,” the Directorate General of   had said in a letter to all states on the issue some time back.
