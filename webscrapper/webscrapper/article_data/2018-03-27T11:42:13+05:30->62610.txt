SURAT: Two men were booked at Adajan police station on Sunday for cheating a mechanical engineer of Rs3.42 lakh with a promise of a good job. The accused refused to return the money to the complainant when they failed to get him the promised job. 

 Ravi Ganghi, a resident of Pandesara; and Dipesh Tandel, a resident of Jahangirpura, were booked by police for cheating Nikunj Patel (24), a resident of Sarthana. Patel, a mechanical engineering graduate, contacted the accused who had started a placement service company in Adajan for a job in April 2016. The name of their company was RD Group of Business Management.
 
 Patel was promised a job in a top company by the accused who took Rs15,000 from him as registration fee. The accused promised Patel a job within three months and demanded money for the services. Patel took his brother and his friend also to the accused for the jobs.
 
 The accused asked Patel to pay Rs5.7 lakh in advance as part of the total fee of Rs12.4 lakh for getting jobs for three persons. The complainant paid advance money to the accused for which they gave him a receipt. However, the accused failed to provide jobs to the complainant and others within three months and they started demanding their money back. 
 
 The accused under mounting pressure returned only Rs2.43 lakh but promised to give back the remaining amount too. “The accused failed to provide jobs to the complainant and others and also return the full fees that they had charged,” police said.
