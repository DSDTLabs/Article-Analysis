NEW DELHI: The DU   and the   (BCI) — the regulator of legal education in India — are again heading for a tussle over the number of   in this year’s batch. The institution may see a reduction in the number of seats as the  , which had last year provided “a one-time concession” to allow an intake of 2310 students, may not do so again. 

 A letter, signed by the dean of law faculty, Ved Kumari and   registrar Tarun Das, written in response to a BCI letter of March 27, 2017 mentions a fine of 30 lakh rupees which has been imposed on the institution for continuing to teach without affiliation from BCI, poor infrastructure and inadequate teacher to student ratio.
 
 In the letter, the BCI is asked “to kindly waive off the penalty amount in view of the fact that the faculty is a public funded educational institution receiving grants from University Grants Commission (UGC), wherein no fund is allocated for the payment of such penalty.”
 
 This fine, it is indicated, was imposed to disallow the law faculty from admitting more than 1,440 students in all its three centres. Sources in the BCI told TOI that the BCI will not allow more student intake, despite the constant plea by the dean who is asking for another year of concession. 
 
 However in the letter, the faculty has requested to be allowed to admit more students claiming that the University statutory authorities had already sanctioned the strength in the three law centres. “These numbers were sanctioned much before the Legal Education Rules, 2008, came into force,” the letter points out.
 
 Despite repeated attempts, Ved Kumari was not reachable for a comment.
