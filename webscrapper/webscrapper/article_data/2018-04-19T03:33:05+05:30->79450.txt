DHAKA: Shirin  , speaker of Bangladesh’s parliament, said on Wednesday that gender empowerment was one of her country’s main priorities.

 She was briefing a foreign media delegation to Jatiyo Sansad that was part of the Visit   programme organised by the foreign ministry. Elaborating on the gender equity and empowerment programme, Chaudhury said efforts are on to bring all girl children to school. “We have women in the police, armed forces and navy. They are highly in demand in UN peacekeeping forces, too,” she said, adding that special stipends are offered to girls to ensure they do not drop out of school.
 
 Incidentally, Bangladesh is the only country with women in four key positions of power. Apart from Chaudhury, the leader of the House, the leader of the opposition and the deputy speaker are all women. Fifty parliamentary seats are reserved for women, who are elected by MPs. This is in addition to the 21 women MPs who are elected directly.
 
 Asked how challenging it is to get women to take part in active politics, Chaudhury said the presence of women in key positions inspires others. “This gives a positive message. They feel that if they prove their worth, they too can hold such posts,” she said.
 
 Chaudhury said her government was trying to improve Bangladesh’s infrastructure in order to attract foreign direct investment. “Poverty has fallen from 40% to 23% within a decade,” she added. On the   issue, she said a “quick and sustainable” solution was needed.
