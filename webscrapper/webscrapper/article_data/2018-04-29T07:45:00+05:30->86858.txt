Rohtak: Haryana urban local bodies minister Kavita Jain has named Anu Kumari (31), the mother of a four-year-old, who secured the second rank in Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), as the brand ambassador for the ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ (BBBP) campaign in Sonipat district.

 “Anu Kumari’s achievement has given a befitting reply to people who have killed their daughters in the womb. Anu has emerged as an inspiration and can change the mindset of such people,” said Jain.
 
 Congratulating Anu and her family on the success, Jain said women are not behind men in any field. “There is need to give them proper opportunity to prove their mettle. Anu’s achievement is a matter of pride not only for Sonipat but for entire Haryana. A daughter of an ordinary family has proved her mettle in the UPSC exams,” she said.
 
 Among the five UPSC toppers, three belong to Haryana. Haryana health minister Anil Vij, Sonipat MP Ramesh Chander Kaushik and Haryana state agricultural marketing board chairperson Krishna Gahlawat also congratulated Anu, the topper among the female candidates.
