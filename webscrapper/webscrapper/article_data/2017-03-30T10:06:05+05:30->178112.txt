KOLHAPUR: The district primary education department has enrolled over 70% students in the allotted   of its 2,002 schools on the occasion of Gudi Padwa.

 District primary education officer   said on Wednesday that such a response was never witnessed before. He said more than 16,000 students have enrolled for over 23,000 seats in primary schools across the district.
 
 He added that the teachers were asked to prepare pamphlets of their schools and take a survey of schools nearby to ensure maximum response to the initiative on the occasion.
 
 The three-year old campaign is part of the education awareness drive and a survey to find potential students of the pre-primary and primary education group across the rural and remote areas of the district. 
 
 In 2015-16, around 16,000 seats were filled. Around 11,000 pre-primary and primary students were enrolled in the 2014-15 academic year.
 
 Chougule said the slogan for Gudi Padwa — Shala Pravesh Vadhva — which literally translates to ‘increase the school admissions’ seems to have done wonders for the department. “The department is serious about increasing the number of students in zilla parishad schools. These schools are often not considered good for education as parents prefer private schools over us,” he said.
 
 He added that the zilla parishad schools are offering education at par with private schools using the constructive mode of education and the rising standards of infrastructure in the premises.
 
 On the Right to Education (RTE) Act admissions, Chougule said the said drive was used to spread awareness among the potential beneficiaries as well.
