BENGALURU: Summer camps have become costlier by 18% with the Goods and Services Tax ( ) regime deciding to tax coaches who train even beginners and amateurs. 

  Many sports clubs and academies in the city have advertised their plans for April and May with fees and the 18% tax. With increase in camp fees an inevitable annual feature, parents now have to pay a bigger price this year to keep their children engaged in sport. 
 
 Camp fees average between Rs 3,000 and Rs 10,000 depending on the sport. The popular ones are for cricket, badminton, football, table tennis, tennis, chess and swimming. Some customised academy training modules, particularly in cricket, run into lakhs. Till June 30 last year, a service tax of 12% was levied only on coaches who mentored professionals but summer camps, which are recreational in nature, escaped the levy.
 
 The transition to GST means that coaching at all levels attracts tax. The only exemption, as stipulated by the GST Act, are "services by way of training or coaching in recreational activities relating to arts or culture or sports by charitable entities registered under section 12AA of the Income-Tax Act".
 
 While private sports clubs, academies or training centres don't figure in the list of charitable entities, recognised sports governing bodies registered under the section of the IT Act can organise camps without fear of additional tax burden.
 
 In some cases, clubs and academies have announced a consolidated fee, without mentioning the tax component. These clubs are determined to keep their annual gross receipts to less than Rs 20 lakh. GST guidelines say that tax kicks in only if the turnover crosses this threshold.
 
 Tax experts have this advice for parents. "Whether you pay in cash, cheque or online, don't forget to ask for a proper receipt or invoice with the GST registration number of the organisation. This number is proof that the money collected is remitted to the government," a chartered accountant said.
