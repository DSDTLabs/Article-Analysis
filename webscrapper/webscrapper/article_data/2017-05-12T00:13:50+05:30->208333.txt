Indore: The fire that broke out at the trenching ground on Monday could not be doused completely till late Thursday evening. The civic body that had earlier claimed to control the situation in 48 hours is now saying it would take at least a week to completely eliminate the smoke and fire. 

 “Major fire has been controlled but sporadic pocket fires continued to break out. We are trying to control it round the clock,” said IMC health officer Uttam Yadav.
 
 Officials said the fire keeps breaking out from deep within the garbage and it was creating problems. Sources said the situation may take more than a week to come under control. 
 
 The residents, living in the residential societies nearby, complained that the smoke had started entering their houses. 
 
 “From last few days, wind was blowing in opposite direction, it changed today, our rooms, parking and other areas are full of smoke making it difficult for us to breathe,“ said Sameer Karambelkar, a resident of the area. 
 
 A major fire broke out at Devguradia trenching ground on Monday and created panic among residents and IMC officials. Fire in the area is generated due to the presence of methane gas that comes out from garbage once it decomposes. High speed winds and plastic bags spread the fire in large parts of the trenching ground. 
 
 More than 200 tankers have been deployed to control the fire and the officials are working round the clock. 
 
 This is not the first time that such a fire broke out at trenching ground. Several fires were reported in the area last year.
