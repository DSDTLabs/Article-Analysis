Samala Pavani, Municipal Chairperson of Telangana’s   district, kicked up a storm on Saturday, when she stated that bribes for contracts in the state are “routine”, and that “the Minister is also aware.”
In a video clip of the press conference, which subsequently went viral, Pavani said, “You are all aware that taking one to three per cent (commission) is common while giving big civic contracts. Even the Councillor is spending money. We go and break coconuts and inaugurate. So it’s only fair that after the completion of the project, we get a cut of it.”
 Not stopping at that, Pavani stated, “the Minister is also aware of the situation,” and that charging 1-3 per cent commission is a common practise for civic contracts across the state. “Mana Mantri (Our Minister) also said that we (government officials) do not get anything but what I’m telling you is a known fact. If the contractor gives 1 per cent, 2 per cent, 3 per cent (commission) to the Councillor, everything is done,” she stated. 
 Interestingly,  , son of Chief Minister  , is the minister of   and Urban Development. He is also a legislator from Sircilla, of 
 which Pavani is the Municipal chairperson. 
 “The contractors must not politicise the issue. The Councillors spend a lot of money during the elections and pave the way for these projects to be made. So it’s the duty of the contractors to give at least 1 to 3 per cent,” Pavani added. 
 Hours after the press conference, the Municipal council chairperson resigned from her post citing “personal reasons”. She also thanked Minister KT Rama Rao for his support.
