MUMBAI: After hovering between 32°C and 33°C all through last week, the maximum temperature in the city on Saturday shot up to 35°C, much above normal. The weather department has forecast that the temperature will increase further over the next few days.

 Along with rising temperature, a late sea breeze meant higher pollution levels in the city. System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 237 on Saturday, same as the previous day. An AQI between 201 and 300 is harmful for the health of sensitive people.
 
 On Saturday, the maximum temperature recorded by India Meteorological Department’s   observatory was 35°C— 3.9°C above normal. Similarly, the   weather station recorded a maximum temperature of 32.5°C—2.6°C above normal. The temperatures were higher than Friday’s 33.5°C and 31°C at Santacruz and Colaba respectively.
 
 Weathermen attributed the higher maximum temperatures to the wind direction. “The winds are currently easterly (land to sea) and the sea breeze set in much later in the afternoon. This results in the higher maximum temperatures. It could increase by 1-2 degrees in the next few days,” said  , scientist from IMD Mumbai.
 
 The minimum temperatures too remained above normal on Saturday. The minimum temperature at Santacruz was 19.7°C, 1°C above normal and Colaba was 22.2°C, 1.6°C above normal. The minimum temperature at Santacruz was however lower compared to Friday’s 20.4°C. “Because of the dry air, the maximum temperature increased on Saturday and hence the vast difference between the minimum and maximum temperature. Sunday onwards, the minimum is likely to rise too,” said Kumar.
