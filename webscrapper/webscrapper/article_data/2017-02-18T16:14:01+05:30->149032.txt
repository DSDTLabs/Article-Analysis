MANGALURU: Even when grapevine is rife within Congress circles that veteran Congress leaders   and C K Jaffer Sharief will be expelled from the party, an unfazed Poojary has thrown the gauntlet to CM   inviting him for a truth test at either   or Sri Kshetra Gokarnanateshwara.

 Poojary said that it was Siddaramaiah, who as a finance minister opposed his proposal of distributing rice at Re 1 per kg earlier. “As KPCC president, I suggested the Congress government to implement a scheme to distribute rice at Re 1, but it was opposed by Siddaramaiah, who was finance minister then. Let him take a truth test before the deity at Dharmastala or at Kudroli regarding this,” Poojary said inviting the chief minister for an ‘Aaane Pramaana’. 
 
 Poojary said that he is ready to accept show cause notice from the party high command and will be happy even if he was removed from the party. “I will die happily as a Congressman even if the party expels me. There is no question of leaving Congress. Let them expel today evening itself, but I will continue to be a Congressman even if they remove me from the party. I am not a politician, who jumps from one party to another for power,” Poojary said emotionally. 
 
 Recalling his bond with Nehru family, Poojary said, “Congress is in my blood. Nobody can remove me from the Congress. AICC general secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad called and asked the developments. I have explained to him the situation in the state. Is giving good suggestions and pointing out mistakes wrong? I have made my suggestions not only before the media, but also in front of all Congress leaders on a party platform in Mysuru. Let party leaders recall how badly Siddaramaiah was portraying Indira Gandhi when he was in Janata Dal.” 
 
 Further, lashing out at government whip in State Legislative Council Ivan D’Souza, Poojary said, “He (Ivan) is trying to divide Catholics in the region by making baseless charges against MLA J R Lobo (Mangaluru City South).”
