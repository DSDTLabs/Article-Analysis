 (MANALI): The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) started its   operation on strategically important Manali-Leh highway after organising a puja for the safety of its men and machinery at Gulaba, 23km from Manali, on Thursday. 

 The BRO personnel have cleared snow till Rahla Fall, 4km from Gulaba, and will take some more days to clear the road till Sarchu. It has set a target of May month for restoring traffic on   highway. Sarchu-Leh stretch is expected to open by early May. Cutting five to 10 feet of snow at Gulaba is proving to be a tough task. Besides, road clearing has been taken up even amid mild fresh snowfall. 
 
 “The snow accumulation is increasing gradually as we are gaining altitude. A lot of avalanches have come on the highway and snow thickness at some places could be more than 30ft,” BRO officer Mayank Mehta, who is also the officiating commander, told TOI. Mehta added that snow clearance operation had been started simultaneously at four places. “A team from Gulaba and another team from Sissu in Lahaul are moving towards   pass. Two other teams are clearing snow within Lahaul. The main team from Gulaba has nearly 45 personnel, two snow cutters, three dozers and one excavator. All of the machines are operational and performing well,” he said.
 
 Manali-Leh highway had blocked following heavy snowfall on January 6. BRO’s official start to clear snow from the road has provided relief to the residents of Lahaul and Ladakh. As the entire length of the highway is covered with thick layer of snow and ice, which is more than previous many years, the opening of road for vehicular traffic is expected to delay this year.
