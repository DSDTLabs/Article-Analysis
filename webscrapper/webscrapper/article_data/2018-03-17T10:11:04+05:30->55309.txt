VADODARA: Even as there is no trace of Devkishan Katadiya (Ahir) , the final-year MBBS student of GMERS Medical College in Gotri who has gone missing since March 10, the Baroda Obstetric and Gynaecology Society (BOGS) called an emergency general body meeting in support of Dr Ashish Shah. 

 In his two-page letter that he had left before he went missing, Katadiya had claimed that Dr Shah, the head of  , had failed him the viva exam. TOI which had accessed Katadiya’s mark sheet has earlier reported that he had actually passed in the viva which was conducted by Dr Shah.
 
 Office-bearers of BOGS had conducted an emergency general body meeting at the obstetrics and gynaecology department of Baroda Medical College. Later, all the doctors submitted a memorandum to dean of GMERS medical college Dr   condemning the allegations levelled against Shah. 
 
 “We pray for the safe return of the final year MBBS student to his home and pursue his remaining education,” stated the resolution passed by BOGS. 
 
 “At the same time, we unanimously condemn the highly objectionable act of levelling allegations against the teacher and conduct of examination,” the resolution stated. 
 
 Dr Ashish Gokhale, head of department of gynaecology at Baroda Medical College said that Dr Shah has also remained past president of BOGS between 2008 and 2009 and is known as an active academician. 
 
 “The allegations on the exams are not justifiable. We have demanded that the teacher should not be victimised for no fault of his,” Gokhale told TOI. 
 
 Meanwhile, Devkishan’s father  , who is camping in the city, continued issuing appeals and prayers for his son’s safe return.
