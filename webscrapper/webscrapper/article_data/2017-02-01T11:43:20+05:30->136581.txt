CUTTACK: The   (OHRC) on Tuesday directed chief district medical officer (CDMO), Sundargarh, to probe the incident in which a patient killed another at   Government Hospital (RGH) on January 29. 

 The commission has directed the CDMO to thoroughly probe the matter and submit a report within four weeks. The direction came in response to a petition filed by a human rights campaigner holding the hospital authorities responsible for the mishap. The petitioner alleged that the incident occurred due to sheer negligence of authorities of the government hospital.
 
 "The murder clearly reflects that there was no proper security arrangement in place to ensure safety of patients in the hospital," contended the petition. The petitioner has urged OHRC's intervention to avoid such mishaps in the state. The petitioner has also prayed for a compensation of Rs 10 lakh to the bereaved family. 
 
 As the patient was undergoing treatment in a government hospital, he was under the care and custody of the state. But the government failed to discharge its duties properly, alleged the petitioner. 
 
 Yadab Munda, 25, admitted in infection ward of the RGH allegedly killed a fellow patient  , 60.
 
 According to case details, Mundari, a native of Dharanidharpur village of Sundargarh district, was suffering from tuberculosis and undergoing treatment in infection ward of the RGH. While Yadab, a native of Orampara area of Rourkela city, had some infection in leg and was also admitted to the infection ward of the RGH. At 3.30am on Saturday, both had a heated exchange over some matter, following which in a fit of rage Yadab picked up an iron pipe, which was lying in that ward, and hit Sambunath's head. The elderly patient died on the spot.
