Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad’s 
  on Thursday has stunned his own kin as well. His wife Usha told Mirror this was the first time that she witnessed his “violent side”.

 “I had never imagined my husband would be hitting somebody, like he did in Delhi. For the first time, his   has been seen and that was mostly because of the rude behavior by the  ,” she insisted.
 
 Gaikwad, who represents the  , had visited Pune with his   for a family function a few days ago. Kiran had recently lost the zilla parishad polls in Osmanabad. After the function, his family stayed back in Pune while he decided to fly back to Delhi on Thursday.
 
 “My husband has a fairly long experience in politics,” Usha said. “He was an MLA for two terms and is now representing the Osmanabad constituency in the Lok Sabha. Teaching was his profession and he has been extremely popular in Osmanabad because of his friendly behaviour. Anyone who knows him personally would have not even imagined that he would be doing something like this,” she said.
 
 She claimed that her husband, who was caught on camera 
  at the   in Delhi a few years ago, doesn’t get angry at all. “Never in my life had I seen anger get the better of him. I called up him up after the incident around midnight and he said the Air India staffers were rude to him even when they knew that he was an MP,” she said.
 
 When reminded that no amount of provocation should have led to such goondaism, she said, “My husband wanted to do was register a complaint against Air India’s poor service. But, instead of taking down his complaint, they kept on arguing. Finally, when they used the name of our prime minister disrespectfully, he lost his cool and hit the staffer.”
