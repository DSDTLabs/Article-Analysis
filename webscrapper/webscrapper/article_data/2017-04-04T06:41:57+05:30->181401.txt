NAGPUR: Providing relief to thousands of pensioners, Jaripatka post office has finally been shifted to a place more convenient and accessible for its customers.

 TOI has been reporting about the problems faced by the residents, particularly senior citizens, after the post office was shifted to an isolated slum area. 
 
 After being in main market near Mahatma Gandhi Centennial Sindhu High School for about 60 years, it was shifted to   in Indora despite opposition from pensioners and women agents. 
 
 After pressure from media and various organizations like Sindhi Yuva Sangathan, Sindhi social forum and Nag Vidarbha Central Sindhi Panchayat, the post office was shifted to   in Jaripatka on Monday. “We identified the house whose owner offered to rent it to the post office for Rs17,000 a month. The new office has ample parking space, waiting area and hall where postman can sort letters,” said Kishan Balani, joint secretary of Sindhi Yuva Sanghathan.
 
 Pensioners are relieved as the new office is within walking distance. “We won’t have to spend money on transportation,” they said. 
 
 The post office was first shifted to an isolated area in Machine Mohalla. According to the postal agents, more than 150 people had closed down their accounts, some even prematurely, because agents as well as account-holders felt unsafe to carry cash to the new location.After objection from the residents, it was closed and two cash counters were opened at the   branch.
