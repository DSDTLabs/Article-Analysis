PUNE: Six persons succumbed to   in Nashik, Aurangabad, Ahmednagar, Nagpur and Pune since the beginning of this year, prompting state health officials to step up vaccination of high-risk individuals.

 “Swine flu virus has infected 20 people this year so far. Of them, six have succumbed to the virus-induced complications,” a state health department official said.
 
  
 The year’s first H1N1 death took place at Pravara Rural hospital in Loni (Ahmednagar) on January 8, in which a 50-year-old woman died because of the virus-induced complications.
 
 The second death took place at Suyash Hospital in Nashik on January 25 where a 45-year-old woman died of the H1N1 complications. A 17-year-old boy fell prey to the virus at the   in Pimpri on January 29.
 
 On February 7, a 63-year-old man died of swine flu at Wockhard Hospital in Nagpur. A 26-year-old woman died of swine flu complications at   in Aurangabad on March 6. 
 
 Nashik recorded the sixth swine flu casualty on March 24 after a 24-year-old woman succumbed to the virus at Sanjivani hospital here.
 
 A total of 777 people died of swine flu in   in 2017. Of these, 148 deaths were reported from Pune city alone.
 
 Going by the analysis, the H1N1 virus hit the state harder in 2017 than the previous year (2016). Barring 2015, when the virus had claimed the maximum 905 lives, the year gone-by grappled with one of the worst outbreaks of the disease in Maharashtra since 2009.
 
 Only throat swabs of critically ill suspected patients are sent to the   (NIV) for testing. Suspected patients, who are not critically ill, are administered oseltamivir without testing the throat swab.
