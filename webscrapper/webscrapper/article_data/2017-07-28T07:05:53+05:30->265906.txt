NEW DELHI: External affairs minister   charged   on Thursday of politicising the issue of the 39  , claiming the main opposition has a “political agenda” to prove  , who had claimed witnessing the murder of the abducted persons, is right and the minister is wrong.

 “Wait for few days. The mystery will be uncovered,” she said in   while referring to why Massih never divulged shooting details of the kidnapped men and how he escaped from IS forces.
 
 Meanwhile, India has decided to again send junior foreign minister   to Iraq in another attempt to trace the Indian construction workers with the MEA saying it had requested Iraq foreign minister   to facilitate a visit by Singh to Badush near Mosul. 
 
 Al Jaafari, who was in India earlier this week, had said that there was no “absolute proof” that the Indians were lodged in the Badush jail even when it was under control of IS.
 
 Foreign minister Sushma Swaraj had prior to that said India had received information that they were probably in Badush jail. The jail is now under the control of Iraqi authorities.
 
 Swaraj said she was the first one to talk to Massih, who only pleaded for his quick rescue. “I kept asking how he could escape, he continued saying rescue me or I will also be killed.
 
 He thought if he says all were shot dead, none will question him. He did not know we have a foreign minister who will still continue the search and the mystery will be revealed,” Swaraj said responding to Congress MP Pratap Singh Bajwa’s contention of what Massih would gain by saying they had been killed in front of his eyes.
