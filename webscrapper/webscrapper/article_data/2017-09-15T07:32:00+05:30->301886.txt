Patiala: Anandpur Sahib MP and SAD general secretary Prem Singh Chandumajra has alleged that chief minister Amarinder Singh had got into a secret understanding with his Haryana counterpart Manohar Lal Khattar to resolve the water dispute by providing the neighbouring state with waters from Hansi-Butana canal in lieu of Haryana giving up its claim on the SYL canal.

 Chandumajra stated on Wednesday that the Punjab CM was repeating the dubious role played by his predecessors Giani Zail Singh and Dabara Singh by surrendering state’s river waters to Haryana as part of the pact to release waters to Hansi Butana canal. He said that the issue would be taken up at the political affairs committee meeting of SAD on September 18. “I have come to know that Amarinder has agreed to release Haryana’s so called share through Hansi-Butana canal. Akali Dal will not allow the Congress government in Punjab to surrender on this sensitive issue. In case the Hansi Butana canal is to be made functional, the Dashmesh canal project in Punjab should also be allowed to carry waters from the Bhakra canal to parts of Ropar, Mohali and Patiala districts,” he maintained.
 
 Chandumajra said that the Dashmesh canal project planned by Punjab was not cleared by the Centre on the ground that the Bhakra canal could not be punctured to release water into it. “This canal will have to be punctured to release water to Hansi Butana canal constructed by Haryana. The same criterion should apply in this case also,” Chandhumajra said.
