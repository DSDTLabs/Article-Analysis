KOLKATA: Two years ago, when   began his second stint as the coach of the national   team, one of his objectives was to guide No. 173-ranked India to top-100 in the   rankings.

 When the game's global parent body releases the latest team rankings on Wednesday , India are expected to jump a whopping 31 spots -from No.132 to No. 101.
 
 “Had Bolivia not beaten   (in the   last Tuesday), we could have been No. 97,“ Constantine quipped during an interaction with the media here on Tuesday . The highest Fifa ranking India has ever enjoyed was in February 1994 when they were placed No. 94.
 
 The British coach, who was in charge of the Indian team from 2002 to 2005 in his first stint, maintained that the Indian players have it in them to qualify for the Asian Cup, to be held in the UAE in 2019. India launched their Asian Cup qualification campaign on a positive note last week by beating Myanmar 1-0 in Yangon.
 
 “Am I happy? Yes. Can we do better? Absolutely . We have now got the spine. I believe, we have a team which can take us to the Asian Cup and beyond,“ said Constantine, who is here to monitor the state Sports Council-organised coaching and scouting workshop. He had similarly guided Rawanda from No. 133 to No 68 in Fifa rankings after taking charge of the African nation's senior team. It was the highest ever position attained by Rawanda. Constantine refused to compare his stints at Rwanda and India, but acknowledged that the inception of Indian Super League (ISL) and the upcoming Fifa Under-17 World Cup have given Indian football a leg up.
 
 “Between my two stints as India coach, there has been quite a bit of difference. The ISL has made India universal.The world is now aware that India not only play football but are not bad at it either,“ he said.
 
 “And now we have the under-17 World Cup coming up.It's a huge honour for the country and we should make the most of this opportunity .“
