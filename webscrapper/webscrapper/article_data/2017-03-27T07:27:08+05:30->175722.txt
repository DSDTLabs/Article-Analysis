AMRITSAR: In a first, Delhi   (DSGMC) has decided to honour only selected guests with siropas (robe of honour) to “restore the significance” of   and save money spent on them.

 To begin with, the DSGMC did not bestow a siropa on Akal Takht jathedar   and other religious leaders at a function in Delhi on Sunday. DSGMC president Manjit Singh G K told TOI that the decision had been taken to mark Delhi Fateh Diwas on March 25 and 26. “The act of bestowing a siropa is equal to the Guru’s blessings and signifies honour bestowed upon an individual. We can’t distribute it like langar and lower its importance,” said G K, adding that in past one year DSGMC had spent over Rs 50 lakh on siropas alone.
 
 G K added that siropas had been replaced with mementos and a set of religious books.
 
 The siropa is a robe of honour bestowed upon a person for his commitment and dedication to Sikhism or who has achieved something remarkable. In the past, there have been several instances when giving a siropa to a person courted controversies. 
 
 In 2016, Shiromani   had taken strict action against   who, while performing sewa as an ardasiya in the sanctum sanctorum of Golden Temple, had refused to give a siropa to former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and his son, former deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal. He had said that the two SAD leaders had failed to put a check on incidents of sacrilege.
