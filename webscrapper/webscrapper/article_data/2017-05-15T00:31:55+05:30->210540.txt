Madurai: Come June, a new waste management system will come into force in the city, making it mandatory for residents to segregate garbage at source before it is collected by corporation workers.

 The Madurai Corporation will start collecting waste material segregated into biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste from June 1. The corporation will also collect a fee ranging between Rs 10 and Rs 30,000 per month from residents, shops and commercial establishments as per the by-laws framed by the civic body under the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.
 
 Commissioner Sandeep Nanduri, while taking to reporters on the sideline of Happy Street, said that they will start collecting segregated waste by June 1. Starting June 5, segregation at source will become mandatory. “Waste will be collected only if it is segregated into biodegradable and non-biodegradable material. There is nothing waste. The biodegradable waste can be used for various purposes, including production of biogas, electricity and fertilizers,” he said.
 
 The by-laws for   framed before April were kept for public viewing for a week’s time from April 1. According to it, a fine will be imposed for not segregating wastes and also dumping waste in open areas, roadsides or waterbodies. The fine amount will range between Rs 100 and Rs 15, 000 according to the nature of the waste and those found violating the rules. 
 
 Earlier, addressing people during the event, Sandeep Nanduri urged them not to use plastic bags, which pollute the environment. He also advised residents to use water judiciously. “At this time of water crisis, the corporation with the help of the state government has been taking all possible steps to maintain water supply. I want you to conserve water and use it judiciously,” he said.
 
 While more than 50 out of the 100 wards in the city limits have already been declared open-defection free, he sought the support of the people to rid the entire city of open defecation.
