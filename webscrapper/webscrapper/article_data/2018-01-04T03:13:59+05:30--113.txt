MUMBAI: A short circuit sparked the fire in which 12 workers of a snack-making unit in   died on December 18. This is what the fire brigade’s probe into the fire has revealed. The report points out how “loose wiring” at   where the fire broke out due to a short circuit and matters worsened when a gas cylinder kept around the place started to leak. A senior fire officer confirmed this. “While a short circuit caused the fire, the storage of combustible material caused the flames to spread rapidly. Also, there was a large quantity of oil lying nearby which caused the flames to spread rapidly,” said the fire officer.

 Congress legislator  , who met municipal commissioner   on Tuesday over the fire incident, raised questions over the “inaction of the civic administration” over the incident. “In case of Kamala Mills fire, action was initiated against civic officials in no time. But in the Saki Naka fire, no action has been taken so far against anyone. Why this differential treatment between two tragedies each of which witnessed at least 12 deaths,” said Khan.
 
 Containers of oil that was used to deep-fry goodies sold at the shop lay around the place, said sources in the fire brigade. The report has been sent for a routine administrative approval by the municipal commissioner. A preliminary probe into the fire incident had revealed that 20 workers asleep at the shop that night woke up around 3.30 am due to suffocation. Eight of them survived the blaze. The owner,  , has already been arrested.
