HYDERABAD: Not just in nondescript bricks-and-mortar shops, original medals and their `tailor copies' are up for grabs online as well, both in India and abroad.

 An original Indian   Special Service medal (Suraksha) was auctioned for $19.95 (approx. Rs 1,359 as on Tuesday) on January 20 on eBay in the US. It was expressly mentioned that the medal would not be shipped to India. However, domestically, a seller was found offering the same kind of medal for as less as Rs 299.
 
 A   medal, which has the inscription `Goa, 1961', has been priced at $45 (Rs 3,065) . It supposedly belongs to one N Ram of the Dogra Regiment. A Samanya Seva medal awarded in 1965, which reportedly belongs to sepoy   of  , was also put up for sale on the internet. The availability of medals with num bers and names for purchase begs the question whether they are being sold by former soldiers or middlemen. “It cannot be that any soldier sold his medal. When a sol dier dies, his medal is pinned to his chest until his body is lowered into the grave or cremated,“ said Major General   (Retd). The 72year-old told TOI that it was a matter of pride for any family to display Army medals earned by members at home. There is a consensus that medals are a source of honour and no one would want to sell them. But this doesn't seem to be the case when it comes to the original 25th and 50th anniversary-of Independence medals, which are found in huge numbers online. These medals were given to all Army personnel on August 15, 1972, and in 1997.An original 25th anniversary medal was being offered for Rs 360. Another seller was offering it for Rs 350. Customers in search of `tailor copies' can also find a selection online. For instance, a medal bar comprising nine medals is being auctioned on eBay by a seller from Kanpur. The starting bid is Rs 3,500.
