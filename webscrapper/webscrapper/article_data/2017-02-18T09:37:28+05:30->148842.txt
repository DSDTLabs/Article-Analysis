KOLHAPUR: The   (KMC) has decided to recover the expenses made on former mayor Ashwini Ramane during her one-year tenure. 

 Ramane was disqualified last month by municipal commissioner P   after the caste validation committee (CVC) termed the caste certificates produced by her during the civic elections in November 2015 invalid. As per the election commission rules, the expenses are recovered from the disqualified corporators and the civic administration can recover the emoluments, allowances and other benefits given by the civic body. 
 
 The municipal commisioner has issued notices to all departments of the KMC, asking them to estimate the benefits received by Ramane during her tenure and submit the report in two weeks. The heads of the departments are likely to submit the report next week, after which a notice for recovery of the benefits in monetary form will be issued to Ramane. 
 
 Sankar told TOI, “There is a rule that the disqualified corporator has to pay back the benefits he or she received during the tenure as corporator as well as while holding any post. The decision has been taken over the directions of the election commission.”
 
 Ramane had contested the election from the a ward reserved for candidates from other backward class (OBC) category. Despite being a Maratha, Ramane had submitted documents claiming to be of Kunabi caste, which falls under the   class. The KMC is going to initiate process for by-election in the ward after directions from the election commission.
 
 Two other corporators of the civic body also may face disqualification. They had moved the Bombay high court against disqualification and the court had stayed the decision. However, after fresh scrutiny Ramane was disqualified and the decision on the rest of the corporators is pending.
