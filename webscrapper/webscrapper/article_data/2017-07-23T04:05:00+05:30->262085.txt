Ahmedabad: Special Operation Group (SOG) of the city police on Friday registered an offence against unidentified persons for depositing, during the past three months, a total of 4,426 fake notes in 10 different private and nationalized banks .

 SOG officials said the fake notes deposited include post-demonetization currency in the denominations of Rs 500 and 2000 and pre-demonetization notes in the denominations of Rs 500, 1000, 100, 50, 20 and 10.
 
 “Every three months, on the complaint of banks, we register such offences in which fake notes were deposited in banks,” said assistant commissioner of police (SOG), BC Solanki.
 
 However, what is significant is that though the time limit for depositing demonetizing currency in banks expired in March 2017, it is allowed only for those who were abroad during that period. However, the old notes could be deposited only in branches of Reserve bank of India. 
 
 Sources in the SOG said there were 36   notes of post-demonetizatin Rs 500; 63 of Rs 2000 and 1307 of Rs 500. Further, 440 pre-demonetization notes of Rs 1000; 124 of Rs 50; 2447 of Rs 100; 3 of Rs 20 and 6 of Rs 10 value.
 
 It is noteworthy that though such cases are being registered every three months with the SOG, not a single case has been cracked.
 
 “Even if we gather cctv footage from banks, how can we ascertain which customer deposited fake notes? The fake notes are scrapped by the banks. People who deposit fake currency notes in the banks can only be nabbbed if caught in the attack,” a crime branch official said.
