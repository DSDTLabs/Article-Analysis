BENGALURU: Healthcare company   on Tuesday announced the launch of its liquid biopsy test portfolio which detects tumour traces from a simple blood draw.

 Typically, tumours are assessed through invasive biopsies or radioactive scans. This technique allows early assessment with minimal discomfort to patients. “Liquid biopsy (LB) is a paradigm shift that involves a minimally invasive procedure and no radioactive scans. The technique can detect tumour DNA traces in 35% of patients with earlystage cancer. The figure goes up to 70-90% in patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer,“ said Dr Vijay Chandru, chairman and managing director, Strand Life Sciences.
 
 “We combined multiple techniques, including those that track single mutations very economically, and those that track tens of genes. The test will be offered at   in Bengaluru and other hospitals across the country,“ said Dr Ramesh Hariharan, CEO of the firm.
 
 The Strand LB tests are an outcome of the collaboration between scientific teams of Strand and Mazumdar Shaw Center for Translational Research (MSCTR). The tests were validated by clinicians at the Mazumdar Shaw Medical Center (MSMC).
 
 “Innovations like liquid biopsy are huge breakthroughs in cancer detection. India needs such pioneering innovation in healthcare to foster early detection, which can be a great help in bringing down the non-communicable disease burden that our country is facing today. I congratulate the scientific teams at Strand and MSCTR as well as doctors at MSMC for this achievement,“ said  , chairperson and MD, Biocon.
 
 Dr  , hemeoncologist and clinical director, MSMC, said: “Solid tumours can sometimes be hard to access and often require a small surgery to enable sampling. A liquid biopsy test provides a new way forward in such situations.“
