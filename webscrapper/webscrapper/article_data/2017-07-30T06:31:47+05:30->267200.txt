KOLKATA: When   from Howrah — who took his ISC this year — went to a reputable south Kolkata college on Wednesday for admission, he had with him an SMS forwarded by his “agent” stating that Surana’s name was on the merit list. However, when his agent returned his marksheet, Surana found it showed he had secured higher marks than he actually had. The agent then informed him that his admission would be guaranteed if he paid Rs 1 lakh. Surana immediately informed Bhowanipore police.

 In the next 24 hours, cops busted a gang of five who ran a college-admission racket and pocketed around Rs 1 lakh for each deal. The gang included a third-year BSc student of a reputable college in Bhowanipore and at least two recent graduates from another college in the vicinity. The accused have been identified as Saif Ali Khan, Atul Gupta, Saurabh Sonkar, Avnish Madogoria and   — all residents of Golabari in Howrah. Raids in Howrah led police to fake ISC marksheets, fake stamp papers and letters apparently signed by principals of three different colleges.
 
 “During the probe, it became clear that the accused had been operating for the past two years. We have traced at least four victims this year and have advised the college to carry out thorough background checks on all ISC marksheets,,” explained an officer.
 
  “We found that the fake marksheets the gang supplied could ensure the students got through,” said DC (south)  .
 
 “We will need to investigate the role of each of the accused. Each one was assigned a particular job. We believe the fake marksheets were printed from outside the state. Though the accused have claimed that the gang is two years old, we have found at least two of them have some political connections. All angles will be covered,” said an officer.
