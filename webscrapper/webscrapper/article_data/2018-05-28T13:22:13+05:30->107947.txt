PATNA: Ahead of Menstrual Hygiene Day on May 28, city doctors are advising women to switch to eco-friendly alternatives such as cloth pads and menstrual cups instead of plastic pads.

 
 A woman uses 15-20 disposable pads in a month during her menstrual cycle that lasts around five days. Some may use more depending on the menstrual flow.
 
 “Starting from the age of 10-15 years, a woman bleeds and uses sanitary pads till she reaches menopause. Most of the used pads, which are disposed of with general household waste, end up in landfills and pollute the environment. They are made of plastic and are non-biodegradable,”   and Hospital (NMCH) doctor Dr Amita Sinha said.
 
 Doctors are of the view that plastic pads should be replaced with reusable cloth pads or organic sanitary pads. 
 
 Dr Sinha said, “Although these new versions have not been introduced in the markets of  , they are available online in different sizes.”
 
 According to the  , incineration of sanitary waste should be done at temperatures above 800 degrees. “This is hardly practised here. Some women even throw the pads in drains causing them to clog or in open areas which invite infections and other diseases,” the NMCH doctor told this reporter.
 
 Gynaecologist Dr Meena   urged women to use menstrual cups made of flexible medical grade silicone. “These cups, which are reusable, practical and eco-friendly, collect blood rather than absorbing it. They can easily be washed and there is no need to sterilize them,” Dr Samant said.
