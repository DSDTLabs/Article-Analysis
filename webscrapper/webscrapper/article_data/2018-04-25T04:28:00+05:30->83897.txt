MUMBAI: Produce the permission given by the BMC to dig up the road at ESCI Nagar, Andheri (W), for conducting   for the proposed  , the   told   on Tuesday. 

 Eleven elevated stations are to be constructed along S V Road between Bandra and Andheri for the Dahisar-DN Nagar corridor. Last week, replying to a PIL by the H-West Ward Association, MMRDA said it would inform residents within 10 days on whether this Metro line can be constructed underground. But a bench of Justices Abhay Oka and Riyaz Chagla heard a petition by JVPD Housing Association, Gulmohar Societies and Nanavati Hospital stating already barricades are up at for soil testing and a contractor appointed. Senior advocate Venkatesh Dhond, representing the petitioners, said no permissions were granted by the fire brigade and Airports Authority of India and even public suggestions were not taken.
 
 MMRDA advocate Kiran Bagalia said they have not started any “actual activity”. “We are sure we will get permissions,” she asserted. When HC asked if soil testing requires digging, she said it was a borehole. “We have general permissions. Under the Metro Act, we have the power,” Bagalia said. The judges pointed out that there is a specific provision in the BMC Act to seek permission for   roads and asked MMRDA to produce the permission on May 2. —Rosy Sequeira
