THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In a state where the area of paddy farming had shrunken from over 8 lakh hectares to less than 2 lakh hectares in four decades, Haritha   has registered a slow but sure progress. The mission has set a target to bring 3 lakh hectares under paddy farming and so far the report card augurs well for the future.

 The mission, along with department of agriculture, undertook group farming, barren land farming, additional crop farming and paddy farming in 10 districts.   and   recorded massive results in group farming with 37,000 hectares covered in Alappuzha and 17,339 hectares covered in Kottayam.
 
 Kottayam also recorded significant conversion of barren land by covering 876 hectares for farming activities. The mission is also mooting good agricultural practices to ensure generation of pesticide-free vegetables in the state.
 
 This has been achieved by simultaneous conduct of vegetable farming in schools, institutions, barren land, terrace farming and by forming clusters of farmers. As many as 34,877 units of terrace farming – with each unit comprising 25 bags – have been launched across the state. The farmer clusters undertook vegetable farming in 650 hectares.
 
 Officials say that a radical change in farming was effected by social media collectives. “We could come across so many people like housewives in cities, people who are employed, traditional farmers all exchanging ideas on social media groups and undertaking vegetable farming. A meeting of such groups held in mission office was marked by the presence of 17 groups,” a project official said.
