NEW DELHI: India may be the world’s fastest growing aviation market but the country’s skies are getting increasingly unsafe as the air traffic grows. Last year (January-December, 2016) saw as many as 427 pilots and cabin crew of Indian carriers facing regulatory action for various safety violations like turning up drunk to fly or for being involved in accidents. This number was 54% higher than the regulatory action taken against 275 cockpit and cabin crew members in 2015. 

 The figure in 2014 was a high 391 due to extra surveillance on private planes used for political campaigning.
 
 “We have started a new system for doing safety checks based on risk assessment that led to this surge in detection of safety violations. Generally, we have heightened surveillance that led to a higher number last year. This included cases of crew flying more than the permitted number of hours,” said a senior   ( ) official. 
 
 The regulatory actions are decided by DGCA’s safety division that is headed by joint DG Lalit Gupta. Last year’s safety drive saw the regulator directing filing FIRs against two pilots (one each of   and Jet) and three cabin crew members (two of AI and one of Jet) who were found tipsy after operating international routes.
 
 “Crew is suspended for reasons like failing BA tests for a maximum of eight weeks as airline crew is a precious resource and cannot be kept on ground for long. They are given corrective training and then fly again,” said the official.
