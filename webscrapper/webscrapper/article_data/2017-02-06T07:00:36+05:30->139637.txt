HYDERABAD: The vast expanse of the newly formed   police commissionerate seems to lack enough   and personnel for effective crime-fighting. Spread over 5,090 square kilometres, the commissionerate has only about 42 police stations. The spread of stations is also skewed, with people in most areas in the   forced to travel long distances to report their grievances.

 In contrast, the neighbouring Cyberabad commissionerate has 44 law and order police stations for an area of over 3,000 square kilometres. 
 
 What makes matters worse is that only 20 of the 42 police stations dotting Rachakonda have magisterial powers to register a First Information Report (FIR). This delays the entire process and it takes almost two days to register an FIR which should ideally be done immediately.
 
 “It is a problem. As of now, residents of the commissionerate are forced to obtain FIRs from the erstwhile police stations. The government is yet to issue the gazette notification in the matter,” said Rachakonda police commissioner Mahesh M Bhagwat.
 
 For most residents, it is the distance that acts as a deterrent. For C Ramesh (name changed), a resident of Manthangowrelly, filing a police complaint is a cumbersome process. With his home 96.4 km away from the heart of the city, Ramesh has to change two buses to reach his nearest police station in Yacharam.
 
 There are several like him who are forced to brave the odds just to file complaints. P Sambaiah, a 47-year-old resident of  , has to travel for almost 45 minutes to reach the police. “The buses are not frequent for the travel to Choutuppal. Even the police officials rue that the distance is too far to be covered by car. In such a case, how do I lodge a complaint?” he asked.
 
 Incidentally, it was only two months ago that home minister   spoke about setting up new police stations in the state.
