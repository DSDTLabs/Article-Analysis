KANPUR:  , who is recovering from a knee injury, has been asked to join the Indian team here at the   on Tuesday to check on his rehabilitation. Shami has been out of action after the third Test against England in   in the first week of December.

 It is learnt that Shami was asked to join the team as there were doubts over the kind of facilities he received during his rehab. “The facilities in his home town are not good enough. That’s why we asked him to come to Kanpur so that the team physio could keep a proper tab on his improvement,” chairman of selectors MSK Prasad told TOI on Tuesday while confirming that he will not take any part in the T20 series. The National Cricket Academy doesn’t have its leading physios services since Patrick Farhart, who has designed a model for the trainers across the country, trainer Anand Date are travelling with the team and physio Rajnikanth is busy working with the Under-19 team.
 
 Shami has been kept out of Bengal’s first two Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 matches as well. “He hasn’t recovered. How can he be allowed to play? We need to be very careful with him,” Prasad said.
 
 Shami has been plagued by injury since the 2015 World Cup and his return has been cut short by reoccurrence of the injury. Having missed the limited-overs series against England, he will have no international matches with the white ball if he does regain fitness before the Champions Trophy although he was seen bowling in the nets with a slow run-up on Tuesday. “We have a big Test series coming up against Australia. We want him to play. As I have earlier stated, we want to stay at the top of the Test rankings for as long as possible. If he stays fit, we will get a fair idea how he is doing in the shorter formats during the IPL,” Prasad remarked.
