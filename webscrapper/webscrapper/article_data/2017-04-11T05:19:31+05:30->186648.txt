NEW DELHI:   member Tarun Vijay’s remark about “black South Indians” rocked   on Monday as Congress-led opposition demanded a police case against him, saying what he said reflected the ruling party’s philosophy.

 Starting a protest over Vijay’s controversial comment about South Indians which forced three adjournments of the House, Mallikarjuna   asked, “I want to know whether we are Indians... Are we not citizens (of India).”
 
 In reply, the government said Vijay had already apologised for his comments but   continued its protest and later also staged a walkout from the House.
 
 Kharge argued Vijay has been the editor of RSS mouthpiece ‘Panchjanya’ and has written 20 books on BJP philosophy, besides being a regular media commentator. “He is no ordinary man. He has a big role in giving shape and form to this ideology,” he said.
 
 He asked, “Has he come from Germany? Is he a descendant of  ? Is he completely fair?” He said the comments were a threat to national unity.
