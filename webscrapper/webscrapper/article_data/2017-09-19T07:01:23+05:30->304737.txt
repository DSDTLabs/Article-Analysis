KOLKATA: In a shift from the usual practice, Kolkata   has decided to deploy its full force from   this year. 

 “We usually make full arrangements from Sasthi. But since Chaturthi falls on a Sunday this year and several big Pujas have advanced their inaugurations, we are not taking any chance. Similarly, the top pandals will receive police cover from Panchami this year. However, if the crowd surges on the weekend and we have a massive crowd from Trithiya (Saturday), we might have to change plans,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar.
 
 Sources within the police say there are indications that the crowd may throng pandals from Friday evening itself. “We have been speaking to cab owners. They claimed they have bookings from Friday night itself,” said a police officer.
 
 Chief minister Mamata Banerjee kicked off the Puja on Monday itself by inaugurating the Sreebhumi Sporting puja. She is scheduled to inaugurate four more, including Chetla Agrani, Naktala Udayan Sangha and 95 Pally, on Tuesday.
 
 But the cops have another test to pass before Durga Puja. India is scheduled to take on Australia at the Eden Gardens on Thursday. Shoppers’ rush at New Market and the adjoining areas is likely to pose a major challenge for police personnel.
