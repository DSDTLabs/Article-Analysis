AJMER: Despite jammers and strict security, mobile phones are frequently found at the   central   and police suspect that these mobiles are being used by the hard core criminals to operate gangs of extortion and dacoity.

 In a recent case of firing on a Kishangarh based   leader and business Pradeep Choudhary, the extortion call to Choudhary before the firing, was made from the Ajmer central jail. ``Investigations revealed that Choudhary had received a call demanding Rs 50 lakhs, from the jail and hence, we are now looking into the mobiles used inside the jail premises,’’ said a police official. 
 
 On Wednesday night, during a sudden inspection at the jail, three mobiles and three sim cards were recovered from barrack number 10 and 15. During the last month, 8 mobiles have been recovered from different cells inside the jail. “We have registered a case in   police station against the unknown prisoner for bringing mobile illegally inside the jail and using it from behind the bars” said jail authority.
 
 Civil Lines police stated that before shooting in Kishangarh, Choudhary was receiving frequent phone calls. “The called had claimed to be calling from inside the jail and that members of his gang were following Choudhary. He had demanded Rs 50 lakhs as extortion,’’ said the police.
 
 Sources said that the hard core criminals inside the jail are still running their gang from inside and therefore it is important to stop the use of mobiles inside the jail, “We seized all mobiles and checking the numbers and calls made from these sims,” added Civil Lines police.
