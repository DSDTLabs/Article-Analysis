HYDERABAD: The   (TSBIE) is in a fix as 284 of the 334 existing   in the state have not fulfilled the prescribed affiliation norms despite the last date being extended to September 21, 2017, leaving nearly 50,000 students in the lurch.

 As many as 103   and 231   offering courses in science, arts and commerce failed to submit the required documents to seek affiliations this year.
 
 However, managements of private unaided junior colleges rue that the TSBIE rejected the pleas of various colleges on petty grounds.
 
 “The TSBIE has sought decade-old documents, which many private colleges are unable to furnish.Apart from this, the board has also sought fixed deposits, which small-scale colleges are unable to pay,“ said Narender Reddy, president,   Private Junior College Managements Association.
 
 College managements have now requested the state government to grant affiliations this year in the larger interests of the enrolled students. “The board cannot deny affiliation to colleges in the middle of the academic year. It will lead to immense inconvenience to students as they will have to be shifted to other nearby colleges, which is a tedious task,“ said Reddy.
 
 He further added that if TSBIE fails to grant affiliations this year they will be forced to initiate an agitation against the board and the government.
 
 Following requests made by the college managements, the TSBIE has now forwarded the list of the unaffiliated colleges to the Telangana government for further directions. “We have forwarded the file to the government to seek clarity on the future of second-year intermediate students. If the government doesn't allow us to grant affiliations then we will be forced to shift these students to nearby colleges,“ said a TSBIE official.
