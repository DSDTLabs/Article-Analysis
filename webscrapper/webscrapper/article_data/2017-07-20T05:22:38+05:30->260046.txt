KOLKATA: As the   threat looms over Kolkata following the death of four patients in Dum Dum,   ( ) has started cracking down on para promoters for not taking adequate measures to prevent accumulation of water, which can become mosquito breeding grounds, at construction sites. 

 According to the KMC health department, the civic body had identified around 7,000 construction sites that pose a threat and issued a dos-and-don’ts guideline on dengue prevention in early June. All developers were told to do whatever it took to keep the construction sites dry and ensure that water did not stagnate. They were also told to ensure that rubbish didn’t pile up.
 
 A month later, inspection by the KMC health department’s Rapid Action Force (RAF) found that its guidelines had been ignored. “Nothing has changed at several sites. Our team found mosquito larvae in stagnant water that had been allowed to accumulate. We also found heaps of rubbish and construction material. We have now served notices to the errant developers, asking them to take immediate action. If they fail to rectify the situation, we will slap stop-work notice,” said MMiC health Atin Ghosh.
 
 Sources said a notice had already been issued to a developer at a large construction site off EM Bypass. This apart, several developers have been served notices, asking them either to fall in line within a week or face action. The worst offenders are local promoters in added areas like Behala, Garden Reach, Metiabruz,   and stretches off EM Bypass as well as places like Bidhan Sarani, Chittaranjan Avenue, Tollygunge and Jadavpur in Kolkata proper. 
 
 “We need to take our guard against spread of dengue in Kolkata. So far, the situation is under control but with an increasing number of patients testing positive in the neighbouring south Dum Dum and Baranagar, the threat is menacing. Construction sites are potential breeding grounds of mosquitoes and hence we had to act tough,” Ghosh explained.
