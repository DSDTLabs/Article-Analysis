JAIPUR: The   has directed the government to submit recommendations to frame an effective   in the state. 

 The division bench of Justice K S Jhaveri and V K Mathur was hearing a PIL by   on water crisis in the state especially during the summer months. The court directed the government and the petitioner to submit recommendations to frame an effective water policy for the state.
 
 Appreciating the PIL, the court said Gujarat and Maharashtra had made considerable improvement on the water front through an effective water policy with public and community participation, said counsel for the petitioner  .
 
 “It is the need of the hour as water cannot be manufactured, it has to be preserved and conserved,” the court observed. The PIL called for promoting judicial use of limited water available in the state.
 
 The petitioner had pointed out that Rajasthan is the driest state in the country and depends entirely on rainfall to feed its rivers, seasonal or perennial. Thus the dependency on ground water resources is very high. But the ground water in many areas is unsuitable for human consumption due to fluoride and other minerals.
 
 As many as 13,500 villages do not have access to safe drinking water, surviving solely on the mercy of water tankers. The state of Rajasthan has country’s 10% land mass but only 1.1% surface water making it completely disproportional and dependant on ground water which is fast depleting. 
 
 Only 10% of the wells have water that is safe for drinking. The ground water levels in 190 of the 236 blocks are either overused or critically short of water declaring them as ‘dark zones’.
 
 The petition alleged that the government had failed to come out with a concrete plan of action to provide relief to people who are in grave need of water for their day-to-day drinking and sanitation needs.
