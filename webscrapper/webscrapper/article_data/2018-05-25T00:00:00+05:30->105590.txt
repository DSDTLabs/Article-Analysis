Actor   was in   recently. He visited the   in   to continue his research into the Devadasi practice, which he termed “dehumanising”. Chetan also spent time with school kids, narrating stories and asking them to try and become heroes in real life, and to serve their parents and the country. We caught up with Chetan and had a candid chat about his social work, films and his connect with Belagavi…

 
 
 I have come here many times, and spent a lot of time here shooting for my films. During the filming of Suryakanti in 2009, I was here for a month. My tryst with Belagavi dates back many years; my mother studied at the   here. The thing about this city is that whoever comes here is welcomed with open arms. Once, I was running around the city at 2 am to can a scene, and that is when I learnt how warm and caring the people here are, because people on bikes wanted to give me a lift. I was surprised by that. Such is the nature of the people here.
 
 
 
 I am currently shooting for a film titled Ranamma, in which I play a freedom fighter and an activist. I could relate with this role, because, as you know, in real life, I have participated in many agitations.
 
 
 
 It has affected my personal life quite a bit. During the filming of Athiratha, I was called anti-Hindu for a stand that I took on Lingayats. Agitators not only attacked me, but protested against the film as well. Due to this, the film’s producer and team had to face a lot of issues, which was unnecessary. I just hope that in the future, my film teams don’t suffer due to my social work.
