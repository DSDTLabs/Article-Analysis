Surat: Next time you visit Gujarat’s only hill station Saputara, you would be able to enjoy walking on lake water, water zorbing and even cross over the lake on the zip line.

 For the first time, Notified Area Authority and tourism department have set up adventure sports activities at the amusement park and the boating point at a cost of Rs1 crore. The facilities are all set to be opened for the tourists during the summer vacation. 
 
 Sources said the water ball or water walking ball will be used for the first time at a tourist destination like Saputara in the state. The water ball is a large inflatable sphere that allows a person inside it to walk across the surface of a body of water. The giant ball is usually two metres in diameter and has a zippered entrance to allow for easy entry and exit. 
 
 The zip line, on the other hand, will be based on Saputara lake at the boating point. The adventure lovers will be able to cross the lake on the zip line from one point to the other. 
 
 Moreover, Segway ride has also been started at the lake point for the tourists. The battery operated Segway ride allows tourists to travel to nearby places along with their family members and also climb the hilltop.
 
 Notified Area Authority’s chief officer B M Bhabhor told TOI, “Saputara is among the top 13 destinations across the country, which is most frequented by the tourists. The state government’s tourism department and the notified authorities have been working in close cooperation to add more tourist facilities, including adventure sports at the hill station.”
 
 Bhabhor added, “The adventure sports in the lake are going to be a major hit among the tourists. The work on the zip line is going on and will take around 15 days to be completed.” 
 
 Dang administration will launch the summer festival at Saputara from May 13, sources said.
