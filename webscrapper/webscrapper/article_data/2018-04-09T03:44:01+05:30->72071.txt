KOLKATA: Two youths in their early 20s, who were on a speeding bike without helmets, were killed after a truck hit their two-wheeler on   in North Dum Dum in the wee hours of Sunday. Another youth, who was on the same bike, was severely injured. 

 While   (19) and   (18) were declared dead at Kamarhati Sagore Dutta hospital, their friend   (19) is still battling for life.
 
 The bike was reportedly travelling at a breakneck speed on the airport-bound flank of the near-empty expressway when the accident occurred.

"A speeding cement-laden truck coming from behind had hit the bike. All of them suffered head injuries apart from injuries on other body parts," a local trader said.

The injured youth claimed that the truck was racing even as they were trying to avoid potholes. We are ascertaining their claims," an officer of   said.
