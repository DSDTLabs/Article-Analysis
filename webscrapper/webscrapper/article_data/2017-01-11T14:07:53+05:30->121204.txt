NEW DELHI: The  's (SP) cadres are "worried" because "the SP was born out of struggle", said party chief   today, adding that he's working tirelessly to ensure the party doesn't split.

 "Neither are we (me and brother Shivpal) forming a separate party, nor are we changing our symbol," Mulayam said about the SP's electoral symbol, the 'cycle', which has become a bone of contention between the two warring factions of the SP.
 
 In the feud within the SP, party founder Mulayam and his brother Shivpal are on one side and Akhilesh and Mulayam's cousin Ram Gopal are on the other side. Both factions have recently met with   officials staking claim to the 'cycle.'
 
 "This party is born out of struggle, so your worries are habitual and understandable. I am trying to ensure unity in my party. I will not take names, but people are trying to cause a split," Mulayam said.
 
 The SP founder also said he and his brother Shivpal have sacrificed a lot for the country. 
 
 "Shivpal had to go underground during the emergency. Whatever I had, I have given away. I am left with nothing but party workers," Mulayam said to party workers.
 
 The two factions have been quarrelling since September over the re-entry of "outsider"   into the party and also over some other officials that Akhilesh believes have "undue influence" in the party. The latest fight erupted over who the candidates will be to contest the upcoming Assembly elections.
 
 "They (faction led by Akhilesh) have met the president of the rival party three times. I've asked him (Akhilesh) not to get involved in any controversy. I want to keep the party together at any cost," Mulayam said.
