BENGALURU: To   while   and prevent  ,   ( ) has invited a tender for setting up effluent-treatment plants at 54 depots across the state.

 On an average, KSRTC requires 17.50 lakh litres of water a day. At present, only 26 of its 80 depots have   plants, saving 4 lakh litres a day.
 
 KSRTC officials said effluent-treatment plants in 54 depots are expected to save up to 14 lakh litres daily. The corporation is also planning to upgrade existing facilities to ensure 100% recycling of water.
 
 “We’ve appointed two private consultants — Aqua Treat System and Environ India — to prepare a detailed project report to set up effluent-treatment plants in all depots to ensure 100% recycling of water. Earlier, we would treat used water, which is mixed with oil, and release it into drains. But now we want to reuse the same recycled water,” said KSRTC managing director S R Umashankar.
 
 KSRTC has divided the tender to set up effluent-treatment plants into five packages — 12 depots in Bengaluru and Ramanagara divisions; 12 depots in Mysuru, Mandya and Chamarajanagar divisions; 10 depots in Kolar, Tumakuru and Chikkaballapur; 11 depots in Hassan, Chikkamagaluru, Mangaluru and Puttur and 9 depots in Davanagere and Shivamogga divisions. The firm will have to operate and maintain these plants. Each plant will have a capacity to recycle 20,000 litres of water. 
 
  “The waste water from these depots will have detergents, solid suspended matter, oil and diesel. If it is discharged without treatment, it will contaminate our water sources,” environmentalist Yellappa Reddy said.
 
 In May 2017, the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board identified 488 establishments, including a BMTC bus depot at HSR Layout which is letting out effluents into Bellandur Lake.
