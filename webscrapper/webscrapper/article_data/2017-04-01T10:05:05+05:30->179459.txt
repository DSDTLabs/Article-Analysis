MYSURU: State   chief   on Friday said that BJP candidate C S Niranjan Kumar didn't want to contest Gundlupet bypoll as he had lost twice before. "But I persuaded him to enter the fray on the promise that I will get him elected." 

 Even Kumar's father lost the elections twice. Hence Kumar was not keen to contest. "But I told him that I'll get him elected by taking the lead in campaigning," he told a women's convention at Harave. Kumar's family has fought the elections four times and has not enjoyed any power for over two decades. It is time to elect him, he told the gathering.
 
 Yeddyurappa said   candidate   Mahadeva Prasad is trying to drag into a controversy arguing that he had promised her of unanimous el ection. She was in mourning following death of her husband H S Mahadeva Prasad and I paid my last respects and consoled her. "Can I talk to her about politics when she has lost her husband?" he asked adding that energy minister D K Shivakumar has put his words into Geetha's mouth. It is a ploy to defame me, he stated. 
 
 He said he is merely focusing on getting his party candidate elected in the bypoll. MLC and actor Tara, former MP Tejaswini Gowda were present.
 
  
  
 
 Meanwhile, former minister V Somanna said people will revolt in case the Congress leaders, including the CM and energy minister D K Shivakumar try to play tricks and lure voters with money. They are trying to dupe people, he stated, while canvassing at Mallahalli in Nanjangud. He said Congress candidate in Gundlupet Geetha Mahadeva Prasad has misused the name of seer of Suttur mutt by asserting that she got his blessings. The religious leaders bless all and won't be for a particular candidate, he said.
