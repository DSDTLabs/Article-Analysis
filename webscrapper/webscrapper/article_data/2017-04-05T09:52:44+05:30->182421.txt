HYDERABAD: Few can beat   when it comes to perspective. The New Zealand captain, who is part of the  , could fit into only eight of their games last year, but ask him how difficult it is to switch on at short notice and pat comes the reply .

 “That's the nature of IPL,“ he said ahead of the defending champions' opening fixture of   against the Royal Challengers Bangalore.
 
 “The fickle nature of Twenty20 and cricket suggests the more you play , the more chance of making a contribution to the game. A one-off game is never easy .
 
 “You do respect and you do know whenever you get an opportunity , it's not about you.It's trying to do the job for the team and I think that was our strength last year.
 
 “The team we had was a bunch of guys wanting to give to the team, help the side get across the line.“
 
 Help they did and in the year that has gone by; the New Zealander has hardly switched off, so prolific was he. In fact, he was straight off the plane after an intense series against South Africa, and into handling franchise commitments on Tuesday . “You have good days and bad days in the game and that'll be there forever. But we need to have a few days off. It's important to recover, do something else and when the time comes, you are ready to go carrying the focus and the team's focus. It's really important that when you step on the field, you are looking to contribute as best as you can because that's the important thing about being in the side.“
 
 The 26-year-old was also happy with the new mix. “It's exciting having a sort of similar side, but also bringing in some new talent.“
