LUCKNOW/KANPUR: Was there a conspiracy planned to derail a train ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Parivartan Rally in Lucknow on Monday? Was the November 20 train accident in Agra's Pukhrayan also part of a conspiracy? These questions have surfaced on social media after unidentified miscreants were spotted damaging the railway tracks late on Saturday night near Mandhna in Kanpur. 

 Railways minister Suresh Prabhu retweeted a tweet on this incident, voicing his concerns.. 
 
 At around 10.30 PM on Sunday, a Twitter user posted from his handle @iAnkurSingh: "Dear @sureshpprabhu you RTd this means u agree there can be a Conspiracy. Why not get it investigated then? (sic)."
 
 Prabhu retweeted: "It would be investigated thoroughly by multidisciplinary experts (sic)"
 
 Does the minister smell a conspiracy behind Saturday's incident? Earlier, local MP Murli Manohar Joshi too had alleged conspiracy behind the Kanpur rail accident.
