 Agra: Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar University teachers were in for a shock this weekend when they realized that a majority of first year engineering students did not even know basic English. The university had conducted an informal exam for the students of Institute of Engineering and Technology on Friday and the results were shocking. “These students got into the engineering college after clearing an examination conducted by Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University (AKTU). About 150 of them took the test on Friday and as many as 90 (60%) flunked in English. While their performance in science subjects was nearly satisfactory, their command over English language is alarming,” said an Agra university teacher who did not wish to be named.   While the university authorities did not disclose the questions asked in the paper, sources said that students were asked to rewrite sentences and answer question based on a simple English passage. “A majority of students could not distinguish between past, present and future tense. They were not even clear about words and their meanings,” said a source.     The Agra university administration has now decided to hold extra classes in English for these students. Talking to TOI, Girjashankar Sharma, the university’s public relations officer, said, “These extra classes are part of a larger initiative to improve learning standards. Students will be taught in a manner that will help them in learning at least basic English.”     “We have been following AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education) guidelines and have been conducting such exams at regular intervals to identify the area of weakness. One of the reasons why so many students performed badly in English is their rural background. Students from villages are generally weak in English,” said VK Saraswat, director of Institute of Engineering and Technology.
