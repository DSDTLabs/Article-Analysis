BATHINDA: Even as over 90% cotton crop has arrived in the markets and new crop season has already set in, the estimate for cotton arrival has been lowered fifth time for  . On the other hand, the estimates have been revised upwards in the neighbouring states of   and Rajasthan.

 A loss of another over 30,000 bales of cotton is likely in Punjab as per the revised estimate of the arrival of fibre crop in state as against the earlier estimate in the beginning of March 2018. In the revised estimates, the crop arrival in grain markets of Punjab has been lowered at 9.67 lakh bales (1 bale = 170 kg) by cotton trading body   (ICAL). The ICAL keeps tab on cotton arrival and price fluctuation in three states of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan and records sales.
 
 Initially, the estimate was put at 12 lakh bales at the start of the season in October-November 2017 and was lowered to 11 lakh in December and again to 10.37 lakh in January and 9.97 lakh bales at the end of February 2018.
 
 In Haryana, the estimates has been revised to 25.47 lakh bales on March 31 up from 24.30 lakh bales expected on February 28 and likewise estimates in Rajasthan has been revised to 23.12 lakh bales up from estimate of 22.14 lakh bales at the start of March. The less arrival in Punjab, as per market watchers, points towards Punjab crop sold in Haryana and Rajasthan.
 
 Interestingly, the state agriculture department is not ready to accept that Punjab would lose so much on production. The yield surely has come down slightly from 756 kilogram per hectare lint in 2016-17 to 730 kilogram per hectare in 2017-18 season but this reduction in yield may not lower the production to the extent being estimated by the ICAL, claim   officials.
 
 “We need to check whether Punjab cotton is sold in neighbouring states as the arrival in these states has been recorded more than initial estimates whereas in Punjab it has been shown decreasing”, said Punjab agriculture department joint director Sukhdev Singh. Deficient rainfall when it was needed most in July-August and less availability of canal water is cited as the reason behind lowering of yield by the agriculture department authorities.
 
 The price of cotton too has come down to nearly Rs 4,850-4,900 per quintal from nearly Rs 5,000 per quintal a month ago. The cotton was sown in 3.82 lakh hectares in 2017-18 season whereas in the 2016-17 the crop was sown in 2.57 lakh hectares. In 2016-17 cotton season 8.57 lakh bales had arrived in grain markets of Punjab.
 
 In Haryana, cotton was sown in 6.56 lakh hectares in this season, as against 5.70 lakh hectares in 2016-17.
