PATNA:   facing   can expect some relief as the   for the post started at the   on Saturday. The process is expected to continue for around two months to select drivers for the state police force.
 
  According to sources, state’s Central Selection Board for Constable advertised 1577 positions for constables to serve as drivers in the police department.
  
  Around 70,000 candidates appeared for the written and physical test after which around 30,000 candidates were selected for the final phase. The recruitment process started in January this year and the physical tests were conducted a couple of months back.
  
  DSP Chandra Shekhar Singh, who is monitoring the final recruitment process, said it is a lengthy one as each candidate has to appear for driving test on three different categories of vehicle.
  
  He said each selected candidate has to drive a jeep, a car and a truck subsequently on a tricky T-shaped track on the set pattern only after which he is deemed to be fit for the final selection. The driver aspirants have to move the vehicle inside the track and come out of it in reverse gear.
  
  “If a candidate is able to drive a jeep by shifting just three gears within one minute, he gets 10 marks. Same marks are awarded for driving a car and a truck by the same driver. Points keep decreasing on shifting more gears and consuming more time,” Singh said, adding 20 marks are reserved for viva and knowledge of spare parts and maintenance.
  
  According to sources at the police headquarters, there are only 506 constable drivers against the sanctioned strength of 2,736. Somehow, the situation was managed with home guard jawans who served the purpose, but their strike has precipitated the crisis. Moreover, it has become a common practice at police stations to hire private drivers for police patrolling vehicles.
