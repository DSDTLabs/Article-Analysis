PUNE: The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) is probing a possible link between the 10 Bangladeshi immigrants arrested from Pune and Raigad over the last few days and the two high-intensity bombs found in  , Bihar, during Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama's visit there on January 19 . 

  The arrested immigrants seem to have provided shelter to members of the outlawed Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT).   banned ABT in 2013 after its links with   emerged. One of the arrested immigrants was working as a mason at an army quarters construction site near a prominent army academic and training institution in Pune. 
  
  
 State ATS chief Atulchandra Kulkarni said, "We are probing whether these immigrants had any role in the terror activity in Bodh Gaya. For now, there is no concrete lead. We have recovered fake documents like Aadhaar and PAN cards from the arrested immigrants and it is a matter of serious concern. We are surprised how these immigrants created the fake documents. We will take up this issue with the authorities concerned."
 
 The ATS has been working with military intelligence authorities following a tip-off from the West Bengal police about illegal Bangladeshi immigrants having moved into the interiors of the country.
 
 A source from intelligence agencies said militants from the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) had planted improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Bodh Gaya as part of a plot to avenge the alleged atrocities on Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar by Buddhists.
 
 Asenior ATS officer, requesting anonymity, said, “The JMB is supported by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). A large number of JMB operatives have migrated to India and taken shelter in West Bengal and Assam. Some of them have also migrated to Maharashtra and settled in the coastal areas.” The officer said, “Probe has revealed that a large number of Bangladeshi immigrants have identity cards and residential proofs. They can speak Hindi and understand Marathi.”
