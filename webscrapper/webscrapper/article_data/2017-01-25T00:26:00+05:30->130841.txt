Chennai: Tamil Nadu   say that the two-month   for farm loans, announced by the Union government to mitigate the effects of demonetization, is inadequate since it doesn’t address crop losses due to  .

 Primary Agriculture Cooperative Credit Societies (PACCS) in Trichy, Thanjavur and Madurai, want the Centre to grant them 100% waiver in view of the state government declaring the “drought-hit.” 
 
  “If the Centre also declares the state as “drought-hit,” then it can put pressure on the Reserve Bank of India to direct banks to give us a longer moratorium period for repayment,” said Swamimalai S Vimalnathan, secretary, Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association. 
 
  “This relief is being given in view of the devastating effect of demonetisation on farming activities in India. But unlike our peers in the north, who had a good monsoon, we have also had a severe drought. Of 1.45 lakh cultivable land in Madurai, only 15,000 acres were cultivated. And of this only 1,500 or 10% had yield,” said R Arulpragasam, president, Poondi PACCS.
 
  “In Madurai, we largely grow paddy, sugarcane and raw bananas. Our crops have wilted. We are not able to pay our labourers, let alone repay bank loans. Our entire year's investment has turned to zilch,” said Arulpragasam, whose own farm on the Madurai-Azhagar Koil Road yielded just 50 tonnes of sugarcane of poor quality versus a 240 tonne-yield last year.
 
  Local cooperative sugarcane mills have had to import sugarcane from other states to turn their mills, say farmers. “Our crop has died. Normally we’d get 50 tonnes of sugarcane per acre. Today, our yield is just 10 tonnes an acre. The government needs to intervene,” said T Thilagar, a farmer from Usilampatti, Madurai.
 
  Another problem faced by farmers is banks using cheques encashed with them to settle loans. 
 
 “We need cheques given to us by vendors for our working capital. To buy equipment and seeds, and hire labourers we need that money,” said farmers.
