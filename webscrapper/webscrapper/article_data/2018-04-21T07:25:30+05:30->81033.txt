PANAJI: Following reports that Goa police recommended that the directorate of transport suspend over 7,000 driving licences for various traffic offences, the directorate on Friday clarified that this won’t be carried out until legal opinion is sought. The directorate said that it has moved a proposal to the state government to obtain legal advice on the issue.

 
 
 
  
 
 Director   on Friday directed all licencing authorities to keep in abeyance all requests for suspension till further orders. He also asked authorities to defer dates fixed for hearings indefinitely with immediate effect. “Any violation of these directives will make the licencing authority concerned liable for strict disciplinary action,” he said.
 
 The director said that the order was issued in view of increasing requests from police authorities for suspension of licences as per the guidelines framed by the   committee on road safety (SCORS).
 
 Desai said that there have been concerns raised in various quarters about whether such guidelines are binding on statutory authorities, and whether the action of suspending licences after compounding the offences amounts to double jeopardy.
 
 Meanwhile, DGP   told TOI that Goa traffic police is implementing the directions of SCORS strictly. The DGP said that the RTO is ‘likely’ to suspend licences of all those caught violating traffic rules. This is in addition to fines payable for violations, he said. “Driving after your licence is suspended has severe consequences if you meet with an accident,”   said. “It will prima facie be a grave, negligent act, and no insurance cover will be available. So, abide by traffic rules.”
