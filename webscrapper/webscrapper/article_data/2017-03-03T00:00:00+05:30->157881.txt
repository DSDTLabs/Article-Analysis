Actress-danseuse-filmmaker   is a happy person. Her latest film,  , which was sent to over 90 festivals across the globe, has just earned its first international recognition. The children’s film was awarded the Best Foreign Film at the   International Film Festival.   says, “This is a prestigious film festival at which they get around 1,500 films from across the world, and select only 10% to be screened. On Tuesday, we heard that we were semifinalists, and on March 1 they declared us winner. As filmmakers, we dream of making a film in Hollywood, now I feel so happy to share this news proudly that we have won an award in Hollywood.” She adds that she is looking forward to the award ceremony.
