SHIMLA: A day after chief minister   accused the Enforcement Directorate (ED) of concealing facts and giving out a “concocted” value of the   by it just to “sensationalize” the matter, Arun Thakur, younger son of leader of opposition Prem Kumar Dhumal, countered him by saying that investigation in the case has led to   valued at Rs 1.5-Rs 2 lakh crores.

 Addressing media persons in Una on Wednesday, Arun Thakur said it is very unfortunate that Virbhadra rather than resigning has started blaming officials. He said all the officers involved have done a fantastic job in the national interest and deserve accolades rather than brick bats from the corrupt.
 
 He alleged that   had laundered crores of rupees on behalf of Virbhadra Singh through IPO proceeds of one of his company Tarini International. The IPO was listed on June 9, 2014. He said the company had extremely weak financials with annual revenue of Rs 70 lakh and profit of mere Rs 2 lakh.
 
 Arun alleged that a part of IPO proceeds was transferred to   a company owned by Virbhadra Singh’s son. He said the lead manager of the company was raided in Kolkata and it got confirmed that Chandrashekhar routed cash proceeds through various paper entities and the money was brought back to Tarini International and subsequently to Maple Destination.
 
 He said given poor financial health of Vakamulla and his companies, it is obvious that the cash belonged to Virbhadra Singh as it was finally routed to Maple Destination. He said that Kolkata raid led to expose of many such entities and individuals leading to unearthing of thousands of shell companies being used by people like Virbhadra Singh to launder their ill gotten money.
