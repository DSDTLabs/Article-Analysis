Bengaluru: The Justice Nagmohan Das-headed expert committee, which is looking into the issue of providing minority tag to Veerashaivas-Lingayats, has sought an extension of six months to submit its report, and politicians see this as a boon ahead of the 2018 elections. While water resources M B Patil, who is spearheading the movement for a separate Lingayat identity, has sought for an early resolution, JD(S) MLC Basavaraj Horatti said the extension could, in fact, be a boon rather than bane and help the ruling Congress shed the image of using religion to divide the Lingayat community ahead of polls. However, state minorities commission chairman Nasir Ahmed declined to comment on the extension sought, saying he is out of town and requires time to look into the terms of reference given to the expert committee. According to Horatti, while the delay will unnecessarily give a lot of room to detractors, who are seeking to derail the Lingayats’ demand for a separate minority tag, it’d be a blessing in disguise for those politicians who are being accused of trying to divide the community. "The expert committee was given a month’s time to look into the history of the community and give its opinion, and it could have been completed the task within the time frame. However, the demand for a six-month extension is acceptable as the movement needs to benefit the community rather than any political party. Congress and JD(S), which are being accused of trying to divide the community for electoral gain, stand to benefit because of this move," he said.
