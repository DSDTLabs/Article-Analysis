PALAKKAD: The   has sought the urgent intervention of Chief Minister   for getting water released from the inter-state Parambikulam Aliyar Project (PAP) by   to save the drinking water schemes in Bharathapuzha. 

  In a letter to the CM on Saturday, Committee secretary Dr P S Panikkar urged him to take up the matter with his Tamil Nadu counterpart because most of the drinking water sources based in Bharathapuzha had dried up, creating serious drinking water problems in Palakkad, Thrissur and Malappuram districts.
 
  The letter said that Bharathapuzha is the lifeline of the people of these districts as it is their main source of drinking water.
 
 It provides drinking water to 175 grama panchayats and eight municipalities in these districts. So the drying up of the river will deprive drinking water to lakhs of people, Dr Panikkar said.
 
  He said as per PAP agreement, Tamil Nadu should give 7.25 TMC feet of water to Kerala at Manakadavu weir for Chitturpuzha annually. But it has diverted the water from Parambikulam, Thunacadavu and Peruvaripallam reservoirs of PAP to Thirumurthy and denied Kerala its due share of water resulting in a   on the drinking water front.
