LUCKNOW: Considering the SIT statement that it does not arrest any accused during probe, the high court on Wednesday disposed of the petition of former Uttar Pradesh minister   seeking quashing of an FIR and stay on his arrest in a probe into alleged irregularities in recruitment in UP Jal Nigam during Azam’s tenure.

 The probe is being done by the Special Investigating Team. The court directed Azam to cooperate in the investigation and make himself available for recording his statement. A bench of Justice DK Upadhyay and Justice Rajnish Kumar passed the order.
 
 Azam had demanded that the FIR should be quashed because it did not disclose commission of any cognizable offence.
 
 The government counsels — additional advocate general VK Sahi, government advocate Vimal Srivastava and additional government advocate S N Tilhari — told the court that SIT does not arrest any accused during investigation.
 
 They added that SIT submits its probe report to a three-member committee of the government headed by principal secretary home which then takes a call on arrest of the accused.
