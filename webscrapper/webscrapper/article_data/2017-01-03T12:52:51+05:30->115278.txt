In an interview to a daily the actor said he will be collaborating with Prabhu Deva for the second time. “Prabhu Deva and I are looking at some promising subjects and we may well team up once again soon. The two of us are more like brothers and we share a great confidence in each other. We had a great time working for my debut production and it would be exciting to team up with him again,” 

 Sonu Sood is all set to be seen next with   in the forthcoming Sino-Indian film, ‘Kung Fu Yoga’ which also stars Disha Patani.
