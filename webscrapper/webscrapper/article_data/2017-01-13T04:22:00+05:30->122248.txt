Nagpur: The latest murders of Manohar Atla (45) and his nephew Ramesh (22) by Naxalites at Chichoda village, around 8 kms from Fulbodi-Gatta in Dhanora taluka in north Gadchiroli, have left a shocking trail in the district as the victims were former supporters of the rebels. With the latest murders, the toll of civilians killed by the rebels in the last few weeks in Gadchiroli reached six. 

 The Atlas, who were part of the Naxals’ Area rakshak dal (ARD) and Gram rakshak dal (GRD) outfits, were shot dead from close range by the Naxals labelling them as ‘informers’. The uncle and his nephew were summoned out of their house by the Naxalites before killing them in front of their family members. 
 
 Sources from the police department claimed that the contents of the pamphlets, left behind by the Naxals, indicated that the rebels assumed that the slain duo was behind tipping-off the police force regarding their presence in the forest near Chichoda village in 2015 which had led to encounters in which two Naxalites were killed while several others were injured. The security forces had recovered two bodies too from the spot. The Naxalites have claimed that the latest murders were in revenge of the 2015’s encounters. 
 
 The Naxals’ claim was, however, refuted by the SP, Gadchiroli, Abhinav Deshmukh. “There was no connection between the 2015 encounters and the Atla kin who were unnecessary killed by the Naxalites. In fact, the police records showed the Atlas as naxal sympathizers who were part of their local formats at villages,” he said. 
 
 A section of the police have claimed that the latest killing was carried out by Chatgaon Local organization squad (LOS) which is headed by commander Yogesh.
