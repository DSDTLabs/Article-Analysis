Nag Ashwin's much-awaited Savitri biopic '
 ' is finally here, starring  , Dulquer Salmaan,   and   in lead roles.

 Featuring music by Mickey J Meyer, the film charts the journey of the   from her childhood to fame, and later her consequent downfall and death. The first half of the film sees an underdog journalist 
 Madhuravani (Samantha) and her photographer Anthony (Vijay Deverakonda) being asked to write about Savitri (Keerthy Suresh) being in coma since a year. After a press meet with Gemini Ganeshan (Dulquer Salmaan), the duo decide to delve deeper into the actress' life and write about a side of her hitherto unknown.
 
 The first half sees Savitri's childhood, where she and her widowed mother have no choice but to move in with her uncle and aunt (Rajendra Prasad and Bhanupriya). Her only solace is her best friend Susheela (Shalini Pandey). After finding out that dancers make good money, her uncle pushes her to learn dance, do theatre and later, be a part of films.
 
 'Mahanati' has so far been an engaging and beautiful ride, with the character development of Savitri being its main focus. Innocent and enticing, Keerthy Suresh does a beautiful job of playing the Mahanati. While the first half has many arresting moments, the subtle sense of humour, the song Sada Nannu and  's cameo as ANR are definitely the highlights. Despite knowing how it all turns out in the end, with the scenes before the interval slowly turning things considerably serious, it remains to be seen how the second half will fare.
