NEW DELHI: Countering deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia’s claims that the   vice-chancellor is interfering in the delayed governing body (GB)  , some college principals have alleged that government officials are calling them up and demanding that the government-nominated candidates should win the post of the   chairperson and treasurer — even in colleges which only get 5% of their total funding from the state.

 On Tuesday, the deputy CM wrote to the VC alleging that the governing body polls at Satyawati College were postponed at the behest of two senior university officials. 
 
 The DU officials have denied the charge. Speaking to TOI, Payal Maggo, the joint dean of academics, refuted the allegations and said that she “has never called up any college principal regarding the GB elections”.
 
 A senior DU official, however, claimed that the government was calling up principals and demanding its nominated members get elected. “Already, 14 colleges are conducting elections, out of which nine colleges did not even follow procedures. When the election meeting was postponed at Satyawati College after opposition from a few teachers, the deputy CM wrote to the VC because he realised that their nominated members won’t win,” the DU official said on the condition of anonymity.
 
 This was corroborated by a principal whose college is fully funded by the government. “We often get calls from the government asking us to keep their nominated members on priority.” 
 
 Another principal of a DU college, partially funded by the government, said they also got calls from officials. “The government wants to be involved in every activity despite paying a minimal amount,” the principal said on the condition of anonymity.
 
 Despite attempts, government officials were not available for comments.
