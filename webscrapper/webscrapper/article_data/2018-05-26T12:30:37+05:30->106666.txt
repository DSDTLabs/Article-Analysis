CHANDIGARH: A Union   comprising the Prime Minister and minister of home affairs has reappointed a former   faculty who had recently superannuated from service.

 Dr D  , head of pulmonary medicine in PGI, Chandigarh, had superannuated on March 31 this year. This is one of the rare appointments given only to eminent faculty of esteemed medical institutions like the PGI and AIIMS.
 
 Dr  , oncologist in AIIMS, New Delhi, has been given the charge of the cancer department for another two years, despite his superannuation. In addition, Dr HS Chawla, who was heading the dental department in PGI a decade ago, was also reappointed.
 
 “I got offers from many private hospitals soon after I retired. But, I am keen to teach and do research in PGI. I will also serve the patients here,” said Behera. He has also served as dean research at the institute.
 
 However, after this  , Behera will not head any committee in the institute. He has completed 40 years in PGI and has been holding positions in national and international bodies in tuberculosis research. “The government is keen to retain talented and experienced faculty who are usually lured by the private sector. Therefore, there is a provision of taking consent from the faculty of the concerned department and then move it for approval to the Appointments Committee of Cabinet (ACC),” said a senior faculty.
 
 The age of retirement of teaching faculty in national institutes like AIIMS and PGI is 65 years.
