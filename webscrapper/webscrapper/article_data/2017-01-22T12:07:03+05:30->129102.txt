JAIPUR: Former diplomat Haksar joined scholars   and   at a session titled ‘Battling the Gods: Atheism in the Ancient World’ at the   (JLF) on Saturday.

 The session focused on   literature that was not liturgical, philosophical or religious. Far from the common notion that all Sanskrit literature is either philosophical or religious, there is much in the ancient tradition that is atheistic, quite like the Epicurean tradition.
 
 Haksar spoke of the materialistic Charvaka tradition, which held that all that mattered was matter – there was no soul, no accumulation of sin or virtue, no afterlife. So, what was important was only the living which was pleasurable.
 
 Haksar read out little couplets in translation from this tradition that underlined the need to stop fretting, recommending that one drown one’s sorrows in drink.
 
 Alex Watson, who teaches Sanskrit and Indian philosophy at Ashoka University, explained that there was a robust tradition of atheism in seven of the nine major schools of Indian philosophy. However, in many Sanskrit works, the contention is not so much with the notion of ‘Ishwara’ or God, but the notions of karma, samsara or moksha.
 
 Tim Whitmarsh spoke of atheism within ancient Greek traditions. Sanskrit scholar Arshia Sattar, who moderated the discussion, underlined how these robust traditions of atheism were seldom even referred to in modern discourse on Sanskrit literature.
