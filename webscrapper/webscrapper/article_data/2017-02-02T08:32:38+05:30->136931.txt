THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Incidents of violence marred the BJP-sponsored hartal, which crippled normal life in the capital district on Wednesday. Police resorted to lathi-charge after BJP workers tried to break through barricades at Peroorkada Junction to enter the nearby   Law College. 

 Protesters retaliated by hurling stones and bottles, forcing the police to use water cannons and teargas shells, injuring several BJP workers, including party state vice-president P P Vava.
 
 Vava, who was trying to pacify party workers, was hit by a teargas shell and he suffered head injuries. He has been admitted to the Medical College Hospital. 
 
 Control room assistant commissioner V Suresh Kumar, Peroorkada circle inspector S S Suresh Babu and sub-inspectors of Peroorkada and Mannanthala police stations were also among the injured. A few media persons too suffered injuries. The hartal was over the alleged police atrocity against BJP workers on Tuesday. Later, the police arrested and removed V Muraleedharan from the protest venue. BJP state secretary V V Rajesh would replace him and continue the hunger strike. 
 
 Meanwhile, ABVP has called for an education bandh in all colleges in the state on Thursday. In Thrissur, an   worker and student of Sree Rama Polytechnic, E M Jithin, was allegedly attacked and injured by SFI activists, who opposed AISF's state-wide strike over the Law Academy issue. TNN
