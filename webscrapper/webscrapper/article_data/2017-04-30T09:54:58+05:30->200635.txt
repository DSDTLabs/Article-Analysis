PUNE: Hotels around highways in the city are facing a unique complication. Clients who book rooms in their hotels are stepping out to dine elsewhere. 

 With liquor out and mini bars locked, the hotels are reporting a 40%-50% dip in food and beverage (F&B) sales as clients are choosing to dine in places where the tipple still flows freely. Room bookings in highway hotels have dipped by 15%, with some clients turning into ‘no-shows’.
 
 Another shocker for them has been clients, mostly leisure travellers like foreigners, are cutting down their stay in such hotels. “After all, who would want to step out of the hotel each day to wine and dine elsewhere?” said a hotelier. 
 
 Dilip Datwani, president of Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), said, “While room bookings in such hotels have dipped by 15% since the ban, dip in sales in the F&B segment has been up to 40% as liquor compliments food.” 
 
 A   research had recently assessed the effects of the   judgement on premium segment hotels (five-star and five-star D category) of top 12 cities in India. The research had said that Pune has been the worst affected by the ban and that about 71% hotels in Pune, which lie along NH-8, NH-60 and SH-27, have already been affected by cancellations in upcoming events. 
 
 It said hotels close to IT business hubs of   and Kharadi have been worst affected due to their proximity to the Mumbai-Pune Expressway and  . 
 
 The manager added that while rental footfalls (guests staying in the hotel) at his restaurant have dipped by 35%, non-rental footfalls at the restaurant have dropped by 75%. Meanwhile, those hotels unaffected by the SC ban have witnessed a jump in room bookings in April this year.
