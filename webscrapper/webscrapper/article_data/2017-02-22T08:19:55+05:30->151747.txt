HYDERABAD: The mystery behind the death of 32-year-old Monster.com telecaller K Sunitha, whose badly burnt body was found last week at   in Madhapur, took a murkier turn on Tuesday. Police have booked her boyfriend   for abetment to suicide. However, they are yet to arrest him.

 Addressing a media briefing here on Tuesday, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Madhapur, M Ramana Kumar confirmed that Sunitha committed suicide and it was not a murder as suspected earlier.
 
 Police are now analysing WhatsApp messages she sent over the last year to Shravan Kumar, a resident of   and employed with a BPO at Madhapur. The messages ran close to over 500 pages.
 
 “On Valentine's Day, the victim had sent Shravan a message saying that she wanted to meet him for one last time. However, he responded curtly and said that she could go and die. His retort might have pushed her over the edge,“ Madhapur inspector (detective) K   said.
 
 “Shravan reportedly is having multiple affairs. That is why the victim asked him to marry her. However, he refused,“ he added.
 
 In a few messages, Shravan even demanded money and did not shy away from asking the victim for a motorcycle, the inspector further added.
 
 Police have booked Shravan Kumar under the charge of abetment to suicide and might quiz him soon over the case.
