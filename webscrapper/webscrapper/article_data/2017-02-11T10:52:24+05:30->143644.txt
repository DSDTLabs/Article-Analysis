BENGALURU: A woman lost diamond and gold ornaments worth Rs five lakh after a gang of miscreants distracted her by telling her she had dropped Rs 10 currency notes on the street. 

 The incident took place on 100 Feet Road,  , on Friday morning, and comes days after a gang used   to steal a businessman’s cash bag. 
 
 Rani Bhagya, a private firm employee and resident of Indiranagar was headed to Binnamangala off Old Madras Road. She was carrying a bag full of diamond and gold jewellery worth over Rs 5 lakh in the car, and wanted to deposit it in a bank locker.
 
 Police suspect she was followed by the gang, which waylaid the car claiming she had dropped some cash on the road. The gang members themselves had laid out the Rs 10 denomination notes on the road to trap her. When Rani got out of the car, the miscreants snatched the bag and fled.
 
 Police said they are scanning the   footage from the area. They suspect it to be the handiwork of someone known to Rani or someone observing her movements.
 
 Beware: Techniques used by miscreants
 
 *Punctured tyre
 
 Conmen knock on window to tell driver about the car’s flat tyre. When the person steps out to check, his/her valuables are stolen
 
 *Paint on clothes
 
 Misceants pour paint/ink on the shirts of motorcycle riders. While one of them offers the biker water to clean the shirt, his aide vanishes with the valuables
 
 *Jumping in front of car
 
 A man jumping in front of the car is another tactic used by conmen. Cars moving at slow speeds are usually targeted. In a recent case, a man who alighted from his car to help a man who fell on the road lost Rs 1.3 lakh
 
 Currency on road
 
 *One of the most effective methods used by miscreants, this involves tricking the driver by dropping currency notes on the road. When the driver gets out of the car to collect the money, the thieves flee with the money or mobile phones
 
 *Road rage
 
 Two men on a motorcycle chase a driver, alleging he has knocked down a man. During the argument, the men flee with the money
