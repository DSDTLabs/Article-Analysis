TRICHY: Seeking removal of eucalyptus trees planted across thousands of acres of land in   district, members of three voluntary organisations and children came together on Saturday to petition the district collector.

 Close to 100 people including children, their parents and members of various NGO’s reached the collector office on Saturday.
 
 Selva Kumar who led the group to the collector office said that the eucalyptus trees grown on thousands of acres of land in Pudukkottai were responsible for the drought-like situation.
 
 These trees not only spoiled the soil but also sucked gallons of ground water which had now resulted in the depletion of ground water in Pudukkottai, he said.
 
 Over 30,000 acres of land is under eucalyptus farming and a majority is grown by the state government through forest department under the social forestry scheme. Besides, a few hundred acres of private land was also under eucalyptus cultivation, he said. The group handed a petition to the district revenue officer in the absence of collector and dispersed.
 
 Pudukkottai district which is one of the worst-hit districts in terms of water scarcity was once known for its effective water management. Water was never scarce in the region because of water brimming lakes and tanks during dynastic rules.
 
 “Our kings had knowledge of water management and they created tanks that were used for all purposes,” said children who were part of the procession. “However, such tanks and lakes have gone dry without water, even the deep bore wells too are dry,” they said.
