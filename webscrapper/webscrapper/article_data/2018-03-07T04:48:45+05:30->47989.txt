MUMBAI: Cricketer and   member Sachin   has batted for a single zone comprising suburban networks of   for better management of services, which carry almost 75 lakh commuters daily. In a letter to Union railway minister Piyush Goyal, Tendulkar said, "I am sure you will support this idea beyond the difficulties of implementation, it will provide much needed focus, budgetary assistance and exclusive administration to the needs of the people of Mumbai." 

 He batted for setting up of a corporation for Mumbai's suburban network. Tendulkar reasoned, "It will help optimise management of suburban railway stations and surrounding railway-owned land, and enable speedy decision-making, holistic planning and execution of projects. It will also free Mumbai suburban from overall supervision of Indian Railway, which remains largely preoccupied with maintenance of country's national rail network."
 
 In fact, minister of state for railway   had replied to his query in the Rajya Sabha on December 11, 2015, that a group of senior officials found it was not feasible.
