NEW DELHI: The   has deferred taking a decision on the governing body   of 28 Delhi government-funded colleges citing “improper procedure” being followed in nominations. The decision was taken at the EC meeting held on Friday.

 A five-member committee has now been formed to look into the names. “The committee will comprise the dean of colleges, two EC members, a college principal and a court member,” said EC member AK Bhagi. Many members opposed the nominations claiming that “there are 39 academicians from JNU who would not know how DU functions.” Virender Negi, a member of National Democratic Teachers’ Front, added that JNU professor Archana Prasad’s nomination “is objectionable as she has Naxalite links and an FIR has been lodged against her in Bastar.”
 
 “The EC resolution states that there should be people of varied backgrounds, including academicians, doctors and legal professionals, in the governing body. Bringing in too many academicians will not serve the purpose,” said EC member Rajesh Jha. The EC members also raised concerns over the delay by Delhi government in providing the names. 
 
 Many DU members have suggested that the colleges which receive 95% funding from UGC should be managed entirely by the university. “This will curtail political interference in the functioning and appointment of   members,” said Pankaj Garg, academic council member.
