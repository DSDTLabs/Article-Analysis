LONDON: Since 2013, London-based Bangladeshi blogger   has been under London Met protection. The reason? His name figures in the hit list of 84 atheist bloggers identified by extremists in Bangladesh.

 Death threats by email are not new for this civil engineer, the last such being on July 30. However, on Saturday, he received a death threat by post at his London residence after which he lodged a complaint with the Forest Gate police station.
 
 “Earlier, I was the only target. But in this letter, the threat has been extended to my family, including my kids who study in London. The group that sent the letter claims to be following us 24x7 and knows all about our whereabouts. Specific details regarding where my children and my nephew study have also been mentioned,” he said.
 
 The letter claimed that Das Gupta’s parents, who live in Bangladesh’s Habijang, aren’t safe either. The same has been mentioned about his in-laws. “I would have ignored this threat, too, but they dragged in my family and kids. I will speak to school authorities to check what precautions can be taken,” said Das Gupta, who is the science and technology secretary of London Metropolitan Awami League Unit.
 
 Das Gupta, as expected, has been asked to stop blogging in the threat letter. “Free thinkers are in danger everywhere in the world.   was critical of right-wing politics in India. She got killed. If anyone criticises Tory politics in the UK, she or he would face the same situation. The same may happen in the US. People are scared of talking against Donald Trump. But I will continue to write. I will be more vigilant now,” he said.
 
 Police called on Das Gupta on Monday as well. “They told me to be vigilant and call 999 if anything was wrong. In 2013, I was given an alarm by  . On being pressed, it sends out a big alarm. I still carry it with me. I refuse to bow to threats. Courage, after all, is my biggest shield,” he said.
