INDORE: In absence of facilities, including screening for early detection of the inherited blood disorder and bone-marrow transplant ( ), the mortality rate due to thalassemia has become very high. Around 1,500 people in the city suffer from the disease.

  “Chacha Nehru Children Hospital (CNCH) has as many as 471 registered patients and around 4,520 blood transfusions occur every year among them. It is the only treatment available to increase the blood cells” said,   superintendent professor Dr Hemant Jain. He said that around 65 per cent thalassemia patients are above five years of age. During this period it becomes difficult to get a high survival rate even after doing a BMT since irons overload in liver and heart cause hepatic and cardiac failure.
 
  “Under the central and state government funded super- speciality project, screening and BMT facility will be started in the building of MY hospital in next six months,” said   (MGMMC) dean Dr Sharad Thora.
 
 Once the facility will starts, those who come under below poverty line (BPL) and the beneficiaries of   will be treated in free. It will cost around Rs 3 lakh for the patients belonging to above poverty line.
 
 “It costs around Rs 15-20 lakh for BMT,” said Dr Thora.
