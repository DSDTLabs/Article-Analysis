Vasco: Around 370 shops at the Mormugao municipal market are at the mercy of just one water hydrant, a new unit which was installed a few months ago during the renovation of the town’s clock tower. While there are rumored to be others around, nobody — officials included — knows how many there are, just that they haven’t been used in over a decade.  The Vasco fire station, which has spent several years writing to the Mormugao Municipal Council about the condition of the hydrants to no avail, seems to have given up; no letter has been sent at least for a year now. “Water hydrants are very significant as during emergencies, fire tenders don’t have to return for refilling but just be connected to hose pipes,” says station fire officer Francisco Mendes. “That way, we can continue fighting fire and thereby saving life and property.” Mendes says that he hasn’t seen the hydrants working for over 10 years, during which sources say the council hasn’t deemed it important enough to get the hydrants in working condition. “This is a thickly-populated area and if a fire breaks out, there is hardly any chance of saving anything,” says shopkeeper Anil Naik.  “The council has been adamant about collecting rents and has even sealed properties if rents were not paid. But, when it comes to doing their job, they are least bothered,” he adds. MMC’s chief officer Deepali Naik said “recently, the matter came up again and I have issued directions to our staff to prepare a report on water hydrants. In two months, we plan to make the hydrants functional”.
