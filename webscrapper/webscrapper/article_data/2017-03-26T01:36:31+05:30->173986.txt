 Lucknow: After reports of boys being allegedly harassed by the   squad, prinicipals of the city colleges came out in their support.   should only have eve-teasers on their radar and not every boy standing near a girls’ college is an eve-teaser, they said. 
 
 “Detaining each and every boy on suspicion is not the right thing to do. It may be a good move for the girls but at the same time, we cannot ignore boys’ welfare either. A boy should not be harassed on mere suspicion,” principal of Guru Nanak Girls’ Degree College. Kamla Bisht. 
 
 She said, “My college is near the Naka police station. Once a boy stood near the college early in the morning. When a police official asked him, he said his sister was taking an exam and he had escorted her so he was waiting for her to finish. But the policemen didn’t believe him until the college corroborated his explanation.” 
 
 Echoing similar sentiments, Upma Chaturvedi, principal of Avadh Girls’ Degree College, said, “The role of the police is important in an anti-Romeo squad. They should be sensitive in handling cases. They should not harass every boy found sitting with a girl.” 
 
 “As far as the safety of girls is concerned, it is a welcome move but the anti-Romeo drive should not turn into a drive to harass boys. The issues and the problems need to be resolved sensibly. There should not be moral policing,”said principal of Isabella Thoburn, Vinita Prakash.
 
 False cases of eve-teasing may blow up into other issues...a falsly implicated boy may commit suicide. Their mental health would also be affected and the system should keep their welfare in mind,” said Uma Chowdhury, principal of Khun Khun Ji Girl’s PG College.
