BENGALURU: The   (BDA) will launch an   at its 40-odd residential   to identify unauthorised sites and  . The authority will hire an independent agency to conduct the survey and revenue analysis.

 G Lingamurthy, deputy commissioner (land acquisition), BDA, said they recently floated tenders calling for consultants for the audit. “BDA has formed over 60 large layouts in the city. Though the audit started a decade ago, it was stuck three years back due to various reasons. Till then, we had completed auditing of about 20 layouts. The fresh audit will cover the remaining ones,” he added.
 
 Each layout will be audited for the number of vacant sites, unsold ones, whether people have built on allotted sites, encroachments or unauthorised constructions, if any. “The recovered land from illegal occupation will be auctioned,” he added. About three-and-a-half years ago when the BDA conducted an audit of 12 layouts, it came to know that it was sitting on real estate worth multiple crores of rupees. 
 
 These land parcels included vacant unallotted plots, corner sites and other commercial spaces. About 6,000 unsold corner sites were identified in these layouts, said a senior official.
 
 The audit is expected to bring a windfall for the cash-strapped BDA whose plans to develop layouts have come a cropper over the last decade, barring   which has seen some progress since last year. 
 
 The move comes in the wake of a recent urban development department directive, which sought details of vacant land with BDA.
