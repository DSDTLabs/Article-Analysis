Vadodara: While he is still absconding in the murder case of gangster Mukesh Harjani, the kingpin Vinod Udhwani alias Vijay alias Viju Sindhi has once again become active in liquor business in the state. 

 Police investigations has revealed that the stock worth over Rs 37 lakh which was seized by Karjan police near Bharthana toll plaza on February 9 belonged to Viju Sindhi and another co-accused in the same case — Lalchand Khanani alias Lalu Sindhi. 
 
 While Viju Sindhi is on run, Lalu had surrendered before a judicial magistrate’s court in the murder case in November last year. Since he already had anticipatory bail, he was released after his police custody ended. 
 
 A police official said that though the liquor stock seized was manufactured in Haryana, it was dispatched from Banswada in Rajasthan and was supposed to be delivered at Sardar Estate. 
 
 The involvement of the duo surfaced after interrogation of the truck driver Dalveer Singh Jat and checking call detail records of his phone.
 
 Jat was arrested by cops when he was trying to speed off with the truck carrying 762 boxes of liquor. Just a week before this consignment was seized, another consignment of Viju Sindhi was seized by State Monitoring Cell in the jurisdiction of Santrampur police station in Mahisagar. 
 
 In that case too, Viju Sindhi and other bootleggers’ – Ashok Marwadi and Dilip Prajapati alias Dilip Marwadi – involvement had surfaced during the course of investigations.
