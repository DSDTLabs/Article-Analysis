GUWAHATI: After the NSG cover for former Assam chief minister   was withdrawn by the Union home ministry, the AGP founder-president on Thursday said he has been discriminated against. 

 "I would not mind if there was a credible home ministry report (regarding this). I don't want any kind of NSG cover. The love of the people is enough for me. It seems, however, that the report was influenced by a letter written by former chief minister Tarun Gogoi. This is unfortunate," Mahanta said, addressing reporters here.
 
 NSG cover was withdrawn and replaced with   security for both former   recently. Mahanta said this came only after Tarun Gogoi wrote to the home ministry. "It is learnt that the home ministry reports say there's a threat. If that is the case, why just CRPF and not NSG for me? According to the home ministry, they didn't want to engage the elite commandos for VIPs. I accept that but when it comes to other leaders, the norm is different. Altogether, 13 leaders in the country receive the NSG cover," he added.
 
 Meanwhile, Assam chief minister  , agriculture minister and AGP president Atul Bora, and IT minister Keshab Mahanta have written to the Union minister seeking NSG cover for Mahanta on February 4. 
 
 "If Gogoi's letter can influence the home ministry report, let's see how a CM's letter works," said Mahanta. 
 
 Mahanta, however, continues to enjoy the NSG cover after   ordered stay on the home ministry decision on February 13.
