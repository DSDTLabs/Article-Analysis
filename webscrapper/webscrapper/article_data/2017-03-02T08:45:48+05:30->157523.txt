NEW DELHI: Delhi government is ready to present its first ever “outcome“ budget next week. Allocations to each department will be accompanied with goals and how they will benefit the common man or whom they are aimed at.

 “A comprehensive outcome budgeting exercise was carried out by each department and agency in which all major programmes and schemes were mapped against outputs, like tangible infrastructure or services to be provided, benefit from programmes, etc. Subsequently, outcome and targets for 2017-18 have been set,“ said a senior government official.
 
 In a review meeting of heads of departments, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the finance portfolio, said: “A traditional budget emphasises only financial outlays and spending on various activities but stops short of promising outcomes that citizens eventually care about. This outcome budget will constitute a contract between Delhi government -and, therefore, each department official, and the people of Delhi.“
 
 As the list of indicators is expected to run into thousands, the government is also planning to develop an IT application to track the commitments on a quarterly basis.
 
 “Tracking will be done on inputs provided by departments,“ said an official.
