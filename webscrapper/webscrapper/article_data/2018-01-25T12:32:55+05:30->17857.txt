VADODARA: A sessions court here denied bail to cash-for-marks scam co-accused Dhruvin   on Wednesday. Shah, who is currently in jail after he surrendered in September last year, had sought bail from the court second time on January 6.

However, the court upheld the arguments made by the investigating agency through its affidavit that he had helped the kingpin of the case   to run the entire scam.
 
 It was also argued during the hearing that he used to run a website in the name of   through which he used to get admissions for the students in medicine and engineering courses. The court also observed that though second chargesheet was filed, the circumstances have not changed.
