HYDERABAD: MIM leader   is facing hurdles in campaigning for Pune municipal elections scheduled for February 21.Though people are eager to listen to the articulate Hyderabad MP, Maharashtra police are making it tough for him to hold rallies.

 When he landed in Pune on February 14, the `welcome party' was ready at the airport. But police served him a notice under Section 149 CrPC which Owaisi had to sign and acknowledge. The section gives authority to police to issue a notice to prevent cognizable offences.
 
 Owaisi took to twitter to express his anguish: “I have been served Section 149 CrPC notice by police in Pune on my arrival at airport. No other political leader was given any such notice,“ he said.
 
 The Hyderabad MP pointed out he had made 19 speeches in Uttar Pradesh where the MIM is contesting, but he had neither been served any notice nor sued for his spee ches. In Pune municipal corporation elections, Asaddudin's party has fielded 25 candidates.
 
 Owaisi, however, did not take the curbs lying down. In a speech at a rally on February 14 in Pune, he dared the Maharashtra government to silence him. “I will walk alone after the rally. I dare you to kill me. Shoot 15 bullets at me, if you will, but I am not scared. You can kill me in an encounter like  ,“ Owaisi said in his fiery speech. Khwaja Younus, a 27 year-old software engineer of Parbhani, died in police custody in 2003 after his arrest in a BEST bus blast.
 
 Owaisi said he could not be silenced by threats. “I am running a fever. My throat is sore and my patience is being tested by Maharashtra police,“ he said.
 
 Owaisi also demanded to know why police were not issuing notices to chief minister Devender Fadnavis,   leader Udhav Thackery , NCP leaders   and Ajit Pawar.
