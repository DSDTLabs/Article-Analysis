NOIDA: A 13-year-old   survivor, who was taken for   to three hospitals in a day, was refused entry at all the hospitals on one reason or the other before finally being examined at the second place where she was taken a day later.

 The girl was first turned away from   community health centre (CHC) on the pretext that there was no qualified (MBBS) doctor on duty. They asked her to be taken to Bhangel CHC. 
 
 Doctors at Bhangel CHC referred the rape survivor to the district hospital,   Sector 30, apparently for lack of DNA kits. 
 
 At the district hospital, the girl’s family members said she was told by the lady doctor on duty to go back to the Jewar CHC because the crime took place in Jewar.
 
 According to the police, the minor was sent to the district hospital for an examination along with a police team led by sub inspector Kuldeep Yadav and some of her family members. Eventually, she was examined at the Bhangel CHC around 4.30pm. 
 
 The doctor on duty at the district hospital on Friday, who did not wish to be named, denied the charge that she had sent back the girl on the pretext of hospital jurisdiction. “We couldn’t conduct the test because of lack of DNA kits. Moreover, there are many centres in Greater Noida too. There is Kasna Medical College too, why couldn’t the medical examinations be conducted there,” she asked.
 
 When contacted, CMO Dr Anurag Bhargav said an inquiry would be held in the matter by additional CMO Dr Shashi.
