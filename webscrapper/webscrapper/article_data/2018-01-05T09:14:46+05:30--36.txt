LUCKOW:   holds greater credence compared to a   unless the school certificate is based on the age mentioned in hospital or  , ruled the   on Thursday.

 The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court held that medical evidence to prove age could not be discarded if the date of birth mentioned in the school register or certificate did not match with it. In the   regarding date of birth in school certificate, credence has to be given to medical certificate and not to the school one, it said.
 
 Based on the ruling, a division bench of Justice Ajai Lamba and Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh quashed an FIR lodged by the brother of a girl against her alleged husband and in-laws. In the FIR lodged in Tikunia police station of Lakhimpur in July, the brother had alleged that the accused had kidnapped his sister, a minor as per the school transfer certificate.
 
 Challenging the FIR, the husband had pleaded that he and his parents had not kidnapped the girl as she had willingly married him. The husband also produced medical evidence to state that the woman 20 years old.
 
 Opposing the plea, the state lawyer said that as the school transfer certificate showed the girl was a minor, the FIR could not be set aside.
 
 Considering the statement of the girl that she had left the house on her own will and no one had kidnapped her, the court quashed the FIR.
 
 The court held that medical proof of age could not be negated on the basis of school certificate unless the school certificate was based on the age mentioned in hospital or municipality documents.
