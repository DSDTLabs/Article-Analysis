There is one startling statistic that illustrates the existential crisis facing the BSP in Uttar Pradesh - there is not one seat in the entire state where the party won in 2012, led in 2014 and won again in 2017. Considering the party won 80 seats in the last assembly polls when it was on a downhill slope, you would expect most of the 19 it won this time would overlap with that list, but there are just three seats from the northern part of Poorvanchal that it managed to retain. 

 There is just one seat where the BSP won in the last assembly polls and led in 2014 and another where it led in the Lok Sabha polls and won this time. Both of these are in Sitapur district.
 
 The story of the Congress is not very different. Barring Rampur Khas in Pratapgarh district, there is no seat it won or led in all three polls. There is just one other seat that it won last time that it has now retained - Tamkuhi Raj in Kushinagar district.
