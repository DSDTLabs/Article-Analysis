NAGPUR: In a major boost for on-campus research, the   has signed a   (MoU) with   for joint research projects and special funding.

 The initiative is likely to bolster NU’s image since it has often been critiziced for lack of authentic research work despite awarding a large number of PhDs.   (BCUD) director   told TOI he had a meeting with a delegation from the UK university on Thursday. The visitors expressed their desire to conduct research on environmental issues. 
 
 “Around Rs10 lakh would be allocated by Nagpur University for joint research works. Same amount would be kept aside by the University of Portsmouth. The chief investigator would be from Nagpur University while co-researcher would come from Portsmouth for projects. Similarly, our researchers would be co-investigators in their projects,” Agrawal said.
 
 He added the research projects could be of one or two years’ duration. Agrawal said as of now only an MoU had been signed while another agreement would be signed after video conference between VCs and other top university officials of the two universities. “The delegation would be apprising their university of the agreement. Particular subject or topic would be discussed and a final agreement would be signed,” he said.
 
 NU has already tied up with Portsmouth for student and faculty exchange in December. According to MoU, NU students can apply for completing a semester (probably the last) from Portsmouth and will have to follow its curriculum as well as grading pattern. In faculty exchange, two professors or associate professors with extensive research work will be sent by the university for three or more weeks. NU will host students and teachers from Portsmouth in a similar manner.
