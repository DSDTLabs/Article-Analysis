PATNA: Women legislators on Thursday took up the   with a woman MLC of the LJP in the legislative council and demanded a probe by the House   

 According to reports, BJP MLC   had on Wednesday afternoon allegedly caught the woman MLC’s hand. Her husband, who himself is an MLA, was reported to have later turned violent against Prasad.
 
 The matter was on Thursday raised in the House by JD (U) MLC Reena Yadav, who told the chairperson that never before such an incident had happened in the council.
 
 Former CM   supported Reena and criticised both the BJP as well as the LJP for allegedly making a bid to hush up the matter. “If he can misbehave with a woman in the council, imagine what he will do outside. What kind of a party the BJP is?” asked Rabri.
 
 Male legislators of the ruling grand alliance also joined issue and demanded strict action against Lal Babu. 
 
 Council chairman Awadhesh Narain Singh told the members it was unfortunate if any incident of misbehaviour with a woman had taken place. He assured the members that he would not tolerate any black spot on the House in his tenure.
 
 Singh later told newsmen he would call both the parties involved in the matter as well as other women legislators and discuss the issue. Asked if he had received a written complaint, he said the woman’s MLA husband told him he would complain to me in writing but had not so far.
 
 Talking to TOI later, education minister   regretted while PM Narendra Modi did tall talks of “beti bachao”, his BJP was trying to cover up this crime against a woman.
 
 However, leader of opposition in the council Sushil Kumar Modi denied such an incident. “I called both the so-called accused and his victim... They denied the reports,” he said.
 
 JD (U) spokesman Sanjay Singh, however asked why was the culprit then beaten in the lobby of the council.
