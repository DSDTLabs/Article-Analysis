CHANDIGARH: The police on Sunday arrested a   resident for snatching a mobile phone of his former girlfriend in   and making a hoax bomb call in order to harass her, an action that triggered panic in the market on Saturday evening.

 A team of police rushed to the Plaza but did not find anything anything suspicious. When police officials called back on the number, the woman replied that she had not made any call. She told cops that she had got married a couple of days back. She had gone to Sector 17 market to purchase some goods on Saturday and found her friend Satnam Singh, a daily wager. “He forcefully took my phone and dialled “100” to harass her as he was upset after my marriage with someone else,” the woman said.
 
 The police registered a case under sections 505 (statements conducing to public mischief), 507 (criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication), 182 (false information, with intent to cause public servant to use his lawful power to the injury of another person) and 177 (furnishing false information) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the Sector 3 police station.
 
 Assistant sub-inspector  , the investigating officer, said, “The accused made a   from his woman friend’s phone and was arrested.”
