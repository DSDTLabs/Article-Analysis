NOIDA: An 11-year-old boy suffered severe injuries to his legs after he was attacked by a pet dog that was unleashed on him by its 80-year-old owner to prevent him from picking up mangoes from a garden outside her upscale bungalow in Sector 36 on Monday. 

 The boy has been admitted to the district hospital. On Tuesday, Arun Kumar’s father lodged a complaint at Sector 39 police station against the elderly woman owner of the dog. Police are, however, yet to lodge an FIR. The dog’s breed is not known.
 
 According to Arun, who lives with his family in a rented accommodation in Sector 31, the incident took place on Monday morning when he was taking a stroll in Sector 36 along with three of his friends.
 
 “We reached near a house and found a mango tree outside. We spotted some mangoes on the ground. We started picking up the mangoes when an elderly woman came to the door with her dogs. The woman unleashed one of the dogs on us,” Arun said.
 
 While his three friends managed to flee, Kumar was left behind and bitten by the dog on his right leg.
 
 Man Singh, a local security guard, said he was the one who had found the boy lying in a pool of blood. “We rushed him to the district hospital for treatment as soon as we saw him soaked in blood,” he said.
 
 Police said they have received a complaint in this regard. “The dog owner is an elderly woman, Mrs Rishi, aged 80. She lives alone in the house. We are investigating the matter from all angles,” said an officer of Sector 39 police station.
 
 When approached by reporters on Tuesday morning, the woman refused to comment on the alleged dog attack. “I am unwell and I do not know anything about the attack,” she said.
