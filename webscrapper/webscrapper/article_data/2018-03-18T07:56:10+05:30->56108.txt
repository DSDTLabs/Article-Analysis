CHENNAI: In a bid to drive digital adoption in the manufacturing sector, industry body   ( ) has embarked on a three year initiative called Manufacturing & Digital Excellence Initiative (MADE). 

 Addressing the media, B Santhanam, president and MD, Saint-Gobain India Pvt Ltd who will chair the committee said, "There is no better time for Indian manufacturing companies to get digital. Manufacturing is able to mirror IT services to the extent that we are able to do it frugally as compared to the West. Adoption of digital is critical for us to drive efficiency within manufacturing." The first phase of MADE will involve assessing the industry readiness on digitalisation.
 
  "A detailed assessment is being made through online and offline channels. We are covering small and large companies within the 50-2000 crore turnover range," said Santhanam. The results of the survey will be released on March 23 at an event in Bengaluru. Close to 30 digitalisation partners are working with CII in this endeavour including GE, Bosch, Siemens, TCS, Cognizant and  . 
 
 "We are looking to bust some myths on digital and the fears associated with it. For one, I don't think digital and automation will lead to wide scale loss of jobs. In fact, digital for the entry level workforce will be liberating and enhancing. Digital need not be investment high and small companies can start taking baby steps," he said.
