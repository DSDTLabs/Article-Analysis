Margao: South Goa MP Narendra Sawaikar has, in a letter addressed to the Union minister for environment, forests and climate change Harsh Vardhan, made a strong case for development of   waterfall and removal of restrictions on the number of vehicles ferrying tourists to the scenic spot. 

 Sawaikar said livelihood of more than two-thirds of the households in Collem panchayat area are dependent for their livelihoods on the tourism activity centred around Dudhsagar falls. 
 
 Sawaikar said restricting the number of vehicles to 225 per day meant the owner could make only 13 trips per month, thereby making it a loss-making business activity. 
 
 He also drew Vardhanâ€™s attention to the inadequate facilities for visitors to the Dudhsagar falls.
