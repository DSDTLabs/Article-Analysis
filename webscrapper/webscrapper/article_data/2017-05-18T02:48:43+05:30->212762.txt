 The principal, Babli Moitra Saraf, said the centre will primarily focus on archiving old and lost audio, as well as ongoing current events that have been recorded. “The listening room will not be restricted to music alone, but several books that have been written in their original language will be available in the form of archives, interviews and conversations about dying dialects, the college community-radio programme and other forms of art will be available to students in this room,” said Saraf.
