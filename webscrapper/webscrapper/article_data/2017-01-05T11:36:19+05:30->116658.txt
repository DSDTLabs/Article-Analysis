BENGALURU: The   added a new innovation to its cricket infrastructure at the M Chinnaswamy stadium with the installation of the SubAir subsurface aeration and vacuum-powered drainage system. The 4.25-crore project will make Chinnaswamy the first cricket venue in the world to have a state-of-the-art drainage solution. 

 The technology will help prevent waterlogging in the outfield during rain and faster resumption of the match as the system is capable of draining water 36 times faster than normal standards. "It is a matter of pride that KSCA is showing the world how to make use of technology in cricket infrastructure, "said  , MD of Great Sports Infra, the marketing arm of the SubAir, USA.
 
 "The   automatically kicks into action the minute it starts raining, thereby not allowing any build up of water on the outfield. Water begins to get sucked out at the rate of over 10,000 litres a minute from the moment it begins to rain. The suction system gets activated through signals from the remote sensors embedded in the field," Anil said.
 
 The other advantage of the technology is that the system can pump in oxygen for aeration of the roots and ensure that the grass stays healthy. It also helps in maintaining a better playing field by preventing turf diseases, algae, excessive thatch and black layer. Additionally, there is an inbuilt sprinkler system for watering. 
 
 
  
 
 Another positive is that the technology will help in optimising the use of water needed for the turf. The maintenance of the drainage system will cost KSCA Rs 7 lakh annually. "This technology makes tremendous economic and financial sense and many games will be saved in the future," KSCA spokesperson   said.
 
 KSCA vice-president Sanjay Desai said: "Fan experience is our primary objective. There is a risk of losing Rs 80-100 crore when a game gets washed out. We believe we have addressed this challenge." 
 
 Among the prominent sports venues to have installed the SubAir technology are Wembley (UK), New York Mets,  , BMO Field (Canada),   (Manchester City). The system was used for 2014 FIFA WorldCup in Brazil and would also be used in the 2018 FIFAWorld Cup in Russia. 
 
 
 
 * The system measures the moisture in the air, salinity in the soil and grassroots temperature and pump in cool air or water as required
 
 * Pumps in oxygen for aeration of the roots through the system to ensure the grass stays healthy. 
 
 * The 200 Horse Power pump can suck rainwater out of the outfield at 36 times the speed of gravity.
 
 * The excess water from the outfield can be pushed into the nearby tank and reused for irrigation.
 
 * The technology includes a network of perforated tubes, pipes and drains, which are laid below the surface of the outfield in a closed loop structure and connected to the SubAir System.
 
 * Globally, the system has been installed at several golf, football, baseball and rugby grounds.
