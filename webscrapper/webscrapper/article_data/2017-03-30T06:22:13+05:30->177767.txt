AHMEDABAD: Havmor Ice Cream Limited is planning to set up a new manufacturing plant in  , with the aim of establishing a pan-India presence. The Ahmedabad-based ice-cream maker intends to invest Rs 200 crore in the expansion.

 Venturing out of Gujarat for the first time, Havmor recently commissioned its new ice-cream unit at Faridabad in the   (NCR). 
 
 “Havmor is working on a greenfield project to develop a new manufacturing facility in South India over the next three years. The plant will help the company cater to the South Indian markets,” said  , managing director, Havmor Ice Cream.
 
 Havmor is looking at the southernmost parts of Maharashtra or Telangana as potential locations for the new plant. “We are the second largest player after Amul when it comes to the real milk-based ice-cream market. We hope to close 2016-17 with a turnover of more than Rs 550 crore and aim to achieve a turnover of Rs 1,000 crore by 2020,” Chona said. 
 
 He, however, expected margins to remain under pressure due to an increase in prices of raw materials such as skimmed milk powder (SMP), butter, dry fruits and sugar.
