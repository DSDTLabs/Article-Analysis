LUCKNOW: As much as it hurt, demonetisation was implemented with a good intention and Modi had at least the courage to fight corruption by taking such a bold step, said Yancey Momin (30), research scholar of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University. 

 Sipping coffee, her friend Tanuja Singh said, “Modi and Akhilesh's work is visible and I feel Mayawati is the exception, as besides Dalits, there is hardly anyone who wants her to come to power. "Momin and Singh weren't debating in a college competition but only discussing at a home-run cafe at Mall Avenue. Who will win the 'talent hunt' (read elections) in the country's biggest state was being debated at many tables. 
 
 TOI spotted a group of youngsters pursuing master's degree or recently employed engaged in an animated discussion. “Akhilesh has at least fufilled his promises and is talking about jobs and entrepreneurship, unlike the government before his. What good came out of  's demonetisation which only led to misery," said Anas Irtiza (23), postgraduate in advertising and marketing. Even before he could finish, Zeeshan Khatib (24) interrupted, “Law and order situation is pathetic. Akhilesh is a promising leader but Mayawati may just turn out to be people's choice considering her ability to maintain law and order."
 
 Hailing from Aurangabad in Maharashtra, Khatib was in Lucknow to attend a friend's wedding and met his old college mates. “As a contender, Akhilesh is projecting himself like Modi did when he was the Gujarat chief minister. Just as Modi branded himself with his claims of development and prosperity in Gujarat, Akhilesh is doing in UP," observed Khatib.
 
 Businessman Karan Kumar, who had come from Delhi, talked about the possibility of a hung assembly. “Can Akhilesh assure public of safety and security? Be it Metro or the expressway, all his work is incomplete. Congress has allied with SP to save its honour," he said.
