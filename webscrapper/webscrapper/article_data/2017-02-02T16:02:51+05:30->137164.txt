Director   and tennis player   are all set to leave you in splits as they rule over the couch on   this week. Known for bringing the closest and most well-known Bollywood friendships together, the newest episode will see the two ladies taking over the show like never before, leaving KJo totally stumped. 

 
  
 While sports and Bollywood have long seen a connection, with Indian sportsmen often seen in the company of stars from the film fraternity, Farah and Sania’s friendship makes Karan rather jealous as he is not a part of this closely bonded relationship. This prompts Farah to state that Karan is suffering from ‘FOMO’ or the ‘Fear Of Missing Out’!, which is hilariously mistaken by Karan as Homo. 
  
 On the show, Farah is her usual candid self, ribbing Karan continuously. When Karan asks Sania how does it feel to be making her Koffee debut, Farah warns her to be prepared to hide for the next three months (given the controversies the show creates).
 
 
 
 
  
 While Sania admits to her love for Bollywood unabashedly, Farah jokes whether Karan ‘ko base pasand hai’. Karan's reaction to the question gives it all away. The fun doesn’t stop there as Karan tells Farah that he knows she is a “cheap adulteress”.
  
 It may be Sania’s debut on Koffee with Karan, but she faces Karan’s questions with grace, ease and much amusement. She also joins Farah in pulling Karan’s leg as she questions his definition of sports in the Rapid Fire Round.
  
 Watch all the fun, banter and conversations only on Koffee with Karan Season 5 this Sunday at 9 PM on   and Star World HD.
