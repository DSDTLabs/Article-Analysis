AMRITSAR: Poor supply of leukocyte filters and chelating medicines at the government hospital in Amritsar has not only added to the woes of   patients but has also put extra burden on the Thalassemia Welfare Society. It has been forced to generate its own resources for providing these to the patients. 

 There are as many as 140 thalassemia patients registered with the state-run Guru   ( ).
 
 Dr   of the paediatric department of the GNDH told TOI on Thursday that they didn't have adequate supplies of leukocyte filters or the chelating medicines due to which patients had to procure these from the market. 
 
 He said the leuckocyte filters prevent adverse transfusion reactions.
 
 He said a thalassemia patient's body forms little haemoglobin, which is needed to carry oxygen to various parts of the body. "These patients - majority of them young children - require regular blood transfusion, which in turn causes build-up of iron in the body. 
 
 "Chelating drugs are then required to remove excess iron from the body," said Dr Singh.
