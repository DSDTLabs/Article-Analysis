AHMEDABAD: Citizens on Thursday lighted bonfires at many city crossroads and prayed for the good year as part of   festivities. 

 “The festival is associated with the legend of   and his aunt   and is seen as triumph of belief and truth. Traditionally, the citizens perform pradakshina (going around the bonfire ritually) and offer popped jowar (sorghum) with dates to the fire. The festival marks end of winter and beginning of summer. In some parts of the state, there is tradition of predicting the year on the basis of direction of the flames,” said Shaunak Shastri, a resident of Naranpura.
 
 Major temples in the city including   in Jamalpur, Samartheshwar Mahadev near Law Garden and Sola Bhagwat Vidyapeeth organized the bonfire on Thursday evening. At Vidyapeeth, the devotees had made the bonfire entirely of dried cow-dung cakes. A number of city schools and colleges hosted the Holi parties on Thursday ahead of the long weekend as friends and colleagues coloured each other in rainbow of colours. With the water crisis looming large on the state, a number of societies and localities have decided not to waste water for the Holi festivities and instead play with dry colours.
 
 Pushpa Panchal, a resident of Dhal ni Pol, said, “Women of our pol have been spreading awareness about keeping Holi a dry affair instead of wasting water. We have also asked our children to enjoy the festival with dry colours and flowers.” “Holi is a festival one looks forward for the entire year as we gather in large groups at one of the friends’ farmhouses and enjoy festival of colours. However, this time, we will celebrate with gulaal and ensure that the water is used minimally,” said Parin Shah, a resident of Vastrapur.
