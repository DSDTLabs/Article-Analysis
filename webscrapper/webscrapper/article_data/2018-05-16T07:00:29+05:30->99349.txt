KOLKATA: Old schools in the city were given a close run by their new age counterparts in this year’s ICSE exams. While the La Martiniere for Boys and Calcutta Boys’ School held on to their share of toppers and high scorers, The   and DPS Megacity were not too far behind.

 If Calcutta Boys’ had 51students scoring more than 90%, Heritage had as many as 91students in the same bracket. Senior teachers felt that the gap between the two has narrowed down considerably in terms of results which was an encouraging sign for the city.
 
 
  
 “The   are abiding by the instructions much like the traditional, reputable and well-established ones. They have become much more disciplined. This is reflecting in their results. The teachers being recruited by them are experienced and qualified. Till now, most teachers preferred to join the established schools only. Now, even the new ones are attracting good faculty,” said   principal Sujoy Biswas.
 
 Another senior teacher added, “Even students earlier would prefer to travel far to attend reputed schools. Now, many parents prefer the local schools which have made a name for themselves.”
