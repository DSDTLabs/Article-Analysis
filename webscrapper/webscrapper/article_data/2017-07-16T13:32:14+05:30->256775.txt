SALEM: A 25-year-old woman staged a protest in front of her husband’s house in Attur here on Saturday, as his parents didn’t allow her to meet him.

 According to V Manjula, 25, of Manamadurai in Sivaganga district, she befriended Venkateshwaran, 28, of   near Attur, on Facebook in 2012 and they fell in love.
 
 They got married this June against the wishes of Venkateshwaran’s parents. Since Manjula was a dalit,   didn’t accept her as their daughter-in-law. “After the marriage, we lived in my father’s house,” Manjula said.
 
 Venkateshwaran decided to register the marriage with the registrar’s office in Manamadurai and left for his house on July 7 to take his educational certificates. 
 
 When he did not return, Manjula attempted to reach him over mobile phone, but in vain.
 
 On Saturday, Manjula visited her husband’s house. “But, his parents didn’t allow me to meet him. They told me that he had gone out,” she said.
 
 Manjula said that she would approach the Attur police if Venkateshwaran’s parents refused to send him with her.
