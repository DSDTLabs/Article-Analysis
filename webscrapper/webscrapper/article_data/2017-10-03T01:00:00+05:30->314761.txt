Experience and freshness have found a perfect mix in ‘Call For Fun’, which features a promising bunch of debutantes and boasts of a technical team that includes National Award winners. 

 The youth-centric comedy, directed by Janak Toprani, who is also producing it along with Hardik Patel, has garnered support from within the industry. Appreciation is especially pouring in for the filmmaker, who comes from a theatre background. Here’s what some B-Town celebs had to say about the film: 
 
 Sharman Joshi: I have known Janak ever since I joined theatre many years ago. He has an eye for detail and every production of his has earned a top spot in theatre. ‘Call For Fun’ will leave a mark in films, too.
 
 Anand Mahindra: I’ve known Janak from his previous avatar as an accountant at our company. He left to pursue his passion for theatre. Despite being a complete outsider, he has made an indelible mark for himself over the years. I have no doubt that his foray into films will be just as successful and I wish him all the very best! 
 Ram Madhvani: I was a part of Janak’s theatre group many years ago. He is a gem, I wish him success. 
 
 Ronnie Screwvala: Having known Janak from our theatre days, I’m sure that his talent and creative skills will reflect in filmmaking as well.
 
 Harry Baweja: Janak is extremely talented. He has all that it takes to deliver a fun-filled film.
 
 Parmeet Sethi: This is a film that every teen in the country needs to watch. Full marks for Janak’s direction, vision and putting the entire project together in less than six months.
 
 Bharat Dabholkar: Kudos to Janak for putting together a project without any major industry player backing it and taking a huge risk by launching nine newcomers. I wish him great success and many more such films in the future.
 
 ‘Call For Fun’, produced by Filmquest Entertainment, releases on October 6.
