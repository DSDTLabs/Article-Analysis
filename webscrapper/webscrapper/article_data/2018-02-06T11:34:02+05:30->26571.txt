PATNA: The   (BSEB) is all set to conduct the Intermediate examinations at 1,384 centres across the state from Tuesday. Around 12.07 lakh students, including 4.88 lakh girls, will take the exams this year.

 The Class XII exams will begin with biology (ISc) and entrepreneurship (ICom) in the first sitting (9.45am-1pm) and philosophy (IA) and R B Hindi (vocational course) in the second sitting (1.45pm-5pm).
 
 According to BSEB chairman  , all the district magistrates and SPs have been asked to deploy ample police force at each centre. “Frisking will be done twice — first at the gate and later in their respective classes by male and female teachers. There will be CCTV cameras and videographers to record the exams,” he said and added, “Centre superintendents will fill up declaration letters, informing the board that the exams were conducted peacefully. If anomalies are found later, strict action will be taken against them.”
 
 Kishor also asked teachers not to bother students if there is a mistake in their admit cards. He said, “In case, a candidate misplaces his admit card, he can write the   after taking provisional permission. His verification will be done through scanned photos on attendance sheet and roll sheet.”
 
 The   has set up a 24X7 control room where students can register complaints regarding anomalies in question papers, seating arrangements or timetable till February 16. They can write a mail to coe.interbseb@gmail.com or send a fax on 0612-2230599, 2227587 and 2233423. They can also dial 0612-2227587, 2227588, 2229840 and 2232249 for help.
 
 Electronic devices like bluetooth, calculator or cellphone are not allowed at the centres. “Students have to use OMR sheets for objective questions. Answer-sheets in which whitener is used will be rejected,” Kishor said, adding students should reach the centre half an hour before the commencement of the exam.
