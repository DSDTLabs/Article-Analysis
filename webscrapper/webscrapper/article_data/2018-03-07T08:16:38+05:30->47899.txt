MANGALURU: Uttar Pradesh CM  , continuing from where PM   had left off in the  's attack on the   government in  , charged it with being mired in corruption and compromising the security of its people.

 Yogi Adityanath claimed time has come for a "Congress-free government" in Karnataka. He said if the northeastern states can be Congress- and Communist-free, there is no reason why Karnataka cannot be the same. 
 
 Addressing a ceremony to mark the culmination of four-day Mangaluru Chalo Jana Suraksha yatra organised by BJP's state unit, the UP chief minister said a new "political feeling" is blowing through the state, especially after the declaration of results in the three north-east states.
 
 Claiming that Congress has become a problem unto itself and the state, Yogi, who air-dashed to the city despite an ongoing session of the UP assembly, said development is important for any society. "A sense of security with development creates a favourable atmosphere in any state and it is missing in Karnataka," Yogi said.
 
 Noting that anti-social elements are behind the murder of Hindu activists in Karnataka, the Yogi alleged that they have the active patronage of the state government without which they would not have been so emboldened to carry out their attacks.
 
 The withdrawal of cases against PFI and SDPI cadre en masse has clearly indicated the inclination of the Congress government in the state, which has become an ATM for its party high command, the UP chief minister added.
