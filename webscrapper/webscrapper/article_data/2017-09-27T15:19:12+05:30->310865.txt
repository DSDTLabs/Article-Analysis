It seems like   does not believe in drawing 'Bad Blood' afterall.

  A day after Taylor Swift's 'Look What You Made Me Do' was knocked down to number three on the   by   B, the 'Bad Blood' singer congratulated her in the most adorable way possible.
 
  
  
  Rapper Cardi B shared on Instagram that Taylor sent her flowers congratulating her on her success.
 
  The 'Bodak Yellow' hit-maker wrote, "Sooo beautiful and lovely .Thank you @taylorswift for the flowers ??....and I freaking love your  ."
  
  
  Cardi B's 'Bodak Yellow' is the second song by an unaccompanied female rapper to ever top the chart, joining Lauryn Hill's 1998 track, 'Doo Wop'.
 
  She is also the first female rapper of color to appear on a No. 1 hit since Lil' Kim collaborated with Pink, Mya, and Christina Aguilera for 2001's 'Lady Marmalade'.
