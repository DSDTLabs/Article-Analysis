 and his wife   recently hosted a party for their close friends. Ashu, Jyoti,   and Sakshi made an early entry at the do. "Rahul and Pamelaâ€™s parties are always rocking and have so many things to keep you entertained," said Ashu.
Being a disc party, nobody wanted to wait and soon the guests got on to the dance floor to dance on latest   numbers being played by DJ Romi. A vintage scooter placed at the venue caught the attention of Jaspreet and Nimrat and they both posed for selfies with it as a prop. We also spotted Rohini, Rahul, Sanjay, Manisha, Priya and Gaurav having a good time in each other's company.
