  : The state government on Tuesday set up a   (CAC) to   cybercrime. 

 The CAC was set up in the cybercrime wing of Meghalaya Police's CID, officials said.
 
 "The CAC will provide assistance to police to stop harassment or criminal activities through mobile phones or internet," state criminal record bureau SP D Jyrwa said in a statement issued here.
 
 "Online pornography, stalking, abuse through internet, defamation on social networking sites or emails will be dealt with by the CAC and victims will be assisted, if necessary, to register a formal complaint at the nearest police station," he added.
 
 Last year, the state government had notified the installation of a cybercrime police station (CCPS) to specifically deal with cyber criminals and online fraud.
 
 The CCPS has statewide jurisdiction and can investigate cybercrime in which digital devices such as mobile phones and computers are used to commit an offence.
 
 At least 24 police personnel have been trained to deal with cybercrime cases and regular training sessions have been conducted to cope with the ever-changing cyber world, officials added.
