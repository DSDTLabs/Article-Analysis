Tirunelveli: Dravida Kazhagam founder K   on Thursday strongly condemned those hurling verbal abuses and threats at noted poet and lyricist Vairamuthu in public and through social media for his alleged derogatory remarks on Hindu deity Andal. He told reporters here that those engaged in such actions should put an end to it.

 He alleged that hindutva forces were trying to use intimidation as a tool to dominate people here as they had been doing in North India. “Those unable to ideologically defend themselves are engaged in verbal abuses and threats but these will not work here (Tamil Nadu),” he added. 
 
 The state government should initiate stringent action against such threats as these would vitiate the law and order situation and cause its downfall, he said. He added that they would take the matter to a court of law and to the people’s court. Veeramani said that the poet had given an open statement expressing regret for his statement and also explained that it had been misunderstood by many who were condemning him. 
 
 On DK and Dravidian organisations targeting Hinduism, he said, “We bandage only the wounds and plaster the fractured portion and teach those who don’t know how to do it,” he said. Veeramani also came down heavily on the Centre for withdrawing Haj subsidy for Muslims. 
 
 This year DK would campaign for enforcing a law enacted by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam government in 2007 for appointing people from other castes as temple priests. Though 206 people from various communities underwent training to become temple priests, the AIADMK government had been delaying their appointment, he said. 
 
 Meanwhile, Tirunelveli city police arrested three Hindu Makkal Katchi cadre including district president S Udaiyar who garlanded a portrait of Vairamuthu with footwear. They also marched towards the collectorate to petition the district administration and the police to arrest the poet.
