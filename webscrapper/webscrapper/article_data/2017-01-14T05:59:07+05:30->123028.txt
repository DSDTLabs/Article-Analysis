CHANDIGARH: Punjab Congress president Captain   has asked the   to transfer state chief secretary  , charging him with trying to “influence voting in favour of the ruling SAD-BJP combine by pressuring officers responsible for the conduct of elections in Punjab“.

 In a written complaint to chief election commissioner Dr Nasim Zaidi, Amarinder said the chief secretary was sending unwritten missives to district collectors to work for the candidates of the ruling alliance.
 
 Urging the EC to replace Kaushal with some other officer in the larger public interest, Amarinder said this would help build the morale of the common man and save them from the apprehended “political-bureaucratic nexus“.
 
 Amarinder reminded the EC of his earlier communications to the poll body on the need to depute neutral, competent officers to conduct elections in Punjab. The letter to EC reads: “Kaushal is sending unwritten missives to district collectors to work for candidates of the present ruling political dispensation... It is gathered that the chief secretary is pressurizing officers responsible for the conduct of elections to do everything desired by the ruling SAD-BJP combination to influence voting in their favour.“
