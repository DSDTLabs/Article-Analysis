NEW DELHI: The man who headed Delhi's police force himself became a victim of a brazen theft on Saturday. Thieves allegedly got into  's car and stole an iPad, cash and some other valuables near Majnu ka Tila. 

  DCP (north) Jatin Narwhal said the thieves struck when the former commissioner had stopped briefly while on his way to Chandigarh. Gupta had asked his driver to park the car by the roadside and was transferring some luggage to another vehicle. 
 
 In the complaint, the driver said Gupta had stepped out of the vehicle for a few minutes and returned to find the items missing. The driver claimed he had locked the car and stepped out but cops later found the rear door unlocked.
 
 Cops suspect that the thieves may have removed the items while the driver's attention was diverted. There were no CCTV cameras at the spot but cops are scanning footage from nearby areas for clues.
 
  Gupta, a resident of Greater Kailash, was on his way to Chandigarh with friends for a golf tournament. 
 
 On Friday, thieves had similarly fled with a doctor's belongings in Civil Lines, north Delhi, after diverting the attention of his driver. The theft took place as the driver was changing a flat tyre.
