 In addition to levelling the dumping ground and layering the waste, with soil, fertilizer and gravel, the department has separated each of the bio-diversity arenas into different zones for a holistic learning experience for environmental enthusiasts visiting it in the near future.
 
 “There are separate gardens for butterflies, roses,   that connect to religious beliefs and even those that have historical significance. Walking through each of the five phases will give the student a different experience,” said M Magdum, the social forestry officer handling the plantation. 
 
 The park also hosts a unique and functional Phytorid project, set up by  , which sucks up the drainage water from the nallahs that flow between the five phases and purifies it. This water is then used to water the plants in the park making it a self-sustainable.
 
 This date of the inauguration of the park will be decided as per the availability of the forest minister S. Mungantiwar who is expected to inaugurate it.
 
 The remaining part of the plantation of the fifth phases will be carried out after the inauguration and as part of the state tree plantation drive this year.
