Mapusa:   villagers unanimously resolved to support all the activities of the Mhadei Bachao Abhiyan. At the gram sabha held on Sunday, a resolution was also passed against the proposed hike in the electricity tariffs by the electricity department.

 The meeting was presided over by sarpanch Jallinder Gaonkar in presence of deputy sarpanch and other panch members, along with panchayat secretary Rajesh Asolkar. The Mhadei issue was raised by Rajan Ghate who proposed to support the Mhadei Bachao Abhiyan. The sarpanch extended his support and said, “Irrespective of affiliations to any political party, we should, all together support the Mhadei Bachao Abhiyan, and protest against the diversion of water by the Karnataka goverenment”. A resolution was unanimously passed by the gram sabha.
 
 Another resolution was moved by Owen Braganza and Olga D’Souza against the proposed hike in electricity tariff. They were of the view that there is pilferage and theft of power, and the electricity department has failed to control it or the losses. 
 
 They said that instead of stopping the pilferage and preventing losses, the government is burdening the common man with a hike in tariff to make up for a deficit of Rs79 crore. 
 
 A resolution was passed by the gram sabha, with a decision to write to the Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission.
 
 The issue of imposition of garbage tax was deferred for the next meeting since there was no conclusion, despite discussions. The pending work of the football ground was also raised.
