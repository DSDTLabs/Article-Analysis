 MUMBAI: Local residents and motorists heaved a sigh of relief as Cidco’s anti encroachment squad, with adequate police protection cleared encroachment on a 700 sq mprime plot in sector 8A of   on Friday. 

 An illegal vegetable market was located here for years, creating hurdles for the locals. Over a hundred vegetable vendors, who had grabbed the area after breaking the wire fencing boundary, were removed from the plot. Besides, over a dozen illegal four-wheeler garages that came up on CRZ area in sectors 8 and 9 here were also razed amidst mild protests. 
 
 Motorists have been complaining about the traffic chaos on this internal road which connects Mulund-Airoli link road with Thane-Belapur Road as an alternative short cut during traffic snarls at rush hours on the   link. 
 
 “In the recent past we have lodged complaints to the civic body pertaining to unhygienic state of the area which was being used for urinating by the vendors and general public. Leftover vegetables were being dumped here. The authorities had remained mute spectators,” said resident  . Local residents were upset over the Saturday’s weekly open market here. 
 
 “On Saturdays we would jostle to walk on the footpath due to the encroachment by illegal hawkers.   should convert it into a public amenity to prevent further encroachment,” said another resident  . During the demolition of garages, a garage owner fell unconscious and was rushed to the hospital by his kin and the cops and is said to be stable. “We conducted the surprise demolition drive fearing backlash but it turned out to be successful. We have cleared the market plot which has a parking provision too. We will urge out engineering department to construct boundary wall soon,” said PB Rajput, controller of unauthorized construction, Cidco, Navi Mumbai North.
