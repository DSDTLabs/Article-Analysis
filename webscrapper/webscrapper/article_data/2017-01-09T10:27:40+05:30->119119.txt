Vasco: BJP workers of Mormugao taluka on Sunday said they will write a memorandum to the BJP chief in the state as well as Centre to rethink about their candidate in Mormugao constituency.

 BJP senior worker   said, “if BJP gives the ticket to ex-power minister Milind Naik, we shall not vote and support our party this time”.
 
 A huge gathering turned out at the MPT officers’ club at Sada on Sunday evening, to vent their anger against their ex-MLA Naik. Kochrekar said, “I was the one who went to Parrikar 10 years ago, literally pleading him to give a ticket to a boy coming from a very humble background. Today, as his status has risen to a state cabinet minister, he fails to recognize me.”
 
 Another BJP worker,   said, “He literally threatens me and my family, saying he will teach us a lesson. This has been the experience of many voters in our constituency. He is a goon and not a leader. He wants people to be at his mercy and live according to his ways.”
 
 Councillor, Mormugao municipal council, Nilesh Navelkar, said “He has been a MLA for 10 years and has failed on all fronts, whether setting up a garbage treatment plant to coal pollution. He has done nothing for the welfare of people, but just filled his pockets. He has no guts to look into our eyes.”
 
 Western India Shipyard Limited workers’ leader Alex Pacheco, who had undertaken a 42-day hunger strike, said “Naik was a childhood friend and I have worked day and night for his win, but, when I was on strike, his official car moved up and down. Not a single day, did he step out to see me. On the contrary, other leaders like   from Delhi came to listen to our grievances”.
 
 Secretary, all Goa Banjara Samaj, Tourappa Lamani alleged that Naik had undertaken the mass demolition of slums in an “inhuman way”. Naik’s biggest supporter during the elections Suraj Chodankar alias Balan from the ‘Mexico group’ was also seen on the dais.
