Suresh Wadkar’s 10 year old daughter is all set to follow her father’s footsteps. After her debut in the music industry with the album, ‘ Sapnon ka Gaon’ in 2016, she is now going to make her debut as a playback singer. 

  Jiya has recently recorded ‘Mothya Mothya Latanwari Pohu de’, a track in an upcoming Marathi movie ‘Pari Hu Mai’. The song describes the tender relationship between a father and his daughter. 
 
  Born in a musical family, it was only a matter of time before Jiya took this step. Not only her parents, but her sister   is a sitar player and a singer. She has earlier sang in films like Aaja Nachale and Taare Zameen Par.
