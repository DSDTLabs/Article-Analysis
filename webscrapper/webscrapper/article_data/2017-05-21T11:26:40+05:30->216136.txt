Actress   hosted a luncheon in Los Angeles during which she backed the #HowAreYouReally mental-health awareness  . The 27-year-old actress, whose father   committed suicide in 2014, hosted the event last week to kick-start the campaign.

  
  
 In her speech, Zelda said, "How many times a day do you get to the counter to order your coffee or pass a coworker in the hall and hear 'How are you?', and before that can even sink in, how quickly do you usually respond with 'I'm fine. You?'. It's sweet, polite, perfunctory. An innocuous exchange that these days, is usually given as much care or actual curiosity as 'how's the weather?'" 
 
 "We often respond without thinking, whether we're fine or not, because it's expected. And stranger still, we often ask without actually being curious how the other person is at all, just waiting for some version of 'Ok, good, fine!' before moving on. Because we're busy. And because we assume."
