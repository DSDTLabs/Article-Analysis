NEW DELHI: A meeting of the joint parliamentary committee on the land acquisition bill, set up in 2015, could not be held on Tuesday as only six of the 30 members of the panel turned up, far below the required quorum. 

 Apart from committee chairman Ganesh Singh, a Lok Sabha MP from BJP, secretaries from the civil aviation and highways ministries had come for the meeting. The six members - three from BJP apart from Derek O'Brien from TMC,   (BJD) and Vir Singh (BSP)- waited for half an hour for others to join and finally left without conducting any business, it was learnt.
 
 "It seemed the ruling party is no longer interested in this bill, as most of them did not even turn up for the meeting being held after a long gap," said an opposition party leader. 
 
 Having failed to move ahead with the bill in 2015, the government sent it to a joint parliamentary committee which was then headed by BJP MP SS Ahluwalia. After Ahluwalia was made a minister, his party colleague Ganesh Singh succeeded him as chairman of the panel. Over the last few years, the committee has held very few meetings. While the committee met 14 times in two months between June and July of 2015 and held 19 meetings in 2015 itself, the frequency dropped to two meetings in 2016 and four meetings in 2017. 
 
 "They've lost the plot. Chairman (a BJP MP) of Parliament Comtee on Land Acquisition Act calls meeting. Woefully short of quorum. 6/31 MPs. Meeting called off. Even BJP members ditch. Hmmm," tweeted O'Brien after meeting didn't happen.
