CHENNAI: A group of wildlife researchers recently sighted the highly endangered grizzled giant squirrel (Ratufa macroura) in a forest near   in   district for the first time.

 The squirrel is generally found in the foothills of the Western Ghats and a couple of areas in the Eastern Ghats. There has been no previous record of the arboreal animal near Gingee, said researchers.
 
 S  , a member of the group, said he saw a pair of grizzled giant squirrels on a tamarind tree while trekking through a forest leading to the   shrine, located southwest of Gingee town. The animal had also been sighted in   forest division a few years ago, he said.
 
 He said a detailed study of the area in different seasons is required to understand the squirrel's movement. The species is threatened by poachers and is also in demand in the pet trade. A proposal to declare the area a sanctuary is being considered, said forest department officials.
