BATHINDA: A constable, working in the accounts branch in the office of Moga senior   (SSP), has been booked for drawing double salary for the past two years. By drawing double salary, the accused constable   defrauded the exchequer of Rs 7.65 lakh.

 Head constable Jaswinder Singh, who connived with the constable in the act of cheating, has been booked for cheating and criminal conspiracy.
 
 Moga SP (headquarters)   said constable Gurmeet drew double salary from August 1, 2014 to September 2, 2016, when the fraud was detected by an audit team. “In two years, he withdrew Rs. 7.65 lakh. Head constable Jaswinder, who was also posted in the section and was responsible for sending salaries to the bank accounts, is learnt to have connived with the constable in this act. Both cops played fraud and used the ID of another constable also named Gurmeet Singh, who was transferred out of office. They kept preparing his salary and used to deposit it in the account of Gurmeet Singh.”
 
 The SP said though constable Gurmeet had returned the withdrawn amount, he had committed a fraud and case under sections 420 (cheating) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC had been registered against him and Jaswinder. No arrests have been made so far in the matter.
