NOIDA: A day after nearly 30 shanties were gutted in a major fire in Sector 78, the city magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar and other officers reached the spot and distributed cheques worth Rs 3,800 to each of the affected familites. 

 “By our count, there were 30 families. So we distributed cheques on the spot to 28 of them. We could provide compensation only for their belongings and for food supply. We could not provide them compensation for their houses as they were living illegally on   land,” city magistrate Ramanuj Singh said. According to local residents, nearly 64 families staying a row of over 100 shanties were thrown to the streets as all their belongings were run down late in the evening on Wednesday. Though fire tenders reached the spot, not much could be salvaged.
 
 The residents of newly completed apartments in sectors 74-78 also extended help to the families. Residents from Mahagun Moderne, Mahagun Mezzaria, Antriksh Golf View were among those who offered help. Newly elected legislator   also visited the spot in the afternoon along with some local NGOs. “It was scary with the entire place ablaze. However, the residents of nearby flats came out to help. People brought food, clothes and even brought doctors to attend small children. Thankfully there was no casualty,” Dhananjay Singh, a resident of   said. According to local residents, there were 64 families residing in the area, but many have already started relocating since Wednesday night. 
 
 “We have been here since last night. Most families have relocated. We have tried to extend all kinds of support with food and medicines,” Sudeep Rathod, a local resident said. “Most people were construction workers, labourers. Those who have not found an alternative place to go will stay there under makeshift tents,” Ramanuj Singh added.
