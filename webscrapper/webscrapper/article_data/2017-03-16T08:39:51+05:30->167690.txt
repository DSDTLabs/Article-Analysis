HYDERABAD: Bharatiya Janata Party floor leader in the Legislative Assembly G Kishan Reddy said the 1.49 lakh crore budget presented by the state government for the 2017-18 financial year was high on allocations and low on expenditure. Even allocations to important sectors such as irrigation in the previous years were not spent. He described the budget "as a show off which is nothing but a magic with numbers." 

 Initiating the discussion on the budget in the Assembly on Wednesday, Kishan Reddy said the government could spend only 68% of what was proposed in 2016-17 and the 2017-18 budget could not be more than 1.28 lakh crore going by the trend so far. 
 
 He alleged that the government had been taking loans in the name of development and projects. The loan burden on the government rose from 61,000 crore during the Congress rule in united AP to 81,000 crore in 2014-15 and is expected to touch 1.40 lakh crore now. Kishan Reddy said the government lacked transparency in allocating works and tender processes and demanded that all the tender evaluation documents of major irrigation projects be placed in the Assembly. 
 
 Finance minister Etala Rajender said government could not take loans as per its whims and wishes.
