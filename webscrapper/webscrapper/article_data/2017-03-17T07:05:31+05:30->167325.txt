HYDERABAD: Every government school in the state will have toilets by the time they reopen for the new academic year on June 12, 2017. Students will also be provided uniforms and textbooks by that time. 

 Intervening during the question hour in the   on Thursday, deputy chief minister and education minister Kadiam   urged all legislators from the ruling party as well as from the Opposition to bring to his notice if these facilities were not available at schools by the scheduled date. “Each of the 25,000 schools have at least one   as of now, but I agree that they need maintenance,” Srihari said.
 
 Several members raised the issue of schools not having toilet facilities in the state and pointed out that the problem was felt acutely in girls’ schools. They also pointed out that if there were toilets, they were not being maintained and in most cases, they lacked water supply.
 
 TRS MLA Kalvakuntla Vidyasagar Rao, who spoke on the issue, remarked, “At least boys can ease themselves somewhere in open places. The government should make sure schools have toilet facilities for girls on a priority.”
 
 Admitting that there were problems, Srihari said these would be set right as the government was providing funds to schools for toilet maintenance. Around Rs 30,000 to Rs 1 lakh was being provided to each school to take care of the cleanliness, security and maintenance of toilets, he said.
 
 Panchyat raj minister  , while answering a question posed by MLAs Goverdhan Baji Reddy, Manchireddy Kishan Reddy and K Vidyasagar Rao, said toilets will be constructed in 6,000 schools under NREGS. During 2017-18, toilets in 3,000 schools would be constructed. Though NREGS funds would be used for these identified schools, the education department will take up construction of toilets in all the schools, Kadiam Srihari said.
