DHARAMSHALA: With chief minister   concluding his first winter sojourn in the lower part of the state on Sunday,   leaders claimed that nothing much was done for the welfare of the people during this period and termed it as a joy ride. During his seven-day tour, which started from January 28, Jai Ram visited various constituencies of Kangra district. Later in the day, he left for   from here. 

 Leader of the Congress legislative party Mukesh Agnihotri said besides celebrations nothing much had been done. “Bureaucrats have made the new chief minister inaugurate works, which already had been opened during the Congress tenure. He was misguided by his team. It was just a jo ride,” he said. “This tradition of winter sojourn was started by us (Congress) for welfare of this hill state,” added Agnihotri.
 
  Congress Committee ( ) secretary Ajay Verma said the foundation stone laid by the chief minister in Nagrota Bagwan had already been started during the Congress stint. Nagrota block Congress president Mann Singh claimed that two such projects Mohalkar-Niara road and   road to be completed at a cost of Rs 3.5 crore were started during the Congress rule and adequate budget provisions had been made for these.
 
 Congress leaders also maintained that the power substation for whose upgrading the CM laid the foundation stone was also taken up during the Congress stint. “Instead of wasting money on inaugurations, the new government should direct officials to complete the works started by the previous Congress government,” Verma said.
