The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it would not intervene in the Syro Malabar  , allegedly involving Cardinal  , until the Kerala high court decided on the pending appeal.

 A bench of Justices A K Goel and R F   disposed the petition challenging the stay granted by a division bench on a single bench order for registering an FIR against the cardinal and others. It noted that the high court had scheduled a hearing on April 3. 
 
 Arguing for the appellant, advocate Prashant Bhushan said the apex courtâ€™s decision in   case had not been followed. Responding to it, Justice Nariman also said the allegations are serious.
