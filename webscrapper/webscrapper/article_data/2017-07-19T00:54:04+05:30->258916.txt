MUMBAI: After making changes to the admission forms and filling up new applications, eyes are now set on the   merit list to be announced at 5 pm tomorrow (Thursday). The expected high cut-offs at top colleges and delay in the first round of admission already have students worried. 

 While the department opened applications a few hours late on July 15, it did not extend the deadline for students. The   at 5 pm on Tuesday stopped accepting new application forms and changes ahead of the second round of admission. “Even if there was a delay in opening the portal, it worked smoothly after and we received no requests from parents or students to extend the deadline,” said an official. 
 
 The second   is critical for over one lakh students who were not allotted a seat in the first round of admissions. But, at most top colleges, the seats are few and hence principals aren’t expecting the cut-offs to drop by more than 1%. “We have a few seats left in the science stream but hardly any in commerce and arts. We have been getting inquires from students who have got the same percentage as the first merit list cut-offs. If there are many students with the same marks, it is unlikely that the cut-offs will drop drastically,” said Ashok Wadia, principal,  ,  .
 
 Adding to the nerves is the delay that affected the first merit list and admissions. 
 
 On July 10 when the first merit list was announced, the education department delayed the process by several hours and announced it post 1 am. The general merit list too was delayed by a few hours.
