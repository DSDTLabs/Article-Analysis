NEW DELHI: The   department is grappling with a huge backlog of   in its leadership cadre. At the apex level of the department, of the 26 posts of principal chief commissioners, 20 have been vacant for almost two years now. 

 A rank below, at the chief commissioner level, there are 40 vacancies against a sanctioned strength of 91 posts. The two cadres are responsible for revenue collection of over Rs 10,000 crore at each individual officer’s level on average, or of a similar revenue implication. Further down, at the principal commissioner level, 150 of 300 posts have been vacant for two years. 
 
 A rank below, another 150 out of 600 sanctioned posts of commissioners are vacant. In most cases, the departmental promotion committee (DPC) has not met since 2014. Recently, the revenue department constituted a   for promotions to the principal chief commissioner level. 
 
 The government’s tardy approach has affected work culture. Many senior commissioners due for promotion have stopped taking interest in work, a senior officer said. “This is because they will be transferred along with the promotion so why take up any long-term initiative,” he added. 
 
 These high-level posts were to be filled up immediately after the cadre restructuring in 2013. However, the department got involved in court cases against some of its officers who were “inadvertently” promoted and this led to a logjam. 
 
 A senior officer said that according to DoPT rules the DPC should be convened twice every year to account for all retirements and vacancies arising in that year. The   has been at the forefront of search operations carried out across the country since the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. This exercise, a senior officer said, was over and above the task of achieving the direct tax collection target of nearly Rs 9 lakh crore. Mumbai and Delhi have most vacancies at the apex level.
