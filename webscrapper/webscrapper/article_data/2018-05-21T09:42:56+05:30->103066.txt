JHANSI: In a surprise move, SP president   visited a village in   where two farmers had committed suicide couple of months ago and met their families. He also handed over a relief amount of Rs 1.25 lakh to each family.

 
 Ramesh Mishra, MLC, informed that Akhilesh had gone to   for some work. While returning, he expressed his wish to meet the family members of the deceased farmers.
 
 Around two months ago, Thakurdas Ahirwar(42) and Rajbahadur Srivas(45), both hailing from Karhara village of Mahoba district had immolated themselves in a gap of 10 days as they were going through severe financial crisis.
 
 Akhilesh arrived in the village at around 1pm on Sunday, and met the families and listened to their problems. He also handed the relief fund to both families.
 
 “I am deeply concerned about the plight of farmers as they are the backbone of our country. The present government is not at all concerned about the farmer community,” he said.
