ALIGARH:   vice chancellor Lt Gen Zamer Uddin Shah on Saturday said prolonged non-availability of   could manifest in “resentment” as buffalo meat is the “staple diet” of students and set up a committee to manage supply of essential items to all messes.

 Talking to TOI, the VC said he had already set up a committee of five members to manage supply of meat and essential items to all messes. He said talks are going on with a private group and the issue will be resolved soon with supply of 600 kg meat per day hopefully being resumed.
 
 Supply of buffalo meat has been severely affected after the crackdown on illegal slaughterhouses in the state. With meat dishes off the menu in all messes AMU students had recently written to the VC seeking his intervention in the matter.
 
 The university has 19 halls, each catering to 5-7 hostels, where 25-30 kg of buffalo meat is consumed daily, except Fridays. That takes the varsity’s total consumption to over 570 kg meat a day. On Fridays, students get chicken to eat and the varsity administration procures 600 kg poultry meat to serve them.
 
 When contacted Tariq Anwar, secretary of Aligarh Meat Sellers Association, said there has been no improvement in the supply of buffalo meat due to administration's rigid stand. He said, over 350 small unauthorised butchers have stopped slaughtering animals. “The municipal corporation’s slaughterhouse has been closed since 2014 and if it is reopened, it will benefit small vendors as they will be able to slaughter animals here and get proper margin,” he added.
 
 Another issue plaguing the meat supply is the transportation of livestock after a number of incidents of assault on transporters carrying buffaloes were reported.
