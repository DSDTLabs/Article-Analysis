CHENNAI: Now that the state board Class XII results are out, it's time to gear up for college admissions into courses that could lay a foundation for the future. While engineering, medicine or commerce courses were at one point considered the go-to career option for many, today there is a plethora of career options waiting to be explored. 

 To help students with their choices,  , as part of its Mission Admission initiative, organises a full-day seminar on 'alternate career options' on Sunday (May 20). 
 
 While there is plenty of information available regarding the well-beaten paths, the seminar hopes to give a peek into some of the options less talked about and provide guidance for students who are seeking to convert their passion into a career. 
 
 The seminar will shed light on new-age careers and also involve focused sessions on design, film-making, digital marketing, journalism, advertising, lyric writing, radio jockeying and stand-up comedy, and photography.
 
 Some of the speakers at the seminar will include  , director and cinematographer  , lyricist and dialogue writer, and  , wildlife photographer, and   from the career counselling centre Admizzionz Campuz. 
 
 This year's seminar will also include one-on-one personalised career counselling at the venue for students who passed out of Class XII. 
 
 While the counselling sessions will be dedicated to Class XII pass-outs, the seminar is open to students of other classes as well.
 
 The programme will start at 9.30am and continue till 5pm at the Magnum Hall, Hotel Hablis, GST Road, Guindy. 
 
 To book a free one-on-one counselling session at the seminar, students can email their names along with mobile numbers to toichennai2018@gmail.com with the subject as 'TOI Mission Admission'.
