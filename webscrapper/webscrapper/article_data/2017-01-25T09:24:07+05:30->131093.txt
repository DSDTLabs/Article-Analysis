RAIPUR: A day after anti-Maoist vigilantes barged into the house of activist Bela   and asked her to leave the tribal region in 24 hours, the activist has said that she would not leave Bastar.

 “I will not leave Bastar. I will continue to work for protecting the rights of voiceless and marginalized communities. I am just changing my current address but definitely not leaving,“ she said, adding that there was a campaign against her ever since she comp lained to police against locals manufacturing liquor three months ago.
 
 A local tribal organisation lodged a complaint with SCST police station on Tuesday alleging that Bhatia insulted tribal communities.   president Mahesh Kashyap told reporters they were demanding legal action against Bhatia for naming her pet dog “Somari Nag“, a name popular amo ng tribal women in the region.
 
 “Initially, she told her neighbours that her name was `Somari Nag'. The locals staged a peaceful protest against using a tribal name. She later told reporters that she had named her dog `Somari Nag'. The entire tribal com munity , particularly tribal women, felt it was an insult,“ the complaint said. The tribals have demanded registration of an FIR and her immediate arrest. However, support has been pouring in for Bhatia ever since `goons' barged into her house and asked her to leave Bastar.
 
 T S Singhdeo, leader of opposition in   assembly , tweeted on Monday: “Convinced it's being done with Govt's approval, which is afraid of its human rights violations being exposed (sic)“.
 
 Poet-lyricist   tweeted on Tuesday: “the question is if   has filed FIRs accusing the security forces and taken rape victims to NHRC why are the “goons“ threatening her“.
