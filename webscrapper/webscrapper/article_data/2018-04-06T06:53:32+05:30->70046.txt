JAIPUR: Rajasthan High Court on Thursday sought a report from the JDA over the mismanagement of   in Jaipur.

 The division bench of Justice K S Jhaveri and   was hearing a PIL by   over the poor upkeep, encroachment and illegal constructions in the Central Park, the largest park in the heart of the city. 
 
 The court asked the JDA spell out how it is going about removing the encroachment, maintain cleanliness and also stop illegal constructions in the park used by hundreds of public every day.
 
 The petitioner said the Central Park is situated in approximately 80 bighas of land and a specific walking and jogging track has been developed around the entire area. This is being used by hundreds of people every day. But there is no maintenance is being carried out on the track and also no regular disposal of the waste from the park.
 
 Central Park area is a no construction zone as per a high court order in 1996. But some people contrary to the interest of the general public at large have illegally encroached upon the land in the guise of religious structures and constantly enlarging their land area encroaching upon the park land and carrying out illegal constructions. The JDA has failed to discharge its responsibility.
 
 The petitioner said since the title and ownership of the Central Park is with JDA it is incumbent upon the JDA to maintain and keep a watch on the encroachers. But groups having temple and mosque and residential houses on the central park or its adjoining areas are opening gates of the buildings and using the land for functions and programmes and dumping garbage. The encroachers have also constructed private toilets and placed benches without prior permissions of the JDA.
