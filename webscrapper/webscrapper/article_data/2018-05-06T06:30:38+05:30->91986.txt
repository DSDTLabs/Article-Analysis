KOLKATA: The decomposed body of a 75-year-old woman was found inside the first-floor room of her   residence on Saturday morning. While police have ruled out any foul play, locals are surprised after her husband said he didn’t get any stench.

 On Saturday morning, locals in the Survey Park area started discussing about a stench coming out of the two-storied residence of   (82). “We have been getting the foul smell since Friday morning. Initially, we thought it to be a carcass. But the odour grew stronger by Saturday morning and one of the locals called up cops,” said Rita Haldar, a neighbour.
 
 When cops reached the spot, they found the first-floor room of the woman — Manju Saha — locked from inside. They broke open the door to find out her decomposed body on the bed. She was draped in a saree. Her husband, who has been staying at the ground floor of the house, claimed that he was unaware of his wife’s death. Police later sent the body for autopsy.
 
 A resident of the area for long, Saha is known to everyone in the locality. He used to go out for morning walks regularly and talk to locals. After he started facing difficulty in climbing stairs, he reportedly stopped going to the first floor of the house. When questioned by cops, he said that he had not heard from his wife for the past few days and was unable to climb stairs. A maid, who had been looking after Manju for years, did not report to work for the past few days.
 
 A retired stenographer, Manju married Saha after the latter’s first wife died. While his two sons from the first marriage did not like him getting married again, one of them relocated to Garia after getting a job. Saha’s another son lives outside Bengal. Sources said none of them are in touch with their father. Manju had been suffering from old age-related diseases for long and was staying alone on the first floor.
