The 9th edition of ‘
  2018’, an annual photography exhibition by Photographers@Pune recently concluded at   on Ghole Road. 
 

  The exhibition was inaugurated by acclaimed theater artist and Film Director Nipun Dharmadikari of 
  fame. “Portrait or pictures do not need words as they are self-explanatory. A photograph always reflects the perception of a photographer. Every year I come to   where I get a glimpse different perceptions of various photographers,” said Nipun 
  
  Dharmadhikari further added, “I would love my scripts to be read by the photographers from the 
  Exhibition. It also gives me jitters when I think of a scenario where the photographers criticize my script. Nevertheless, I would be highly obliged if photographers review my scripts in the future.”
