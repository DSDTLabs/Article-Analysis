Mumbai:   Thackeray has slammed chief minister   for giving assent to the Centreâ€™s   with Saudi Aramco, a   oil giant, to expedite the Nanar   project slated to come up in   district in the   region.

 Fadnavis had assured   that the project would not be forced on villagers. Thackeray has accused Fadnavis of not keeping his word.
 
 The key question is whether a stung Shiv Sena would be willing to quit the Fadnavis government on the   dispute and safeguard its political constituency in Konkan ahead of the 2019 general and state elections or continue to cling to power, said observers.
 
 Speaking in the state legislative council last month, senior Shiv Sena politician and industries minister Subhash Desai said he would resign from the cabinet if the project imposed on Ratnagiri.
