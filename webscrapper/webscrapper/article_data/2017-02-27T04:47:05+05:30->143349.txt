Last evening,   uploaded a picture from a friend's birthday party that had two of the nation's biggest superstars -   and Aamir   in it. The picture was a rare sight where the former friends and foes came together in a single frame.

 
  
 Now, King Khan has taken the world by surprise with another picture from the same celebration. In the early hours of Saturday, he posted a picture with the 'Dangal' star on his social media profile.
 
 
  
  
 Shah Rukh captioned the picture, "Known each other for 25 years and this is the first picture we have taken together of ourselves. Was a fun night."
 
 Coincidentally, both of them are donning the colour white and waving the peace flag in this dazzling picture, while their films continue to tussle at the box-office.
 
 After making amends with Salman Khan, and appearing with him on various platforms, SRK seems to be on a similar path with Aamir. For the first time in decades, the fans of the three actors will probably be elated at seeing them put up a united front.
