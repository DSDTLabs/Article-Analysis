GUWAHATI: With Magh Bihu round the corner, the demand for traditional food items has gone up with people from across the state interested in locally made seasonal delicacies. From milk products to fish, sweets and cakes, imported or packaged foods items are being ignored in favour of their indigenous varieties. 

 For instance, items from dairy giants which generally rule the market have taken a back seat as the demand for home-made products has gone up. "I have already sold more than 20 litres of curd so far and I also have an advance order for around 120 litres. We are doing good business here and this is the best time of the year for us," said Xun Barman who hails from Sarbhog in Barpeta district, and was selling dairy items at a makeshift stall near   in the city. He also pointed out that one litre of buffalo curd costs around Rs 180 during this time.
 
 With a high demand for locally prepared curd in the market, branded dairy items like packaged yogurt were for once being ignored. In  , villagers from places like Janjhi which are known for their traditional milk products, are working round the clock to meet the sudden surge in demand.
 
 "These traditional forms of curd are creamy in texture, have more fat content and often melt in the mouth. Unlike other forms of curd, it is sour and clear white in colour. Prepared from raw buffalo milk, traditional yogurt is a favourite dish in every Assamese household during the festival of Magh Bihu," said a trader at Jhanji Mukh in Jorhat. 
 
 Jalpan, a local form of curd with flattened rice and molasses, is another traditional favourite during this festival. The demand for local types of fish has also gone up with Bhokuwa or Rahu, ferried from Andhra Pradesh and other states, being neglected during this time.
