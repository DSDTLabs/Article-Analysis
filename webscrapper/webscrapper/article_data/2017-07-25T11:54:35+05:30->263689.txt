AHMEDABAD: Dengue infections appear to be on the rise in the city. At least so reflects the data provided by civic body-run and civil hospitals given to   ( ). 

 Well-placed sources in the civic body’s health department have confirmed some 52 progressive cases of dengue reported in the civic body-run hospitals of the city in July. 
 
 However, in the weekly health report of the city, civic authorities have confirmed only 26 of these cases till July 22.
 
 “Most cases are only clinically ascertained and unless it is confirmed through both NS1 as well as IgG and IgM tests, these are not considered to be dengue cases. Therefore, once the hospitals report dengue cases, the samples are further sent for testing and only the positive cases are confirmed,” said a senior AMC health official.
 
 Last week, a random check on three civic body-run and two civil hospitals in the city revealed that 113 cases of dengue were reported from June to July 17, while civic authorities confirmed only 16 cases in the first fortnight of July. This is against 102 cases of dengue reported in July last year as per AMC health report.
 
 Further, dengue is caused by the same mosquito, Aedes aegypti, which also causes   virus infection. Such alarming under-reporting of cases does not augur well, especially at a time when city is faced with vector-borne epidemic.
