 "In fact, there is a very wonderful thing that read yesterday in a newspaper where a rape survivor was saying that why should the victim has to hide her face? It, in fact, the accused, who committed the crime should be ashamed, they should hide their faces. It's a threatful situation... I guess it's a good thing that media is so alert about all these things nowadays."
