 Ridiculed initially for her anglicised   to finally becoming everyone’s favourite and even emerging amongst the top five, Nivedita Gowda has clearly had an interesting journey in the   home. Having already created a sensation with her bubbly Dubsmash videos, the 19 year old was hailed as the Barbie doll in the BB home. So when she came out of the reality show, it didn’t take long for Sandalwood filmmakers to approach Nivedita with movie offers. But unlike other contestants who’ve enthusiastically entered the film frat, Nivedita, we hear, has not signed any film yet. “Yes, she has been getting many offers, but Nivedita won’t be doing films for the time being. She is in her second year BCA and needs to first complete her education. It is only after she graduates that we will be taking the next step,” shares Nivedita’s mother  . And has life been for the family since Nivedita’s return? “Nothing short of hectic. It’s only been home and college for Nivedita because she can’t afford to get an attendance shortage as exams are around the corner. As for us, we have been busy entertaining friends and relatives at home. Life is yet to return to normalcy for the family, but we are not complaining,” wraps up Hema.
