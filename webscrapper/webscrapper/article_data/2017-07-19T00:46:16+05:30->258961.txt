Panaji: The   ( ) has told agitating clubs that the foreign player rule for under-13 and under-15 leagues is restricted to players whose parents reside in India.
 
  The AIFF has given the go ahead for clubs and academies to field foreign players in youth and kids leagues. But only those players whose parents reside in India and in the same city that the players are registered in are eligible to take part.
  
  “Address proof, residential status must be provided as evidence (Indian passport holder parents with children with overseas passport, parents who have an OCI/PIO card, or have a residential permit or work visa in India),” the AIFF wrote to all clubs and academies in a clarification after top clubs like   and even the   ( ) criticised the AIFF move.
  
  AIFF general secretary Kushal Das said foreign players – even if their parents reside in India – won’t be allowed in any other competition but for young kids, it was only fair that they made an exception.
  
  “We got a fair bit of representation from parents whose kids don’t have Indian passports. At age 12 to 15, if anyone wants to play football, we should not deprive them of the opportunity, whether they are Indians or expats. They have passion for the game. They cannot be considered to play for the national team but they can at least play in our leagues,” said Das.
  
  Meanwhile, AIFF’s decision to allow foreign players who reside in India, PIOs and OCI card holder has been welcomed by former GFA general secretary  , who saw first-hand how many deserving children had to sit out of competitions.
  
  “There are a lot of mixed marriages in Goa and I guess it happens elsewhere in the country too. During my time with the GFA, I saw just how eager they were to play in our leagues. Players with foreign passports were eligible to play in school competitions but not the leagues. I am glad that the AIFF has now made changes to their rules,” said Messias.
