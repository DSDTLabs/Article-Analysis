HYDERABAD: With no takers for land and disinterest only increasing after demonetisation, the state has no plans to   in the 2017-18 financial year. In the previous budget, the government expected 10,900 crore in revenue by way of sale of land and planned to use these funds for various projects and flagship schemes, but the sale never really took off. 

 "There will be no sale of land by the government, mainly due to issues like demonetisation impact which needs to be examined thoroughly," finance minister Eatala Rajender said after presenting the budget on Monday.
 
 Ever since the TRS government came to power, one of its priorities was sale of government land to mop up resources. It estimated an earning of about 6,500 crore for 2015-16 and 10,900 crore for 2016-17 through sale and regularization of land.
