KOHIMA: The youth wing of the   People’s Front ( ) organised a ‘beef feast’ on Friday in front of the party headquarters to celebrate the end of its ties with the BJP.

 The two parties, allies since 1997, parted ways on July 18 after governor PB Acharya dismissed the government led by Shurhozelie Liezietsu. Angry at Acharya’s alleged ‘role’ in precipitating the crisis, the organisers also invited him.
 
 Speaking to the media, NPF working president Huska Yepthomi said the feast had been organised to provoke BJP that had made its strictures against the slaughter of cows quite clear. He said Nagas ate beef and would continue to do so.
 
 NPF youth president Vihoshe Sumi said three cows donated by a party member were slaughtered for the ‘feast.
