LUCKNOW:   studying in   in UP will now get 20 extra minutes during examinations. The decision, to be applicable from odd semester examinations in May-June, was taken by the academic council of APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University on Tuesday. Earlier, all students were given three hours to take an exam. In another decision taken by the examination committee, teachers awarding either more than 75% marks or failing any student in sessional exams will have to give reasons in writing. 

 According to university pro vice-chancellor V K Singh, the decision to give more time to differently-abled students was in accordance with the Central government rules. Such candidates will also be provided whatever facility they need. For instance, there was a student in a Noida college who wrote her exams with her foot. “For her, we had to make seating arrangements on the ground,’’ said controller of examination J P Pandey. 
 
 In an examination reform which will put a check on impersonation, there will be online attendance of candidates inside the examination hall. The university, which is to link candidates’ roll numbers with their Aadhar number, will make use of UID-compatible devices to take thumb impression of the candidates inside the examination hall. This, said Pandey, will check impersonation and also provide real time data. “Earlier, we used to get information once the exam was over. With online attendance, we will have real time data and can take action against proxy candidates,’’ Pandey said. 
 
 In addition, question papers will be sent online to the examination centres an hour before the exam. The centre incharge will be responsible to get print outs of the question paper.
