BENGALURU: The state government's decision to shift the venue of a ceremony, being organised on Saturday to mark the completion of four years in power from Bengaluru to Chitradurga, 200km from the city, has come as a source of great relief for commuters here. Political rallies conducted in Bengaluru often add to the congestion on city's streets.

 The social welfare department has been entrusted the responsibility of organising the rally, titled Janarige Manana Janarige Namana. The aim of the rally is to project chief minister Siddaramaiah government as an 'efficient, strong and able' regime. Besides cabinet ministers and legislators, beneficiaries of the government's various welfare schemes are likely to be present at the event. “We are expecting at least 2,000 people from each district,“ said Congress sources.
 
  H Anjaneya said, “Ideally, the bash should have been held in Bengaluru. But, we decided against it owing to the traffic congestion.Had we organised the event in Bengaluru, it would have caused more jams, with several vehicles carrying Congress workers entering and leaving the city adding to the congestion. We did not want to inconvenience the common man. Since the event is confined to Bengaluru division, which comprises nine districts, we chose Chitradurga.“
 
 In fact, the government drew flak from commuters after a bash organised to felicitate home minister G Parameshwara in October last year, for completing six years as KPCC chief threw traffic out of gear in the city. The event was held at Palace Grounds, and added to the congestion on the busy Ballari Road.
 
 “If the central part of Bengaluru gets clogged, it has a ripple effect on other roads. Hosting a mega political rally here is bound to throw normal life out of gear,“ said a police officer.
 
 The BJP too was criticised after the   that it held in November created havoc on the city streets.
