CHANDIGARH: An unidentified woman was found murdered in a room of an abandoned hotel on   road in   on Thursday night. 

 Police suspect the woman was killed after a sexual assault. 
 
 “The unclothed body, which perhaps was a week-old, was infested with maggots. We found some clothes near the spot which, it appeared, were of the woman. The accused destroyed her face to make her identification difficult,” said a cop.
 
 The murder came to light after the reeking body took a nearby dhaba owner to the hotel room. 
 
  said, “An ATM receipt was found in the clothes of the woman, who appeared to be in her 30s. We are trying to identify her. The body has been sent for a post-mortem examination to Post-graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak. We are awaiting the autopsy report.” 
 
 On the complaint of the dhaba owner, police have registered a case.
