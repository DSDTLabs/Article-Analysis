NEW DELHI: A Chinese lawmaker has pitched a proposal to preserve the country's "Red genes" to better preserve and develop the   ethos of the country and thwart "historical nihilism", reported state-run media.

 
  Liu Xianglian, a deputy to the 13th National People's Congress from Central China's Henan Province, made the proposal at the ongoing annual session of China's top legislature. He said, "revolutionary education" needs to be strengthened in the country's elementary and high schools. 
 
 The Henan lawmaker proposed a "Red gene transmission project" be initiated in schools to foster love of the   and for the country while countering "historical nihilism", which "smears revolutionary heroes and plants incorrect values and views of history". Revolutionary education should be written into textbooks and introduced into academic sessions in schools, Liu said, adding that more red websites and forums should also be launched online. 
 
 All cities and counties should make full use of local "red assets" including base areas and revolutionary sites for education, the Henan lawmaker said.
 
 A top academic hailed this "Red gene" proposal.
 
 "The proposal came just in time and it is to best preserve our Red genes, as revolutionary history is an integral part of Chinese history, as great as traditional Chinese culture, which are the basis of Chinese cultural confidence and cannot afford to be abused," said Su Wei, a professor at the Party School of the Chongqing Committee, to the state-run  .
 
  In December, a draft law on the protection of the reputation and honour of China's heroes and martyrs was released online for public opinion, said Global Times. 
 
 According to the draft, those who appropriate, damage or contaminate memorials, insult or slander heroes and martyrs, may receive administrative penalties from public security bureaus or even criminal sanctions.
