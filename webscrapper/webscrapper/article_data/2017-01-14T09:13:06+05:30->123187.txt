VADODARA: Artists in the city are set to make history of sorts with scrap. The ‘Spirit of Vadodara’ camp to make sculptures out of scrap organised by the   (VMC) has produced works that are set to become landmarks in the city.

 The imagination of prominent artists would make you enter the city to the sculpture ‘Gateway of Vadodara’ and fly from it in a steel plane designed much like paper planes one made as a student. One work even depicts the kite flying fervour in the city during Uttarayan with kites shown touching the stars and the moon.
 
 From steel pipes to rods and even a road roller, artists have made sculptures with whatever came their way. 
 
 “Nowhere else have we seen an effort on this scale in the country. A whopping 60 to 70 tonnes of scrap has been turned into art,” said  , who is coordinating with the artists for the effort.
 
 One of the curators for the camp,  , said that the artists were given complete freedom to select the theme of their works. “It was the first time that such an opportunity to make public art came to the artists and it fired them up too,” he said.
 
 Artist   said that there was little variety in the scrap and it was a challenge for the artists to make sculptures on different themes from it. “In fact, the material was more than sufficient,” said Das.
