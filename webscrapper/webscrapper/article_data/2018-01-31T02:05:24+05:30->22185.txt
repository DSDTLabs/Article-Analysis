GREATER NOIDA: After Noida, the   council has now recognised   authority as a   body. The Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority on Tuesday said that it has received a letter from the Goods and Services Tax (GST) council recognising it as a civic body. 

 This means residents will not have to pay GST for many services, including sanitation and water. Institutional, commercial, industrial and group housing plot owners will have to pay GST as per rules. But industrial plot owners will not have to pay GST on land cost. Non-business entities such as schools, medical colleges and religious buildings will also not have to pay GST for services provided by the authority.
