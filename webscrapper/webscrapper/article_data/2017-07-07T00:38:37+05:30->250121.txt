Mumbai: Ambulance sirens in the   don’t emit sound of 120 decibel (dB) that the state government recently permitted for local ambulances, said   of Awaaz Foundation on Thursday. She was responding to the state notification that allowed ambulance sirens to be raised to 120dB. 

 Sounds over 80dB are considered to be hazardous to health. The WHO states that noise pollution can trigger even heart attack and strokes.
 
 “I measured the decibel level of ambulances in London (94dB) and Mumbai and found sirens in London less noisy than those in Mumbai (100dB),” said Abdulali. She said she had highlighted this aspect in a letter to CM Devendra Fadnavis in May. “In the US, only ambulances operating near the highways are allowed to use sirens of 120dB.” She added that ambulances in western countries are ‘sound-proof’ so that the patient isn’t troubled . “Ambulances in Mumbai should consider lowering the decibel levels of sirens as they are not sound-proof.” TNN
