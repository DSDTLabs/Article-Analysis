INDORE: With only a week left for the   online application window to open for parents seeking   under it, some prominent private   in the city are yet to declare their seats under the   act. 

 The education department sources said these prominent private schools are shying away from the process despite the warnings.
 
 “Many prominent schools are yet to be recognized under RTE and principals and directors of these schools are giving excuses of being on a holiday due to summer vacations,” said an official. 
 
 Many schools authorities are blaming the delayed process of RTE as most of the schools had closed down for summer vacation from May 1. 
 
 Out of over 2,000 private schools in Indore district, around 1600 have approached the department to be recognized under the RTE while many were sent reminders constantly. Despite extending the deadline for schools to get recognition under RTE, 111 schools are yet to get recognition under RTE. 
 
 Online admission window will open for parents from May 15 to May 31 after which the online lottery will be held in the first week of June. “The registration is under process and we are hoping that all schools will register by May 10 as it is the last day. The BRC’s are keeping track of the registered and unregistered schools and action will be taken against those who fail to register by the deadline. We are doubtful about the schools which refused to take RTE students for the academic year 2016-17. We are keeping an eye on such schools,” said Akshay Singh Rathore, district project coordinator.
 
 However, for the schools, there are too many issues to be sorted out before applying for recognition, like fee reimbursement, uniforms and so on.
