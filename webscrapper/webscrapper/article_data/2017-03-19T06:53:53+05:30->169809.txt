PUNE: A suspected conman purchased a car from a businessman and duped him of Rs 3.5 lakh by issuing him a bogus cheque. 

 The incident occurred near   in Kharadi on February 21. 
 
 The businessman on Friday registered a complaint with the   police station against the suspect from   in Thane district.
 
 The victim had published an advertisement on an e-commerce portal for selling his car. The suspect, on reading the advertisement, contacted him and offered to buy the vehicle. 
 
 The duo met a few times, before the suspect purchased the car from him and issued him a cheque of Rs 3.5 lakh. 
 
 However, it bounced due to insufficient balance in his bank account.
 
 Senior inspector Anil Patrudkar in charge of the   police station on Saturday said, "After the businessman contacted the suspect over phone and told him that the cheque had bounced, the suspect visited his residence on February 27 and assured him of making the full payment at the earliest." 
 
 "However, he later broke all contact and avoided attending his telephone calls," he added.
 
 "A few days later, the businessman learnt that the suspect had sold the car to a customer in Gujarat, following which he registered the complaint," the officer added.
