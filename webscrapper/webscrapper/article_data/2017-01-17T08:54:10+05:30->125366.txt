BOKARO: Despite the  's efforts to make rural areas   (ODF) under the  , people continue to defecate in the open in the urban areas. 

 Bokaro DC Rai Mahimapat Ray recently sent letters to officials in Bokaro Steel Plant (BSL),   (CCL), Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC), Tenughat Thermal Power Station (TTPS), Indian Explosive Limited (IEL) and sought information from the administration on the number of toilets in their township along with the number of employees. Companies have been asked to provide information on the existing toilets in their townships.
 
 In   (BSL), the issue is the maximum as thousands of squatters reside illegally on more than 1,100 acres of land. These illegal residential structures do not have toilets, forcing residents to defecate in the open. BSL consists of nearly 37,000 quarters where existing and former employees live. Those working in banks, administrative offices and schools also stay here. Residents go to the Cooling Pond and its surrounding areas to relieve themselves. According to sources, several old quarters of CCL in Bermo do not have toilets. 
 
 As against the 2011-High Courts order to remove all encroachment, the administration wishes to make the area ODF by building toilets. An anti-encroachment drive was conducted on the encroached land of the public sector undertakings, jointly by the administration and companies. However, it failed to remove the illegal settlers completely.
 
 Nodal officer of ODF, S N Upadhayay said they have asked companies to provide information on the existing number of toilets, the number of employees, their addresses and other relevant details. "Once we gather information, it will help us to decide the future course of action," Upadhayay said.
