BEIJING: A   who had inadvertently crossed over to India in 1963 after the 1962 war finally returned to his hometown in   province after 50 years.  , 77, was kept in captivity till 1969.

 He finally settled in Madhya Pradeshâ€™s   district and raised a family after marrying an Indian woman.
 
 On Friday, he returned to China with his son Vishu Wang, daughter-in-law Neha and granddaughter Khanak Wang. His Indian wife Shushila and daughter, however, stayed back in India due to ill health and are expected to join him soon.
 
 Qi, however, has not yet decided whether he would live in China or return to India. Indian authorities have stamped a 1-year visa on his Chinese passport allowing sufficient time to decide his next course of action.
 
 Chinese government has taken the rare decision of giving a relatively long two-year visa to his son and granddaughter in what appears to be a signal that Beijing wants him to stay back.
