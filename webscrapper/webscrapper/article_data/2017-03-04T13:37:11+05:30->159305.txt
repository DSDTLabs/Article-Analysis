DHANBAD: More than 10,000 rural women living across Left Wing Extremism-hit areas of   will soon be connected with livelihood projects under the Union government's   (NRLM). 

 The district administration has identified at least 1,000 groups of skilled and trained women who will be provided with loans on subsidised rate and required tools to start their trade or business. 
 
 Deputy commissioner,  , who has been instrumental in rural development projects across the district with the help of government and non-governmental agencies, had recently interacted with rural masses in LWE-hit areas and directed the authorities to prepare a list of trained women. 
 
 "The programme will certainly help the authorities to curb the insurgency across the region," Singh said. 
 
 "The women have been imparted training under several skill development programmes by renowned institutions through   (JSLPS) over the past one-to-two years. The main business include retail outlets of handicraft products, garment shops, mushroom cultivation, animal husbandry and fisheries," said district development commissioner (DDC)  . 
 
 "If we check the NPA accounts of the local banks we find that the women are more reliable than that of the men in repayment of their loans. As such the bankers, too, are active in this project. Our main focus is on the extremely poor and deprived women living across the remote and inaccessible parts of the LWE-hit areas of Parasnath in Pirtand, Dumri, Giridih, Gawan, Tisri, Deori, Bengabad and other block areas of the district," Pasi said.
 
 He added, "The government has allocated a sum of Rs 5 crore that will given as loans to these women. The district administration will organise Swarojgar Protsahan Mela to call these women to a common platform in the next 10-12 days to start the projects."
