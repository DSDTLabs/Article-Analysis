Vadodara: From veterans like N S Bendre and Dhruva Mistry to K Laxma Goud and Vrindavan Solanki, finest artworks of some of the prominent artists in the country will be on display in the city from October 5 to October 8. 

 The art show will exhibit paintings and sculptures of 45 artists at the exhibition hall of fine arts faculty, M S University. Some of the city’s top artists and eminent personalities have also been invited. 
 
 “I owe most of learning of art to Vadodara in general and M S University in particular. I have been planning to do a show in the city for a long period but somehow other commitments kept me occupied,” Harmeet Singh Sethi, director of Aura Art eConnect that has organized the exhibition. 
 
 “I have lived in this city for over 15 years. But I have been spending more time in Mumbai since last few years and during this period my keenness to find reason to be in Vadodara prompted me to finally plan this show,” Sethi added.
 
 “This show will certainly give onlookers a spiritual delight in travelling through this galaxy of artists and their revelation of an unprecedented world of imagery,” said Prof Shailendra K Kushwaha, Member, National Apex Committee, NGMA and former dean, Faculty of Fine Arts, MS University. “The paintings will be exhibited inside the hall while the exquisite sculptures will be put on display separately outside. The idea is to bring some of the best quality of works from different parts of the country to Vadodara that is known its for art culture,” Sethi said.
