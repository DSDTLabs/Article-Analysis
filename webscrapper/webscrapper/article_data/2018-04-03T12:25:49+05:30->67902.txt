ZIRAKPUR: The   district authorities could well have inspired the distrust   finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal claims to have in the English proficiency of most bureaucrats in the state.

 Blunders have come to light in a couple of official replies filed by different local officials of the Punjab government to two complaints from March about the lack of public   and garbage disposal in  . The reply to both complaints was: “Differently abled   matter has been forwarded to the DC office.”
 
 On March 3, Zirakpur resident Manoj Das submitted on the deputy commissioner’s portal garbage collection in his area had stopped a long time ago. He said: “I was surprise to get an acknowledgement message from the DC office in Mohali on March 9 that ‘your representation related to the differently abled pension matter has been forwarded to the DC office in SAS Nagar (Mohali’s official name). For future correspondence, DCSAS/E/2018/00019 was given as registration number.” 
 
 On March 17, he posted another compliant about the unavailability of a public toilet in the entire Zirakpur. On March 20, he again got an acknowledgement letter that with the same old reply. Only the registration number (DCSAS/E/2018/00024) had changed. On March 28, Das wrote again to the Mohali DC that no action had been taken on the two earlier complaints and the DC should look into the matter.
 
 Confronted, deputy commissioner Gurpreet Kaur Sapra said she had not even received any of these complaints. She said she would check up with the officials concerned. Zirakpur resident   said after getting this kind of non-serious response from the town’s authorities, maybe the residents should start filing complaints in Punjabi instead of English, “so that the bureaucrats can understand it”. Another resident, Rakesh Bansal, also said “the correspondence with any Punjab office should be in Punjabi only”.
