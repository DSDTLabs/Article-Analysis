RAJKOT: An unemployed man, who is also affected by polio, has threatened to start selling country-made liquor in market of   town of Kutch from January 26 as he is left with no option to earn a livelihood despite having a post-graduate degree.

 Bipin Matang, has written a letter to various government departments including Kutch district collector claiming that he holds Masters’ Degree in Arts and has graduated with Bachelors of Education but has not yet got a job despite registering with the employment exchange. 
 
 “I am polio affected person and am physically handicapped and therefore unable to do work and I am now forced to sell liquor in an open bazaar in Bhuj town,”  , wrote in his letter to state government.
 
 “Forget about job, but I have not even received a letter of interview from employment exchange for the job. I applied to various places but did not get any call. A Gandhidham-based high school called me up for six months but they did not continue my service and since than I have been jobless. Till now, I was alone but now I am married and I have to feed my family. The (Narendra) Modi government only does drama of development to fool people. I have lost my patience and therefore I have decided to sell country-made liquor. My family has never been addicted to anything but now I have to sell liquor,” Matag claimed.
 
 “I am helpless and I will also ask other unemployed people to join me to sell liquor,” he added. However, Matang could not be contacted despite several attempts.
