PATNA: Bihar’s new   does not appear to be fair to the fairer sex with one woman representing half of the state’s 10.38 crore population. Even the representation of Muslims has reduced from four in the previous cabinet to one in the new one.

 While JD(U)’s Cheriya Briarpur MLA Kumari Manju Verma is the only woman minister, its   alias Firoz Ahmad is the sole minister belonging to the minority community. They were in the previous cabinet as well — holding social welfare and sugarcane industry portfolios respectively.
 
 According to the 2011 census, women comprise 49% of the state’s population. A large section of them is considered the vote bank of CM Nitish Kumar, who has in the past initiated several measures for women empowerment, including 50% quota in local bodies and cycle and uniform schemes for girl students. 
 
 The much-publicised prohibition was also enforced in the state on the demand of women.
 
 As many as 28 women were elected MLAs in the 2015 election, including ten on JD (U) ticket, four as BJP candidates and one Independent. Their number, however, is down from two in the previous cabinet to one in the new cabinet as RJD’s  , who helmed the tourism department, has been dropped. 
 
 Needless to say, women are not happy. “Though we are supporters of Nitish, but women’s representation is definitely poor,” said social activist Babita Sinha.
 
 Muslims comprise almost 15% of the state’s population. The state has 28 Muslim MLAs. However, only five of them belong to the ruling alliance with none of the coalition partners, except JD(U), having any Muslim MLA.
 
 The four Muslim ministers in the previous Grand Alliance government included RJD’s   (finance), Congress’s Abdul Jaleel Mastan (excise and prohibition), RJD’s   (minority welfare) and JD(U)’s Khurshid.
