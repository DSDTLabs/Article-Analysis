Mumbai: Transport experts on Wednesday drafted a petition, demanding that the fares of autos and taxis in Mumbai should taper off after 10 km so that it cuts down the cost of travelling long distances. 

 This along with other demands such as the need for an exclusive app for black-and-yellow taxis and increase in penalty for refusals will be forwarded to the newly formed government committee on fare hikes headed by Mumbai Transformation Support Unit director B C Khatua. The panel is currently in the process of hearing auto-taxi unions, activists and commuter groups across the state, and is likely to devise a new formula on fare hikes soon.
 
 “Fares of autos and taxis should be tapering off after the first 10 km. Currently, we pay fares on a fixed calculation of Rs 12.19 per km for autos and Rs 14.84 per km for the taxis. But for a long run, the fares should drop gradually. This can be programmed easily in the electronic meter, and will provide benefit to passengers while at the same time increase ridership in black-andyellow taxis for long routes,” said transport expert Ashok Datar. 
 
 Experts want the state to introduce electric autos and cabs to curb noise and air pollution. 
 
 “The fines for refusals should be increased and it should be imposed on the spot so that it acts as a deterrent. A new mobile app can be developed exclusively for Kaali Peeli taxis, which can help commuters locate cabs in the vicinity,” said A V Shenoy from Mumbai Transport Forum. 
 
 Varsha Raut of Mumbai Grahak Panchayat said the new panel should also examine the “competitive” fares of Ola and Uber before deciding on the hike.
