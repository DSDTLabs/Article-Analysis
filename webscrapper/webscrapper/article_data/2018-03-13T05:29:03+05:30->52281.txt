MUMBAI: An   drafted by   may give the University of Mumbai a new   by April 20.

 A high-ranking official said that a search committee headed by noted scientist K Kasturirangan will interact with candidates on April 13 and 14 and submit the names of five short-listed nominees to Raj Bhavan. 
 
 
  
 
 The search committee has Uttarakhand National Institute of Technology director Shyam Lal Soni as the University of Mumbai nominee and Cidco MD Bhushan Gagrani as the state government nominee.
 
 The   is also the chancellor of all universities in the state.
 
 Soon after vice-chancellor Sanjay Deshmukh had to leave over an ill-implemented online assessment programme that inordinately delayed results, D Shinde, the vice-chancellor of Shivaji University, Kolhapur, was entrusted with the additional charge of the University of Mumbai.
 
 The search committee was set up simultaneously and received 96 applications, of which 64 were found to be eligible. After a preliminary scrutiny, the committee short-listed 32 candidates for interaction with the search committee. 
 
 Shinde did not apply for the prestigious job.
 
 “We expect that the search committee will submit the list of five short-listed nominees to Raj Bhavan on April 14 or 15 and the governor may hold personal interviews with the nominees in a day or two after April 15 and declare the new vice-chancellor,” he said.
