According to sources,  , general manager of SCR has instructed officials to come up with a proper display system for passenger complaints and suggestions pertaining to coach cleaning, and keep tabs on activities of contractual housekeeping staff deployed on trains.
 
 "The exisiting action plan on cleanliness has been drawn up in sync with   drive," said an official.
