MEERUT:  , 24, and her sister Farheen, 22, residents of   in   married to two brothers of Ladpura village -Sabir Ahmad and Shakir -on the same day in 2012, but both had to bear   including abuse and beatings by their husbands.

 Eventually , in September 2016, when Amreen's 3-year old son asked Rs 5 from Farheen's husband, he not only thrashed him but asked the sisters to fetch Rs 5 lakh from their parents. When the argument increased, Shakir gave talaq to Farheen and threw her out of the house.
 
 The two women have horrifying details to tell. “We had been subjected to untold miseries including unnatural sex by our spouses. Once I was beaten so much that I suffered a miscarriage, but our trauma did not end. In 2015 also we both were thrown out of the house but they had to take us in after directions from the court. But in September last year, when my sister Farheen was given talaq, I too left the house with her. I also filed an FIR against my husband and my brother-in-law. My sister has been divorced through triple talaq and now I too want to give my husband triple talaq .And that is why I have come here.“
 
 Amreen, accompanied by her sister, has sought justice from the inspector general as the FIR filed on January 30 has not led to any action against their former husbands.
 
 Interacting with mediapersons outside the IG's office, Amreen said, “If men can give triple talaq to women, then we should also have the right to do the same. Today I also give triple talaq to my husband and I demand that a law should be made to make triple talaq given by women also valid.“
 
 Besides, they also demanded arrest of the brothers. IG Ajay Anand has assured of all possible help.
