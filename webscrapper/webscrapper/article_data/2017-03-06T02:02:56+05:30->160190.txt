GURUGRAM: The highly competitive work environment of   has a tendency to suck the life out of young professionals. Many people have succumbed to the pressures of the corporate world by going into  , with some even ending their lives.

 People, however, are reluctant to consult a psychiatrist for their mental well-being. In India, 25% of the population suffers from various psychological problems and about 5% from minor depressive disorders, reveals a recent study by the National Institute of   & Neuro Sciences.
 
 “At least 70% of the population in Gurgaon has high stress levels or some form of depression,” said Dr Rachna Khanna Singh, relationship expert and psychologist at   Hospitals. This is where ‘tele-psychiatry’ steps in. In a bid to circumvent this hurdle, mental health experts are now offering to counsel patients using technology — through interactive media, a patient can get expert advice in the comfort of his home.
 
 Singh reveals that in the past year, 80% of her patients have chatted with her via texts and WhatsApp whenever in need of help. She even conducts at least 2 to 3 video chats a day on Skype with her patients. But her rules are clear — a patient will have to meet her in person the first time. 
 
 “Through tele-psychiatry, we are constantly monitoring the patient’s emotional well-being, unlike in a traditional set-up where we would see a patient only once or twice a week,” said Dr Jyoti Madan, senior consultant, psychiatry, at Paras Hospital.
