A host of artistes — including Benny Prasad, Mike Murali and Shermaine Willis — will come together this weekend, as they perform at Tree-Mendous, an event hosted by a non-profit   that aims to help underprivileged children. The event, which will be held on January 20 at Planet Hope, promises to be a huge affair, as there will be  , food and other activities through the day, and will also have birthday celebrations of 500 underprivileged kids as they share their birthday month. Organizer Ruben John Jose says, “The event is aimed at getting non-financial 
  for underprivileged children in over 35 shelter homes. We are aiming at getting mentors in four categories — youth aged between 20-25, working professionals aged between 25-35, those aged between 35-45 and finally retired mentors.”
 
 Ruben adds that the aim of finding such mentors is that they will be spending more time with these children. “Often, we have many people coming and celebrating their birthdays and bringing gifts for these kids at the shelters. They also promise gifts and other goodies, which many times they forget to send. By having such mentors, we hope that each one of them will be able to spend time 
 with the kids on a regular basis so that they (kids) do not feel left out.” The event, says Ruben, will also have activities like human formations, which they will attempt to form in the shortest time, trying to create a record of sorts and will have music performances and several food stalls for those who attend. “The formations will revolve around the theme of ‘Save Plants, Save our Planet’,” Ruben sums up.
