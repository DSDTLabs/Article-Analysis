JAIPUR: After the   took   for   two days ago, hundreds of locals reached the spot to stall the   on Monday.

 The JCB machine and labourers working on the site were forcefully asked to stop the construction work by the protesters. These protesters claimed to have ‘taken back’ the land and they would not give the possession of land. “Most of the colonies developed by the JDA are lying vacant. The civic body is forcibly taking land of poor farmers to develop a housing colony. We would not let this happen,” said Nagendra Singh, coordinator,   Bacho Kisan Yuva Samiti
 
 The JDA had planned to acquire 1,300 bighas to develop the housing scheme. Out of this, the civic body took possession of 110 bighas recently from the ‘mandir mafia’. Till date, the JDA has taken possession of 600 bighas located in the scheme. It has also deposited Rs 60 crore in the court for the acquired land.
 
 On Friday JDA took possession of 15 bighas required for connecting the area with housing project. “Case with local police for disruption of work at our Ninder was registered on Monday. We have also decided to increase the force deployment at the site. ” said a senior official
 
 Authorities had announced the scheme in January 2011. It is proposed that the project, located 20km away from Ajmeri Gate, will have 10,000 houses. After the failure of Privthiviraj Nagar housing scheme planned on 1,300 bighas, this is JDA’s second-largest housing scheme.
 
 Official sources said the JDA made a mistake by launching such a big housing project on private land when people were unwilling to give their expensive land for such a project.
