PANAJI: All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) has filed a writ   at the high court of Bombay at Goa, challenging the contract awarded to Wellness Medicenter to supply medicines and surgical implants to   and Hospital (GMC).

 The high court on Monday issued notices to the chief secretary, GMC and Wellness Medicenter, Mumbai.
 
 In the petition, AITUC has alleged arbitrariness and discrimination by the government to favour business interests of the Mumbai-based company.
 
  told the court on Monday that with   (GAPL) being a public sector undertaking, it is the responsibility of the government to protect the livelihood of the people employed at the pharmaceutical company. The central government holds 76% of the stakes in the company, while the state government holds 24%.
 
 The GAPL has been supplying medicines to the premier government hospital for the last 20 years. It supplies medicines worth Rs 6 lakh per day to the government hospital, and so far, there has been no complaints against GAPL with regards to either the quality of medicines it has provided or any other aspect of the supply.
 
 Besides, the petition alleged that the whole e-tendering process was suspicious in nature as it was not transparent, and allegedly tailored-made to suit the requirement of the third-party contractor. The petition prayed that the contract awarded to the Mumbai company be set aside. tnn
