NEW DELHI: The   on Thursday rejected a plea seeking to allow the controversial sport   played during Pongal festival in  .

 A bench comprising justices Dipak Misra and R Banumathi told a group of lawyers, who requested for the verdict, that it is unfair to ask the bench to pass an order.
 
 The apex court, however, said that the draft of judgement has been prepared but it was not possible to deliver it before Saturday when Jallikattu is to be organised.
 
 The court had reserved its verdict on a batch of petitions challenging Centre's notification allowing the sport.
 
 In 2014, the court had 
  on grounds of animal cruelty. The order, however, didn't go down well with Tamil Nadu political parties.
 
 Last year, SC had 
  that banned bulls for Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu. 
 
 The apex court had also earlier declared Tamil Nadu Regulation of Jallikattu Act, 2009 as constitutionally void, being violative or Article 254(1) of the Constitution.
 
 On January 8, last year the Centre had issued a notification lifting ban on Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu with certain restrictions, which was challenged in the apex court by Animal Welfare Board of India, People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India, a Bangalore-based NGO and others.
 
 On July 26, last year the apex court had said that just because the bull-taming sport of Jallikattu was a centuries-old tradition, it could not be justified.
 
 It had said if the parties were able to convince the court that its earlier judgement was wrong, it might refer the matter to a larger bench.
 
 The Supreme Court had on January 21, last year refused to re-examine its 2014 judgement banning use of bulls for Jallikattu events or bullock-cart races across the country.
 
 The apex court had also stayed the January 8 notification of Centre.
