CHANDIGARH: A day after the   ruled that it was illegal to seek votes in the names of religion, caste, colour or language, Sirsa-based Dera   claimed that it was neither a religion nor a sect, but a place that preached meditation. Dera’s functionary Aditya Insan gave his statement on Tuesday to justify the existence of its political affairs wing.

 The dera has a huge following across the country and abroad. Its followers are called ‘Premis’. As a result, leaders of all political parties make a beeline before its chief, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, ahead of elections. “We are neither a sect nor a religion. We teache meditation free of cost to followers of all religions and preach universal brotherhood. We have never stood by those who use religion for vested agendas,” said Aditya. “We respect the law of the land and authority of the Supreme Court,” he added.
 
 Ram Rahim has been in controversies over allegations of sexual abuse of women followers, murder and allegations of castration of male followers.
 
 It is the only dera in north India having a political affairs wing, which becomes active ahead of the assembly and general elections.
 
 BJP president Amit Shah, Rajsthan chief minister Vasundera Raje and senior politicians of Congress Captain   had been thronging the Sirsa-based dera to seek the support of its followers and their families.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Aditya confirmed the continuation of dera’s political affairs wing. “The wing is a citizens’ body for advocacy against drugs, alcohol, communalism, cartelism and gender bias by motivating politicians to sign a charter based on these principles,” he said.
 
 According to information, the wing works at three different levels. The committee at the top gets the opinion generated from the grassroots. The opinion is generated through various rounds of discussion on the candidates and political parties in the fray in particular areas.
