KOLKATA: An extra signal post 100 metres before the main traffic signal and a 100-meter dedicated bus lane will do immense good to decongest city roads. The average journey time by bus will be reduced by 25% if the design change is incorporated, revealed a study conducted by IIT-Kharagpur.

 
  
  
 
 After a laboratory test, the IIT-Kharagpur team recently carried out the experiment, in association with   and the transport department, at the Rash   crossing and   crossing successfully.
 
 “The entire exercise is to prioritise buses on the last 200-metre stretch — Queue Jump Lane — before the signal. The left lane will be a dedicated bus bay. There will be an additional signal for other vehicles 100 meter down the main signal.
 
 This additional signal will be synchronised with the main signal. The ‘pre-signal’ will turn red 15 seconds before the main signal. So vehicles other than buses will stop 100 metres before the main signal 15 seconds before the buses,” explained Bhargav  , a traffic and transportation expert from IIT-Kharagpur, who is leading the study.
 
 During this 15-second time slot, buses will move forward along the dedicated bus lane till the crossing. Once the signal turns green, the buses will move first, followed by other vehicles. Since buses carry 90% of commuters, the dispersal will happen faster. Then private cars and cabs can then move smoothly, said Maitra.
 
 The result of the pilot study was startling. While the average journey time by a bus reduced by 25%, it increased by 6% in case of cars or cabs. Overall mobility, on the other hand, gets benefitted by 10%.
