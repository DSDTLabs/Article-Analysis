NEW DELHI: Two men fired multiple rounds in Rohini’s Siraspur village on Wednesday night, targeting a property dealer’s office and a party lawn. They fled from the scene afterwards.

 Thereafter, they moved ahead and stopped outside a real estate agent’s office, firing three rounds at the office. Cops from   police station said that no one was injured in the incident. It was found that the agent owns the party lawn as well, confirming that the accused had come to target him.
 
 Senior police officers said that the crime team and forensic experts were called in to collect evidence from the scene. A case has been registered.
 
 A preliminary probe has indicated it to be the handiwork of some local criminals who are trying to extort money from the real estate agent.
