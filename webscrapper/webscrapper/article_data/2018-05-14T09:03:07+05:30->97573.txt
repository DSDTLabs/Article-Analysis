JAIPUR: Only 10 seats in government medical colleges are left for mop-up round for PG courses admissions in the state. The mop-up rounds are scheduled for Monday. Among 10 vacant seats, nine are those from non-clinical branchesâ€”anatomy and physiology. After the mop-up round last year, there were no takers for 74 PG seats in government medical colleges in the state. It has always been a difficult task to fill seats in all non-clinical branches, especially in anatomy, biochemistry, pharmacology, preventive & social medicine (PSM), physiology and forensic medicine.

 But this time around, the medical education department has successfully filled up more non-clinical branches in comparison to past year. There is a trend of students preferring clinical branches rather than non-clinical ones.
 
 Last year, in  , 12 seats for PG courses were left lying vacant after the completion of mop-up round last year. But this year, only one seat in forensic medicine has been left for mop-up round.
 
 Before the admission process initiated in PG medical courses this year, the state government had scrapped the bond requirement for non-clinical branches which are less popular among candidates that helped in filling the post-graduation courses in non-clinical branches this year. It is compulsory for PG students to sign a bond of Rs 5 lakh assuring that they would not leave the course without completing it. Also, another bond of Rs 25 lakh bond is compulsory for PG students assuring the government that they would work for at least five years in government hospitals. But, for less popular non-clinical branches, such bonds were not required.
 
 Besides, more than 100 PG seats are vacant in private medical colleges and they will be offered to the aspirants in the mop up round on Monday. Sixteen seats are yet to be filled up in MD (anaesthesia), 15 in MS (anatomy), 10 each in pathology and physiology in private and government medical colleges of the state.
