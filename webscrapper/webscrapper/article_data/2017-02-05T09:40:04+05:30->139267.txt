KOCHI:  , mother of  , the PhD scholar of   who committed suicide to protest against alleged caste-based discrimination on campus, said it was unfortunate that leftist unions like SFI were attacking members of dalit, women and Muslim organizations. Inaugurating a seminar on “Caste Discrimination In India’’ organized as part of   national conference on Saturday, she urged the youth movements to work together to resist fascist forces.

 She noted that even a prominent adivasi leader like C K Janu had to join hands with   forces. Even the SFI was fighting dalit unions in the universities like JNU, she said.
 
 On the efforts to bring in legislations named after Rohith, she “How can a law be framed by non-dalits to protect dalits? The Sangh Parivar and BJP don’t enjoy the support of majority. Still, the BJP rules at the Centre. This was because anti-fascist organizations are a divided lot,’’ she said
