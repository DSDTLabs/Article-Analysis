YAVATMAL: The   Sachindra Pratap Singh has continued to issue instructions to the Chief Officers of   in the district regarding the spate in   on the government land and ordered them to launch the encroachment removal drive right from the day one he has assumed office here in Yavatmal. However, the instructions of the Collector seem to have fallen on deaf ears or the officials prefer to turn a   on it.

 The collector has held a number of review meetings in the last couple of years and issued standing orders to remove all the encroachments on Govt land but of no avail.
 
 On Saturday, the Collector has again chaired a review meeting of the Municipal Chiefs and the Chief Officers of all the Municipal Councils and appealed them to launch a search drive of the encroachments on the Govt land under their jurisdiction and report back to him in seven days.
 
 The District Collector is keen to remove the encroachments and utilize the Govt land for generating revenue sources for the Municipal Councils. But the Municipal Chiefs and Chief Officers failed to pay attention to the orders of Collector and the encroachments are mushrooming everywhere and it has become a public nuisance and the life and property of the genuine tax payers are at stake.
 
 The new SP has instructed the Traffic control police to tow off the vehicles parked on the road sides and the traffic constable are in high spirit to comply with the order despite considering the non availability of parking spaces in the busy market areas in the city.
 
 In fact, the traffic police turns a blind eye towards the hawkers and shops on wheels and prefer to take ‘hafta’ from them for violating the traffic rules and illegally occupying the public roads for their business thereby preventing the traffic movements.
