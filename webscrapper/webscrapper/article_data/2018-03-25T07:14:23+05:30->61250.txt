LUCKNOW: The design and architecture of the   — state capital’s oldest and most popular market — draws inspiration from the classical dance form Kathak. Since Kathak is a very expressive dance, the design team decided to construct the two levels of station — concourse and platform — in the form of a pair of eyes.

 The Metro station construction is in full swing under   and will be complete by next month but it will be unveiled in April 2019. Hazratganj station will be the longest among all underground Metro stations that will connect the underground Sachivalaya Metro station with the elevated station at KD Singh ‘Babu’ Stadium.
 
 
 On entering the station, a passenger will see an elliptical shaped opening (with boundary) on the concourse. It will be a large glass and stainless steel-based structure creating impression of an eye. The staircase and escalators that will pass through the opening will look like the eye’s pupil (as shown in picture).
 
  (LMRC) will put art panels, designer glass and paintings depicting Kathak ‘mudras’ on station walls. Unlike other Metro stations which use maximum two colours of stone for granite flooring, Hazratganj station will use a scheme of four colours: black, white, pink and red to create the desired image of an eye.
 
 The Hazratganj Metro station entrance will be designed in a special canopy form that will seem like a gateway to a palace. The station will have four entries, near DRM office, Mayfair Building, LIC office and Cathedral Church.
 
 Officials said that Hazratganj being the longest station besides Charbagh, will see maximum number of commercial units, shops, cafes, lounges, ATMs on the concourse.
