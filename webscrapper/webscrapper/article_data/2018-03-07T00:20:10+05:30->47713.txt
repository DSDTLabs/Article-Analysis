 are contemplating a hike in ticket prices for the semifinals of Indian Super League to offset the high cost of renting out the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda.
 
  FC Goa qualified for the semifinals with a 3-0 win over Jamshedpur FC in the concluding match and will now lock horns with rivals   in the first leg semifinal at Fatorda on Saturday.
  
  According to sources, the minimum price of a ticket for the lower stands – East, South and North – will be Rs 449, while South Upper and North Upper ticket will cost Rs 499 each. Ticket for the East Upper stand has been priced at Rs 999 while the most expensive ticket will be for the West Upper stand at Rs 1249.
  
  Ticket sales will start from Thursday.
  
  FC Goa are understood to have agreed to pay SAG, who owns the stadium, approximately Rs 1 crore for the nine group stage matches and will have to pay an additional Rs 11.5 lakh for the first leg semifinal. Cost of permissions from various departments, including police, works out to approximately Rs 27 lakh for each game, said club officials, leaving the club with little or no revenue.
  
  “Last season we did not even break even with the revenue that we got from ticket sales,” said one club official. FC Goa’s revenue from ticket sales last season totalled Rs 2.39 crore.
  
  FC Goa have played attractive   this season winning plenty of hearts. The Sergio Lobera coached side is the most attacking in the league with 42 goals in 18 matches.
