Ponda: Colem police are clueless over the two bodies retrieved in two different incidents on Saturday. Both the bodies had no identification documents on them. While the first body was fully decomposed, the second had several injuries that resembles injuries caused in a motor vehicle accident. Though Colem police inspector Nilesh Dhaigodkar has said that they have registered the first case as an unnatural death and the second one as a hit-n-run case of a motor vehicle accident, the possibility of homicide cannot be ruled out as some murders, in similar fashion, have already been committed in the area earlier. Both the cases show resemblance with earlier cases.  The body recovered on Saturday at Souzamol, Colem, is also similar as it is fully decomposed and has no identification documents on it. Police say the person could have died about 25 days ago. The skeleton-like remains has only a shirt and a short pant on it and by the dress, the police suspect that the deceased could be a man in his forties. In the recent case, a man, possibly in his thirties, was found lying dead near the roadside at Anmod on Saturday evening. The body has several injury marks and the police suspect that he could have been hit by a speeding vehicle and the driver fled away after the incident.  The man had worn a t-shirt and a pant. Police say that he could have been a cleaner on a truck and was knocked down by another vehicle.
