NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: Referring to   and   as two ‘shehzade,’ BJP chief   on Sunday said one looted the nation and the other Uttar Pradesh. People should not vote just to elect an MLA and a minister this election, instead they should vote to change the fate of Uttar Pradesh, he said invoking surgical strike and also promising free laptops with 1 GB data to youths. He was addressing a BJP rally in Sector 44 in the evening.

 “Akhilesh Yadav was sure of defeat and hence collaborated with the Congress and gave the latter 103 seats to contest. The Congress committed scams from space, air, land and water during its government. The SP government also committed scams in making cycle tracks in Noida. What development can we expect from them,” he asked.
 
 Shah also said the BJP will shut down slaughter houses in the state on the first day itself if it comes to power. It will also drive away the land grabbers who are associated with the ruling parties, he said.
 
 Meanwhile, addressing a rally at Khoda Colony in Ghaziabad, Union textiles minister   questioned why, though the SP leaders had promised an investment of Rs 950 crore for improving the level of cleanliness in the state, only Rs 40 crore had been spent so far. 
 
 She also lashed out at the government on law and order, particularly on the issue of women’s safety. She said, “If a woman goes to a police station to file a complaint, she gets raped by policemen in the police station itself, if a girl leaves her house in the morning, her mother is worried that whether she would return safely home in the evening. In a situation like this, the police have been bought by leaders and they have forgotten their job. If you vote for BJP this time, we will recruit 1 lakh people into the UP police force, without asking for any bribe.”
