KOLKATA:   and   lock horns at the   on Saturday, having experienced contrasting fortunes in their last outing in IPL 11. Their respective matches followed a similar script but threw up different results. While KKR failed to defend a 200 plus score to go down to Chennai Super Kings in the last over in Chennai on Tuesday, SRH made heavy weather of chasing down a 148-run target before scampering home off the last ball against Mumbai Indians in Hyderabad on Thursday.

 
 Going into their third match of the season, the bowling unit of the two sides present is a study in contrast. While both Royal Challengers Bangalore and CSK scored more than 170 runs against KKR, SRH kept their opponents – Rajasthan Royals and Mumbai Indians to under 150 runs. SRH bowlers have not only been economical but also picked up wickets — nine (vs RR) and eight (vs MI).
 
 On the contrary, bowling remains an area of concern for KKR’s team management. KKR’s bowling coach Heath Streak indicated on Thursday that changes will be effected in the bowling unit for Saturday’s game. Australian pacer Mitchell Johnson, who missed the last match with a niggle, is likely to return to the playing XI in place of Tom Curran. R Vinay Kumar, who has conceded 65 runs in the 3.5 overs that he has bowled in the two matches, is also likely to make way for one of the India U-19 pacers Kamlesh Nagarkoti or Shivam Mavi.
