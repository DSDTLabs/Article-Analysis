Vadodara: Help has started trickling in for a disabled girl from Godhra who began studying for bachelors of commerce (BCom) degree course at the Faculty of Commerce of M S University here. Moving scenes were witnessed at the faculty when Ayesha Mistry was brought there on Monday by her father on his shoulders.

 Despite not being in a position to walk and hailing from a financially weak family, Ayesha has been nursing the dreams of graduating with a BCom degree before enrolling for the chartered accountancy course.
 
 Ayesha’s father Gulam Mistry does labour work and her mother Amina Mistry sewing work at their humble house in Godhra town. “We don’t have financial resources to let her pursue CA course. But she is insisting on completing her studies,” her father told media persons here on Monday.
 
 Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) councillor from BJP Vijay Pawar and Congress councillor Gulamfarid Lakhajiwala offered Rs2,000 each every month to the girl as aid from the honorarium that they receive. Pawar said he took the decision after learning about the girl’s plight. “It can take care of her commuting expenses. Our Prime Minister takes special care of the disabled; he also promotes girl child’s education and hence I decided to take the step,” he said.
 
 Lakhajiwala said he has been giving aid to the needy from his honorarium ever since he became a councillor. “I will start helping the girl from Godhra too,” he said.
