PUNE:  , a country many technical and engineering professionals from India considered for employment opportunities till now, is also beginning to appear on the radars of healthcare professionals looking to find jobs abroad.

 The officials at the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce (IGCC) and the German   (DAAD) have noticed a shift in trend of healthcare professionals taking up jobs in Germany through their consultancy services.
 
 Although the numbers are still low, more and more healthcare professionals are showing an interest in Germany. Working in their favour is the fact that the European country is currently facing a shortage of professionals in the healthcare sector. Moreover, the scope for growth and attractive pay packages also make it an attractive destination not just for doctors, but also academic professionals.
 
  
 
 “Hospitals and clinics, especially those in the small towns and provincial areas, are looking to hire qualified staff. However, the healthcare sector in Germany is regulated. Before being allowed to work in the country, the Indian professionals need to obtain a licence,” said  , manager (vocational training and recognition) at IGCC. Also, aspirants must acquire at least B2-level of German language skills before they can apply for positions in the country. Nearly 50 healthcare professionals are ready to go to Germany in this year from across the country, revealed Jenninger.
 
 She added, “As a part of the Indo-German collaboration, we are focussing on academic healthcare professionals, mainly doctors, during webinars and information dissemination sessions with the DAAD.”
 
 Devi Katharina Arand, the honorary director of DAAD, said, “The trend of engineering and technical courses is undeniable... but, there is a noticeable number of aspirants enquiring for the healthcare sector.”
