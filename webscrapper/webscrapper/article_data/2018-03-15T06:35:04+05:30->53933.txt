BARRACKPORE: The authorities of Modern English Academy in   on Wednesday lodged an FIR against the   Executive Officer (CEO) of   (BCB) and the board’s civil engineer in connection with Tuesday’s demolition of a portion of the boundary wall of the campus.

 Some 130 ICSE candidates of the school had to wade through debris outside the school gate on Wednesday to take their Hindi examination. A senior school official said, “The cantonment board authorities should not have brought down the wall when the ICSE exam was on. At least 130 ICSE students of our school are appearing from their home centre. On Wednesday, the candidates had to walk through debris to enter the campus.”
 
 When a TOI team visited the spot on Wednesday morning, senior officials of the school, BCB’s civic members and some guardians expressed their anger against the personnel who reportedly masterminded the operation. Though the school authorities claimed the operation was carried out “without any notification”, TOI found a notice outside school’s gate.
 
 According to  , dean of Modern English Academy, “Without serving us any written notice, the men brought in a bulldozer and started demolishing the boundary wall and the students’waiting room.”
 
 BCB sources, however, said, “Whatever we did was for the safety of the students.” Barrackpore commissioner   said, “We have received the complaint and are inquiring into it.”
