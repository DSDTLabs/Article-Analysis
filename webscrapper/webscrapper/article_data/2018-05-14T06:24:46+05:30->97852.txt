BENGALURU:   hasn’t even started, but rain has already become a common feature in the lives of Bengalureans. With pre-monsoon showers almost every day, the city has received double the rain it usually gets during the season.

 The   (IMD) said Bengaluru received 207mm of rain since March 1, a significant departure from the usual amount of 115mm. 
 
 Though the evening showers offered the residents some respite from heat, they often led to streets being flooded, power cuts, traffic snarls and falling of trees.
 
 “There has been extra rainfall this season, and this is due to continued convergence of wind at a lower level, which occurs due to heating of the land. The rain is likely to continue with south-interior   receiving scattered rainfall for the next 4-5 days. Monsoon is expected to hit Kerala by June 1, and then travel upwards to Karnataka,” said C S Patil of the meteorological department.

 The Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre said   received up to 50mm of rain, and Bengaluru Rural recorded up to 40mm of rain. The BBMP control room received 15 complaints about falling trees and branches, largely from areas like Vijayanagar, Nagarbhavi, KP Agrahara, and Malleswaram.
