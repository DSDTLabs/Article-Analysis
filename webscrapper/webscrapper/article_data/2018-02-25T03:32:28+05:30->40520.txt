NEW DELHI: Writing about   in a   group proved costly for a man who has been booked by the   for promoting enmity between two groups and defiling a religion.

 The decision to register a case against the man, who is the admin of the WhatsApp group, was taken after a legal counsel was taken on the complaint. 
 
 The complainant, an advocate with the high court, approached cops in September 2017 after his relative informed him about the content that was being shared on a WhatsApp   he is a part of.
 
 “On a WhatsApp group called ‘Shalin’ that my relative is a part of, a man was constantly putting derogatory content about Ambedkar,” the advocate claimed.
 
 A police officer said that in September 2017, the accused allegedly put derogatory comments and abused Ambedkar during a conversation about castes in the WhatsApp group. The accused allegedly questioned the credentials of Ambedkar and also allegedly made caste remarks from his number. A member of the group raised objection to it and told the complainant, who approached the cops to take action against him.
 
 “On Thursday, a case under Section 153A (Promoting enmity between different groups) and 295 (Injuring or defiling place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class) of the IPC was registered,” a senior police officer said.
 
 The accused, when contacted, said that he made “some” remarks during an ongoing conversation and made those statements in response to alleged abuses that were directed at him by some members.
