CHENNAI: More than 200 residents of Porur, with support of NGO Arappor Iyakkam, gathered to place a 10-point charter of demands to the government for the restoration of   Lake.

 The lake, which has shrunk from 800 acres to just 240 acres in the past three decades, was filled with sewage until Metrowater recently plugged the inflow of waste.
 
 As a desperate measure, Metrowater began drawing 4 million litres of water per day from the lake for supply in Kodambakkam, Valasaravakkam and Alandur zones this month. Arappor Iyakkam state body member   said, “Authorities can't just use lakes for water supply during summer. For a start, at least lakes that are larger than 100 acres must be taken up for restoration.“
 
 Large water bodies in the city include the   lake (440 acres),   tur (540 acres) and Retteri (300 acres).
 
 “We found in an audit that even the Puzhal eri, one of the four city reser voirs, receives se wage inflow,“ Sult han said. In its 10-point demand, Arappor Iyakkam asked that the lake be desilted.Other demands include removal of encroachments, fencing of the lake and strengthening of bunds.
