 "When I make or do any film I don't think of awards or anything. (My films were considered) cheap action comedy movies. I don't care as I am not for awards I am for the audience. Even if my films do well at the box office or not do good, or people watch my films or don't watch my films I will continue to risk my life for every movie," Jackie said.
 
 "They saw (referring to his work) after 56 years I did not change; I was doing the same thing, which is why they decided to give me the Oscar. I think one should continue to do their best always. Oscars came to me and I did not go to Oscars," he said.
