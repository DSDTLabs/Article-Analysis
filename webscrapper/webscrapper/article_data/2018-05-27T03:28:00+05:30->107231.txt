AHMEDABAD: Between November 2016 and February 2017, India reported its first three   (ZikV) infections, all of them from Ahmedabad. The patients were two pregnant women and a 64-year-old man. The health status reports of these individuals and the infants born to the infected women were never made public by the state government.

 A recent report by scientists of the department of health research in New Delhi, the National Institute of Virology at Pune and   at Ahmedabad, a copy of which is with TOI, provides details of the patients diagnosed with Zika infections. The authors reported these details to the British Infection Association and also pointed out that India’s disease surveillance system must be strengthened to report Zika-like infections early.
 
 The first patient was a 34-year-old woman who was admitted to BJ Medical College on November 9 in 2016 and delivered a baby by caesarean section. The woman developed a fever with chills on November 12. Her baby was born at term, weighed 3.7kg and was clinically well, the report states. On November 14, her blood samples tested positive for ZikV and were forwarded to the NIV in Pune.
 
 The report adds that the woman had no rash, myalgia, arthralgia, conjunctivitis, headache, retro-orbital pain, haemorrhage or other classical ZikV symptoms. A follow-up check was done at 3 months of age and the baby’s weight was 6.25kg and there were no indications of microcephaly.
 
 These samples helped the NIV point out that the Indian strain of ZikV may have evolved parallel to the cluster of virus strains in South and Central America (2015–2016) called NIV2017. 
 
 “The partial E gene of the Indian ZikV strain and the African strains (1947–2001) differed by 11.2%, whereas the 1966 Malaysian strain differed by 10.7% from the African stains, indicating that the Indian NIV1720741/1845ZKV genetic sequence may be a more distinct sub-lineage of the Asian genotype,” states the study by Gajanan Sapkal, Pragya Yadav, Rajlakshmi Viswanathan and Devendra Mourya of the NIV and   of the health ministry’s department of health research.
 
 Based on the 34-year-old woman’s reports, wider surveillance was launched and 953 blood samples of patients with acute febrile illness (AFI) were taken and sent to the NIV. Between January 23, 2017 and February 14, the NIV confirmed a ZikV positive case of a 64-year-old man, who had a fever and cough with expectoration and was admitted to BJ Medical College on February 3.
 
 The third Zika infection was found while screening samples from pregnant women. Some 1,180 such samples were tested. One sample that tested positive was from a 22-year-old pregnant woman, at 37 weeks gestation, collected on January 11, 2017. Her child also did not suffer microcephaly, according to officials of BJ Medical College.
