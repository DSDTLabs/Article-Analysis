Jamshedpur: Senior   leader   on Thursday reiterated that his party will build the Ram temple at the disputed Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid site in   by enacting a law if the issue is not settled amicably.

 The Rajya Sabha MP said the possibility of constructing the Ram temple through enactment of a central law exists as his party will attain majority in the Upper House of the Parliament by April next year.
 
 “If the Ayodhya issue is settled through mutual agreement, it is fine, else we have the option of constructing the temple by enacting a law like the Rajiv Gandhi government did in the Shah Bano case,” Swamy said, while talking to press reporters here. 
 
 Urging the Muslim community to support the construction of Ram temple at the disputed site, the senior Parliamentarian said, “The Ram temple can only be built in one place and that is Ayodhya, where Archaeological Survey of India found the structure of the temple during its investigation.” 
 
 Earlier, addressing a public function organised by a social outfit in Agrico, Swamy the said Allahabad High Court in 2003 had made it amply clear that the structure of Ram temple existed at the disputed site. 
 
 “We have been asking the Muslim community to vacate the three sites (namely) Ayodhya, Mathura and Kashi and I hope by 2024, all these three sites will be vacated,” Swamy said.
 
 “I was asked by the Supreme Court to talk to stakeholders concerned that are party in the Ram Janambhoomi Babri Masjid case. I spoke to AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi and Babri Masjid Action Committee convenor Zafaryab Jilani but they did not agree to the bilateral talks. The instead demanded mediation of the Supreme Court,” Swamy said. 
 
 Earlier, at Sonari airport, Swamy said his party will continue to oppose triple talaq as it relates to violation of Article 14 of the Constitution. He also said Uttar Pradesh will progress well under the leadership Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.
