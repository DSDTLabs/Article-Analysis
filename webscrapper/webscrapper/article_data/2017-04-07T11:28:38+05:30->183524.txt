PATNA: The soil purchase scam allegedly involving Bihar minister Tej Pratap Yadav took a new turn on Thursday with chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh calling for details of the purchase of soil worth Rs 90 lakh by the Patna   from the builder of a mall in the city.
 
  “As of now, the government has not ordered a probe as such. Any further action in the matter will be based on the review of relevant documents,” Singh told TOI on Thursday evening.
  
  The issue came to light on Tuesday when former deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi alleged that the zoo purchased the soil excavated from the site of an upcoming mall near Saguna Mor without floating tender. “The land on which the mall is coming up belongs to   of which deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and environment and forest minister Tej Pratap are directors,” he said.
  
  Modi, who is the leader of opposition in the legislative council, said on Thursday even the chief secretary would have to do explaining on the purchase of soil by the interest money generated on the  . For, he said, the chief secretary is the chairperson of the Society responsible for expenditures from the Fund.
  
  “The water resources department had given Rs 337 crore to the forest department for construction of Durgawati reservoir. Later, the Supreme Court ordered creation of a corpus of the funds and utilise the interest generated from it for conservation of forest and wildlife. However, a sum of Rs 90 lakh was withdrawn from the interest amount for purchasing the soil to develop a track inside the zoo,” Modi said, adding chief minister Nitish Kumar should break his silence and order an all-party probe into the matter.
