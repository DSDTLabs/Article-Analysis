Madurai: A one-and-a-half-year-old girl has been found dead under suspicious circumstances inside a water tank on the terrace of a neighbour’s house near Pattiveeranpatti in Dindigul district. The deceased was identified as P Nesiga of Meenakshipuram village, about 10 kms away from Batlagundu town. 

 Nesiga’s father Palpandi works in a grocery shop at their native place, Usilampatti, in Madurai district. The girl was the second daughter of Palpandi-Nagajothi couple who had an elder daughter, Desiga, 3. Police said Nagajothi had been suffering from an ailment. 
 
 As Palpandi could not look after her, she was sent to her parents’ house in Meenakshipuram village. As her health condition worsened, she was admitted to a private hospital in Batlagundu for treatment. Her parents who left the house to visit her in the hospital had left Desiga and Nesiga at home in the care of their neighbours. 
 
 When the children’s grandfather Pandi returned home, he could not find the younger one and searched for her. On being alerted, the neighbours too joined the search. After a long time, the girl’s body was found inside a plastic water tank on the terrace of a neighbour’s house. 
 
 Dindigul district superintendent of police R Sakthivel visited the spot and supervised the investigation. Based on a complaint, a case was registered under CrPC 174 - suspicious death and a detailed investigation was underway.
 
 Police say that the child could not have climbed on the water tank, which is at least five-feet-high, on her own. They suspect that someone could have taken the child there and dropped intentionally or unintentionally
