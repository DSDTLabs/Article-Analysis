 A video has surfaced online, showing Virat and Anushka being the centre of attention of a large group of people gathered outside a shopping store. 
 As fans began taking pictures and videos of the two, Anushka was seen leading Virat out of the shop with their friends. The actress sported a light blue dress paired with sunglasses while Virat looked handsome in his casual attire.
