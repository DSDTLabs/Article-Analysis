THRISSUR: Thiruvambady Sivasundar, one of the most popular captive elephants in Kerala, died on Sunday morning. The 48-year-old tusker was undergoing treatment for impaction for the last 67 days. The elephant was holding the `thidambu’’ (replica of the deity) for the Thiruvambady side in the famed Thrissur   for the last 15 years. With a height of 306 cms   was one of the tallest and majestic captive elephants in the state, and was a highly sought-after tusker for the temple festivals across the state. The elephant was offered to the Thiruvambady temple by the   entrepreneur TA Sundar Menon more than 15 years ago.

 A large number of people from various walks of life thronged to watch the carcass of the Thiruvambady Sivasundar and to pay their last respects. Seven elephants belonging to Thiruvambady were also brought to the site where the carcass was lying and they also paid their homage to the departed tusker. The carcass will be taken to the   areas for post-mortem and cremation.
 
 According to reports, this was the seventh captive elephant dying in the state this year, and the figure will go up to 53 if the data of the last 27 months are taken into account.
