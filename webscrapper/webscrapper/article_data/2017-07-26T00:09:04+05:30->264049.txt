Coimbatore: The city corporation is planning to set up two solar panels at Ukkadam sewage treatment plant and at Kavundampalayam old compost site under the smart city project.

 Corporation officials have already sent a detailed project report to the State government. “We are awaiting the official administrative sanction after which tenders will be called for the project,” said a corporation engineer.
 
 The project, estimated at Rs 11 cr, will involve setting up of two solar panels of 1 MW each. “Earlier, Vellalore dump yard was one of the selected locations, but since the EB sub-station is far from the dump yard, the location has been shifted to Ukkadam sewage treatment plant site,” said an official.
 
 The project, though proposed in 2014, was not implemented due to the lack of funds. “We will be using smart city funds to set it up,” the official said.
 
 Multiple panels of 100-350 MW will be set up at the sites and infrastructure such as powerhouse, protection device and other construction will be undertaken. “Once the project begins, it will be completed within three to four months,”said the official. The power generated from the panels will be sold to TANGEDCO and the electricity bills of the corporation buildings will be compensated.
 
 Officials said if the project is not completed by September, the cost may get escalated due to the goods and services tax and increase in import duty.
