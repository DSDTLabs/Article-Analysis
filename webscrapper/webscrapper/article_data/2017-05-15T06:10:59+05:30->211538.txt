 My earliest tryst with design was as a student at The Future Foundation School, Calcutta. Our teachers encouraged us to explore areas like Origami and  . As I was active in theatre during my high school days, I was used to making costumes, makeups and props. At that time, I wanted to become a neuro-surgeon, but I was always passionate about theatre and arts. In school and college (in early 2000s), we did not know much about industrial design or architecture. There was a general lack of awareness about the discipline as most families wanted their children to become a doctor or an engineer, and may be one or two dreamt of becoming another Satyajit Ray.
 
 Thanks to the Indian Institute of Career Studies, Lucknow, which conducted a workshop at our school, me and my friends realized our “alternative“ potential. Such interactions help students get out of the rat race and yet be successful. So when my dreams of becoming a surgeon did not realize, I ended up studying architecture at IIEST Shibpur (erstwhile BESUS). After graduation, I went on to study industrial design at IDC, IIT Bombay. Currently, I, along with a friend, run a studio 'The Design Thing', where solve problems through design.
