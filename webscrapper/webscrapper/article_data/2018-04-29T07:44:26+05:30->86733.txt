AHMEDABAD: In yet another embarrassment for the city police, a 13-day-old   boy was kidnapped from   campus on Friday. While the cops are clueless about the incident, parents of the infants have lodged a complaint against a suspect named Savitaben who had lured them to Civil Hospital to avail government benefits on child delivery.

 Deputy commissioner of police, Shweta Shrimali, said they managed to get some clues including the CCTV footage of the woman in question, but have not able to trace her till now.
 
 “We cannot divulge more details as the investigation is under way, and this is a sensitive case of suspected  ,” she added.
 
 According to the complaint lodged by parents of the infant, Mukesh Kokharia and his wife Sharda, who belong to Palanpur of north Gujarat, met the woman at Palanpur bus station.
 
 “The woman told them they could get monetary benefits from the government scheme on birth of a child and would have to go to Ahmedabad Civil Hospital to avail the benefits,” said a police official.
 
 Police officials said the couple along with Savitaben came to Ahmedabad on Friday. “While they entered the civil hospital campus, the woman asked them to wait till she comes back after getting the weight of the infant checked,” said a police official.
 
 DCP Shrimali added their team is working on the case and very soon they will be able to get the woman. “We have CCTV footages of the couple moving in the Civil Hospital campus with the woman. We are not ruling out a possibility of involvement of others in the abduction of the infant,” added Shirmali.
