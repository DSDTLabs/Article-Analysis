Merlapaka Gandhi's film ' ' starring  ,   and   in lead roles released today amidst high expectations. Featuring music by  , the film charts the journey of look-alike playboys Krishna and Arjun, both played by Nani. 

 
 
 Krishna is an aimless man from Chittoor, whose only aim in life is to have a girl fall for him. The women in his village despise him but nonetheless, he persists. Arjun on the other hand is a rockstar from Prague that women fall for left, right and centre. Any and every woman he wants seems to fall for him effortlessly. 
 
 Then walk into their lives two women whom they fall in love with. Krishna falls for the city girl Riya (Rukshar Mir) who's a doctor and the sarpanch's daughter. Arjun falls for Subbalakshmi (Anupama Parameswaran) who sees him for what he is, a fraud and a cheater. While Riya falls for Krishna, Subbu refuses to fall for Arjun because she doesn't trust him. 
 
 When both the women head to Hyderabad to their respective homes, with Krishna and Arjun following close behind, the film takes a darker turn right before the interval. 
 
 The first half of 'Krishnarjuna Yuddham' has been a mixed bag of clich√© scenes, cute love tracks, peppy numbers and humorous scenes so far. Krishna's friends and Brahmaji as Arjun's manager provide some much-needed humour in a tale that has nothing new to offer so far. Going to and fro between the tales of Krishna and Arjun is a narrative that might not sit well with everyone. 
 
 The highlights of the first half are most definitely the humour, the foot-tapping number 'Dhaari Choodu' and the refreshing characterisation of Subbalakshmi. While the first half has been an entertaining ride in parts, hinting at a much darker second half, it remains to be seen what direction the film will take.
