HYDERABAD:   may not be life savers always, but if they meet the  , many lives can be saved.

 A proposed bike ambulance service by the Emergency management and research institute (EMRI) would see hundreds of paramedics reach medical supplies and take care of crucial emergency care until a regular ambulance arrives.
 
 The paramedic is expected to reach the accident spot within minutes of receiving information and provide basic first aid and resuscitation to the victim. In this new operation, as soon as the control room gets a call, the call centre staff will assess the traffic situation on that route. If the traffic is heavy for an ambulance to navigate, a bike ambulance will be dispatched. Paramedics on   will actually help save a life by providing critical care before the regular ambulance reaches the spot. “We may roll out the proposal soon,“ Brah manada Rao of EMRI said.Chennai and Bangalore already have bike ambulances operating in the area.
 
 Apart from accident cases, the initiative with   would see paramedics administer first aid in emergencies such as heart at tacks, strokes, poisoning and fire accidents. If the patient needs additional help, he or she would be shifted to a regular ambulance with advanced facilities such as ECG, ventilator, 24-hour UPS back-up and oxygen cylinders.Secunderabad, Mehdipatnam, Banjara Hills road number 1, Begumpet, Tarnaka, Paradise, Punjagutta, Malakpet, Jubilee hills, Dilsukhnagar, Nampally , Khairatabad, Langer house, Amberpet and Charminar are among spots identified as trauma spots based on analysis of calls for ambulance in case of accidents.
