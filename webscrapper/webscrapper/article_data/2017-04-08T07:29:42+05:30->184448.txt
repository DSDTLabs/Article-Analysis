HYDERABAD: The city is in for more rain over the next 48 hours, said weathermen, attributing this to the formation of a trough across the stretch between   and Jharkhand. On Friday, the maximum temperature in Hyderabad dropped to 39.2 degrees Celsius, two notches below last week's 41 degrees Celsius. The total average rainfall recorded through the day stood at 3mm.

 But much like Friday, the rains over the next two days too would be strictly localised, Met officials said. According to the   (IMD), the city will witness partly cloudy skies, with possibility of rain or thunder showers, accompanied by squall, towards evenings.
 
 “The trough extending across western parts of the country has aided the development of convective clouds (rain-bearing clouds). It is now moving inwards towards the state. Under this influence there will be a few isolated spells of rain, but these will abate,“ said Mahesh M  , chief meteorologist,  , a private weather forecasting centre.
 
 Considering these are pre-monsoon showers, Palawat reiterated these rains would only begin during the late afternoon hours.
 
 But while the news of more rain brought cheer to the people of city reeling under extremely hot day-time temperatures, it dashed the hopes of electronics goods dealers who were looking at bet ter profits following the onset of summer.
 
 “Usually , at this time of time last year I sell at least eight to 10 air conditioners every day . But this year, since the weather has suddenly turned cool, people have still not come out in large numbers to buy ACs,“ said  , owner of an Ameerpet electronics store.
 
 Sales executives from   said that they have seen no increase in the sale of ACs so far this year. “And this despite extending various offers. It could either be because of the drop in temperatures or the concern among customers about mounting electricity bills,“ said one of them.
