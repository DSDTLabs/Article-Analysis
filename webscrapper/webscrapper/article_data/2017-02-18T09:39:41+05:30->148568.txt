PANAJI: Travel and Tourism Association of Goa ( ), in its annual general meeting held recently, has decided to unitedly fight the ban on alcohol outlets located within 500m of the outer edge of state and national highways. 

 TTAG has already submitted a memorandum to the chief secretary stating that the apex court’s order does not apply to hotels.
 
 TTAG president Savio Messias told TOI that the issue was discussed threadbare. He said that the members felt that they, along with other associations like Goa Chambers of Commerce and Industry ( ) and trade bodies should take up this issue jointly. Goa’s tourism industry would be affected if the ban comes into force.
 
 At the meeting, the members also discussed the issue of tourist taxis which has remained unresolved for the past many years. 
 
 TTAG along with GCCI and others recently appriached the high court seeking direction to the state government to implement its decision of making digital meters mandatory for tourist taxis. The government kept its decision on hold consequent to protests by the tourist taxi operators.
 
 Among the other points discussed at the annual general body meeting was the amendments to be made to TTAG’s constitution.
