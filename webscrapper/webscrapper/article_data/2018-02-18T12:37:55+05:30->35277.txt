JAIPUR: Ahead of Holi, health authorities unearthed a unit producing substandard   by using skimmed milk powder in Chhitwadi village of Jaipur district on Saturday morning. 

 Chhitwadi is the place which is surrounded by small and big units of mawa, paneer and other milk products which are supplied to Jaipur for consumption.
 
 Early on Saturday morning, food officers reached the area and conducted raids in the units. 
 
 “We have seized 150kg of skimmed milk powder, 200 kg of ready mawa and 100 kg of unprepared mawa,” said Dr  , chief medical health officer (Jaipur I). 
 
 The farm raided by the health department officials is situated on   road with name Rahul Fresh Farm. However, his owner   said, “I kept the skimmed milk power for setting paneer in my unit.”
 
 When the health authorities inspected his firm, they found bags of skimmed milk powder. “The labourers were using the skimmed milk powder. Actually mawa is produced from fresh milk but here they were using powdered milk to produce substandard mawa,” said  , a food safety officer.
 
 He said that there were three containers full of mawa and they were preparing another 150 kg of mawa using powdered milk. Singh said that though the mawa was not adulterated with any harmful substance but it was not the pure form of mawa which is sold to the consumers. 
 
 Officials alleged that selling substandard mawa is a kind of cheating with consumers. They collected eight samples of milk products from Chhitwari area and sent them for testing to government-run laboratory.
