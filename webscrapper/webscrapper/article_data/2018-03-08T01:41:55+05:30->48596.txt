NEW DELHI: The entrance exams for   might be completely   for 2019-20 as   vice-chancellor has set up a special   to suggest recommendations for the process.

 A notification by the varsity on Monday said that the vice-chancellor has constituted a committee to discuss and make recommendation to conduct JNUEE 2019-20 completely online.
 
 However many claim that online entrance may not be a viable option for JNU.
 
 “If the online process is implemented, then students who come from far-off places won’t be able to sit for exams as internet penetration is poor in the country,” said former JNUSU secretary Satarupa Chakraborty.
 
 ABVP JNU unit president Vijay Kumar said, “There should be options for students to sit for both online and offline exams. If the exams are only online, then students with lack of access to internet and computers would never get admissions.”
