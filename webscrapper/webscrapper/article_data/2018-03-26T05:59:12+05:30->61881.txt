KOLKATA: A gang of three armed men forcibly entered a house at  's   and decamped with cash and gold ornaments over 200g worth 2.5lakhs. 

 The incident took place around 7.30pm on Sunday. When the three broke into the house, Swapna Kundu, a homemaker, was alone. 
 
 She was attacked and the three men - in their mid twenties - tried to throttle her from behind when she tried to resist them. The robbery created panic among locals as the area where the incident happened is a densely populated place. 
 
 Swapna told cops that the three were wearing helmets and gloves. They snatched the key and when she tried to raise an alarm they threatened to kill her. Swapna said the three had swords in their hands. 
 
 They entered through the front door as the grille of the house was open as a relative had just left the Kundu's. They even snatched her earring, injuring her. The victim said the three had opened the almirah and left with the valuable within a few minutes.
 
 Swapna's husband is a trader. Cops are trying to find out if the criminals, who robbed the house, were known to the family. Cops are trying to find out if the attack and loot was related to some business rivalry of Swapna's husband. 
 
 According to cops, the theft might have been carried out by known people as they knew when to find Swapna alone. Swapna said she was perturbed for sometime after the three fled.
