GHAZIABAD: The   is likely to decide on the contempt plea filed by city-based environmentalist Sushil Raghav against GDA after the development agency failed to obtain   for its UP Gate to Rajnagar Extension   project.

 The GDA on December 18 last year submitted an affidavit in the NGT admitting that they have still not able to seek environmental clearance from   (SEIAA). “This goes against NGT’s July 2016 order in which it had asked GDA to obtain environmental clearance following which we filed contempt plea” said Raghav.
 
 The GDA said it is working on getting environmental clearance. “The matter regarding seeking environmental clearance is being pursued at the highest level and we hope that just before elevated road project is inaugurated the clearance will be taken” said Ritu Maheshwari, GDA vice chairperson.
 
 The case dates back to 2016, when Raghav filed a case with the NGT alleging that a portion of the 10.3-km elevated road is being is being built on land for Hindon bird sanctuary. Following the petition, the court stayed the work on this section in July 2016 and ordered GDA to obtain environmental clearance from SEIAA within three months.
