NEW DELHI: Nearly three decades after it rocked India's political landscape, a Delhi court this month dealt a final blow to the chances of prosecution trying the   case. In a recent order, ACMM   discharged S K Jain and J K Jain, the alleged writers of the dairies, saying there was no evidence to prove charges of violation of foreign exchange. 

  "There are allegations that the accused S K Jain, J K Jain and Nand Kishore have received any payment from an unauthorised agent or made any payment or for any person by order or on behalf of any person resident outside India but it appears prima facie there is nothing on record to corroborate any of these allegations," the court said while discharging the accused in a case of alleged FERA violations. 
 
  The case was one of the several offshoots of the 'Jain Hawala Diary Case' registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation in 1991. The Enforcement Directorate, too, had registered the case and subsequently charged the Jains for indulging in hawala transactions of Rs 94 lakh.
