CUTTACK: Among those vends located on national and state highways, more than 60 per cent are on Bhubaneswar-Cuttack and Puri regions. The government is in a fix as to how to deal with hotels and restaurants which serve alcohol and are located within 500 metres of national and state highways. 

 "There is some confusion regarding identification of 500 metres from highways. The excise and works departments have been asked to conduct a study and submit a report within one month to get a clear picture on this issue," chief secretary A P Padhi said.
 
 While relocating liquor shops may not be difficult, removing hotels and restaurants could be a next to impossible task, a problem Sethi seemed to be well aware of. 
 
 "It would not be possible to relocate hotels and bars located within 500 metres from highways passing through different cities," Sethi said. 
 
 Hearing on a public interest litigation filed by an NGO, the   had ordered the closure or relocation of all liquor shops located along highways to check accidents due to drunken driving. The court had set April 1 as the deadline and had directed state governments not to renew licences of liquor shops on highways after the time period gets over.
