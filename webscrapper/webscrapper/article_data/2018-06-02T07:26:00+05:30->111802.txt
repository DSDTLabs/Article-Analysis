Ludhiana: The Vigilance Bureau has nabbed an assistant sub-inspector of Salem Tabri police station while accepting a bribe of Rs 7,000. It is alleged that the accused ASI, Kulwinder Singh, was threatening the complainant, Sahil Sharma of Haibowal, with framing him in a case following domestic issues with his wife. The cop demanded Rs 10,000 from him, but the deal was finally settled at Rs 7,000.

 In his police complaint, Sharma said he was having problems with his wife Bhanu Priya, and the matter also reached Salem Tabri police station. Since then, Kulwinder was threatening to frame him on wrong charges. He said the ASI had already taken Rs 2,500 from him, but later started demanding Rs 10,000. The deal was finally cracked at Rs 7,000, and Friday was the day fixed to pay the bribe. As soon as the ASI accepted Rs 7,000 from Sharma, Vigilance officials nabbed him and lodged an FIR.
