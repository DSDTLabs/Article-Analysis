HYDERABAD: Eleven months after many police officers were suspended for alleged links with slain Maoist-turned gangster Mohammed Nayeemuddin, the Commissioner of Inquiries has formally initiated a probe against suspended additional superintendent of police (CID) M Srinivas Rao. Sources said the officer has appeared before the retired Commissioner of Inquiries   at   office. The home department had recently issued GO no.580, entrusting the inquiry against M Srinivas Rao to Commissioner of Inquiries. 

 It is learnt that Inspector General of Police Y.  , who heads the   appointed to probe the case, has furnished all relevant documents before the commissioner. "In next couple of days, a formal inquiry against the cop will begin as presenting officer (government counsel) will present the case before the commissioner of Inquiries," a source said.

 Additional superintendent of police (CID) M Srinivas Rao, ACP Mirchowk Mallineni Srinivas Rao, ACP detective department M Chintamaneni Srinivas, Inspector Kothagudem Rajagopal and Sangareddy Inspector (traffic)   were suspended.
