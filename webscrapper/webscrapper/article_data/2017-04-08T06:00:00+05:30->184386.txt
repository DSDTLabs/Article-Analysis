Visakhapatnam: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has chosen the   (AIR) to broadcast his ‘Mann ki Baat’ programme as it is the oldest, cost-effective and highly credible medium with a vast reach, said union urban development minister   while inaugurating the   regional news unit here on Friday. This is AIR’s 47th regional news unit in the country.

 Addressing the gathering, the minister said post-bifurcation, Vizag has become a major centre for news both in terms of its economic and strategic importance as well as the necessity of having a news centre. “The new regional news unit in   manifests the mandate to inform the people about events, news, schemes and programmes being implemented by the government,” he added. 
 
 Appreciating the news bulletins of AIR, the union minister said, “Unlike a few other media, AIR does not manufacture news but presents as it happened. The media must draw a line between news and views and not present views as news. The regional news unit will strengthen the local dialect, culture and inform people of local happenings.” 
 
 Visakha MP K Hari Babu urged the union minister to set up a   (PIB) office in Visakhapatnam to disseminate information regarding various central government policies and programmes.
