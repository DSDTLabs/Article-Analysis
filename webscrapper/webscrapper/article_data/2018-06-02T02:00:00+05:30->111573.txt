Taking a leaf from rapper Drake’s book, the rock band   have come up with a video featuring a stellar starcast of female celebrities in their latest single titled   featuring rapper  . The track is a part of Maroon 5’s sixth studio album Red Pill Blues and the video for the song is directed by the 'Wedding Crashers' filmmaker David Dobkin.

 The visuals in the song can literally make your head spin, not with the number of celebrities, but by the revolving shots, features famous women from all walks of life including comediennes, YouTube personalities, sports-persons, actresses, singers, politicians and entrepreneurs. Some recognisable names include  ,  , Gal Gadot, Lilly Singh, Ellen DeGeneres, Jennifer Lopez, Mary J. Blige, Elizabeth Banks, Rita Ora and even Levine’s model-wife Behati Prinsloo and their daughter, Gio Grace. The track has a scratchy yet addictive guitar riff running through it and Cardi B, who is the flavour of the season, raps to it in her funky irreverent style that matches the mood of the track. The message on the track is a bit Vanilla when it comes to frontman Adam Levine’s part,which is about bleeding hearts and crying for forgiveness when compared to Drake’s 'Nice For What. However', Cardi, who is the flavour of the season and for a good reason, ups the ‘gangster-ness’ in the song when she raps about wanting to ride in Porsche’s and wear diamonds rather than wait for her Prince Charming to whisk her away in a fancy carriage.
