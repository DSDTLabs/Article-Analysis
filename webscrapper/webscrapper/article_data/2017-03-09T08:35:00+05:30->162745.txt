NEW DELHI: They broke into houses in the pre-dawn hours, held entire families at gunpoint and forced them to hand over valuables. Then, they took the jewellery to gold deposit firms and secured cash loans against the loot. Targeting one house a week in the neighbourhoods of south and southwest Delhi, the gang pulled off 24 burglaries since December last year. 

 Residents conducted patrols with the anti-robbery cell, then laid traps at empty houses. While the burglaries continued, police gathered crucial leads from informers. Finally, a team led by ACP Rajender Singh and inspector Vijay Chandel arrested three of the members.
 
  Additional DCP Manoj C said the trio had been identified as Bharat, Amit and Vikash. All three are drug addicts and had been jailed for three years earlier for property-related crimes, police said.
