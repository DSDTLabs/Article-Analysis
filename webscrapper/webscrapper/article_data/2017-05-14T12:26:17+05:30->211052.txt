LUCKNOW: Bahujan Samaj Party chief   said the party would benefit from the induction of former   Fateh Bahadur. Meanwhile, expelled   leader   alias   was also taken back into the party on Saturday. An ex-MLA from Pilibhit, Ahmad had been minority affairs minister in the previous BSP government and was expelled in 2015 after he accused Naseemuddin Siddiqui of demanding money for a ticket to contest 2017 assembly elections. Speaking to reporters, Ahmad said Muslims were happy with the expulsion of Siddiqui as he had dented the party. 

 Reacting to UP CM Aditya Nath Yogi statement that the ongoing crisis in BSP would have pained party founder Kanshiram, BSP chief Mayawati said if he was so concerned about Kanshiram he should help maintain the memorial constructed in the name BSP founder. “Getting the memorial renovated would be the most appropriate homage to Kanshiram,” she said in a statement.
