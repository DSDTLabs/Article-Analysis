MUMBAI: A 40-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly cheating 10 to 15 people—mostly his friends and relatives— by taking loans from them and not returning the money. What has foxed the police is that the accused, Mehboob  , even conned a car mechanic by masquerading as a realtor and even roamed around in a chauffeurdriven   to lend credence to the fake identity. 

 The crime branch of the city police arrested Siddiqui on Saturday and handed him over to   police station where a case of cheating has been registered. The police said that Siddiqui had taken money from 10 to 15 of his close relatives and acquaintances by making false promises. The duped people also include the bodyguards he hired to bolster his claims of being a businessman. 
 
 A complaint was filed by Siddiqui’s close friend, Abrar  , a Bandra resident, from whom he had taken a loan of Rs 12 lakh in 2015, as he was “in urgent need of money for some eventuality in the family”. Shaikh’s complaint said that Siddiqui never returned the money. “He’s a sweet-talker. Ibelieved him as he was my friend and lent him the money ,” said Shaikh.
 
  “Whenever I asked him to return the money, he kept making excuses.” It was Shaikh’s friend, Asif, who was instrumental in laying a trap and getting Siddiqui arrested on Saturday. Another complainant in the case is the mechanic from whom Siddiqui allegedly borrowed Rs 20 lakh last year. 
 
 “He used to move around in a chauffer-driven Mercedes with a bodyguard in tow and bragged about his real estate business. “He told the mechanic to lend him cash for some urgent need. He said he was to sell the Mercedes and would repay him after he sold it. He even handed over post-dated cheques which bounced,” said a police officer. Siddiqui is now in cop custody.
