NEW DELHI: After PM Narendra Modi’s tough talk, the ministry of corporate affairs is pushing the   ( ) hard to take swift disciplinary action against   who are found guilty in cases where the government has complained.

 The government has complained against some CAs for their alleged involvement in cases related to shell companies, entry operators as well as major violations related to the Companies Act.
 
 Sources told TOI that the ministry had signalled to ICAI (the self-regulatory body for the profession) earlier too, but the response has been poor. “If they do not act quickly, they should not expect much support from the government. The process takes years and our experience has not been very good,” said a source.
 
 On July 1, at a gathering of chartered accountants, Modi had highlighted ICAI’s poor track record on the disciplinary front, saying that during the last 11 years, only 25 CAs had been prosecuted. “Did only 25 people make a mess? And I have heard that more than 1,400 cases are still pending for many years now. A single case takes years to settle. Tell me my friends, is it amatter of concern or not, for such highly qualified professionals?” the PM said.
 
 Sources said following the PM’s admonition, ICAI is also working out a roadmap to clear the perception and even “correcting” the data, an issue that is expected to be flagged to the  . The institute’s top decision making body has been roped in to address the concern, they said. In a message to fellow CAs, ICAI president Nilesh S Vikamsey said that he along with Disciplinary Committee Director recently met Central Board of Direct Taxes chairman Sushil Chandra to discuss “matters of professional concerns”.
