Indore: After verifying identity of Bharat Stage (BS)- III emission norm compliant vehicles that were sold after Supreme Court’s ban, regional transport office ( ) of Indore are now issuing their registration cards (RCs). 

 Regional transport officer MP Singh said that they were issuing around 350 RCs daily as against 200 RCs earlier. “We are putting extra efforts to generate registration cards of BS III vehicles that were sold on March 30 and 31 after the SC’s ban. It is collective responsibility of dealers and RTO to ensure issuance of RC within stipulated period,” said Singh. 
 
 Authorities will also have to ensure that registration of a vehicle is issued within 30 days. But after the SC’s ban and receiving a large number of vehicles’ identities it has become a tough task for RTO officials. And this has made them focus on generating more number of RCs, said sources. 
 
 The dealers of BS III vehicles that were sold on March 30 and 31 will have to ensure that the vehicles’ documents are submitted before April 7. 
 
 Officials said that under the Lok Sewa Guarantee Scheme, RTO has to issue registration of a vehicle within 30 days after its identity is generated by its dealer. “Also the document of vehicles has to be submitted by the dealer at the RTO within seven days after generation of the vehicle identity to initiate registration process,” said an official. 
 
 Thousands of people purchased new vehicles on discounted price, and even city auto dealers managed to generate identities of their sold vehicles by making tax payment online. Following this, on Monday, staff of many auto dealers was seen at RTO office to submit documents including insurance papers of sold vehicles to ensure early issuance of RCs of the vehicles.
