JODHPUR: The Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) has detained four men, including a clerk of the ministry of home affairs ( ), suspected of having extorted money from Pakistani Hindu migrants on the pretext of granting them long-term visa (LTV) citizenship. 

 Following a tip-off, the ACB raided a hotel in the city outskirts and detained the four, including MHA clerk  . The accused men had allegedly been extorting Rs 12,000 from each migrant in the name of helping them procure LTVs.
 
 Sleuths are interrogating the suspects and scrutinising the documents recovered from them. "We are questioning them to verify the allegations. A team from Jaipur has reached Jodhpur to assist in the interrogation," said DIG (ACB) Ajaypal Lamba.
 
  Hindu Singh Sodha, President of the Lok Seemant Sangthan - an organisation fighting for the rights of migrants - said the nexus has three levels and has been active for a very long time. "The local foreign registration office is at the lowest level, followed by the state and Union home departments, respectively. We had brought this to the notice of officials at different levels but no action was taken," said Sodha. "Mishra belongs to the topmost level of the racket, which is the MHA," he added. 
 
 The penalty for delay in LTV renewal by just one day is Rs 2500. The accused, however, had been deliberately delaying the renewals to extort money from the applicants. For every renewal, Rs 12,000 was being charged from the poor migrants, Sodha alleged.
 
 Interestingly, Mishra had been representing the central government at every hearing before the Rajasthan HC in Jodhpur since August 2017, when the court took suo motu cognizance of the LTV issue.
