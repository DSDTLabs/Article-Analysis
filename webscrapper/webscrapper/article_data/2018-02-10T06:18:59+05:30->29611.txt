MUMBAI: In a detailed order accepting the Anti-Corruption Bureau ( ) closure report on police officer   on Tuesday, the special trial court took into consideration the investigating agency report which stated that the combined disproportionate properties of the cop and his wife were only 10% of their income.

  "In view of this fact and in the absence of sanction to prosecute the accused on one hand, and nothing concrete objectionable by the complainant on other hand, the final report submitted by the investigating officer needs to be accepted," special judge D K Gudadhe said. 
 
 ACB had told the court that following a complaint, a probe was conducted and an earlier investigating officer had concluded that Nayak and his wife amassed disproportionate assets to the extent of 1,026%. 
 
 Meanwhile, a special MCOCA court on Thursday disposed of a long-pending complaint against Nayak by Ketan Tirodkar, his former friend, who had accused him of links with the underworld.
