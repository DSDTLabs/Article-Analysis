Setting yet another bad example,   fans lost their cool at the   pre-release event that happened in Vijayawada on January 7. The video of the fans breaking and throwing around chairs at the venue went viral not only in the fan circles but also in news. They allegedly did so because none of the guests on stage for the event mentioned Pawan Kalyan. 

 
 
 Now, fans have been notorious with regard to saying Pawan Kalyan's name on stage in every event irrespective of whose event it is. But this time they went a little overboard with not just screaming out their idol's name, much to the annoyance of  , but also resorting to vandalism. It has only ruined the reputation of the cult that calls itself  . Well, we hope the star speaks up and puts some sense in his followers.
