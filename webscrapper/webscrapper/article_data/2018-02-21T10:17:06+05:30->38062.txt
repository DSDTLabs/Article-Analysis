BENGALURU: A 22-year-old college student on Tuesday put some of the state’s ministers on the mat with a volley of questions — Why aren’t more music concerts being held in Bengaluru? Why do politicians suggest girls stay at home whenever an untoward incident happens?

 Renuka H K of  , drew cheers and applause from fellow students, who were taking part in the Nanna Karnataka (My Karnataka) event attended by ministers Krishna Byre Gowda,   and U T Khader along with Congress state working president Dinesh Gundu Rao, Rajya Sabha member   and MLC Rizwan Arshad. Nanna Karnataka. They had an open dialogue with students from six colleges as part of the Congress’ ‘catch-them-young’ strategy ahead of polls.
 
 Renuka’s questions echoed the general sentiment among youngsters on two counts: one, lack of avenue to chill out. Two, their freedom being curtailed. “The city hasn’t hosted any major concert in recent times. The last big event scheduled was the David Guetta concert last year and it too got cancelled,” said another student.
 
 Tourism minister Priyank Kharge got into the damage-control mode, stating: “We are a dynamic city and are facing many constraints. We are building a MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and events) centre in   and hope to see more concerts in future.”
 
 Renuka picked up the issue of moral policing and asked why politicians adopt a blinkered approach and end up advising women on how to behave or dress. MP Rajeev Gowda said: “Vote for the right kind of people who will safeguard your interests.”
