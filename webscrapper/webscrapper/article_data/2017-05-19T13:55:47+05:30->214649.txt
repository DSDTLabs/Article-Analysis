PANAJI: The All Indian Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has halved the number of   reserved for   diploma holders seeking direct   to second year of the degree programme across the country. This has brought the number of direct admission seats in Goa down to 12 from last year’s 24.

 There are now six seats each available in   and in PES’s Rajaram and Tarabai Bandekar College of Pharmacy, Farmagudi.
 
 AICTE has slashed the quota to 10% in 2017-18 for the pharmacy programme.
 
 Until 2016, 20% seats of any given institute’s total intake capacity for the pharmacy degree programme in first year were reserved for pharmacy   holders in the second year of the course. 
 
 These 20% seats were filled through direct admissions at the second year. The idea was to provide vertical mobility for diploma holders in pharmacy and engineering.
 
 AICTE has slashed the quota to 10% in 2017-18 for the pharmacy programme.
 
 “Until last year, there were hardly any takers for the second year direct admission seats at the private pharmacy college. All students would line up for seats at Goa College of Pharmacy as it is a government college and so the fees is subsidised. We are expecting that the private college seats will be in demand this year due to the change in intake,” said an official from the directorate of technical education (DTE), which fills up the seats.
 
 This year, students seeking direct admissions to second year seats in the degree programme in pharmacy and engineering will have to apply to DTE from June 27 to 30. Admissions to these second year seats are carried out based on the marks scored by students in the final exam of their diploma course.
 
 Students have to have necessarily completed their diploma in Goa to be able to stake claim to the second year direct admission seats.
