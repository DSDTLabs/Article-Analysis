HYDERABAD: As many as four lakh land owners may not get their agriculture input subsidy as part of the   scheme. 

 
 The state government has put on hold 3.3 lakh land holdings due to issues with Aadhaar seeding. In some other cases, details such as photographs were not matching. In another 50,000-60,000 land holdings belonging to non-resident Indians, the state government has said they are not entitled to get input subsidy.
 
 "Of the 57.33 lakh passbooks, 52.73 lakh were Aadhaar seeded, but there are issues with 3.3 lakh accounts which need to be corrected," chief secretary SK Joshi said while reviewing the arrangements for Rythu Bandhu scheme with district collectors on Thursday.
 
 The government is planning to begin distribution of cheques for 4,000 per acre to farmers from May 10. Leaders from other states such as DMK chief   from Tamil Nadu has also been invited to participate in the programme. The chief secretary asked the revenue teams visiting the villages to carry Pahani printouts and address grievances there itself. Joshi said that of the 58.06 lakh cheques, 54.3 lakh cheques have been sent to mandals and the remaining 3.75 lakh cheques will be sent in a couple of days. 
 
 Each district has been sanctioned 2 crore for distribution of   and  . Joshi also asked collectors to provide facilities like sheds, drinking water and campaign to create awareness on distribution of cheques from 7am to 11am and 5pm to 7pm for one week. 
 
 Joshi asked the collectors to obtain farmers' Aadhaar, digital signature and related data and give these too to the farmers to avoid problems with the banks. 
 
 Finance minister Eatala Rajender Reddy said the government has already deposited 4,000 crore with banks to give cash to the farmers and added that another 2,000 crore would be made available with the banks soon.
