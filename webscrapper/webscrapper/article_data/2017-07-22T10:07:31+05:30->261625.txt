JAIPUR: Organisation is the key. This was the mantra   national president Amit   shared with the state BJP during the marathon meetings he presided over on Friday in Jaipur.

 Shah made it clear that the focus during his three-day tour to Jaipur was not on the government but on the organisation.
 
 "Shah said that we should not just plan for the next two years but keep in mind the next two decades. He said that strengthening of the organisation is vital to be able to think much ahead in time,’’ said a senior party bearer.
 
 Shah arrived in Jaipur on Friday to a rousing welcome on his way to state BJP headquarters, where he immediately began presiding over back-to-back meetings with the office bearers and members of various cells of the state unit. He also held separate meetings with the council of ministers and the MPs-MLAs of the ruling party, directing them to lay emphasis on strengthening of the booths. The BJP chief, who has a proven track record of mobilising cadre to deliver crucial victories for the party, sought suggestions from the members on various issues and assured them that they would be worked on.The elected representatives raised several issues.
 
 Addressing the council of ministers, Shah directed them to ponder over how they (as government) can help the organisation. He said that the strengthening of the party at the grassroots level will make state BJP’s `Mission 180’ for the 2018 assembly polls and `Mission 25’ for the 2019 Lok   polls, achievable. Shah also suggested the ministers and the elected representatives to interact with people from different sections and local intellectuals during their tours.
