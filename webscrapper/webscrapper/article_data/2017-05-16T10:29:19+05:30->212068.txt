PATNA: A   ( ) has been filed in the   against   for polluting the Ganga by allegedly throwing seized liquor into the river.

 “Most of the country   in Diara (riverine belt) area and hidden underground in plastic containers are being recovered and dumped into the river by the police,” said advocate Manibhushan Pratap Sengar in his PIL filed on Monday. He has also mentioned one such incident where police dumped county liquor into the river on May 13 in Patna City area.
 
 Thousands of litres of liquor have been destroyed after the police intensified the anti-liquor drive in the state recently following CM Nitish Kumar’s direction in this regard.
 
 On March 22 this year, the Uttarakhand high court declared river Ganga a living entity having the status of a legal person. The central government is already running Namami Gange project of Rs20,000 crore for cleaning the river besides its conservation and rejuvenation. 
 
 The advocate has made central government, Central Pollution Control Board chairman, DG of Namami Gange project, Bihar government, state environment and forest department principal secretary, Bihar State Pollution Control Board chairman, Bihar DGP, Patna divisional commissioner, Patna DM, Patna SSP, Patna City SP and SDPO respondents in the PIL. 
 
 Earlier in the day, CM Nitish also criticised the act of dumping seized liquor into the river. “Not only in Ganga, liquor should not be thrown into any river. It is not acceptable,” the CM said.
