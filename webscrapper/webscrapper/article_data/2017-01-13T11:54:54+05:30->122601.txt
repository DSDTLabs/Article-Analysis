NEW DELHI: South and   including around 120 BJP councillors were detained on Friday morning when they were protesting outside chief minister  's residence demanding release of due funds to the civic bodies. The detained leaders were taken to   in two buses.

 Led by leader of the South Corporation, Subhash Arya, the councilors arrived at Arvind Kejriwal's residence armed with placards and banners. Braving the chilling temperature, the councilors raised slogans against the government. The protesters squatted on the road when the cops did not allow them to move close to the CM's residence. During the protests they were detained and taken to police station.
 
 Subhash Arya claimed that BJP leaders resorted to protests when their repeated requests to meet the CM failed to get them an appointment.
 
 The civic bodies have claimed that the Delhi government owes Rs 2380 crores to the three civic bodies as per the recommendations of 3rd Finance Commission.
 
 The protesters demanded that the government release all dues and implement the recommendations of the 4th Finance Commission.
 
 The cash-strapped North and East Corporations have been trying to pressurise Kejriwal government for funds, which the BJP-ruled corporations say, are not released on time putting the civic bodies in huge financial crisis. The two corporations often fail to pay their employees timely - a group of East Corporation employees are on indefinite strike over unpaid salaries.
 
 The detention drew sharp reaction from BJP leaders. Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari said it is strange that CM Kejriwal is busy campaigning for Punjab polls even as Delhi is facing sanitation crisis.
 
 Tiwari said CM Kejriwal should have directed one of his ministers to meet the protesting councilors.
