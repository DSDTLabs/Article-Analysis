Gurgaon needs an excuse to run. Be it Independence Day, New Year or any other festival, one will find   being organised across the Millennium City to commemorate such occassions. Going by the trend, it was only fitting that the city decided to welcome Valentine’s Day in a similar fashion. On the Sunday before V-Day, city-based running coach Ravinder Singh and a local playschool organised a  s run near Ambience Mall. The idea of the run was to give quality running time to couples while their kids were taken care of by attendants from the playschool. About 50 couples took part in the 5km and 10km runs. The runners also took part in a short warm-up Zumba session that was also organised before the run.

  Poorva and Ankur, who ran together for the first time, said, “It’s our first run and it was a great experience. It gave us a chance to spend some quality time together. A run might not be an ideal romantic outing for many people, but it was certainly a lot of fun.” 
 
  While the couples ran, the attendants from the playschool took care of their kids at an enclosure near the track. Manu Kalra, who ran 5km with his wife Richa, said, “Usually, most couples don’t have anyone to watch their kids when they want to go for runs. But at today’s event, this problem was solved. It gave couples a chance to do something fun together.”
