KOCHI: The   has warned a family court judge for issuing   against a man who could not pay maintenance to his erstwhile partner due to   troubles. It had earlier allowed more time for him to make the payment.

 A single bench of the high court said two explanations submitted by the   judge on the matter were not satisfactory but further proceedings were being dropped with a warning to the judge.
 
 The family court had ordered the man hailing from Elamakkara to pay monthly maintenance of Rs 15,000 to the woman. He was asked to deposit arrears of Rs 2.6 lakh in three monthly instalments in December last year.
 
 He deposited Rs 90,000 each in December and January but failed to deposit the remaining Rs 80,000 owing to financial crisis following demonetization. The high court granted three more months to him on a plea. The man submitted in the high court that a non-bailable warrant was issued against him despite conveying this to the family court during a subsequent hearing.
