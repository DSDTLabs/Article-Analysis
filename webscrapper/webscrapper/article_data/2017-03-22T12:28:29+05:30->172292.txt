VASCO: A poor start in the   came to haunt   as they failed to qualify for the semifinals despite a 2-0 win over Kerala in their concluding league clash at the   in Vasco on Tuesday .

  gave Maharashtra the lead in the 35th minute and   sealed three points in the second session but it was just not enough as   thumped   5-1in another match at Bambolim to grab the final spot.
 
 Maharashtra finished with six points, while Mizoram and Kerala qualified with seven points each. Kerala topped Group `B' with better head-tohead record against Mizoram.
 
 Aaron D'Costa played an instrumental role in the last two matches of Maharashtra's resurgence. The young striker doesn't always score but helps his team with his hard work and ability to find gaps. Significantly , Maharashtra's last three goals have all resulted from Aaron's assists.
 
 Coach Godfred Pereira moved Aaron from the striker's position to right wing for this game and the move paid dividends in the first session itself. Veteran medio Vijith Shetty sent in a long ball to Aaron, who controlled with his right and crossed perfectly to Vaibhav, who headed powerfully past goalkeeper Melbin S.
 
 Maharashtra, however, made the issue safe just before the hour mark through Shrikant whose sublime finish after meeting a cross from Aaron left Kerala with little to fight.
