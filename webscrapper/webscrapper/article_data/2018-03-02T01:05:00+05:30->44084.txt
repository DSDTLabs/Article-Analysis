Madurai: The Alagappa University in Karaikudi, in association with ByShare Company, Gurugram, launched Mobycy, a GPS-based dockless bicycle system in its campus on March 1. It is part of ‘Healthy India’ initiative under Swasth Bharat scheme. Mobycy is an app-based dockless bicycle sharing technology platform which would allow the users - students and staff - to cover short distances by scanning QR code and ride the bicycle at a nominal cost of Rs 10 per hour or on a monthly subscription model of Rs 99 for 120 hours. The new system works through an app and by an IOT-based smart GPS lock which will show all Mobycy cycles in the campus and students and staff can unlock them via the app by scanning QR code on the lock. After riding they can park it sensibly anywhere in the campus. The new system will be very helpful for students to move from the hostel to academic block, from academic block to library, from library to canteen and from canteen to hostel.  This would make the university a healthy and smart cycling campus. The initiative is also a green concept with a vision to make India a cycling country, which would make it greener and help to reduce the environmental pollution, according to university authorities. VC of the university, S Subbiah launched this programme by riding the first smart Mobycy bicycle inside the campus.
