NEW DELHI: Ahead of the April 9 bypolls to the Rajouri Garden constituency, Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee chief Ajay Maken on Friday urged people to vote out “corrupt forces”. At a road show, where he was accompanied by cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu, Maken asked them to vote for Congress candidate Meenakshi Chandela.

 Sidhu appeared to be the main draw at the event. The newly elected Punjab minister shook hands with residents and appealed to them to vote for Congress. Chandela, on her part, claimed: “As a local councillor, I have worked a lot in the area and am privileged to be given the chance to contest the bypoll as an MLA. We don’t want to play the blame game like other political parties, but prove our merit to the public by doing our work.” 
 
 Sidhu asserted that the Congress candidate was on a strong wicket and no force with the might of money and power could defeat her. Slamming the SAD-BJP alliance, Sidhu alleged that the two parties were using the “illegal money” they had accumulated during their tenure in Punjab to finance the bypoll campaign. “Voters have understood the corrupt ways of these forces, and seen through their game plan, and would only vote for the Congress candidate,” Sidhu said, amid cheers from party workers.
 
 Joginder Singh, a resident of Khyala, wasn’t impressed though. “Congestion and lack of parking facility are our biggest problems but none of the parties, be it BJP, Congress or AAP, has ever tried to address them.”
 
 Maken targeted the AAP-led city government for allegedly wasting taxpayer money on self-publicity and foreign trips.
