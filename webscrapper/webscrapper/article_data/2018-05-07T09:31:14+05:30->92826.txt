CHENNAI:   has always been given a raw deal by the   as far as the NEET examinations are concerned. The board has only accentuated its callousness by allotting exam centres at other states for examinees from Tamil Nadu.

 
 NEET-PG 2015 scheduled from December 1 to 6 was affected due to the Chennai floods. Those who were supposed to take the exam on December 2 were asked to take it at Nagpur, Pune and other cities outside the state even before the candidates could recover from the damage caused by the floods.
 
 Many candidates, particularly those working in government hospitals, were unable to attend the exam as leave was not granted to them post floods.
 
 Only six centres were set up in Chennai for candidates across the state and despite protests to create additional centres at Madurai, Trichy and  , there was no response from the government.
 
 In 2016, candidates from the state wanted CBSE to postpone NEET-PG as there was a cyclone alert. However, CBSE refused and when applicants managed to reach the exam centre despite difficulties caused by Cyclone Vardah, the board cancelled the exams at the last moment. The exam was postponed to the very next day and that too got cancelled due to power failure.
 
 Candidates again were asked to write the tests at centres set up outside the state.
 
 G R   from Doctors’ Association for Social Equality (DASE) said it is not incidental but intentional. “This (NEET-UG 2018) is a written test and not a computer-based exam. So, CBSE did not create additional centres despite knowing that there has been an increase in enrolment from the state,” he said
