NEW DELHI: Nearly three months after home minister   launched a portal where people can directly donate money to the families of martyrs of paramilitary forces, the fund has received more than Rs 10 crore.

 ‘Bharat Ke Veer’, the home ministry said, had received Rs 10.18 crore in just over three months which showed that people cared about the families of jawans who die in the line of duty — in Jammu & Kashmir, northeast and elsewhere.
 
 People have been visiting the portal and making direct contributions in the accounts of family members of martyrs.
 
 The main objective of the portal (bharatkeveer.gov.in) is to enable the public to help the families of soldiers by donating money online directly to the individual bravehearts’ account or to Bharat Ke Veer corpus. 
 
  (BSF),   (CISF),   (CRPF), Indo-Tibetan   ( ), Assam Rifles (AR), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF-India), National Security Guards ( ) and Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) are included in the portal. 
 
 The forces have their own fund as well which is given to the families in case of death but junior ranks are particularly appreciative of the initiative, which was taken by Bollywood actor  .
