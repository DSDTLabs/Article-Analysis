DEHRADUN:   chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat’s announcement that his government will withdraw political cases against   members has stirred up a hornet’s nest in the state’s political circles.

 During a function to mark BJP’s 37th foundation day on Thursday, Rawat said that all cases “of a political nature” filed against party members would be withdrawn. 
 
 Though he did not mention which cases would be considered under the category. His words were taken to construe that all cases registered against ruling party members in the last five years would be withdrawn.
 
 Protesting against this,   state chief   said on Friday that this was “a clear attempt by the BJP government to give a clean chit to party netas like Mussoorie MLA Ganesh Joshi, who is accused of heading the protest in which police horse Shaktiman lost its leg”. 
 
 The horse eventually died. “It appears that Rawat has forgotten that he is the CM of the state. Just few weeks are left for the   yatra, the CM and his ministers need to focus on the pilgrimage rather than raking up such issues,” Upadhyay said.
