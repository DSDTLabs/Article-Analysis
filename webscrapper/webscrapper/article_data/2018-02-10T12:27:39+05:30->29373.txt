CHENNAI/CUDDALORE: The ruling   party continued its expulsion spree on Friday by removing more than 500 party functionaries, including two former ministers- G Senthamizhan and Parithi Ilamvazhuthi- in Chennai (south) and   (west), from their primary memberships with the party on charges of indulging in anti-party activities.

 The party convener O Pannerselvam and coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami in a joint-statement said it was decided to sack them for acting against the party’s policies and principles, for tarnishing the image and dignity of the party, and bringing disrepute to the party. The duo directed the party members to sever ties with the sacked functionaries. 
 
 The party on Tuesday had removed more than 200 functionaries on similar charges. The EPS-OPS camp after successfully retaining the party’s name, symbol and flag, has been expelling Sasi-TTV loyalists to consolidate their supremacy over the party.
