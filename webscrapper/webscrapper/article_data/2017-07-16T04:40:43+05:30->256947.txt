MUMBAI: A six-year-old   drowned in a well in   village, Dapoli taluka,   on Thursday night. Incessant rain, rising water level and nothing on the well wall to clutch on to, led to the death of the big cat. The Dapoli forest officials cremated the carcass after pulling it out on Friday morning.

 The Dapoli forest guard Amit Nimkar said, “The leopard came out of the forest area around Shirshinge Marathvadi village in Dapoli taluka of Ratnagiri on Thursday night and was probably chasing a dog, when it fell in to the well that belonged to a villager Kiran Jangam. We got a call on Friday morning and we found the feline dead by then.”
 
 Animal activists say that the district administration and forest department should identify threat prone wells near the forest area and ask owners to cover those.
