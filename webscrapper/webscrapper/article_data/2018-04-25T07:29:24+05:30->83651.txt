BENGALURU: With the mercury rising and outages becoming the norm, citizens are finding it difficult to believe the goverment’s assurances of “no power cuts this summer”. What’s worse, the lack of response from   authorities has left complainants fuming.

  
  
 
 Unscheduled power cuts were reported in Malleswaram, Thanisandra, Vijayanagar, Jayanagar, Hampinagar, Cooke Town, Mathikere, Jakkasandra, Shantinagar, Koramangala,  , Pai Layout and Nagarbhavi on Tuesday.
 
 Ketan Ashok, a resident of Thanisandra, took to   to reach out to Bescom as the authorities didn’t respond over phone. “There have been power cuts in my area in the afternoon for the past three days,” he said.
 
 Vivek S from Sanjaynagar had a similar experience. “Bescom officials don’t answer calls and its helplines are not working, so I tweeted my complaint to them. Regular outages have been witnessed for the past 15 days, and on Tuesday, the area had no power since 3.30pm. This is very inconvenient as it is vacation time and also IPL season,” he said. 
 
 Monish Sharma, a resident of Jakkasandra, complained of both outages and extremely low voltage. “Beginning 8am, either there is no power or the voltage is so low that we can turn on only LED lights. Since I am a freelancer, it is very difficult for me to respond to clients,” rued Monish, who’s thinking of relocating.
 
 The condition is no better in CV Raman Nagar, which is seeing regular power cuts since the onset of summer, claims resident Shweta. “The locality is without power for around two hours every other night. On Tuesday, the power supply was snapped twice, each time for half an hour. However, Becom responded to my complaint on Twitter, telling me the approximate time it would take to resume,” she said.
 
 Bescom officials said power cuts are being caused largely due to feeder problems, work being conducted by   and rain.
