CHANDIGARH: Two Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs from Delhi Col   and   accused the Kejriwal government of poor governance in the national capital and warned the people of Punjab against falling for party’s tall claims.

 Addressing a press conference, Ahmad said he was removed from the Delhi cabinet because he refused to pay Rs 5 crore as demanded by AAP national convener   for retaining the post. “Though he talks of appointing a Dalit deputy chief minister in Punjab, he removed a Dalit from his cabinet in Delhi and has also failed to appoint a single Sikh as minister in sharp contrast to the practice followed by earlier CMs,” said Ahmad.
 
 Ahmad said development in the national capital has come to a standstill. “Not even a single ration card has been issued to the poor in the past one year, nor has he opened two schools since taking over as chief minister. Instead, 400 new wine shops had been opened during his tenure,” said Ahmad.
 
 Col Devinder Sehrawat spoke about the various alleged scams in Delhi, including gutka, liquor, auto permit and odd-even scheme. While the odd-even traffic scheme was introduced to help private cab services, Kejriwal took Rs 700-1,000 crore from the gutka association to backtrack on his promise of banning gutka, he added.
