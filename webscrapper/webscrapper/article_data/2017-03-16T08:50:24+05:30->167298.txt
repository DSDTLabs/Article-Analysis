PUNE:The  , as an eco-friendly measure, is planning to install two electric and LPG-operated   each at various places across the city. 

 A senior official in PMC’s electrical department said the city at present has a total of 13 LPG-based crematoriums and seven electric facilities, besides the traditional open-burning systems. Eco-friendly measures will also be implemented at every crematorium and better facilities will be provided, he said.
 
 One electric crematorium apiece will be set up in Navi Peth and Wanowrie, while the LPG-based crematoriums are being planned at Hadapsar and Mundhwa. The ageing diesel-operated facility in Hadapsar is being overhauled as a part of this project. 
 
 Work is underway in all three facilities — except the one at Wanowrie —and is expected to finish in one-and-a-half years. Work on the Wanowrie facility is expected to begin in April. 
 
 Furthermore, a plan is in place to upgrade the Vaikunth facility, which already has one LPG-based and two electric crematoriums. 
 
 Apart from these crematoriums, the civic body is also planning to install air pollution control systems (APC) at existing crematoriums, in a bid to reduce air pollution. APCs have been installed and are fully functional at 12 places in the city, and serve as an alternative to open-air cremation. 
 
 Explaining the functioning of an APC system, an official said the gas produced during cremation is passed through a water-scrubber where its carbon content gets absorbed, and the filtered gas is released into air. 
 
 The system allows for a 40% reduction in the usage of firewood. APCs are in place at crematoriums in Vaikunth, Hadapsar, Dhankawadi, Katraj, Yerawada, Kharadi and Kailas.
