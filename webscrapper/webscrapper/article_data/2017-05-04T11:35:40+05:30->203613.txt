PATNA: Rodents in dry Bihar have become Bacchus lovers. Or so claimed certain SHOs when asked about the missing stocks of seized liquor kept in the 'maalkhana', or treasury, of their police stations. 

  Sources said the SHOs told senior officers at the district's monthly crime meeting chaired by   on Tuesday that rats had consumed the liquor after nibbling the sealed bottle caps. Many bottles were broken due to carelessness, they said.
