NEW DELHI: Police suspect a gang of children has been targeting   venues in Lutyens’ Delhi for the past few days and fleeing with valuables? CCTV footage of a recently-held function at the   on   shows two kids decamping with   worth Rs 40 lakh. The cops say they are trying to track them down.

 In the footage, one of the kids, aged around 10, can be seen playing outside a room where a bag of jewellery was kept. The child keeps a tab on the number of CCTV cameras installed there and then walks behind a column. He is seen entering the room and then leaving with the brown bag within a few minutes. He walks among the guests carrying the bag. 
 
 Another CCTV footage shows the child walking up to the lobby where he meets his associate—probably slightly older than him. Both of them hurriedly walk out through the main gate carrying the bag on their back.
 
 Police said they could identify one of them. The victim, Dr Saif Hasan Naqvi, who hosted his sister wedding function, said that nobody, including the security guards, had stopped the boys presuming that they were guests. “They wore proper clothes so that we could not distinguish them from others,” said an official at IICC.
 
 IICC spokesperson Wadood Sajid said this was the first time that such an incident had taken place. “We are sure that none from the centre had gone to the private function and it was the handiwork of outsiders. We are cooperating with the police in the investigation.” 
 
 Police suspect the involvement of more than half-a-dozen juvenile offenders in the crime.
