ALLAHABAD: The Allahabad high court has finally cleared the decks for the appointment of 35,000 police constables in the state by dismissing all the writ petitions challenging the recruitment process. With the dismissal of the petitions on Thursday, all stay orders on the declaration of final result of recruitment of police constables stand vacated.

 
 Welcoming the verdict, DGP OP Singh said that it will finally pave way for the much needed addition to police force strength on the ground.
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing petitions filed by   and several others, a division bench comprising Chief Justice   and Justice Suneet Kumar directed that there in nothing wrong if the constables are recruited on the basis of merit and not by a written examination.
 
 
 DGP OP Singh said, “I have issued directions to all police training colleges to chalk out a well-defined training schedule for the recruits so that they are prepared for ground deployment within the stipulated time-frame,” adding that he would soon meet police training college heads to ensure that the required infrastructure to impart basic training to the recruits is in place.
 
 
 The petitioners had challenged the   government’s order in 2015 for direct recruitment of police constables without conducting a written examination.
 
 
 The petitioners had said that as per rules of 2008, police constables were recruited on the basis of a written examination followed by a physical test. The same method was followed in recruitment of police and   in 2013. However, in 2015 the government decided to recruit constables on the basis of merit as per marks in high school and intermediate.
 
 
 The petitioners had pleaded that meritbased recruitment would be harmful as police constables have important duties and conduct investigation.
