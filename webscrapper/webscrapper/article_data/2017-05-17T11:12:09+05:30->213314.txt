COIMBATORE: Employees of   (Tasmac) on Tuesday demanded   from   who had been manipulating the   against the move to relocate   to residential areas to ransack the shops and manhandle them. 

 Earlier, anti-Tasmac protesters had petitioned against police lathi-charge and sought protection from police atrocities against them.
 
 On Tuesday, around 100 Tasmac employees gathered at the district collectorate seeking police protection at their work place. "The public has the right to protest against the liquor shops coming up in their area," said John Anbozhidas, secretary, Tasmac Employees Federation, CITU. "More than 3,000 Tasmac outlets across the state had been shut following the Supreme Court ban on liquor shops on highways. We then took the initiative to find alternate locations to shift the closed shops, using our funds. This is our job," he said.
 
 Pointing out that there were many anti-social elements among the protestors, Anbozhidas said they were the ones destroying Tasmac outlets and assaulting the employees. "Who will protect the employees from the anti-social elements," he asked.
