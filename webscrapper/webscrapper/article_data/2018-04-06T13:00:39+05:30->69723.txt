MADURAI: The Madras high court Madurai bench on Thursday adjourned a plea that sought a direction to the Madurai city police commissioner to register an FIR against actor   in a paternity case. When the case filed by   from   came up for hearing, justice D   adjourned the case by two weeks. Petitioner said he had already filed a plea before the judicial magistrate court in Melur in Madurai seeking maintenance from Dhanush by claiming that the actor is his son. Against it, the actor filed a case before the high court bench. A single judge who heard the case passed order on April 21 last year quashing his (Kathiresan) plea before the magistrate court by declaring that he had not made out a prima facie case for trial and his petition was devoid of merits.
