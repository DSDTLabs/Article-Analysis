RANCHI: Protests broke out on Sunday at   (NH) 43 over the suicide of a class XI student of   (KGBV) Palkot, in Gumla district, who was found hanging in her hostel room on Saturday night.

 Family members of the student and villagers blocked the highway and Gumla-Simdega road and demanded action against the school authorities over the incident.
 
 According to the deceased’s kin, the student was unwell for the past few weeks and had requested school authorities to allow her to go home. However, accountant Anup Bhushan Ekka denied her the leave, forcing her to commit suicide.
 
 District superintendent of Education (DSE) Gumla, Ganauri Mistri, said, “An inquiry has been set up against the accountant and other officials involved in the incident, based on the statement of the deceased’s family.” Mistri added that the accountant was discharged from his duties thereafter.
 
 SP Gumla, Chandan Kumar Jha, said, “An FIR has been lodged. We will be lodging another FIR based on the claims of the protestors. A post-mortem will also be conducted.”
 
 The girl, police said, was a resident of Kharka village and her parents were farmers. 
 
 Meanwhile, school education and literacy department secretary   directed the Gumla deputy commissioner to launch a probe into the case. Patnaik said, “A state level team was formed to conduct an enquiry into the matter. Action will be taken if someone is found guilty.”
