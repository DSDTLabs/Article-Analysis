PATNA: Chairman of All India Anti-Terrorist Front M S Bitta on Saturday urged the state government to increase ex-gratia to kin of   from Rs 4 lakh to at least Rs 25 lakh and a government job for the dependent. 

 “As a respect to martyr jawans of the country, the Bihar government, like other states, should increase the ex-gratia amount and also give job to one of the dependents. Chhattisgarh government gives Rs 1 crore, but keeping in mind financial condition of Bihar, I request the state government to increase the ex-gratia to at least Rs 25 lakh as a mark of respect to the patriotic sons,” Bitta, who is on a two-day state visit, said. 
 
 Bitta also suggested CM Nitish Kumar to come out of the shadow of RJD boss Lalu Prasad for the sake of development of the state. “Bihar has got potential. If one visits rural areas of the state, lush green fields and beautiful roads can be seen. Nitish displayed his courage by enforcing prohibition in the state. He, however, did a blunder by joining hands with a tainted person like Lalu. He should immediately part ways with RJD,” Bitta, who participated in a programme, ‘Kargil Vijayotsava-Amrit Raswandana’ in honour of the martyrs, said. 
 
 Praising Nitish for prohibition, Bitta said he would take up the issue of illegal supply of liquor to Bihar from states like Haryana and Punjab with the governments concerned. “Nitish has taken a courageous step and all states should support him. I would request Punjab and Haryana government to check smuggling of liquor into Bihar,” he said. 
 
 Bitta was all praise for Centre’s effort to tackle terrorism, especially its actions against Pakistan. “We have started giving befitting reply to terrorists. Pakistan has been cornered globally because of steps taken by Narendra Modi government at the Centre and it is a positive step,” said Bitta.
