NEW DELHI: Making is the best way of learning. With an aim on what they call cultural democracy, a group of people have come together to create a platform for artists of all hues and backgrounds. 

 Arts4All (arts4all.in) has started a public art website called TAP (Tracing Art in Public). Tracingartinpublic.com is South Asia's first magazine on public art featuring institutions and individuals from all across Asia. 
 
 
 
 
 As a part of its launch, Arts4All has initiated a long-term art based community engagement at the J.J Colony area of south Delhi. In the Govind Puri slums, artists are working towards community formations, developing skill sets, facilitating cultural exchange and imprating meaningful education.
 
 
 
 Tracing Art@J J Colony is a platform for young artists to enable them know the communities residing within J Colony better and develop long-term projects for a sustainable engagement. The Govind Puri slums, also known as the  , house a complex mix of communities. 
 
 Recently, the launch projects saw artists - Khandahar Ohida, Rinku Chauhan, Sharad Das, Dhrubajit Sharma - engaging with J J Colony for future conversations. Workshop-based formats, installation, games and photography were used as tools of engagement. While Rinku Chauhan made paper planes to discover wind channels in the bylanes, Ohida and Das initiated a conversation through photography, installation and a thonga-making workshop at the Katha Community Center.
 
 The projects culminated on April 2, with a projection and a conversation about public art at the community park. The photographs and videos captured varied reactions and responses of awestruck people. The event was partially broadcast live out of J J Colony on social media (facebook.com/tracingartinpublic).
