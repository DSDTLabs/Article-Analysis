Calangute/Panaji: There were two incidents of bogus voting reported in Calangute constituency on Saturday.

 The first incident was reported at booth no. 11 at Sauntavaddo, Calangute, when a person produced her EPIC details as Nilima Gadekar and voted, using the EVM. Later, another person produced the same details at the same booth for the purpose of voting, but, was objected to by polling agents of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).
 
 “The polling officers allowed the second person to cast her vote as a postal ballot, and said it would be used in case of a tie. We allowed it but under protest,” said an AAP polling agent. 
 
 The second incident of bogus voting was reported in Candolim at the polling booth at St Theresa’s High School. It came to light when a voter came to exercise her franchise and found that her vote had already been cast by someone else impersonating her. 
 
 The vote which had been cast earlier fraudulently was then deleted, and the genuine voter allowed to vote. BJP MLA Michael Lobo and Joseph Sequeira of the Congress said the turn-out was excellent. Lobo said he expects to get a lead of over 4,000 votes. Sequeira said he expects a lead of 2,000 votes.
 
 The third candidate in the fray is AAP’s Godwin Fernandes. Party volunteers manning election booths said they were hopeful silent voters would cast their votes for AAP.
