CHENNAI: An   arrested on Wednesday for sexually assaulting and killing a seven-year-old girl near Mangadu was warned a year ago for stalking a girl in the neighbourhood, investigators have found. 

  S Tashvanth, now 22, had been following the girl to and from college when her parents lodged a complaint with the Mangadu police. 
 
  Police warned Tashvanth and filed a  . After a while, the woman's family withdrew the complaint and moved out of the locality. Tashvanth had been residing in Saidapet and shifted to the apartment complex at Moulivakkam near Mangadu around two years ago. 
 
  His parents told police that he attempted suicide twice by consuming sleeping pills for being denied what he wanted. Tashvanth made new friends in the recent past, ignoring their advice not to get acquainted with strangers, his parents added. 
 
  After moving into the apartment at Moulivakkam, he was reportedly caught stealing a motorbike and cell-phone at a badminton club in Valasaravakkam but no police complaint was lodged, residents of the complex said. 
 
  On Sunday last, Tashvanth lured the seven-year-old girl to his house, promising to let her play with his dog. He then sexually assaulted and murdered her. He stuffed the body in a bag and burned it near the Tambaram-Maduravoyal Bypass. 
 
  When the girl's parents, who'd been out shopping, began a search, Tashvanth called police and pretended to help in the probe. 
 
  After police nailed Tashvanth's role in the case, he confessed. He was booked under IPC Section 211 (false charge of offence made with intent to injure) and 302 (punishment for murder) and under relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.
