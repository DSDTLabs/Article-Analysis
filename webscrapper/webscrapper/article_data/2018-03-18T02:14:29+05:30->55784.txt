NEW DELHI: A quack-turned   peddlar was caught by the special cell on Thursday with one kilo   and two kilos of Alprazolam. The contraband worth   was found stuffed under the seat of a car. The accused was arrested along with his carrier, who used to help him supply the drug from Madhya Pradesh to NCR and neighbouring states.

 Police said they arrested Manohar Singh alias Doctor (31) along with his aide Fakhrudin Rangrej (61) while they were coming with the consignment near Japanese Park in Rohini.
 
 DCP (Special Cell) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav said both men were booked under sections of the NDPS Act. “We got a tip-off about their whereabouts and intercepted their vehicle. On inspection, multiple bags of drugs were found,” he said.
 
 Singh told cops he had a shop where he treated patients without having any valid medical degree. He got into the drug business to augment his earnings.
