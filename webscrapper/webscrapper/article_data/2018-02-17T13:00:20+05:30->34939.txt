CHANDIGARH:   results have students of classes X and XII on tenterhooks. Many who could not score as per their expectation are worried. As stress levels mount, students are approaching counsellors and teachers, which, members of the school management feel, does not augur well for performance in board exams.

 
 According to teachers, pre-boards don't determine actual score in boards. A number of school heads said in more than 50% of cases, students scored much better in boards than pre-boards.  , vice-principal,  , Sector 44, Chandigarh, said students should improve their pre-board performance rather than feeling low. â€œPreboards are a stepping stone to excellent board results. 
 
  
  
 
 It is one of the best techniques for a child to build speed and analyse preparation for the main exams. Some students voluntarily appear for more than one pre-board as they want to gauge their performance and better themselves. One should not feel dejected if marks in pre- boards are low. In fact, one should use this to better results in board exams."
 
 
 
 Principals feel pre-boards give students a feel of the board question paper. "Preboards are conducted at a time when the syllabus has just been completed. After revision, there is much improvement in performance. In fact, pre-board is only meant to give an idea of the time duration and pattern of questions," said  , principal, Brilliance World School, Sector 12, Panchkula.
