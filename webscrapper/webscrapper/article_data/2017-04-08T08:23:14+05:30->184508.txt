 Over the last decade, no repairs were undertaken in the building spread over 40,000 sq ft. GHMC mayor   along with a team of TRS leaders took note of the dilapidated condition, particularly the dome where plaster is chipping off.
 
 "Repairs are likely to be completed by April 21," TRS office secretary and MLC Prof Srinivas Reddy told TOI. This is just in time for the party plenary on April 27. The venue is at a function hall at  , but many party leaders and ministers would be coming to the party office, the need for makeover is being taken up on a war footing. 
 
 Since chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao was busy, a final nod to repairs was awaited and Mayor Rammohan was assigned the makeover task.
