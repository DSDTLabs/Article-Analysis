PUNE : Only six of the 40 MLAs invited mainly from districts with high burden of tuberculosis (TB) attended the workshop-cum-discussion on controlling the diseases held in Mumbai on Thursday.

 The theme of this year’s World Tuberculosis Day (March 24) is ‘Wanted: Leaders for a TB-free world”. “The objective of the workshop was to sensitize the MLAs and get them involved in various TB control activities,” an official from the   said.
 
 Shiv Sena leaders   (Kolhapur), Sunil Shinde (Mumbai), Sangli MLA Dhananjay Gadgil, BJP MLAs   (Mumbai), Raju Todsam (Vidarbha) were among the representatives who attended the event. Pune MLAs Dileep Kamble and Medha Kulkarni were among those who skipped the event.
 
 Minchekar said, “I shared my views on how involving the MLAs can be effective for spreading the message of early diagnosis and treatment.” 
 
 CM Devendra Fadnavis’s narrative — ‘Maharashtra shows the way on how to tackle tuberculosis – including a daily drug regimen and cash transfers’ — published in TOI’s edit page on March 20 summarised that no health challenge is unsurmountable if political leadership, government, officials, grassroots- level functionaries and civil society members join hands.
