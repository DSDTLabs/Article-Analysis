NAVI MUMBAI: The civic body has stepped up pressure against   for its unilateral decision to give two extensions of three months each to 70   under   jurisdiction. 

 NMMC has also made a strong case before Konkan divisional commissioner for being handed over the quarries in its jurisdiction that have been closed or  . The quarries, said NMMC, need to be filled with earth to restore the green cover. (See Box)
 
 Cidco had given three-month extensions to the quarries twice — one in October 2016 and another in December till March 31, 2017 as the lease had lapsed.
 
 Ankush Chavan, additional commissioner, NMMC told TOI on Wednesday that they were not consulted by Cidco even though the quarries are in their area.
 
 “The condition of the hill needs to be evaluated. The civic body is concerned about the air pollution. We have received many complaints about severe pollution in the industrial belt and residential areas caused by suspended particulate matter,” he added. 
 
 The year rolled out on a positive note for NMMC due to Thane collector, Mahendra Kalyankar’s prompt decision to seal a troublesome quarry in Turbhe for violations.
 
 They were bolstered by his quick response to the civic chief, Tukaram Mundhe’s concern about the quarry affecting the health of workers at the nearby dog sterilisation centre. The quarry was temporarily closed since mid-2016.
 
 The Thane collector sought a report of the status of the hill that he sealed and found a fit case to stop the quarrying.
 
 The district mining office said that the ground area of the hill had been fully mined and any further mining would have been a violation of the quarrying norms. Civic officials added there were other violations too — in sub- contracting the stone crushers, mining and processing norms.
