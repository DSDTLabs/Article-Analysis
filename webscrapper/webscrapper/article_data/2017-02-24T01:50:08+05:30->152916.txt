Lucknow: “Agar pradhan mantriji ko Uttar Pradesh itna achha lag raha hai toh kaho adla-badli kar lete hain hum … (We can swap seats if the Prime Minister likes Uttar Pradesh so much),”   chief minister   Yadav told TOI in an exclusive interview on Thursday.

 Yadav spoke to TOI after a long, hard day of campaigning as the Assembly elections in UP crossed the half-way mark, with the fourth phase of polling taking place on Thursday.
 
 “This is the time to look ahead, to plan how to make our campaigning better .. kyunki Dilliwale logon ko UP ki kursi achhi lag rahi hai (those in Delhi are eyeing the hot seat in UP),” he said. 
 
 “The   has been talking about police stations in UP. He is not aware of the Dial 100 system we have launched. No government can offer anything better than this. But, he keeps harping on the state of police stations here,” he added.
 
 Referring to a recent statement by PM Modi, Yadav said, “He is talking about kabristan and shamshan. He is talking about everything other than development. Isliye maine kaha ki agar aapka dil nahi lag raha hain wahan toh adla-badli kar lete hain.”
 
 “The Prime Minister has been doing a lot of “mann ki baat’ on radio and television. I want him to come to UP and talk about work. I want him to ask me what I have done. I am ready to answer, but then, he too has to answer people what he has done. But, he is not interested in talking about work. He has been shying away from mentioning what he has done and that is why they make references to Kasab,” Yadav added.
