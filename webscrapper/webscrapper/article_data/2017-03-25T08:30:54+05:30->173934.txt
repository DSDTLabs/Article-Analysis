JODHPUR: An intensive search operation aimed at tracing links of recent   incident in the city with inmates led to police recovering 14   along with 24 SIM cards from   barracks.

 According to information, a team of 100 policemen carried out a secret search operation at the jail on Friday morning and recovered these items.
 
 Though nothing much has been revealed by police regarding the search operation and findings apart from cellphones and SIM cards, but call records of these phones might lead police to some vital information pertaining to links of inmates with firing incident. 
 
 It may be recalled that some unidentified persons had fired at the houses of a doctor and a travelling company owner on early morning of March 17.
 
 According to an official, this search operation was completely confidential so that the jail inmates could not hide their phones or SIM cards or other objectionable things. Interestingly, previous such search operations by jail authorities or police have not been much successful with recovery of barely one or two phones.
 
 Investigation of the firing case has led police to some inmates who have been operating from jail. Many such incidents of criminals operating gangs, carrying out activities like recoveries, extortion from jail have been brought to light.
 
 A police team from Jodhpur has also visited Punjabâ€™s Faridkot jail after these firing incidents found to be linked with a dreaded jailed gangster namely Lawrence Bishnoi.
 
 The investigation, so far, has led to the conclusion that some outsiders were also involved in this incident, who executed this crime with help of some local criminals who are in touch with inmates in Jodhpur Central Jail.
 
 According to DCP (West) Sameer Singh, police have obtained some vital clues in this case and was about to crack it in a day or two. He, however, refused to share details of the investigation.
