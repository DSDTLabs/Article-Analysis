LUCKNOW: Governor   has taken a serious note of the breach of protocol by two top senior IAS officers who did not turn up at a programme without informing him.   is upset with the two officers and may seek explanation from them.

 On January 25, Governor Ram   was the chief guest at the National Voters' Day celebrations organised by election commission. Chief secretary   and chairman of revenue board,   were special guests at the function organized at UP   in Gomti Nagar. But when Naik reached, he saw that both chief secretary and revenue board chairman were absent and their chairs were lying vacant. 
 
 Governor took note of the breach of protocol as neither of the two officers had informed Raj Bhawan that they were not coming to attend the function.
 
 He made his displeasure known in his address while saying that he had some sweet as well as sour experience.
 
 He said that Voters’ Day was being celebrated to appeal for maximum participation of voters in polling to strengthen democracy but the absence of two senior officers at the event was intriguing.
 
 “This is a bitter experience for me,” he said.
 
 The governor was so annoyed that when one of the two officers tried to explain him on phone, he refused to talk to him.
 
 As per protocol, if the two officers had any other engagements, they should have intimated the Raj Bhawan which may now even seek an explanation from them.
