CHARMINAR: Several months after they applied for   under various schemes, beneficiaries from the Muslim community are yet to get funds from the Telangana   ( ). They are upset that the loans, which the government promised would be released within 15 days, have still not been disbursed to them.

 “I applied for a minority loan in January 2016 and it was approved on July 4. I submitted that proceeding to the Mehidipatnam branch of Syndicate Bank. The bank manager came to my shop later and took details about my business. I made everything clear to him, but I have still not got the loan amount,“ Parveen Begum, a resident of Mallepally , said.
 
 According to the scheme, the amount has to be credited to the savings account of the minority borrower within a period of 15 days by TSMFC.
 
 Angry applicants said they had visited the TSMFC office several times, but officials did not respond to their queries. “I don't understand the working of the TSMFC officials. Instead of replying to my question, they scolded me and asked me to leave. They said I'd get the loan, but when?“ said Mohd Amjad, a resident of Mehdipatnam.
