The horrors of   can never be forgotten, and the play Jis   Nai Dekhya,   (One who has not seen Lahore, has not been born) is yet another piece of art that recreates the tragedy. 
Jis Lahore Nai Dekhya, O Jamya E Nai to be staged at   today at 7 pm and 9:30 pm has been directed by   and is a story of a Muslim family that migrates from Lucknow to Lahore during the partition. They are given a haveli to stay that has been vacated by a Hindi family. All seems well until they find an old Hindi woman staying in the haveli. Set in 1947, it is a thought provoking play that will surely make you uncomfortable.
