PATNA: The special   (NIA) court in Patna on Tuesday issued a production warrant against Umashankar Patel, Motilal Paswan and  , who were allegedly involved in the derailment of   near Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh and an abortive bid to blast the railway tracks near Ghorasahan in East Champaran on the instructions from Pakistan’s ISI. Around 150 people had died in the train accident late last year. 

 The NIA has taken over the case from   (GRP). The police sources said the trio would be produced before the special NIA court in Patna within a couple of days.

During interrogation, they had confessed to their involvement in Ghorasahan and Kanpur incidents. They also revealed their links with Brijkishore Giri and Shamshul Huda of Nepal. Huda is allegedly an ISI agent based in Dubai and said to be the mastermind of the train accidents in India. 
 
 “A letter sent to produce Patel, Paswan and Yadav in the NIA court was received by the Motihari Central Jail on Tuesday,” the sources said. 
 
 Rail SP (Muzaffarpur division) B N Jha said on Wednesday the documents related to Ghorasahan case would be handed over to the NIA on Thursday. “The NIA had already requested the rail police to hand over the Ghorasahan case documents,” he said.
