Trichy: After a week’s gap, the 11th programme of Happy Streets is all set to be back with a bang this Sunday from 6 am to 9 am at BHEL Township (behind Thiruvalluvar Statue) in Trichy.

 The new venue is expected to host record number of participants in Happy Streets as the locals are eagerly anticipating the upcoming programme.
 
 Times of India, with the support of Trichy Corporation and Trichy City Police, kick-started Happy Streets programme at Thillai Nagar 10th Cross Street (west) on February 25.
 
 One of the major attractions at the 11th programme would be an exhilarating showcase of silambam skills by young boys from Suruli Aandavar Martial Arts Academy. The martial arts school, run by a city based police constable, had previously given a performance at Happy Streets a few weeks back which received resounding response from the crowd during the programme.
 
 Like all the previous events, the upcoming programme will also lay emphasis on providing educational sessions, apart from hosting fun contests. Clinical psychologist, D Randeep Rajkumar, would be giving a talk on ‘Strengthening Inter Personal Relationship’.
 
 The talent corner, which has proved to be a platform where youngsters could showcase their talents, would be held this week too.
 
 Also, activities like cycling, skateboarding, yoga, zumba, aerobics and stalls like fitness arena would be hosted and fun zone and reading zone would be set up for this week’s Happy Streets.
 
 BHEL Township will be in fact the fifth venue for Happy Streets programme. While the first three programmes were held at Thillai Nagar, the next three were held at Uzhavar Sandhai Link Road and two weeks each at Race Course Road near Anna Stadium at Khajamalai and Chithirai Street (South) at Srirangam respectively.
 
 The Happy Streets initiative will be conducted on every Sunday over the course of next two weeks in Trichy from 6 am to 9 am.
