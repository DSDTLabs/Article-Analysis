Mapusa: Another monkey was found dead near a school at Patradevi on Wednesday. Locals have raised fears that parts of the dead mammal might have been dragged to residential areas of the village by stray dogs, increasing the risk of Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD). The body has been sent for   testing.

 After two dead monkeys tested positive for KFD on Monday, the health department on Wednesday started a preventive vaccination drive in the villages of Pernem, bordering Maharashtra.
 
 Sources said that so far 13 monkeys have been found dead in Torsem, Mopa and Patradevi along the Goa-Maharashtra border. Panic had first spread about KFD a week ago after authorities were alerted about the death of seven monkeys along the Goa border. Locals said that the monkeys came to Patradevi from the forest areas of Banda in Maharashtra.
 
 Locals said that in Banda about 90 people are suffering from fever and 34 have tested positive for KFD while four are suspected to have died from KFD. Sources said that health authorities in Maharashtra have vaccinated 1,112 people against the disease.
 
 Local panch member Baban Dâ€™Souza said all the dead monkeys have been reported to the forest officials. 
 
 Officials of the health department, doctors and health officials of the Casarvarnem health centre and local panchayat body members started the vaccination drive, in the presence of local MLA and forest minister Rajendra Arlekar. The drive began at the government school in Patradevi where students and locals were vaccinated. Arlekar directed health officials to take necessary steps to control KFD.
