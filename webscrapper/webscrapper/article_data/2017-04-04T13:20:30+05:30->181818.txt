CHENNAI: Former Union finance minister P   on Tuesday clarified the news report about the CBI investigation into the approval given to the Aircel-Maxis transaction.

 The CBI on Monday informed Supreme Court that it was investigating Chidambaram's role in the alleged illegality of permitting Malaysian firm   to acquire 100% stake in   directly and indirectly through FDI in 2006.
 
 "Let me recall the facts that I had stated on many occasions in the past: Foreign Investment Promotion Board ( ) consists of five secretaries of the Government of India. They examine the cases and recommend approval or rejection. They apply the rules/guidelines and submit each case to the CCEA or the finance minister depending upon the value of the investment," said Chidambaram through a statement issued by his son Karti Chidambaram's PRO P Karunakaran.
 
 “In the Aircel-Maxis case, taking into account the face value of the foreign investment, FIPB submitted the case to the finance minister and sought approval. As finance minister, I granted approval in the normal course of business,” the statement said.
 
  
  
 
 "The CBI has recorded statements from every official who dealt with the case. Everyone, including the then secretary and the additional secretary, has affirmed that the case was rightly submitted to the finance minister who was the competent authority to grant approval, and the approval was granted in the normal course of business," said the statement.
