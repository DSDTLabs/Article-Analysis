VADODARA: Vadodara rural police, in a show of solidarity, recently arranged wedding of daughter of one of their class IV employees at the headquarters in Chhani.

 Devendraba  , a class IV employee in Vadodara rural police, had married off her three daughters, but she did not have enough money for the wedding of her fourth daughter. When the news of Parmar’s economic condition reached senior police officials, the department took it up as a responsibility.
 
 According to sources in rural police, the staff at the headquarters was informed to clean up a ground on the campus so that it can be used as the venue for the wedding. Besides cleaning the ground, the department also put up a tent.
 
 “Earlier my three daughters got married, but nobody from the department had remained present. But this time all senior police officials remained present and it felt like the entire family was there,” said Parmar.
 
 Parmar’s husband   was also posted in Vadodara rural police as constable, but he died 26 years ago.
