MYSURU: Efficient management of wet waste and disposal of dry leaves are among the biggest problems that civic bodies of all major cities face. The prevalence of burning wet waste and leaves notwithstanding the awareness initiatives undertaken to inform the public about the adverse consequences of such an action remains a gnawing concern for the authorities.

 Determined to find a permanent solution to the problem, the   (MCC) has launched a unique initiative under which vermin-composting units will be set up at all   across the city. These units that have been built with metal containers will be used for disposal of wet waste and dry leaves, which will subsequently be used to generate compost.
 
 MCC health officer DG Nagaraju told TOI that the units had already been set up at 89 parks in the city. “The city has a total of 189 parks,” he added.
 
 The units are being set up at the corners of the park. “Presently, we are dumping just dry leaves along with micro-agents necessary for vermi-compost production. After a few days, we will get vermin-compost of high quality. This vermin-compost will be used for the trees and plants in the same park. The units will thus serve multiple purposes,” Nagaraju said.
 
 The health officer said that the residents had voiced reservations about the plan since they were wary of the stench. “But we ensured these units would not stink, and cause problems for regular park users. Besides which, we will bring down incidents of leaves being burnt inside the park,” Nagaraju added. 
 
 However, the residents around some of the parks where the units have already been setup are afraid that the units might lead to problems in the long run. “We are afraid there might be problems when the MCC starts dumping wet waste at these units. Parks are lungspaces frequented by the locals and we want the MCC to be scientific in its approach,” said  , a resident of Agrahara, where the civic body has set up one of its vermin-composting units.
