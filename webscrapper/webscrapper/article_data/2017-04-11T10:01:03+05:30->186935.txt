VARANASI:  , an event that was introduced along the lines of Subah-e-Banaras, has become popular among budding artists as it provides them with a platform to showcase their talent. 

 After the success of Subah-e-Banaras that is nearing its 1,000th day, the district cultural committee introduced Ghaat Sandhya from February 1. 
 
 So far, more than 75 dancers, including foreign nationals, have performed at the evening event and over a dozen photographers and painters have showcased their art at the otherwise not-so-popular Reeva and Ganga Mahal ghats.
 
 The evening of the 69th day on Monday witnessed an hour-long performance by noted Odissi danseuse Amrita Adhikary. Photography exhibition by local artist   also attracted large gathering. Earlier on Saturday, Rafaela Tanner, who was first to introduce Bollywood culture to Switzerland, performed.
 
 Chief development officer  , who is the man behind the concept, said, "The city is known for its iconic ghats but only a few of those enjoy the prominence and attention of globetrotters while others lie neglected and remain filthy. The attempt has multiple dimensions providing a platform for upcoming artists in all classical and semi-classical dance forms, promoting tourism, maintaining these ghats and providing a beautiful evening experience to the denizens. Ghaat Sandhya is a larger and a different version of Subah-e-Banaras.
 
 Like Subah-e-Banaras, no artist has been repeated so far at Ghaat Sandhya.
