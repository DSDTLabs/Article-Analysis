BHOPAL: The opposition   on Thursday tried to corner the government in the assembly by asking some tough questions on the money spent for the ' '. 

 Raising the issue during the Question Hour, Congress   Govind Singh asked whether there was any provision in the Indian constitution under which a state government can use people's money for religious yatras.
 
  He further asked the government to specify if there was any such provision, or else, demanded that there should be a high-level probe into the money spent for the Yatra. What benefit the people of MP got from this 'Ekatm Yatra', he asked.
 
 The congress MLA did not stop here and further asked whether Jan Abhiyan Parishad was the nodal agency for the yatra, if yes, he wanted to know the amount of money paid to it under different heads and the details of expenses given by the Parishad.
 
 Replying to the volley of questions, Forest minister Gauri Shankar   said that Jan Abhiyan Parishad was not the nodal agency. Shejwar gave a list of expenses for the yatra amounting to about Rs 10 crore. This included Rs 60 lakh for the inauguration of the yatra, Rs 29 lakh on its conclusion, Rs 47.60 lakh for food and snacks, among other expenses. 
 
 The minister informed that the yatra was jointly organised by the MP culture department and Jan Abhiyan Parishad. Out of the total expenditure for the Yatra, Rs 9.73 crore was spent by Jan Abhiyan Parishad and the culture department spent Rs 5.29 crore. 
 
 Shejwar added that it was not a religious function. Retorting to this,   wondered that if it was not a religious yatra, then why the chief minister did call it one. In what capacity money was spent on sadhus and sants and why the amount expended at the CM house under the Yatra has not been added in it. Minister said the expenses of government meetings would be official and borne by the government.
