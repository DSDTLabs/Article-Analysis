 Khloe said: "What bothers me so much about people, is that I'm giving you guys my workouts on my snaps for free. So what... 
 
 "Why are you still complaining and saying, 'If I had a trainer, if I had a gym'? I don't have a gym! We're doing everything outside, I'm showing you guys how to do the workouts so you don't need a trainer and I'm using stuff that I'm sure you have around the house or ... Improvise!" 
 
 Khloe added that if her fans demonstrated the same level of enthusiasm for their workout regimes as they do for complaining, they'd have no trouble keeping themselves in shape.
