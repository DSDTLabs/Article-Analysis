KOTTAYAM: A section of the  , the   of the   which conducts the Maramon convention, is likely to move the court over permitting   to attend the convention at night. 

 Shiju Alex, a committee member who tried to move a resolution against the age-old custom of convention that bars women from participating in the convention after 6.30pm, said the members will approach the women's commission, the human rights commission and the Centre on the issue. 
 
 "We are trying to meet church head Joseph Mar Thoma Metropolitan. We want the Church to clear its stand or else we will move court," he said. He said several church members and bishops have been favouring the removal of the ban on women. "They say women are not allowed inside the convention area after 6.30pm due to security issues. But the fact is that women sit on the river banks and listen to the talks during night," said Shiju. 
 
 "If the ban has been imposed because of some practical issues the government should be approached to provide sufficient lights and police at night," he added. Fr George Varghese Punnakadu, general secretary of Mar Thoma Evangelistic Association said: "Any talks on this should be held with the high power panels of the Church like the Synod or with the Metropolitan," he said. 
 
 Several women in the church have been demanding for lifting the ban.  , ex-secretary of the Mar Thoma Kudumba Vedi, said: "Why is that the Mar Thoma church, which emphasis on reformation can't change the tradition of banning women at night conventions? Before God, men and women are equal."
