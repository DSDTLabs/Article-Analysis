NAGPUR: A group of NGOs from Amravati and Akola has pitched in to save   (MTR) from MLAs Prabhudas Bhilawekar and Bacchu Kadu, who want to open Kanjoli-Barukheda road in the core for traffic.

 In a representation to chief minister   against opening the route, NGOs Organization for Wildlife (OWL, Akot), Youth for Nature Conservation & Disha Foundation (Amravati), and Nisarga Katta (Akola) have said that   is one of oldest parks in the country with rich flora and fauna.
 
 MTR field director MS Reddy said, “The powers to open the road wrests with NTCA and chief wildlife warden. When there are no rights of people in the area, how can the demand be fulfilled?”
 
 Jeswani said forest officials are well within their powers to close the road for security of wild animals in Wan sanctuary and improvement of wildlife habitat.

 Unfortunately, despite specific position of law, district collector of Amravati directed the forest officials to open the road for villagers of Kanjoli, Ranegaon, Motakheda, Sindban and Golai.
 
 On the contrary, villagers have two alternative routes — one from Dhulghat-Talai-Zari-Hiwarkhed and the other from Golai-Mothakehda-Ranegaon-Dharni. These villagers have never used Barukheda-Kanjoli road.
 
 Moreover, Jeswani added Barukheda-Kanjoli road was previously used for carrying out illegal activities as it was considered to be the safest route for poachers and other like-minded persons and therefore all these facts were not considered by the collector.
 
 Jeswani said that the  , in a petition closing road in Kaziranga National Park, Assam, has issued notices to the Centre asking why vehicles moving on forest road may not be banned.
 
 Moreover, the apex court had earlier refused to lift traffic ban through Bandipur reserve and it was observed that forest primarily belongs to animals. In the present matter, Barukheda-Kanjoli road is not even a state highway.
