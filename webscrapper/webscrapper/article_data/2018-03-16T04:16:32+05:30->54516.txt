NEW DELHI: A woman has lost Rs 25,000 to a gang of   cheats after she was promised expensive mobile phones and laptops as gifts from the UK. 

 The woman, a resident of   in south Delhi, told the police on Tuesday that she realised that she had been conned when the fraudsters demanded more money to release her gifts.
 
 On January 21, the victim accepted a friend request from one of the gang members who introduced himself as ‘Derrick Morgan’ from the UK. They started chatting and after a few days, the man told her that he would gift her an iPhone, a Macbook and an iPod. A day later, she was told that the gifts had been sent and would be delivered to her by a courier company.
 
 A few days later, the police said, she was contacted by a woman who introduced herself as the courier company staffer. She said the consignment had arrived but the victim would have to pay the shipping charges of around Rs 25,000, said the complaint.
 
 After the victim transferred the money to a bank account provided by the company, the woman called again saying £10,000 had been found in the consignment for which another Rs 87,000 needed to be paid. 
 
 The victim then got suspicious and soon realised that she had been conned as the Facebook profile of her friend became unresponsive and the phone numbers of the contact person also became non-functional.
 
 A cheating case has been registered and the police are scanning the phone numbers and trying to get the IP address from which the Facebook profile was being operated.
