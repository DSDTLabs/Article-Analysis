CHENNAI: Even as youth upsurge for resumption of   in Tamil Nadu was in full swing, the Madras high court on Friday rejected a public interest litigation ( ) that wanted the state and central governments to enact a law for the bull-taming sport. 

 Dismissing the PIL that apparently sought to cash in on the current situation, the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice M Sundar said courts could not issue such direction to government or authorities. 
 
 The PIL filed by K K Ramesh sought a judicial direction to the central and state governments to enact a new special law with strict conditions to celebrate eruthuvizha or manju virattu vizha (jallikattu celebrations) in Tamil Nadu. 
 
 Reiterating the need to conduct jallikattu during Pongal, the petitioner submitted that the continuing ban on the rural sport had been having adverse impact on quality cattle population as well as milk availability and supply. He claimed that a representation in this regard was sent to authorities concerned on January 16. He added that a special enactment providing for safe conduct of jallikattu should be ensured by state and central governments as it was their bounden duty.
 
 Since the sport had been conducted since time immemorial, the judicial ban on it should be overcome, the PIL said. 
 
 In  , during the Makar Sankranthi celebrations, jallikattu was conducted and even the chief minister and his family members attended it, the PIL said.
