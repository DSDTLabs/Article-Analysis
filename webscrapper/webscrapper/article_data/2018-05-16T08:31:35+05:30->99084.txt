TIRUNELVELI:   set a   (TNSTC) bus on fire on Tuesday demanding the release of the founder of   and rowdy ‘Rocket’ Raja who was arrested in Chennai last week.

 The miscreants torched a bus plying between Tirunelveli Junction and   (route number 45B). The bus left Tirunelveli Junction around 11.30am and reached Vadakku Thalaiyuthu around 12.10pm. There were only two women passengers in the bus as it was the last stop.
 
 Two men boarded the bus, threatened driver Paramasivam at knifepoint and forced him, conductor   and the passengers to get down from the vehicle. The miscreants then doused the bus with petrol before setting it ablaze.
 
 
 
 Fire and rescue services personnel from a nearby cement factory and from the city rushed to the spot to fight the flames but the bus was completely damaged by then.
 
 Tirunelveli superintendent of police P Ve Arunsakthikumar visited the spot and conducted inquiries. The Thalaiyuthu police said they would register a case. Special teams were formed to nab the culprits.
 
 
 
 The incident took place a day after Raja was produced before a Tirunelveli court in connection with the murder of a college faculty member, Senthil Kumar in the city, few weeks ago. Police, who were granted one day custody of Raja produced him before the court on Tuesday afternoon.
 
 The judge asked him to be produced before the court on May 23, following which he was taken back to the prison from where he was brought to Tirunelveli.
 
 It may be recalled that last year a self-shot video of a teenager threatening the police to release ‘Rocket’ Raja went viral. The boy was taken to the home for children in conflict with the law.
