MUMBAI:  's ruling alliance partner and   chief Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday demanded a loan waiver for farmers in the state, as he congratulated Uttar Pradesh chief minister   for writing off loans of over 2.15 crore farmers totalling Rs 36,359 crore.

 He also aimed a barb at the BJP, saying the UP CM has shown that loan waiver was not just a "chunavi jumla" (poll slogan).
 
 "Yogi Adityanath has provided relief to farmers burdened by loans. I congratulate him for taking a quick decision," said Thackeray, whose party is BJP's alliance partner both in Maharashtra and at the Centre, in a statement.
 
 "I urge (Maharashtra Chief Minister) Devendra Fadnavis to follow in Adityanath's footsteps and announce loan waiver," he said.
 
 While congratulating Adityanath for taking the decision in his very first cabinet meeting, Thackeray also took an indirect swipe at the BJP.
 
 "He has shown that promises are not mere 'election jumla' for him. If there can be a loan waiver in the country's biggest state, why should a pro-agriculture state like Maharashtra be left behind," the Sena chief asked.
 
 The maximum number of farmer suicides take place in Maharashtra, with indebtedness being one of the main reasons, he said, adding Shiv Sena will continue to demand loan waiver for farmers.
