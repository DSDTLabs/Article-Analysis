NEW DELHI: A 30-year-old   and her infant daughter were found dead at their house in east Delhi’s West Vinod Nagar on Tuesday. Their bodies were found hanging from a ceiling fan in their single-room flat on the fifth floor. 

 Police said the woman, Abreena, her husband, Abhay Kumar Singh, and their daughter, Hina, had moved into the flat just seven months ago. While Singh worked at a car showroom, Abreena was employed as nurse in a private hospital. On Tuesday, when Abreena did not open the door for a long time, her husband broke open the door. It is suspected that Abreena committed suicide. But no note was found, an officer said.
 
 Relatives said Singh and Abreena had got married five years ago. It was an inter-faith match. The couple apparently had major differences and often fought, sources said. As their work timings clashed, there were often disputes over who would take care of the daughter. Singh left for work at 8am in the morning and returned by 10pm. Abreena would leave home at 7am and return only in the evening. 
 
 On New Year’s eve, the couple had another of their fights, following which Singh went to his brother’s place at   in  . On Tuesday morning, when Singh returned, he found the door shut from inside. He rang the bell several times and called her number, but didn’t get any response. He forced open the door and found their bodies hanging from the fan.
