Puducherry: The opposition   on Wednesday criticised chief minister V   for his contradictory remarks on lieutenant governor Kiran  .

 Addressing a press conference on Wednesday, AIADMK legislature party leader A Anbalagan said Narayanasamy had come down heavily on Bedi last Saturday for convening a meeting with the police personnel to review the preparedness of the New Year-eve celebrations in the tourist town. Anbalagan said the chief minister had said law and order was the subject of the government and Bedi attempted to run a parallel government by holding a meeting with the police officials.
 
 However, Narayanasamy in a press conference on Tuesday lauded Bedi for extending the necessary cooperation to the government in maintaining law and order during the New Year-eve celebrations, Anbalagan pointed out. He sought an explanation from Narayanasamy for his ‘sudden appreciation’ for Bedi.
 
 He said the chief minister’s contradictory remarks have exposed his ‘changing stance at will’ and ‘double talk’ attitude and revealed that he has taken the people for a ride. He snubbed the government’s claim that the New Year-eve celebrations were by and large peaceful, and charged that there were incidents of violence during the celebrations and several tourists were attacked by rowdy elements.
 
 He lambasted the Congress government for failing to collect entertainment tax from the hotels and event management firms that organised parties on December 31.
