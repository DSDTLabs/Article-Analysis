Last week, the state government issued a notification putting a cap on fares of private tourist buses plying across the state and from cities like Mumbai and Pune to various parts of the country. The notification said that buses can charge 50% more than the normal MSRTC fare. If the normal fare on a particular route is Rs 1,000, the private operator can charge commuters a maximum of Rs 1,500 for the trip.
 
 The new rule will apply to all journeys within the state, including popular inter-city routes such as Mumbai-Pune, Mumbai-Kolhapur and Mumbai-Nashik. It will also apply to inter-state routes such as Mumbai-Udaipur, Mumbai-Goa, Mumbai-Bengaluru among other popular routes.
 
 Harsh Kotak of Mumbai Bus   said due to competition, private operators were charging less than MSRTC buses on several routes. “Does the government want us to charge more by giving us freedom to levy 50% extra ?” he asked.
