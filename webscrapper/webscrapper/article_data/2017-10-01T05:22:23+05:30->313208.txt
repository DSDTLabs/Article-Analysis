MUMBAI: Piyush Thakkar, 23, a Ghatkopar resident, is in alot of discomfort at civic-run KEM Hospital’s ward number 8, but grateful to be alive.

 His relatives hold a newspaper clipping showing Piyush, clad in a red shirt, buried under several others during the   railway station  . ``He was crushed, but look at him today,’’ said his brother Rajneesh who believes he survived only due to fate. ``We both work with a garment dealer and take turns in going earlier to the workshop.
 
 On Friday, I was on the later shift,’’ said Rajneesh on the morning after the stampede.
 
 Piyush has little recollection of how he landed in  . “ remember people falling over me. I possibly survived because I could still breathe air as my face was near the open railings,’’ he said. Piyush has undergone a series of tests, including a chest X-ray and an ultrasound scan, but seems fine, doctors told Rajneesh.”
 
 The doctors said he needs to stay on for a few days at least,’’ he added. Apart from generalised pain on his chest and abdomen, he said he is feeling better than he felt a day before.
 
 The main problem about his daily commute, according to Rajneesh, was the time it needed to cross over from Parel to Elphinstone Road. “This stretch alone takes me 10 to 15 minutes every morning,’’ he said. A software engineer from Dombivli, said one has to factor in 15 minutes for the station-crawl.
