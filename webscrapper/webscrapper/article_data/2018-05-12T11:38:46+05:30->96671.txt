SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister   inaugurated today the first phase of   Expressway Corridor here, which would give a major push to the connectivity infrastructure in the summer capital. 

 The chief minister threw open the first phase of Jehangir Chowk-Rambagh Expressway Corridor from   to Barzalla bridge, an official spokesman said. 
 
 Being built at a cost of Rs 350 crore, the Asian Development Bank-funded project would hugely decongest the traffic on the road towards Barzalla and Srinagar Airport and the time to cover the area would also be reduced by a great measure, the spokesman said. 
 
 "The Natipora limb of the project is going to be made trafficable within two months and the whole 4-lane   spanning more than one-and-a-half kilometres would be made functional by the year-end," the spokesman said. 
 
 The project is being executed by the Jammu and Kashmir Economic Reconstruction Agency (JKERA). 
 
 The project missed the original deadline for completion due to the floods of 2014 and the unrest of 2016.
