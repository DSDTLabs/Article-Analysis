AHMEDABAD: In a video clip that has gone viral, a man is seen beating his wife — his mother joins him in the assault — while the victim’s five-year-old son tries to save her. The clip is from CCTV footage recorded in the Bungalow area of   in Ahmedabad, where the family has been living for years. After the clip went viral, police rescued the woman, on Sunday, and registered a case under the sections dealing with domestic violence.

  According to the family’s neighbours — who did not want to be identified — the victim, 33-year-old Punam Trivedi, was being tortured for quite some time. “Her husband,  , and his mother, Chandaben, would stop anyone from saving the woman by saying that people had no right to interfere in a personal matter,” a neighbour said. “Tushar does not work. The mother and son would often tear their clothes and rush to the police alleging torture by Punam.”
 
  Some who know the family of the woman said that   used to force her to sleep with another man and would beat her if she resisted. However, this detail does not figure in the FIR lodged by the victim at   police station. The investigation has been handed over to assistant commissioner of police, G Division, J P Raol. “Chandaben was arrested from Kubernagar on Sunday evening and teams have been despatched to nab Tushar,”   said. “We are probing the case and will try to ascertain whether Tushar forced his wife to sleep with another man.”
