If you want your hair and skin to shine and glow like the Japanese in the summer heat, explore   soon. You are probably eating them if you are a big sushi fan. Kombu, nori, wakame, arame, and sea palm are all superb sea vegetables to include in your daily summer fare. They are high in calcium, iron, phosphorous, and race minerals and vitamins. The Japanese swear by sea vegetables — also known as seaweeds — since they have 10-20 times more mineral content than vegetables grown on land. You could chop, crush and mix any kind of dried seaweed into your salads, soups or gravies. While nori’s fibre makes it a perfect sushi wrapper, kelp is a great source of iodine and gives relief in arthritis.
