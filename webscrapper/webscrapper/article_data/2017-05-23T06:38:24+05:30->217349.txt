HOWRAH:   was turned into a fortress on Monday to thwart any effort by   to even come close to the state secretariat, even as multiple layers of barricades were put up across the city along the protesters' routes.

 Over 1,000 policemen, including   personnel and special combat force officers, were deployed at Nabanna and its surroundings. Security was tightened up at all the approach roads leading to   with police barricades.
 
 However, amidst all these arrangements, even before the official start of the demonstration from 1pm, five CPM MLAs -Asok Bhattacharya, Manas Mukherjee, Anisur Rahman and Tanmay Bhattacharya, led by Sujan Chakraborty , managed to reach the north gate of Nabanna around 12.10pm. Chakraborty wanted to enter the secretariat, saying he was an MLA and had the constitutional right to do so.
 
 The cops were initially hesitant to stop the MLAs, but they soon swooped down and arrested them and pushed them inside prison vans.
 
 They were taken to Shibpur police station and released later. “We had come to meet the CM, but she has fled Nabanna as she is afraid to face the common man,“ Chakraborty said while courting arrest.   was at Birbhum, where she had gone to hold an administrative meeting.
 
 Vidyasagar Setu was closed to traffic from 1pm onwards, as Nabanna is located close to Vidyasagar Setu. The way to Nabanna was blocked by a layer of barricades including steel railings. The CPM supporters tried to force their way to Nabanna at Hastings, as the road to the secretariat via Vidyasagar Setu was completely sealed. The police force was ready with water cannons and tear gas shells to prevent any rally from reaching Nabanna.
 
 It was a normal workday for Nabanna employees as they had reached much before any trouble broke out.
 
 Minister Partha Chatter jee, who was at the secretariat for some time, said the CPM had lost its credibility and was enacting a “drama“ .
