Panaji: In an affidavit filed before the high court of Bombay at Goa, the state government stated that “there is no space available at the court premises in Panaji” to establish a circuit bench of the National Green Tribunal(NGT). The government filed a reply following the high court’s suggestion to consider housing the circuit bench in Panaji at the court premises. The high court is hearing a suo motu public interest litigation regarding the transfer of Goa cases from NGT’s Pune bench to New Delhi. The government stated that presently no space is available, either at the old district court building or at the Spaces building at Patto. The existing courtrooms from the Velho Filho building will be relocated to the district court while all seven floors of the Spaces building are occupied, the government stated. The government has sought a withdrawal of the interim stay granted by the high court on the government’s notification. Defending its stand to shift Goa-related cases from the NGT Pune bench to the principal bench in Delhi, the Goa government argued that Pune was “proving to be logistically inconvenient and a significant financial strain on the public exchequer of the state of Goa”.  Director of environment and member secretary Goa Coastal Zone Management authority (GCZMA) Parag Nagarcenkar stated that there are only two flights that connect Goa to Pune by air and only two return flights, thus requiring litigants, advocates and government officers to spend a minimum three working days before returning to Goa. He pointed out that the state doesn’t have any official accommodation in Pune. It was proposed to shift the territorial jurisdiction in respect of the state of Goa to New Delhi primarily because New Delhi is vastly better connected to Goa via air .
