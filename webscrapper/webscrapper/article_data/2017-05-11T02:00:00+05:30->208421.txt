PATNA: Patna   Sanjay Kumar Agarwal has asked the district education officer to make a fresh annual calendar for government schools in the district with provision of summer holidays in May.

 The DM issued the directive in response to a representation made by the Patna Division Primary Teachers’ Association on Wednesday. The association has urged the DM to roll back his order to schools to shut from May 14. 
 
 The government schools were earlier scheduled to close for summer vacation from June 6 to June 26.
 
 Association secretary Prem Chand said the DM advanced the summer vacation due to heatwave conditions, but now rain and thundersquall have lashed the city. 
 
 Prem said the monthlong Ramzan fast would begin from May last week. “If vacation starts early, it will end by June first week and cause inconvenience to the children and teachers of minority schools, who observe fast in June,” he said.
 
 Some teachers, who have already made travel plans according to the annual calendar, find it hard to reschedule their plans. “I have booked return tickets to Pune where my son and daughter-in-law reside. I will not get tickets for earlier dates now,” said a teacher.
 
 The DM said the minority schools or madarssas were free to make changes, but other schools will shut from May 14. “As for the current weather condition, it is temporary,” he said and added the fresh annual calendar would have scheduled summer vacation from May.
