Trichy: In a major anti-encroachment drive, the state highways (SH) removed more than 200 illegal makeshift shelters and evicted various vendors from either side of Vayalur road, near here, on Wednesday. Traffic was hit hard when the 30-foot-wide Vayalur main road thinned down to 20 feet along many of its stretches after people set up shops on roadsides.Vayalur main road is the fourth stretch where the SH was forced to go on an eviction drive, after Palakkarai, Thanjavur road, Karur bypass roads. With the road seeing a heavy number of illegal shelters choking the traffic, SH officials closed down vehicular movement along the stretch from Puthur 4 road junction to Bishop Heber College. This particular 500-metre stretch was the worst affected on Vayalur main road, forcing the authorities to declare it one-way, a couple of years ago. The officers resorted to earthmovers to remove the illegal makeshift shelters and other forms of encroachments including steps extending to footpath and in some cases to the road. Meanwhile, traders have complained against the move, claiming that the state highways did not give any information before carrying out the drive. “We have set up shops on the property that belongs to CSI Diocese which are not encroachments. Moreover, we were not informed about such a move,” said Chandrasekar, a shopkeeper on Vayalur road. However, an assistant engineer from the state highways department said that SH has given out verbally communicated on the eviction. “Oral instruction were given to these shopkeepers a week ago. And that is the enough for us to carry on with the drive,” he said. “Letter is served only if there is any building that needs to be demolished. What we see here is that most of the encroachments were in the form of sunshades and makeshift shelters,” the official said.
