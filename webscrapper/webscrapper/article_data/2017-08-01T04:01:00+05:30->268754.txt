Bengaluru: The Congress MLAs from Gujarat, who are in Bengaluru to save their flock from BJP, chose to entertain themselves by throwing a birthday party for the son of their colleague Kaminiba Rathod. Rathod’s son turned 10 years old on Monday.

 Rathod is accompanied by her husband and two children — her daughter and son. According to sources, the birthday boy started his day by spending time at ‘Wonderla’, an amusement park in Bidadi and close to the resort where the MLAs have been put up. The family had come to Bengaluru to shop for the boy on Sunday.
 
 Karnataka’s energy minister, D K Shiva Kumar, who is looking after the Gujarat legislators till they return to Ahmedabad on August 8, gave a gift to the boy. “Our minister did not buy any gift. He removed the gold ring which he was wearing on his finger and gave it to the boy,” a party source said. 
 
 According to sources, the legislators spent time discussing strategies for the Rajya Sabha polls. Plans for taking them out either to Tirupathi or Mysuru or Madikeri will be made on Tuesday, they added.
