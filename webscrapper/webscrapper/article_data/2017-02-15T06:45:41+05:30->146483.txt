HUBBALLI: Relatives of   Santosh Hosamani, who died here on Tuesday, and fellow sportspersons alleged that the tragedy occurred due to the negligence of the district administration and doctors at KIMS. His sister Laxmi said that Santosh was alright till morning. “After his conditioned worsened, the doctors gave my brother two injections after which he fell silent,” she said.

 She said when Santosh’s condition worsened, he asked for a plain paper and a pen. “I don’t know what he wanted to convey,” she said. 
 
 Santosh’s mother Shantavva and other relatives were inconsolable after hearing about the demise.
 
 Tense situation
 
 Tension prevailed when wrestlers and well-wishers gathered near the mortuary, demanding Rs 25 lakh compensation, government job for Santosh’s brother and an ashraya house for the family. 
 
 There were heated arguments between assistant commissioner   and others officials who were present at the spot. Relatives and friends threatened to stage a protest in front of the deputy commissioner’s office in Dharwad. They demanded that the DC give in writing, promising fulfillment of their demands. 
 
 Over the telephone, police commissioner   spoke to Sharief Nadaf, who was leading the agitation and assured him of fulfilling the demands. Karjagi, after talking to DC S B Bommanalli, announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh. Later, the idea of protest at the DC’s office was dropped. Karjagi said that a case has been registered and police will follow the routine course of inquiry.
 
 Tough guy, says coach
 
 Santosh’s coach   termed the incident unfortunate. 
 
 “We lost an emerging wrestler who had the potential to reach the highest level. We lost a tough guy due to the negligence of the district administration and doctors at KIMS. It’s hard to digest that Santosh died due to leg injury,” he said.
