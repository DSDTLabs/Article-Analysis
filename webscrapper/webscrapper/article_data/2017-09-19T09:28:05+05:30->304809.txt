KOLKATA: Step into a food plaza at any major railway station in the east during the Puja and enjoy a complimentary drink or dessert with the meal you order. The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation ( ) has also planned a special menu for passengers of Rajdhani and Duronto.

 IRCTC has directed the managers of all station food plazas to do up the outlets in a way that gives customers a feel of the celebrations associated with the Pujas. 
 
 “We have also instructed the food plazas to prepare special and traditional items during the Puja. The staff have been directed to greet customers and wish them appropriately. Similar directions have been given to vendors serving food through e-catering. We have also made preparations for special on-board menus at the base kitchen in Howrah. Last year, we served a special menu on the Rajdhanis for the four Puja days. This year, this will be extended to more trains from Howrah and Sealdah,” said Debashis Chandra, group general manager (east), IRCTC.
 
 The five trains where special meals will be served are the Howrah and Sealdah Rajdhanis, the Howrah and Sealdah Durontos to New Delhi, Howrah-Yesvantpur Duronto Express, Sealdah-Puri Duronto Express and the Howrah-Digha AC Express.
 
 On Saptami, passengers will be treated to shahi murgh/paneer korma, moong dal with green peas and ghee, sultana pulao/rotis and ice cream. On Ashtami, the menu will be chicken/paneer rezala, dal makhani, sabz pulao/roti and ice cream. On Navami, passengers will be served murgh do pyaaza/matar paneer, mix dal, peas pulao/roti and ice cream. On Dashami, they can dig into makhanwali murgh/paneer, chana dal with coconut, ghee bhaat/paratha, gulab jamun and ice cream.
 
 “We shall also ensure that more officers are on duty to deal with any complaints and to check that the food is being cooked, packed and served in a proper manner. Passengers can call up the IRCTC control room at 9831074006 if they require any assistance,” Chandra added.
