KOLKATA: The Centre has warned the   government about the increased activity of terror group Jama'at ul Mujahideen   ( ), specially in the state.

 The state government received a communique that given the anti-terrorism action being taken in Bangladesh, JMB is shifting its focus to West Bengal and planning a huge terror attack.
 
 According to the intelligence report, the terrorsists' aim is to target Bangladeshi intellectuals who were granted asylum in India. Many of these itellectuals now reside in the state and the terrorists hope to send a strong message to the Bangladesh government by killing them.
 
 The report mentions four to five districts which the terrorists are likely to target, as they're believed to be mostly active in districts like Nadia, Murshidabad, Birbhum and North 24 Parganas. 
 
 Recently, a connection was been detected between JMB and   (IS). The arrest of IS terrorist Musa has confirmed this claim. 
 
 One name is suspected to be on JMB's hitlist is that of Faridpur's cartoonist Sunnyur Rahman. 
 
 In 2013, Rahman was attacked for drawing a cartoon of Islamic fundamentalists. Since then he has been hiding in West Bengal in fear for his life. But this has not silenced the Sunnyur's voice or his pen. He continues to write against the fundamentalists from his hideouts.
