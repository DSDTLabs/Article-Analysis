Vadodara/ Anand: For the first time after the Patidar agitation was launched in the state,   (PAAS) convenor   will visit Patel-dominated Charotar region of   this week.

 During his visit, Hardik along with PAAS team will visit Sardar Patel’s ancestral home in Karamsad town of Anand district on Thursday.
 
 Hardik’s visit to Karamsad will be symbolic as the Patidar agitation hasn’t created much impact in the twin districts of Anand and Kheda.
 
 During his visit, he will garland statues of Sardar Patel, Vitthalbhai Patel and   (Bhaikaka), who had laid foundation of education town Vallabh Vidyanagar.
 
 “Farmers of Sardar’s ‘karmabhoomi’ had played a pivotal role be it in the Kheda Satyagrah of Bardoli Satyagrah. On March 2, we will urge the residents of Charotar to join the fight against the injustice done to Patidars in a big way,” said PAAS spokesperson Atul Patel, adding that during his visit Hardik will also meet residents of the town.
 
 When asked about the poor response that the agitation has received in the Charotar region, he said that Patidar youths in Charotar always wanted to contribute to the movement.
 
 “But the ‘dabang netas’ of Charotar were harassing the Patidar youths by putting pressure of them. After 25 days of group meetings and ‘khatla parishads’, we are confident that the agitation will aggressively move forward in Charotar region,” he said.
 
 PAAS workers have also started group meetings with different communities to arrange for a grand welcome of Hardik when he reaches Karamsad.
