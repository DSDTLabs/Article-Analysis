All the elected representatives are part of our society, just as each one of us. So, the kind of   we elect in a way reflects the kind of society we belong to. This means that if we want an efficient, powerful and honest leader, it has to start from us.
The only way for this is through our votes, where we should demonstrate that we, as a society, are evolved and wish for great, compassionate leaders. This is the fundamental reason why we all should exercise our right to vote. We should vote, because that is the most powerful tool to get an honest and responsible leader to represent us, and do what is needed for the betterment of our people. And such an opportunity comes only once in five years. So this time, let’s not miss out on this chance. Let’s   for our future and for our country. 
 When it comes to my first time voting, I remember being excited about going with my family to choose a leader. I was fortunate enough to have my parents guide me as far as the election process and the idea of voting for the right candidate was concerned, when I was very young. I hope every teenager gets the right guidance for the same as they need to understand the importance of their vote.
