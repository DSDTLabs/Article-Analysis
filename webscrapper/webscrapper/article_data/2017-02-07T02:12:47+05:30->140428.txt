CHENNAI: This is the second time the AIADMK is electing a chief minister who has not been active in politics. In 1987 it propped up Janaki Ramachandran as chief minister following MGR’s death. But her government lasted only for 24 days.

 Like V K  , Janaki too was not an MLA and had not addressed even a single public meeting before becoming CM. Another parallel in the political history of the country is Rabri Devi, who was elected CM of Bihar in 1997 after her husband   was forced to resign when warrants were issued against him. Though Narendra Modi too was not an MLA when he became CM of Gujarat, he was active in politics for many years.
 
 When Janaki took charge as chief minister, the then assembly had only two years to complete, but now, the 15th assembly has more than 4 years to go. “As per the Constitution, Sasikala has to win from an assembly constituency within six months of becoming CM. Nothing stops her from becoming CM,” said a former AIADMK minister.
 
 “Rabri Devi was also pulled out of her kitchen to occupy the CM’s post. All through her tenure, it was Lalu who was controlling the administration. But in Tamil Nadu, Sasikala is in control. But the moot point is that in the last election, people had voted for Jayalalithaa and not anyone else,” advocate and political analyst Ravinthran Thoraisami said.
 
 Sasikala’s will be the sixth cabinet in the last two-and-a-half years. Jayalalithaa was the chief minister when she was convicted in the disproportionate assets case in 2014. O Panneerselvam replaced her, only to be replaced again by Jayalalithaa in 2015 after she was acquitted. In the 2016 assembly election, once again, Jayalalithaa was sworn in as CM. On her demise, OPS got yet another turn to occupy the hot seat, only to step down now for Sasikala.
