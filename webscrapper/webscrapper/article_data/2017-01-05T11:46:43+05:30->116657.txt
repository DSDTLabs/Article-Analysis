BHUBANESWAR: The arrest of Tapal Pal and   - two top   leaders - in connection with the   chit fund scam seems to have given the opposition Congress the ammunition to go after the ruling BJD. 

 The Congress alleged the   has been going soft on some BJD leaders, whose names have been doing the rounds in other chit fund scams.
 
 "There is a growing public suspicion that the CBI probe, which had gathered pace in the beginning of May 2014, has become sluggish. Though several big shots of the BJD are involved in the scam, the CBI has not yet brought them under its purview of investigation," Congress state president Prasad Harichandan alleged.
 
 Harichandan claimed the BJD must have struck a secret understanding with the BJP at the Centre to escape the CBI guillotine.
 
  The Congress state president alleged the CBI probe mysteriously lost pace ever since it questioned Saroj Sahu, a close aide and office staff of chief minister Naveen Patnaik, in connection with the Seashore Group scam in November 2014. 
 
 "Naveen himself had attended a chit fund company's function in Bhubaneswar and promoted its illegal business. CBI should arrest Naveen," Harichandan demanded. 
 
 The BJD, though, denied the charges. "The allegations are baseless. Such illogical statements may hamper the CBI probe," said former minister and BJD spokesperson, Rabi Narayan Nanda. 
 
 Some BJD leaders came under the scanner in the chit fund scam ever since the CBI took over the probe following a Supreme Court directive on May 9, 2014. 
 
 The BJD's Banki MLA Pravat Tripathy and Mayurbhanj MP Ramachandra Hansdah were arrested in two separate chit fund scams in 2014. Subsequently, the ruling party's Dharmasala MLA, Pranab Balabantray, Choudwar-Cuttack legislator Pravat Biswal and Balasore MP Rabindra Jena were also quizzed in the scam, adding to Naveen's discomfiture.
