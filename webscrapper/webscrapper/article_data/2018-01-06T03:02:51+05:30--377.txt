Actress Jennifer Lawrence said her parents never threw her a birthday party when she was growing up. 

 According to a report, Lawrence was asked to recall her favourite birthday party in an interview, however the Oscar winner said she never had one before she was famous. "Definitely my 25th birthday when my friends surprised me with Kris Jenner holding my birthday cake. I don't want to sound like -- I know that's a famous person story -- but when I was a kid my parents would be like, 'It was your birthday yesterday'," Lawrence said. "We didn't have like parties, so my only birthday parties are after I'm famous, so s**k my d**k," she added.
