CHANDIGARH: The   (EC) has set its sights on ensuring an 85% turnout for the February 4 assembly elections in Punjab, a 6.4% rise from the 78.57% mark of the 2012 polls. 

 Punjab chief electoral officer (CEO) V K Singh said given the growing voter participation in the previous elections and the responses to campaigns run by the election department, it was expected that the turnout would be higher than previous years and, so, they had kept the voter turnout target at 85%.
 
 From 65.14 % in 2002, the voter turnout in Punjab assembly elections jumped to 75.45% in 2007. However, for   elections in the state, the figure was 70.04% in 2009 and 70.89% in 2014. “Apart from special voter-registration camps, the election department has focused on setting up model polling stations. In some cases, voters aged more than 80 have been facilitated. The department tied up with educational institutions to cover young voters,” the EC official said.
 
 At the same time, an election official said on condition of anonymity that cent percent voting turnout was not possible due to discrepancies in voter data and because electoral rolls could not be updated in real time to take stock of recent deaths and floating population. In 2014 the parliamentary elections, there were 1.96 crore voters. After Aadhaar-based screening, nearly 4 lakh votes were deleted from rolls as the people had died
 
 First-time voters in the 18-19 age category had been of key focus for the election department and a special campaigns was carried out to bring them on board. The projected population for 2017 of the state is 2.96 crore. Of this, there are 1. 99 crore voters in the state.
 
 Punjabi singer Gurdas Maan and Olympics Gold medallist   have been identified as Punjab state icons for the Systematic Voter Education for Electoral Participation (SVEEP). About 666 campus ambassadors have been appointed in all districts of Punjab to focus on the enrolment of young electors. Voter awareness and facilitation centers have been set up in all districts.

 The poll percentage for women (79.10%) was higher than men (78.09%) in the 2012 assembly elections. The 2014 Lok Sabha election in Punjab too had 70.33% men cast their vote, while the figure for women was 71.11%.
