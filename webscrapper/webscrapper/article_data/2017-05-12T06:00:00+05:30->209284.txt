"Eedu teneteegatho teene sheeshane nakinche rakam,” says   describing the protagonist, Radha Krishna at the end of the film’s trailer. Loose translation: He is one of those cops who can con a honey bee into licking processed honey from a bottle. When we asked   to explain the analogy, he laughs saying, “Let’s just say it’s not one of those typical cop characters who beats the goons to pulp while spewing long winding punch dialogues.”
This cop is a rather peculiar character. “So this guy revers Lord Krishna from childhood and believes that policemen are like gods themselves because they fight evil in the society. Just like how Lord Krishna, he doesn’t believe in fighting himself but delivers justice by playing mind games,” explains Sharwanand elaborating about his role in Radha which is releasing today. The actor, who’s on a roll with back-to-back hits like  ,  ,   and Express Raja, is confident that Radha will live up to the expectations surrounding it. 
 Set in the backdrop of Rajamundry, the film has a love story as well. “Yes, the cute love story between me and Radha ( ) will give the audiences plenty to laugh about. It’s a complete commercial entertainer, that will leave the people in splits,” he says signing off.
