VADODARA: Soon, each and every area earmarked for police patrolling in city will see regular visit from the cops. 

 To ensure that the patrolling teams don’t skip their regular routes, the   has decided to initiate an innovative attendance system. The new system called e-patrolling will be placed in almost every area in the coming days. 
 
 “We have several patrolling teams, many of which go out during nights. The new attendance system will ensure that all the patrolling units visit each and every spot assigned to them. The idea is to improve police presence on the streets and bring down the crime,” said Manoj  , city police commissioner. Policemen on patrolling duty will have to register themselves on the system with their smartphones. Plates with QR codes will be installed at different spots including residential colonies in the city. 
 
 The cops will have to register there with the help of their mobile phones. “We will be installing 380 attendance plates at different spots of which 130 have already been finalized. Once the attendance is registered, our system will show the time, date and location of the particular cop,” Sashidhar told TOI. The cops will have to turn up for attendance after every couple of hours. 
 
 The city police currently has 49 patrolling teams and Sashidhar recently started an initiative to start night patrolling on motorbikes. Through this initiative, the police hopes to bring down the burglary rates in the city that are highest in the entire state. Also, gangs of   and   have been targeting senior citizens and women in regular periods.
