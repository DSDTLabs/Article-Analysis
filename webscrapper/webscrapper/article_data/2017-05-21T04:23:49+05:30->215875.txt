RAJKOT: Four persons, including noted history-sheeter Bhupat Ahir, were sentenced to eight years imprisonment in connection with an   of diamonds worth Rs 13.06 lakh and   six years ago on Saturday.

 Additional sessions judge M J Parashar of Bhavnagar, convicted Ahir, Bharat Dangar, Sayyed Shabbir Hussain and Ashish Patel. The judge also acquitted two persons   and Haresh Raiyani for want of evidence against them.
 
 “Of the eight accused in the case, four got convicted, one Bhavesh Dangar died during trial and one Krishna Bihari never got caught. He is still absconding,” said public prosecutor Vinay Kumar Oza, who along with government pleader Vipul Devmurari argued the case on behalf of the government.
 
 According to case details, the loot happened on April 24, 2011, when Jeevan Patel of Gujarat Angadiya was going on a motorcycle with his colleague in Bhavnagar town. The duo was intercepted near Nirma Bazar crossroads by Ahir and other accused in the case who were armed with iron pipes and a pistol. The accused attacked Patel and his colleague and snatched the suitcase containing diamonds worth Rs 13.06 lakh. They later fled the spot after firing from a country-made revolver.
 
 Patel then lodged an FIR against the accused who were booked for attempt to murder, criminal conspiracy, assault and under the Arms Act.
 
 According to Oza, the trial took a long time as Ahir had jumped bail and was absconding for some time. He was recently arrested.
