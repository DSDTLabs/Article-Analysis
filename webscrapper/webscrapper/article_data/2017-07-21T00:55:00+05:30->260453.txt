Udhagamandalam: As many as 18 families living in low-lying areas of two tribal villages near   have been shifted from their houses after flash flood, triggered by heavy rain, inundated the area on Wednesday. At least 50 members from these families have been given shelter in a nearby school and they were provided with cloth and food.

 The district administration swung into action after some houses in the tribal villages of Thenvayal and Iruvayal were flooded following the downpour. “The two villages are located in low-lying areas near Gudalur. As some houses in the area were flooded, 18 families were shifted to the government high school at Putthurvayal,” R Dinakaran, revenue divisional officer (Gudalur division) told TOI.
 
 Dinakaran also said precautionary measures were being taken by the district administration. “The Nilgiris district administration has formed special teams to monitor the situation in Gudalur taluk. However, rain has subsided on Thursday,” he added.
 
 Gudalur received 192mm rainfall, Devala 204mm and Naduvattam 186mm rainfall from Wednesday 8am to Thursday 8am. Schools and colleges in Gudalur and Pandalur taluks remained closed on Thursday as the Nilgiris collector declared a holiday for them.
 
 Meanwhile, Kurumba tribals requested the district administration to find a permanent solution to the issue as their villages often get flooded in the monsoon season. “We request the Nilgiris administration to recommend the state government to provide us permanent houses, considering our dire state during the monsoon season,” they said.
