 The VMC had been mulling to take up metered water supply since 2013, but the effort has not been successful so far. It has now decided to give metered water supply all fresh connections that are provided in the city. This will be done once the general board clears the proposal.
 
 Providing metered water was a part of reform that the civic body had promised for getting funding under  . The civic body had also zeroed down on networks of four water tanks to provide metered water supply.
 
 It was in March that the VMC had moved a proposal for metered water supply, but the standing committee had asked the administration to come up with a detailed policy in this regard. The policy was drafted and forwarded to the general board by the committee on Thursday.
 
 Under the policy, the VMC aims to install meter on all water connections. The civic body will provide bills every two months and will take action if any kind of tampering is done with the meters. The rate for metered water supply range from Rs six per kilolitre (kl) to Rs 18 per kl for households depending on the usage. It will be higher for other kinds of properties.
