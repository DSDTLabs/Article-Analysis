Surat: When the residents of Daman are preparing for the bandh on April 15 to protest against the Gujarat high court’s remark of merging the Union territory into Gujarat, the opposition Congress feels that the Modi government could decide on the merger as the Goa, Daman and Diu (Opinion Poll) Act, 1966 has been repealed. 

 The Goa, Daman and Diu (Opinion Poll) Act enacted in 1966 was repealed sometime in 1987 when Goa became a state with the enactment of new act—Goa, Daman and Diu Reorganisation Act, 1987. This, the opposition Congress, feels that the Modi government is cashing on to merge Daman and Diu into Gujarat.
 
 The issue of merging the union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu is not new. It was in 1966, that a similar demand of merger of the union territories of Daman, Diu and Goa was raised during the stint of former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. 
 
 The then President of India gave his assent to the Goa, Daman and Diu (Opinion Poll) Act on December 16, 1966, after it was passed in both houses of the parliament. 
 
 January 16, 1967, was chosen as the date for the referendum. There were 388,432 eligible voters. A total of 317,633 votes were polled. Three days were allotted for the counting. Around 54.20 per cent voted against merger whereas 43.50 per cent voted in favour. 
 
 Thus, despite the Hindus’ numerical superiority, Goans rejected the merger with Maharashtra by a vote of 172,191 to 138,170. 
 
 President of Daman-Diu Pradesh Congress Committee (DDPCC), Ketan Patel said, “The opinion poll act has been repealed, so there is no option left with us to challenge the merger in the court. The reorganization Act for Goa, Daman and Diu enacted in 1987 is enough for the ruling party at the Centre to pave way for the merger of Daman into Gujarat.” 
 
 Patel added, “Despite of the judicial barriers, the people of Daman are all prepared to oppose the merger.”
