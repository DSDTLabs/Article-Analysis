THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister   has lauded the young woman by terming the   she took as an   But many felt it was time for the government to seriously look into why a woman, who had been facing persistent sexual abuse ever since she was a child, did not try to approach available grievance systems to deal with the issues.

 According to Dr Mohan Roy, consultant psychiatrist, medical college hospital, more than an act of bravery, the girl's action could well be an act of desperation.
 
 “This is something a person does when pushed to a corner. We don't know for sure whether it is an act of bravery of desperation,“ he said.
 
 The doctor also said that in his experience, he had noticed that rape victims often did not raise their voice when someone in the family or close to the family are in the perpetrator's role.
 
 “More than the will to see their violators punished, they are driven by the thought of losing a guardian.Perhaps they believe that the shelter homes under the government can never be a suitable replacement for their guardians,'' the doctor said.
 
 Noted human rights lawyer   too echoed the thought. “Such acts are done out of lack of faith in the system,“ Sandhya said.This is because in majority of cases, justice is not delivered promptly.
 
  Victims and their families, who take the legal course are often forced to wait for years and go through several ob stacles before getting the justice.There is no wonder if a victim thinks that they would not get justice if they take the legal course, even if they are legally aware,“ Sandhya said stressing the fact that the victim in this case was a law student.  , secretary of Sakhi, a NGO for women, said we can change the laws but not the attitude." 
 
 Changing the attitude must be the focus when we desire to bring in a positive change'', Aleyamma said.
