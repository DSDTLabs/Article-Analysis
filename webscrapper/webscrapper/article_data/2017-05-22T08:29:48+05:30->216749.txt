MUMBAI: Nearly 4,000 kaali-peeli taxis have gone off the road as the RTO has not renewed their vehicle fitness certificates on the grounds that speed governors hadn't been installed on them. The devices are mandatory for all cabs in the state. A L Quadros, leader of Mumbai Taximen's Union, told   on Sunday that 22,000 kaali-peelis were in Mumbai, and 4,000 less means an 18% reduction at one go. The latest number, 18,000, is a far cry from about two decades ago, when the city had 63,000 kaalipeelis. "We are filing a petition in the high court for a stay on the transport commissioner's directive on speed governors," he said. "We are also seeking compensation from the government for losses incurred by kaali-peeli drivers and taxi owners."

 He alleged that transport department officials did not "apply their mind" in issuing the directive on speed governors. "First, there is a shortage of speed-limiting devices in the market. Second, it's not possible to install the gadgets in all taxis overnight."
 
 The union has sought three months to fit taxis with the devices. A transport official said, "The union wants more time, but this is not possible. We cannot make any changes to the rule. The Centre has amended motor vehicle rules and made speed governors mandatory for taxis."
 
 A transport expert said, "The number of kaali-peeli taxis in Mumbai has been dramatically falling decade by decade. The reasons have been permit freezes, drivers' migration to   and  , and now the speed device issue."
