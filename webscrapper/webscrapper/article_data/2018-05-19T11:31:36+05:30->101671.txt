 CHARMINAR: Seeking justice for victims of the 2007   blast and harsh punishment for the perpetrators, members of   o Shahadat (DJS) protested outside the mosque on Friday after the prayers.
 
 
 However, policemen dispersed them. Eleven years after a bomb ripped through   mosque, killing nine namazis, an NIA special court, in April, acquitted all five accused.
 
 “Terror outfits carried out blast in Mecca Masjid 11 years ago. Later, innocent people were taken into custody on suspicion and they were tortured. Surprisingly, a man who had owned up to have committed the heinous crime and others have walked free in this case. The NIA team has totally failed to prove the evidence against the accused,” said Mohammed Bin Omer, JDS organizing secretary.
 
 Earlier, city police commissioner   took stock of security arrangements for holy month of Ramzan and assured tight security.
