AHMEDABAD: A team of EMRI 108 in flood-hit   district on Sunday came to the rescue of a 22-year old woman, who was in need of medical attention as she had given birth to a girl child recently. Her stitches had started swelling and her condition was worsening. 

 "A team from Diyodar hence rushed to handle the emrgency. There was no way the ambulance could reach   village near  , where the woman - who was bed-ridden since four days - could be reached. The ambulance was stationed near river Banas after which the staff took a boat to cross the river. Since there were no motorable roads, the paramedics had to walk 8 kms to reach to the patient and provide her the aid,"  , Banaskantha,   said.
 
 EMRI officials said the team has attended to over 400 emergencies in past fortnight during the rain fury. "It includes 20 child deliveries and also treatments of snake bites and drowning. Most of the areas are still not accessible by vehicles and thus we are trying to keep the mobile teams ready that can reach the spot on feet. Ambulances deployed at Palanpur, Tharad, Vav, Dihodar, Suigam are worst-hit, but we are reaching out to maximum emergencies," Jetavat said.
