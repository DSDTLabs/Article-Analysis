  : Sixteen students from the   at   had to be rushed to the local health centre for treatment, after they complained of stomach ache shortly after consuming the midday meal at the school on Wednesday morning. While 14 were discharged after they received medical attention, two others were admitted to the Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital at Bambolim for further treatment. Their condition is stable, according to authorities.
  
  Director for education G P   said that the self-help group (SHG)   from Porvorim, which served the midday meal, has been suspended until the inquiry against them is completed.
  
  Bhat said that the SHG serves meals to around 800 students from three schools based in Porvorim. While one school,  , refused the meal as the vegetable preparation served as part of the meal was found to be stale, the other school, Vidya Prabhodini, did not accept the meal as their final examinations were on.
  
  Bhat said that no inquiry will take place against officials from the Government High School at Alto Betim as, on inquiry, education officials found that the teachers at the institute had indeed tasted the meals and the meal was not found to be stale at the time of tasting.
  
  Students began complaining of stomach ache at around 11am on Wednesday.
  
  “Two samples of the meal have been collected by the Food and Drugs Administration, which will carry out further investigation,” Bhat said.
  
  Meanwhile, alternative arrangements have been made to supply midday meals at all the three schools where the suspended SHG used to provide meals.
  
  The directorate of education on Thursday is set to hold a meeting to discuss strengthening of the midday meal monitoring system in the state.
  
  Porvorim constituency MLA and revenue minister   also visited the Government High School at Alto Betim along with education officials to make inquiries into the case.
