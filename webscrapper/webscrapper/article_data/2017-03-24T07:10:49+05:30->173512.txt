 Paying tributes to the trio, student activists called upon the Punjab government to throw open the place to public, which was used by freedom fighters for nearly six months in 1928-29 and where Shaheed Bhagat Singh had shorn off his hair to change his appearance. Family members of some freedom fighters also participated in raising the demand and said it would be a tribute to those who fought for independence and the new generations would come to know about the sacrifices made by them.

 Ferozpur resident Rakesh Kumar, who is spearheading the campaign for getting the building declared as a protected monument, said that, “We have been making efforts to ask the state government to take over the hideout and convert it into a museum. Activists of PSU and NBS undertook a campaign for nearly a month, under which they visited hundreds of educational institutions to mobilise students for putting pressure on the government.”
 
 Kranti Kumar Katiyar, who is son of Bhagat Singh’s companion freedom fighter Gaya Prasad’s son, reached from Kanpur to participate in the movement. He said that, “My father Gaya Prasad had rented the house in 1928 to use it as a secret headquarters of  , though he had shown it as a pharmacy. He had rented the home from Lekh Raj under the fake name of Dr B S Nigam. For me, this small house is much more than any pilgrimage. I wanted to see this to be converted into a museum in my lifetime.”
