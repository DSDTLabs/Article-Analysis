Ahmedabad: A city-based group planned an elaborate welcome for the birth of a calf at a farmhouse in city outskirts on Tuesday evening. The same group, led by businessman  , had organized a lavish and elaborate wedding of his cow with a bull last year where the cow was decked in sari and gold jewellery.

  
  
  “It is my love for the cow progeny and our wish to spread the message to save the cows that we had decided to welcome the calf as if it were our own child. According to our culture, the ‘parents’ of the bull, natives of   village in   district, came with laddoos as the calf named   has completed one month,” said Parsana.
 
  
  The event took place when the central and state government are vociferously supporting the protection of cow progeny and formulating stringent rules against cow slaughter. Parsana said that he wishes to bring together persons from all religions to celebrate ‘gau-mata.’
