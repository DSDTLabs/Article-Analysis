NAGPUR:   Aluminium Research Development and Design Centre (JNARDDC) from city, in collaboration with the Maharashtra Remote Sensing Application Centre (MRSAC), is developing an app for large-scale   on bauxite and laterite deposits in Maharashtra. 

 The two institutes, with support from the   (GSI), will be using their existing information on the size, quality, accessibility etc of the bauxite deposits (for making aluminium). The   on all these factors will be superimposed to generate data for the industry and academia.
 
 JNARDDC director Anupam Agnihotri told TOI that the two institutes will be incorporating all the information in an ‘app’ for the Ministry of Mines (MoM) and other users by the end of 2018. MoM is providing Rs69 lakh for the project.
 
 The centre already has three volumes of data on laterite and bauxite deposits. “To begin with, the two agencies would be making the app only for Maharashtra as a pilot project under the digital India campaign. Gradually the exercise can be extended to all other bauxite rich states,” said Agnihotri.
 
 The app will have information on the total resource, its content, thickness, quality, mineralogy, lease boundary of the deposit. The app (yet to be named) will be put on the website of JNARDDC and the MoM and will be available to the user on payment.
 
 In Maharashtra, the bauxite and laterite ore is located mainly in Kolhapur, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Satara and Sindhudurg districts. Pravin Bhukte, principal scientist at JNARDDC, is the project coordinator. Bhukte says the Centre would be sampling the deposits with help of GSI and studying the physical and chemical contents or characteristics of the most promising deposits and the alumina percentage in them. “This will help to assess the quality and feasibility of mining the ore,” he said. 
 
 MRSAC director Subrata N Das says that his institute will be using the satellite based geo-informatics for generating geospatial data, monitoring, modelling, mapping and analysing. “It would be possible to categorize the deposits in two distinct heads of ‘go’ and ‘non go’ areas. It means that the deposit in ‘go’ areas will be accessible for mining whereas in ‘non-go’ areas the deposits cannot be mined due to reasons like environmental protection etc,” said Das.
 
 Project coordinator and associate scientist from MRSAC Ajay Deshpande said that this project will help the user aluminium industry know about the exact feasibility for extraction of ore and accessibility to the ore. The satellite data maps on various parameters like distance from the nearest habitat or village, road or highway etc will be superimposed over each other to generate this information for the MoM and industry.
 
 
 
 
 * Reserves in India | 3,479 million tonnes
 
 * Yearly production of bauxite | 16.4 MT (as per 2014 data)
 
 * India fifth largest producer of bauxite
 
 * Distribution of bauxite in five major geological and geographical areas — eastern ghat coast, western ghat and coast, Gujarat and Jammu and Kashmir
 
 States rich in bauxite
 
 * Odisha, Andhra Pradesh,  , Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Jammu & Kashmir
 
 Bauxite and Laterite deposits in Maharashtra
 
 * Total reserves | 175 million tonne
 
 * 70% of these are high level deposits (altitude of about 850 to 1300 above mean sea level (msl)
 
 * High level deposits are found in Udgiri, Dhangarwadi, Ringewadi, Durgmanwadi, Waki (Shilo), Jhamba (Koyana valley)
 
 * Coastal deposits found at 50-350msl, except in thane district (650msl)
 
 * Low level coastal deposits are found in Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts.
