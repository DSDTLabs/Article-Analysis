KOLKATA: Two guns that   owned and the ceremonial   presented to him when he became the mayor of Calcutta in 1930 may finally be put on public display after gathering dust in a secret vault for years. 

  wants to hand over the priceless artefacts to   Research Bureau (NRB) so that they can be showcased at 38/2 Elgin Road, where Netaji lived before his Great Escape in January 1941. 
 
 The firearms — a double-barrel gun and a colt revolver — are currently in a sealed vault in KMC’s treasury department. The licence to both the arms bears Subhas Bose’s name. Also in the vault are the sword andthe armour that were presented to him when he was sworn Kolkata mayor on August 22, 1930. He held the mayor’s office till April 15 the following year.
 
 Sources in KMC said the vault also contains cartridges and British-era coins. The artefacts were transferred to the high-security vault around four years ago when an internal assessment ascertained that the priceless artefacts could be pilfered. 
 
 “A civic official had earlier proposed that the artefacts be handed over to Town Hall or Indian Museum but the idea did not find favour with KMC bosses. Instead, the valuables were put in a vault and sealed,” a civic official said.
 
 The current mayor believes time has now come to make the objects public. Chatterjee said KMC would approach NRB authorities to accommodate these objects.
 
 Harvard professor and Trinamool Congress MP Sugata Bose, who is Netaji’s grand nephew and in charge of NRB, expressed delight at the prospect of getting Netaji’s belongings. “We will be very happy to display the articles if they are handed over to us. He had received multiple ceremonial swords including one from the Japanese and another from the authorities of Golden Temple when he visited the shrine in 1938,” he said.
