PANAJI/MAPUSA: Environmental activists protested along the   stretch of national highway 17, on Monday, World Biodiversity Day, opposing the proposed felling of 400-odd coconut trees to broaden the highway. The activists said the Guirim-Mapusa road stretch is already wide enough and the trees along it are not a hindrance to traffic.

 “During our previous agitation, the government had assured us that they will save it. We are restarting the agitation, because we want to save coconut trees along the Guirim-Mapusa highway and all over Goa,” said heritage activist Prajal Sakhardande, who led the activist.
 
 Earlier, during the day, chief minister   tweeted, “Every attempt must be made to plan shifting of affected trees and whereever it is difficult to do so, the department should undertake a plantation drive to compensate loss.”
 
 He said the shifting or plantation must form an integral part of roadmaking/widening project and sought action taken report on a regular basis. Parrikar, however, said roadmaking and widening of highways in the state makes removal of few trees unavoidable. But, the chief minister’s statement did not bring relief to agitators who gathered holding placards protesting at the highway. Calling their agitation ‘Chipko’ movement, Sakhardande demanded that the government should withdraw its decision in the interest of the state. “We want commitment from the government to save it. Or else, we will take this movement forward on a larger scale,” Sakhardande said.
 
 Activists said that the information obtained by   Act revealed that from 2011 to 2013, all over Goa, 10,000 trees were felled, but the government has not replanted any trees. “It’s time to prove   and Goenkarponn by saving coconut trees,” an activist said. Demonstrators said they were unaware why people who supported their previous movement, were not with them this time.
