DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand chief minister   on Tuesday said Prime Minister   should be "ashamed" of himself for his statement on the earthquake that hit the state while taking a jibe at Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi's "earthquake" remark.

 "Narendra Modi should be ashamed of himself for making fun of the earthquake that hit Uttarakhand," Rawat tweeted after the Prime Minister's speech.
 
 During PM Narendra Modi's motion of thanks speech in Lok Sabha, he took a jibe at Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi's "earthquake" remark, saying that the nation finally felt the tremors on Monday.
 
 "I was wondering why the earthquake came. When someone see 'SEVA' or any positive virtue in the word 'SCAM' then mother earth would definitely become upset," Modi said.
