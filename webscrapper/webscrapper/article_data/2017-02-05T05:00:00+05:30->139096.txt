The belief that music has no boundaries or culture is perfectly typified by ace flautist duo   and   of the fusion band  . Currently on a tour of India, the band that is completed by Ghatam player   and percussionist  , was in Hyderabad recently for a college fest and boy, did they put on a mesmerising show for the 1000-strong audience! 
And it seems, the flautist duo are equally mesmerised by Hyderabad. “Ravichandran has come here before, but this was my first time. And I deeply appreciate the love for music people have here. Of course since this was a college, the energy was much, much higher,” says Jean-Luc, who hails from Brittany in France.
 It’s not every day you come across a cross-cultural, let alone an Indo-French, flautist duo. The fact that the two even got together in the first place is sheer destiny, Ravichandran reckons. “I was invited to play at the 2014  , a world music festival in Germany. We were among the 11 flautists from across the world who would jam together. I was immediately won over by Jean-Luc’s immense skill on the traditional wooden flute. I knew that he was someone I could collaborate with. Gradually, we became good friends too!” says Ravichandran, a native of Udupi, who has played alongside world-class artistes like  , Pandit Ravi Shankar,   and Arka. 
 Jean-Luc too is equally in awe of Ravichandran’s inimitable Carnatic style. “The way he expresses and uses dramatic pauses blows my mind! The purity of his tone adds another dimension to our sound. My respect for Carnatic music increased substantially after I met and jammed with him,” says Jean-Luc who adds that he wishes to come back to Hyderabad again, having fallen in love with the food over here. “We French love flavours and Hyderabadi cuisine, especially the biryani, caters to a lot of different palates and that’s unique,” says Jean, signing off.
