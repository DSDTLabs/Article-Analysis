SHIMLA: The Union government has announced to introduce pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) to reduce the number of child deaths due to pneumonia and the phased roll-out is likely to begin in   and select districts of Bihar and   in next two weeks.

 Pneumonia and diarrhoea are major causes behind child deaths among children globally and in India. In 2015, more than 1,43,000 Indian children of one month to below five years of age died of pneumonia and 1,12,000 due to diarrhoea which constituted almost half of the total number of child deaths in the country that year. 
 
 In 2010, pneumococcal pneumonia caused an estimated 200 deaths and 1,600 severe cases among children between one month and five years of age in Himachal Pradesh while in 2015, pneumococcal pneumonia and meningitis were responsible for approximately 230 deaths and 5,370 severe and non-severe cases among children. PCV can help prevent many such instances and save children’s lives.
 
 State immunization officer Dr   said that in last one and a half year, PCV is the fourth vaccine to be launched in Himachal. 
 
 “Immunization is one of the most effective public health measures. Why should we leave our children to suffer from diseases and die when interventions such as vaccines are available? It is better to immunize our children and prevent the spread of diseases,” she said. According to her, preventing a disease is better than trying to cure it using antibiotics.
 
 Immunization card with positive messages are being handed over to pregnant women in the state. Community health workers are told to keep a track of all pregnant women and children to ensure every single child is vaccinated. District-wise review would also be done every month to monitor the progress of immunization, she added.
