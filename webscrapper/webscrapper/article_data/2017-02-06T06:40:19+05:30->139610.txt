HYDERABAD: The state government may have envisioned wide roads connecting all the districts headquarters when it planned reorganisation, but it’s proving to be a costly affair. Projects such as   to the state capital are unlikely to take off on time.

 After the districts were reorganised to 31 from 10, chief minister   had asked officials to ensure that four-lane roads connect every district headquarters to Hyderabad and two-lane roads are laid from mandals to district headquarters.
 
 The two projects together are estimated to cost a whopping Rs 2,500 crore — Rs 900 crore for four-laning and Rs 1,600 crore for two-lane roads. This is in addition to the over Rs 1,000 crore required for construction of new intergrated collectorate complexes in 28 of the 31 districts.
 
 Faced with the task of amassing funds for these projects, the government is now setting up a   to raise loans from national and international monetary agencies. 
 
 “We don’t need to construct four-lane roads for the entire stretch between new district headquarters and Hyderabad. There are national highways as well as state highways with four-lane width on several stretches. We only have to fill the gaps. Over 1,100 km total length of roads have to be constructed to fill up the gaps and ensure uniform four-lane connectivity between district headquarters and the state capital,” a senior official in the   and buildings department said.
 
 R&B engineer-in-chief   said the works would be taken up in a phased manner and claimed that the financial burden would not be much on the state government. The government is exploring different financial options to execute the projects, he said.
 
 Officials said that land acquisition has raised the estimated cost of the two road projects to Rs 2,500 crore. The cost of four-laning of roads would have been more had a major chunk of land required not been already available with the state government, they added.
