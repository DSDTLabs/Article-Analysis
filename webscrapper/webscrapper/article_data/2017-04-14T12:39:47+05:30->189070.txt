Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad: In order to promote digital transactions for electricity bill payments, the Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) chairman Desh Deepak Verma announced on Thursday that 'no bank transaction charge' will be collected from consumers, who are paying their electricity bills online using internet banking, credit or debit cards.

 The licensee discom/franchisee will instead, bear the said online banking transaction charge for electricity bills up to the amount of Rs 4000.
 
 “If the electricity bill is beyond Rs 4000 or more, then the consumer will bear the online banking transaction charge as per banking rules. The directive applies for bill payment through net banking only in both, private and public sector banks”,  , secretary UPERC told TOI.
 
 According to Srivastava the move comes in order to ease the electricity bill payment mechanism, and also to help consumers avoid standing in long queues for the bill payment. “The mechanism not only offers convenience, but also budgets the billing process to a certain amount,” said officials from Noida power department.
 
 According to  , superintending engineer PVVNL, “The move will benefit a large number of consumers, those who make online payments, and also encourage consumers to opt for online payments to avoid long queues as well as easing the pressure on ground staff engaged in bill collection and deposits,” said Singhal.
 
 The Commission has asked licensee / franchisee discoms to provide a detailed report on the implementation of the above provisions including account of how many online bills were paid in their area.
