NEW DELHI: How many times have images of a   tugged at your heart strings, making you want to reach out and help in your own small way? Many of those wanting to extend financial help may not have known how to go about it or who to contact. 

 The government, in partnership with Bollywood star  , has decided to bridge this gap between citizens willing to volunteer financial aid and the kin of central security personnel who lay down their lives in the line of duty, leaving their dependents financially parched. 
 
 The home ministry and the film star are tying up to create a simple web application through which volunteers can deposit funds directly into the verified bank account of the martyr's kin, to be publicised through the ministry's website that will display a link to the app.
 
 On Friday, Kumar visited the ministry to discuss the proposal with home secretary Rajiv Mehrishi and the central paramilitary brass. Sources said the ministry has fully backed the initiative. It has asked its experts and Akshay's team to jointly develop the app. 
 
 As per the proposal, each time a central force personnel gets killed in the line of duty, details of his identity, financial status of his family, number of dependents and details of bank account of next of kin etc will be uploaded on the ministry website, letting people directly deposit their contributions into the account through the app. Once the aggregate contributions reach Rs 15 lakh, the details will be removed from the website so as to channelise further contributions to the next deserving case. Contributions will be eligible for income-tax deductions. 
 
 "Though government websites offer options to extend financial help to martyr's kin, these are not well-publicised. Also, officialdom delays the process. The app will simplify things, with the home ministry website and Akshay's involvement as a brand ambassador offering it wide publicity," said BSF DIG in Jaisalmer Amit Lodha.
