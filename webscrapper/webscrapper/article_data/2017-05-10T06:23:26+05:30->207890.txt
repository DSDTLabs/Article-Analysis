PATIALA:   probing the   van   on Tuesday the sketches of four out of   who had made away with Rs 1.33 crore. The criminals had fired at the driver of a cash van on May 2 on the Patiala-Chandigarh highway and escaped with the loot.

 Patiala range DIG Sukhchain Singh Gill said the facial composites had been prepared on the basis of the eyewitness account by employing interchangeable templates of separate features. “Though the eyewitnesses could not see the complete faces of the robbers as these were covered below the eyes, the police graphic experts could also make the composites of full faces of the accused,” he said.
 
 So far, police have failed to make a headway in the case. Initially, name of Nabha jail escapee and gangster Vicky Gonder had come up in the case but police are tightlipped on that now.   denied that any cash reward had been announced for information about the van robbery suspects.
