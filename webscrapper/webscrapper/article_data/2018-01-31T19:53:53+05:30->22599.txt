 The overlap of a blue moon - the second full moon in a calendar month - with a lunar eclipse while the moon is at its closest approach to the earth is the first such celestial trifecta since 1982, said Noah Petro, a research scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center outside Washington.
 
 "Just having these three things simultaneously occur is unusual," Petro said. "A blue moon is not extremely rare but it's a nice coincidence that it happens in conjunction with these other two."
