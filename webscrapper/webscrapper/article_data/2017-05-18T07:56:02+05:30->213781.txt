MALAPPURAM: On Wednesday, a family court in Malappuram rejected the petition filed by   Ali Faizi - who wanted to   - by saying that seeking the same, without a reasonable cause was invalid. The court noted that reconciliation procedures (in accordance with Muslim law) were not followed in this case. 

 Faizi had approached the court to validate talaq and legally divorce his wife, whom he had married in March 1994. Faizi had tried to divorce his wife by saying talaq in September 2012, but his wife did not accepted the talaq letter that he had sent by registered post in 2012. The respondent argued that the talaq was not valid as the petitioner did not follow talaq procedures prescribed under Muslim law.
 
 The petitioner tried to argue that there was an attempt at reconciliation, which failed. But, the court dismissed the petition saying that the petitioner had forced the respondent to undergo divorce and there were no attempts to unite both the husband and wife by two mediators from each person's family. Therefore, the petitioner is not able to prove that there was a valid talaq, the court said, before dismissing his petition. 
 
 The court cited verdicts from the   and Karnataka high court in this case. The verdicts made it clear that for a talaq to be valid, there must be a reasonable cause and also reconciliation talks.
