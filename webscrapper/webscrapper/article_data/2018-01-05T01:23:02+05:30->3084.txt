Chennai: The   and poor visibility caused by the cold spell in Delhi in the last two days has had its impact on train and flight schedules in Chennai, affecting hundreds of passengers . The delay took a toll on those travelling by train as they had to wait at Chennai Central for more than four to five hours. 

 More than five arrivals and six departures were delayed by one to two hours on Chennai-Delhi route because morning   from Delhi were delayed by more than an hour on Wednesday. The Chennai Central – New Delhi Tamil Nadu Express was delayed by more than six hours. The Chennai-Delhi Tamil Nadu Express of Thursday was rescheduled to 4am on Friday.
 
 In Delhi, 60   and 34 domestic and international flights were delayed as visibility dipped to less than 50 metres. “Airlines use the same aircraft to fly multiple destinations which means that a delay at Delhi airport will have its effect throughout subsequent schedules,” said an airport official. 
 
 “The flight had a delayed departure in Delhi due to poor visibility. We waited in the plane for half an hour,” Varshini, a traveller from the capital to the city, said.
