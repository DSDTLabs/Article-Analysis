LUDHIANA: In a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the   (BJP) district president and head of Samvedna Trust,  , and   legal cell convener Rajnesh Mahajan against the recent power hike, the   and   high court has issued a notice of motion to the state government to clear their stand on the issue. The BJP leaders have demanded a cancellation of the revised power tariff that takes effect from April 1, 2017. The case will now come up for hearing on February 2.

 In their PIL, the BJP leaders mentioned that the state government had passed an order on October 23 last year for revision of electricity tariff, and there is an exorbitant increase to Rs 7.36 per unit, apart from other charges. It also stated that a reading of the order showed that the said increase was made taking into consideration the annual audit report and annual revenue requirement for financial year 2014-15 to financial year 2019-20. The hike was made to cover the revenue gap of Rs 2,522.62 crore for financial year 2017-18. It clearly showed that only the commercial consideration has been taken into account and public policy was ignored. The government also issued orders that the revised rates would apply with effect from April 1, 2017, thereby giving a retrospective effect to the order, the PIL mentioned.
 
 BJP district president Ravinder Arora said the orders would affect the general public belonging to middle class families, as almost all middle class and service class families are run on budget. He said they had filed a PIL in court, because this act was not only against the public policy but also illegal. Their counsel   said after two hearings the court has issued notice of motion and now the state government will have to justifying their stand regarding retrospective power rates, on the next date of hearing.
