MUMBAI: The   ( ) here on Tuesday admitted an insolvency petition filed by Swedish communications equipment major   against Anil Ambani-run   (RCom) and two of its subsidiaries, seeking to recover Rs 1,150 crore.

 
 Ericsson had signed a sevenyear deal in 2014 to operate and manage RCom's nationwide telecom network but has not been paid the bill. Last September, the Swedish company had filed a petition in the NCLT's Mumbai bench to liquidate the telecom operator to recover the Rs 1,150
 
 crore that RCom owes it. The tribunal admitted the petition on Tuesday, which could potentially result in delaying RCom's plans to sell assets to lighten its debt load. The company said, "RCom and two of its subsidiaries - Reliance Telecom and Reliance Infratel - await A detailed order from NCLT, allowing the Ericsson application for admitting the companies to debt resolution under the IBC."
 
 RCom owes around Rs 45,000 crore to as many as 31 domestic and international banks, including over Rs 10,000 crore to a Chinese lender. Due to mounting losses, the company began to wind down its mobile operations from last November.
 
 It was also not servicing the debt for many quarters before that as it was looking to recast the loans but the plans did not materialise.
