Panaji: The rules for regulating   operations in the state have been approved in-principle by the law department. The rules will facilitate appointment of a gaming commissioner.

 A law officer confirmed that the law department has “vetted the draft rules” for casinos. “Upon approval by the chief minister, who is also the home minister, we will place the file for approval of the cabinet,” the official said. 
 
 “The chief minister may suggest some changes. Upon effecting those changes, the draft rules will be sent for cabinet approval,” he said.
 
 Significant provisions include banning entry of Goans on casinos and a ban on persons under the age of 21 years. Though the process to constitute gaming commission rules were initiated in 2013, there wasn’t much progress in getting them passed during last four years, while file kept shuttling between different departments in the state government.
 
 The state government had defined many terms in the Goa Public Gambling (Amendment) Act 1976, including area of the casino, electronic gaming, live gaming, offshore, offshore casino, onshore casino, passenger capacity, when the act was amended in 2012. The chief minister has the option of appointing the gaming commissioner either from the state cadre or an IAS officer.
 
 The officer, some experts say, would require to be brought on board not only to keep watch on casino operations but to discover hidden ways, if any, adopted by operators and plug in revenue pilferage.
 
 The government is yet to be find alternate place – out of city limits of the River Mandovi – for shifting the casinos, the officer said.
