MUMBAI: A 26-year-old woman travelling from   to   (LTT) with her family was stunned to discover contents of her missing handbag dumped in trash cans of the train’s lavatories early Thursday. It appears the thief stole her handbag while she was asleep, sorted its contents in the lavatory and made off with only those he considered valuable. The GRP recorded the matter, but are yet to lodge an FIR.

 Lata Juthuga, a Goregaon resident, had gone to Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh to attend a wedding with her parents and brother. Early on Tuesday, the family boarded the Vishakhapatnam-LTT Express from Rajahmundry. Their train entered Mumbai early on Thursday. “Around 3.30am, we were preparing to alight. My father went to the washroom to freshen up. When he got back, he was holding up my purse. My immediate reaction was to look for my handbag and I realised it was missing,” Lata told TOI.
 
 Lata says they started a hunt for the other contents of the handbag. “There were four lavatories in our coach and four in the adjacent one. We were taken aback to find my belongings dumped in trash cans of these lavatories. We found our house keys, notebooks, a Reliance Jio hotspot, earphones, imitation jewellery and cosmetics as well as the empty handbag. They were in a filthy condition and I had to clean them thoroughly later,” she said.
 
 Besides the handbag, the thief had made off with a shirt belonging to her dad which he had left on a hanger. “The shirt pockets had his PAN card, Aadhaar card, a bus pass and some cash. My purse had been emptied of cash too. The thief also stole my cellphone and my brother’s debit card from my handbag. But he left behind my debit card and PAN card,” she added.
 
 On getting off at LTT at 4.40am, the family approached the GRP and narrated the entire incident.
 
 “The incident speaks volumes about the lack of security on trains,” said activist  , who tweeted about the incident, tagging railway authorities.
