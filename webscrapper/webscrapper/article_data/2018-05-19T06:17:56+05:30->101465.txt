 While several officers have individually approached the minister to get their transfer order revoked, sources said the   is considering whether it should move the minister’s office on behalf of all officers. It is likely that a decision will be taken next week, after which a meeting with Rathore may be requested. Sources said the information officers are also expected to urge the minister to strengthen and rationalise the cadre.
 
 The mass transfers had led to considerable angst within the department, with many officers arguing that the transfers had affected functioning of media units and hurt morale of officers.
 
 Individual representations made so far urged Rathore to keep in mind officers’ personal circumstances before issuing transfer orders.
 
 In February’s order, many officers nearing superannuation were transferred.
 
 After the bulk transfers, the IIS Group A Officers Association wrote to the Prime Minister for his intervention and said the “morale of cadre officers was being affected due to the current transfer policy of the ministry”.
 
 The letter also requested that “all transfers effected may be duly reconsidered and further transfers be stopped”.
