Only a few days ago,  , who is turning composer with Santhanam’s Sakka Podu Podu Raja, had recorded a song with his good friend   Shankar Raja. Now, Yuvan has returned the favour by roping in STR to sing a trance number in Dharani Dharan’s  , which stars   and Chandini in the lead.

 “I’ve always admired the Yuvan-Simbu combo, which has given us many hit number in the past. So, when we were thinking of whom to bring in a singer for a solo trance song, we decided to go with Simbu because the lines by lyricist   seemed to reflect the actor’s character. In fact, after recording the song, Naan Yaarunu Theriyuma, STR himself remarked on this, and that is when we let him know that it was the reason we asked him to sing this number,” reveals Shirish, who adds that the recording session, which happened on Monday night, was a fanboy moment to remember for him.
 
 The song, he tells us, will appear as a montage in the film and will be picturised on him. “We have finished 75-80% of the film, and we will be wrapping up the shoot soon,” he informs.
