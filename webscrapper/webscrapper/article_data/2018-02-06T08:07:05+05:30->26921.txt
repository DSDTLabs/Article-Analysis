BHOPAL: Work on 8 km lane flyover — which is to connect   to Airport — has hit a roadblock— by way of merger properties. As some 14 merger agreement properties are located along a stretch from   to Mubarakpur, the district administration has referred the matter to MP revenue department for acquisition of these properties.

 The work on the stretch, estimated to cost around Rs 221 crore, began last year and will cover a flyover and underbridges. “The matter has been referred to the department of revenue for guidance,” district collector   told reporters. Around 50 families live in 14 properties along Panchwati and adjoining areas. Sources said the government is seeking to take over these properties to expedite construction work.
 
 Sources said SDM Bairagarh Pradeep Sharma initiated the process to acquire these properties. The properties are listed as private in revenue records. “In such a situation, compensation has to be given after acquiring these properties. The government will take a final decision on compensation,” said a senior official.
 
 There will be a flyover in Singarcholi ROB, Daata Colony Under Pass, Bypass Crossing Under Pass, Airport Underpass, Mubarkpur. With road widening proposed, houses on either side will be torn down.
 
 Last year, CM   had instructed officials to draw up a separate policy for regularisation of houses built on the land coming under the purview of the merger agreement.
 
 The properties are affected by a 1949 merger agreement signed between the last Nawab of   Hamidullah Khan and the Union of India. Comprehensive survey of an estimated 10,000 houses is to take place as part of the survey. The survey is to cover an estimated 6,000 properties in Bairagarh circle and 3,000 in TT Nagar. In August 2004, the state government had stated these properties should be registered as government land.
