Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court sought a report on the status of construction of a super speciality hospital being built in Madurai. The division bench headed by Justice M Sathyanarayanan heard the contempt petition filed by one S Ramesh kumar from Sivaganga. The petitioner side said he had already approached the HC bench seeking to expedite the construction work of the hospital. The court on March 9, 2017 passed an order directing the health secretary, director of medical education, Madurai district collector and Government Rajaji Hospital dean to complete the construction work in six months. But the officials failed to obey the court order. On November 28, the petitioner sent a contempt notice to the officials praying for implementation of the the court order. But, the officials who received the notice failed to act on it. Thus, the court needs to take contempt action against the officials concerned, the petitioner side said.  The construction of the hospital began in February 2014. As per the project schedule, the work had to be finished on August 23, 2015. But, the authorities did not show interest to complete the work, the petitioner side said. It led the court to seek report on the status of construction of the hospital .
