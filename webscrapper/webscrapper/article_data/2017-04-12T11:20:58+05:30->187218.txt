AHMEDABAD: Even as the rupee appreciated recently against international currencies including, dollar, Euro and pound, tour operators, over the past three to five months, have failed to cash-in on cheaper international  . Estimates provided by city-based tour operators indicate that even though the rupee has appreciated, there hasn’t been any significant uptake in international travel.

 Overall, the bookings for international travel have been limited. “People usually book for summer holidays around December-January to get the best deals in airfares. However, they were unwilling to spend after demonetization,” said Manish Sharma, managing director of a city-based travel company.
 
 Moreover, political disturbances in certain countries such as Turkey and Egypt, have hampered international tour bookings. On the other hand, travellers are either preferring domestic destinations or alternative destinations abroad.
 
 In fact, the domestic travel industry has received a tremendous boost. 
 
 “From Gujarat, the bookings across domestic or nearby international destinations such as Bhutan and Sri Lanka have been significantly good. North East, Kashmir, Kerala and Uttarakhand have emerged as popular destinations,” said Rajeev Kale, president - leisure travel, Thomas Cook, India.
 
 “Bookings from Gujarat, including those from tier-II and tier-III markets have grown by 20% year on year,” said Kale.
 
 “Europe is a popular international destination among travellers from Gujarat. While there is no decline in bookings, the ticket size and budgets have shrunk by 15%-20%. Last year, around 10,000 travellers only from Gujarat had booked Europe tours,” he added.
