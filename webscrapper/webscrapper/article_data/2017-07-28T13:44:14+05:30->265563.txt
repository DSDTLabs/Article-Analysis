CHANDIGARH: In absence of police assistance, first aid and traffic cops at many accident spots,   came forward as a saviour at one such spot.   and  , who were going to their workplace, lent a helping hand to the injured person while saving a biker from skidding on the road. 

 Parminder and   said that they saw some two-wheelers skidding on road and there was no traffic cop at the roundabout of Sectors 18/19/20/21 to stop the bikers from using that road or at least warn them. Both women then took it upon themselves and went on the road and made many motorists aware that either they should drive very slowly as the road had become very slippery or else avoid that road altogether. Both women spent around one hour on the roundabout and saved many two-wheeler riders from skidding. 
 
 When the policemen came on the spot,   had an argument with them on their late arrival at the scene. She stated that they had called up many times on helpline number 100 but the line was busy and there was no cop on the roundabout to divert the traffic.
 
 Manju said that she was working with the income tax office. On seeing people getting injured and screaming for help, she took leave from job and started helping people. The police reached very late on the spot when all injured had been taken to hospital by passersby. Only when the police reached the roundabout and started diverting the traffic that the two left the place.
