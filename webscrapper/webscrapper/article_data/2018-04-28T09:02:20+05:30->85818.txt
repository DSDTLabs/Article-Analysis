CHENNAI: The   is now likely to hand over the ‘diary’ containing the names of people allowed the trade of gutka in   after taking protection money (bribe) from a manufacturer to the  .

 On Wednesday, the Madras high court had transferred the sensational case, allegedly involving state ministers and senior bureaucrats and top police officers, from the DVAC to CBI. 
 
 The country’s premier investigation agency is now likely to register fresh cases in the matter.
 
 A CBI officer said, “We are not in a hurry to conclude the case, but we are closely following the developments. We will step into action against those involved.”
 
 A team of CBI officials led by a superintendent of police under the direct supervision of the joint director has begun probing the case. The DVAC officials have sent the case diary along with the documents and evidence collected to the CBI.
 
 Earlier, despite repeated requests, the I-T sleuths had refused to share information from the diary, seized from gutka manufacturer Madhava Rao, with the DVAC officers as it contained the names of two senior police officers of the rank of DGP as they believed the DVAC would be biased in investigating “two of their own”. The DVAC is part of the police force. The Income Tax officials had told DVAC officers that they would submit all the documents they possessed in the case before the trial court concerned after a chargesheet was filed.
 
 Meanwhile, DMK working president and former deputy chief minister M K Stalin has demanded that the CBI director create a special investigation cell comprising officers from other states to ensure a fair probe. The party suspects that top politicians and police officers may try to influence the investigation. It was the DMK’s J Anbazhagan, who represents Chepauk in the state assembly, who sought a direction from the high court to transfer the case from DV&AC to CBI.
