JAISALMER: The two school students—a boy and a girl—who went   from their homes in Barmer four days back were traced out at the   on Friday. Both were planning to move to another city but were detained by railway police and handed over to the Barmer police.

 
 The   outfits in Barmer had been protesting vigorously ever since father of the minor girl, who is a Hindu, lodged a complaint that she was kidnapped by her classmate, a Muslim minor, on May 8. The girl’s father, who filed an FIR on May 9, had alleged it to be a case of ‘love jihad’.
 
 The Hindu organisations held demonstrations and forced a bandh in   on Thursday. The organisations met the district SP and demanded to find the missing minors within 24 hours and had warned to intensify the agitation.
 
 A Gudamalani police station constable spotted the missing Muslim boy and the Hindu girl at the Jodhpur railway station and detained them with the help of the railway police. The duo was later brought to Barmer. The constable, who was proceeding home on leave, spotted the children at Jodhpur station around five in the evening on Friday. He immediately informed the Gudamalani SHO Jaikishan Soni.
