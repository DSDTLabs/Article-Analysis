Filmmaker   has something interesting to offer his viewers after doing interesting films in Bollywood. The director has translated his own ideas into three features - short films - Teen Paheliyan which will air in the afternoon on April 22. The three films will have talented actors like Vikrant Massey, Surveen Chawla, Kunal Roy Kapur and many others.   said, "I am happy that the channel was welcoming such an interesting idea. I hope that if this works, we can tell many such stories through the medium of television." 

 The director who has made films like   and Jhankaar Beats feels that the right script makes a good film and that translates into good work and connectivity for all. He says, "I would love to work with   again but there should be a good script. There should be the right funding too for that script. I admit we have both done good work together but without a good script nothing is possible."
 
 Ask the filmmaker if he connects with the saas-bahu content on TV and if he wishes to bring in change with the kind of three features he is getting on the small screen and he says, "I don't think I would like to comment on what others are doing. TV shows with saas-bahu content is working on TV and people do watch it so it is wrong to say that it is bad and we are bringing in a change. We are only trying to narrate our stories here."
