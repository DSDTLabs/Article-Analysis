NEW DELHI: The   Delhi Municipal   has listed 42   at key locations in the city which it plans to lease out to private concessionaires through tenders, in a bid to raise its revenue. The agenda for the same would be put up in the first meeting of the newly constituted house.

 Senior officials from the civic body said that the reason behind selecting these halls was under-utilisation. “The shortlisted   centres are usually booked only for only 5-10 days on an average in a year,” the official said. The department has already prepared a detailed preamble and plans are afoot to hand over only the upper floors of these centres to contractors for holding functions.
 
 “The ground floors of the facilities will remain with us and will be available to public as per normal procedure. The private player will make the necessary modifications in order to exploit the available space more efficiently,” said the official. “The rent has been calculated on the basis of circle rate, house tax category, construction cost and land cost.”
 
 Officials said that they expect a revenue of 13 crore annually from these community halls which are located at places like Sultanpuri, Roop Nagar, Rohini (Sector 17 & 18), Majlis Park and Deshbandhu Gupta Road.
