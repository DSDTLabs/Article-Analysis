MADURAI: Members of Makkal Viduthalai Meetpu Iyakkam met the   collector and the superintendent of police on Saturday and urged them to take action against those who recently attacked people belonging to the   community at K Thottiapatti near Rajapalayam. The members also demanded rehabilitation measures for the victims. 

 Iyakkam general secretary R Srinivasa Ragavan handed over a representation to the officials. He said that a dispute broke out on March 30 between people belonging to the Arunthathiar community and those from other castes over drawing of drinking water. Following that, over a hundred people attacked 19 Arunthathiar people using deadly weapons, ransacked 35 houses and burned five houses. In the attack 19 Arunthathiar people, including pregnant women, also sustained grievous injuries. The people injured have been under treatment at various hospitals in Madurai, Srivilliputur and Rajapalayam. 
 
 Ragavan said that police have failed to take proper action against the attackers. He said that it was necessary to arrest the people who attacked and also those who instigated them under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The houses damaged needed to be repaired and Rs 10 lakh compensation should be given to the victims. Besides, a fine of Rs 5 lakh should be imposed on the attackers under the SC/ST Act. The amount to be collected should be given for the development of the people affected, he said. 
 
 He also urged the officials to prohibit discrimination at Thottiappati.
