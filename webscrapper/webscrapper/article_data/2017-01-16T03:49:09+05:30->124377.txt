NEW DELHI: Build less but construct safer roads, road safety experts have urged the government as India observed Road Safety Week. Experts said retrofitting safety features cost more than the original cost of roads. 

 According to latest   ( ) data, 407 people died every day on Indian roads in 2015 and 53% of them died on national and state highways. The number of people dying on other roads, including rural roads, was also high. Admitting that bad planning and execution of road projects had made them fatal, road transport and highways minister   said, "We built high speed corridors without putting crash barriers. I have instructed my ministry and NHAI not to compromise on safety aspects while planning and building roads."
