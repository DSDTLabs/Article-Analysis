Gurgaon: You’d think this was monsoon if you visited  , which has been facing   for the last five days as the area’s master sewerage line is overflowing. 

 Residents have been facing persistent   for the last two years. “The master sewerage line has overflowed at least 10 times in the last one year. The problem started about two years ago, when the sewage connection of a nearby village was connected to our sector’s sewage connection. The authorities have fail to increase the capacity of the drains for villagers even after multiple requests. Due to this, residents of the sector have been forced to live in unhygienic conditions bearing the stench and filth,” said Purva, a resident of the sector.
 
 “As this is the only road available to approach the main road, I have to drive through pools of stinking water. I take my seven-year-old daughter to school every day from this road. She is at a high risk of contracting water-borne diseases,” said Karan Singh, another resident.
 
 Meanwhile, villagers said the drains are not cleaned regularly, which leads to overflow. “One sewerage line serves both the sector and the village. Residents in the sector blame us for the waterlogging. But we can’t help it. We also have the right to a sewage connection and clean surroundings,” said a villager.
 
 With a population of over 8,000 people, the sector reportedly has only one 10-inch-wide master sewerage line.
