VIJAYAWADA: TDP and YSRC leaders exchanged allegations and counter-allegations on Tuesday. The TDP leaders led by local MP Kesineni Nani attacked YSRC chief YS Jaganmohan Reddy saying the opposition leader will get 200-year jail term for amassing more than Rs 1 lakh crore when his father YS   was CM. YSRC leaders counter alleged saying TDP was going out of its way to encourage political murders. 

 Addressing a public meeting at   in Krishna on Tuesday, Nani lambasted Jagan. Nani wondered how could Jagan point fingers at chief minister Chandrababu Naidu when the opposition leader was the main accused in 12 disproportionate assets cases.
 
 Nani further compared Jagan to former general secretary of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam VK  , who was convicted in disproportionate assets case. "The CM is doing a good job and the state is getting global recognition because of Naidu's revolutionary ideas. On the other hand, opposition leaders are busy defaming the government. There is no need for President's rule in AP," said Nani.
 
 Meanwhile, YSRC leaders Kolusu Parthasaradhi and city president   lambasted TDP leaders. They said the TDP government's wrongdoings will soon come to light.
