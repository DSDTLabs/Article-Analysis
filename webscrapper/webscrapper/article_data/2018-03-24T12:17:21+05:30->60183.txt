Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court has observed that the   (SEC) cannot hold the local body elections to the state until the delimitation issue which is causing the delay in the electoral process, is over. The division bench comprising chief justice   and justice P Rajamanickam said this while hearing a case filed by one K   seeking a direction to the   to conduct local body election.

 Counsel for the election commission,   told the court that due to an issue pertaining to delimitation of wards of local bodies the election process is getting delayed. The commission has received 18,000 objections and suggestions. To consider the same, the delimitation commission has conducted seven meetings region-wise. 
 
 Following this, the chief justice observed, “Citing the delimitation issue, you (election commission) can’t hold the election. As per the Supreme Court direction, the delimitation issue has to go independently. The court will hear the case on Monday (March 26).”
 
 Earlier, during hearing, the petitioner said that the posts in local bodies have been lying vacant since October 24, 2016. The SEC was not willing to conduct the election to the local bodies. The issue was taken to the notice of the high court three times, then the election commission told the court that it would hold election. Subsequently, it also published an election notification.
 
 As the notification did not satisfy the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Panchayat (Rules), the court set aside the notification and directed the commission to issue fresh notification, conduct elections and complete the process before December 31, 2016. But, it did not do so.
