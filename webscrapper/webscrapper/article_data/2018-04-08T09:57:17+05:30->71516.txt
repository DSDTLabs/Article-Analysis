LUDHIANA: Even as the fire incidents are on a rise in the city, the tall claims made by the local bodies department and civic officials last year to improve arrangements to fight fires are yet to be fulfilled. The fire brigade department is still in similar condition and the firemen are still risking their lives in absence of fire safety arrangements. The firemen neither got fire-proof suits, nor have they been covered under life insurance policy. The firemen rued they will have to continue working in dangerous conditions.

 Since 2003, an average of 300 to 400 fire incidents have been reported in the city every year. A maximum that is 1098 fire incidents were reported in 2010, while 978 and 860 fire incidents were reported in 2013 and 2016 respectively. In 2017, the fire brigade department received around 324 fire calls, most of those were for major incidents. At one such unfortunate incident, 13 fire officals even lost their lives after a building collapses near   on November 20, 2017. Four firemen had received serious burn injuries in a fire at a textile factory in Industrial Area near Suffian Chowk.
 
 At that time, the local bodies minister   had announced that they will fulfill all the requirements of the fire brigade department. These included purchase of fire-proof suits and a new advanced fire tender with a hydraulic ladder. However, all these things are still distant dream for the department. In one last year, a notification for a separate fire directorate is the only achievement of the state government. However, despite the notification, the fire department is still under   control. 
 
 Requesting anonymity one of the officials said every year authorities make tall promises to upgrade the department. But when the fire incidents take place, they have to depend upon old fire tenders and damaged water pipes. He said even now, there is a lack of pipes and foam, and in case, the fire incidents increase, they will be helpless in controlling the same. He said senior officials advised them not to enter a building if it has been caught in fire for long. “But it is not possible to control or douse flames without entering a building,” he said. “We still have to wear the gunny bags soaked in water and enter the building that has caught fire as no safety kits have been provided till date,” he added. 
 
 When contacted, MC commissioner   he said these issues are being taken up at the state government level and they have no information about the same as of now. However, MC does provide the essential things immediately to the fire brigade department, he said. 
 
 4 months on, damaged fire tender yet to be repaired 
 
 A fire tender was damaged in a fire and building collapse incident near Suffian Chowk on November 20, 2017 and it is yet to be repaired. The fire tender is parked at the fire station of Focal Point since then. One of the fire officials told that front windowpanes and lights got damaged in the incident and to get it repaired, MC had sent a cheque. However, the cheque was sent back for some required correction. He said they have only 16 fire tenders, out of which 6 were new while rest are in dilapidated condition. “Now, one of the 6 new fire tenders has got damaged and has not been repaired yet,” he added. Meanwhile, when contacted the assistant divisional fire officer   said, “We have received money from the MC and will shortly get it repaired for the use.”

 Shortage of staff hitting the fire audit
 
 Recently, the fire brigade department started fire audit of buildings in the city and in the first phase, they started with hospitals. They prepared the list of around 70 hospitals and notices were served to around 35 hospitals for inspection. But due to scarcity of staff, they could check around dozen hospitals. The officials claimed in the wake of fire incidents, it will become even more difficult to complete this survey as there is no extra staff for this task. The department is supposed to check hospitals, educational institutes, schools, industrial units and malls.
