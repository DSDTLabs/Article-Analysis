PATNA: Former deputy CM   appeared before the CJM court in Patna on Saturday morning and had his statement recorded in a defamation case filed by him against RJD national spokesperson Manoj Jha and state spokesperson Chittaranjan Gagan. 

 Modi filed the petition on May 2 under Sections 499 and 500 of the IPC, accusing the duo of levelling false charges against him that he acquired benami properties in Patna and other places.
 
 Sources said Modi told the court the two RJD functionaries levelled false allegations against him without having any evidence and caused dent to his reputation. He requested the court to take stringent action against them. 
 
 Modi, who is the leader of opposition in the legislative council, said the two RJD spokespersons came out with the baseless charges against him after he exposed the shell firms of RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his family and a mall being developed by them near Saguna Mor. 
 
 “Jha and Chittaranjan held press conferences and alleged that I have acquired a palatial bungalow on Road No 13 in Rajendra Nagar; that I was illegally developing a mall on a 7.5-acre plot belonging to a church at Lodipur and that I launder black money through front companies registered in Kolkata and Delhi,” Modi said, reiterating these were fabricated stories.
