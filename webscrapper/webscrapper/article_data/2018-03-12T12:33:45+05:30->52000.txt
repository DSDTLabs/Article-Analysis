The shoot for   and   starrer ‘Hello Guru Prema Kosame’ began today. 

  In the behind-the-scenes picture posted by the filmmakers, Ram and Prakash Raj can be seen playing out a scene on-screen as director Trinadh Rao looks on. The film will have music by  , and going by the way the music director has composed music for Ram Charan and Samantha’s ‘Rangasthalam’, expectations are high for this one. 
 
  On March 7 recently, Ram had released the title on his social media and written, “#Ram16 is now #HelloGuruPremaKosame.” (sic) The production house too had announced the film and written, “Happy to announce our next film. Energetic Star @ramsayz and @anupamahere in #HelloGuruPremaKosame. A @ThisIsDSP musical directed by Trinadh Rao Nakkina. #Ram16.” (sic)
 
  Ram Pothineni and Anupama Parameswaran previously worked together in their last film ‘Vunnadhi Okate Zindagi’. While Ram had done a good job of his role, it was Anupama Parmeswaran who had received accolades for doing a stupendous job. Possibly named after the Nagarjuna and Amala song ‘Hello Guru Prema Kosam’ from their film ‘Nirnayam’, it remains to be seen what the film’s story is all about.
