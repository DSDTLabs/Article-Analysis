BHOPAL: State   on Saturday submitted a memorandum to   demanding the removal of minister of state for general administration department (GAD)   in connection with the alleged murder of former Congress MLA  .

 Leader of Opposition Ajay Singh and PCC chief Arun Yadav led a delegation of Congressmen who marched from Roshanpura Square to Raj Bhavan and submitted the memorandum.
 
 The Congress’ memorandum argued that chief minister   is protecting and trying to save Lal Singh Arya even after a Bhind district court ordered making the minister an accused in the alleged murder of Makhanlal Jatav. The slain Congress MLA was shot dead during a Lok Sabha election meeting in Bhind in April 2009.
 
 “How can a murder accused occupy a constitutional position?” the Congress asked. The memorandum reminded that former minister of the Shivraj Singh Chouhan cabinet Anup Mishra was asked to step down just because his name figured in the FIR of a murder case. Congress said that Anup Mishra was directly not involved in the murder and yet the chief minister had taken his resignation. Congress also argued that former chief minister and presently Union minister for water resources Uma Bharti had to put in her papers after a Karnataka court issued a summon against her.
 
 The memorandum said that it is hard to understand chief minister Chouhan’s attitude regarding Arya. Congress asked the governor, who is the constitutional head of the state to exercise his authority and expel Arya from the council of ministers. Speaking to reporters during the march to Raj Bhavan, Ajay Singh said, “If the government don’t ask Arya to resign, then the chief minister should categorically specify that he will continue to protect his minister who is charged with the murder of a Congress MLA.”
