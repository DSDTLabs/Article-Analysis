Mumbai: Unable to resolve issues regarding   with managements,   from several prominent schools in the city are reaching out to   minister Vinod Tawde and have decided to hold a   at Azad Maidan later this month.

 Parents from several prominent schools in the western suburbs met Tawde with their grievances on Sunday. “The school is asking us to pay a re-admission fee of Rs 25,000 when children move from senior KG to Class I. We have to also pay a security deposit of Rs 30,000. We were given very little notice and the school   fees every year,” said a parent from one of the schools in Kandivli.
 
 Parents of children from another school in Dahisar approached Tawde after the management began to return cheques they sent as they were according to the old fee structure. “The school is sending us threatening emails and asking us to pay in few days. We have sent several written complaints to the government but have not received a response,” said a mother. The parents claimed that the school has hiked fees every year since 2011.
 
 Parents from several other schools had similar complaints like unjustified fee hikes, high security deposits and compulsion to buy books, uniform and stationery from the school at a price higher than the market. 
 
 Parents of students from six schools also met to chalk a plan to tackle the issue on Monday. “Singularly, parents are overpowered by school managements as their children study there. The parents want that the government to monitor fees in private schools and that grievance redressal bodies take action against schools at fault,” said Jayant Jain, president, Forum for Fairness in Education, a NGO which the parents have approached.
 
 Tawde said education department officials have been told to look into the complaints. “We have instructed the officials to visit the schools, speak to stakeholders and submit a report. We will also speak to parents and school authorities to address complaints. Parents can also approach the grievance committee, the district fee revision committee which is headed by a retired high court judge,” he said.
