PUNE: The contractor appointed by the   has resumed the   at  , almost a month after the   forced suspension of work.

 A corporation official said, "The military authorities on February 17 requested us to start the construction work. We instructed the contractor to resume the work on the next day. The work of constructing the second pillar has started."
 
 There was a dispute over constructing an underpass linking the new Command Hospital with the MH-CTC on Kondhwa Road in exchange of the flyover coming up on some part of the defence land about 500m ahead. The construction work was stopped barely six months after defence minister Manohar Parrikar laid the foundation stone for the project.
 
 A senior army officer familiar with the development told TOI, "The army authorities are not against the  . Since the PMC authorities had promised us (army) they will construct the underpass, we were requesting them to start work early."
 
 The officer said they had a discussion over the issue. "The authorities have promised us they will complete the requisite tender process probably by the end of March. Thereafter, the underpass work will start," the officer added.
 
 The flyover, critical to ease frequent  , has been delayed by five years considering the PMC first issued its work order in 2011. It was stuck in a prolonged dispute between the civic and defence authorities.
 
 The latter insisted the road owned by the ministry of defence was managed by the Pune Cantonment Board for decades. As such, any construction work without the handover of the land was not possible.
 
 Corporator Sainath Babar said, "We want the PMC to expedite the construction work of the flyover and widen the side margins of the road for easing traffic flow."
 
 Rupesh Dake, a resident of NIBM Annexe Road, said, "I am happy to see the construction of the flyover has resumed."
