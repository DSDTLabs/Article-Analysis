MEERUT: On Sunday, the lane where the house of the Bishnois is situated in   wore a deserted look.   told TOI that the revelations have come to them as a shock as the family looked very “humble and normal”.   have revealed that while colonel (retired) Devendra Kumar Bishnoi, 72, had served in the Army and was even part of the 1971   and   in 1984, his son Prashant Bishnoi is a national-level shooter.

  “I have been their neighbour since the 1970s. Earlier, we lived is Chippi Tank area of Meerut but then moved here in Civil Lines – again as neighbours. I have seen Prashant grow up and have always been impressed with colonel saab’s dedication to the Army. I used to visit their house often but never saw anything suspicious. All of us were shocked to see so many people here – government officials, intelligence people and police on Saturday. Raids were on throughout the night,” said a neighbour who did not wish to be named.
 
  “All of us were gripped with curiosity as to what raids were happening at their residence. But the only little bits we got to know were from the media persons,” said another neighbour.
 
  While some neighbours claimed that the family was normal and humble, others say they were “surprised how rich they got suddenly.”
 
  A neighbour said, “The Bishnois suddenly became rich. Most of us in the colony were surprised by their increasing wealth since they did not have a full-fledged business in place – at least this is what we believed. But they got SUVs. In fact, their house has CCTV cameras in place and the gates of the house were opened only after confirming who the visitor was.”
 
  On Sunday, policemen deployed at the Bishnois’ house didn’t allow media persons to meet or talk to them.
