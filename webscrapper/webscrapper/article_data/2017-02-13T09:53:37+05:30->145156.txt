CHENNAI: In day-long checks in hotels, marriage halls, mansions and lodges ordered by   city police commissioner S George, police on Sunday picked up at least 105 people on suspicion and questioned them.

 Though storming operations are routine affairs across the city, the check on Sunday was conducted on specific intelligence of possible protests and violence amid the tussle between the two AIADMK factions, one owing allegiance to party general secretary V K Sasikala and the other rallying behind caretaker chief minister O Panneerselvam.
 
 On orders from top officers, police teams conducted intense checks at 1,340 lodges and 540 marriage halls in the city.
 
 To the surprise of police officers, all 105 men they picked up on Sunday had criminal records.
 
 Sources said police rounded up various people who appeared to be acting furtively. Alongside, police have been told to carry out intensive vehicle checks, especially at entry points to Chennai and on the city streets.
 
 Orders have gone out from the commissioner’s office to all city police stations to intensify patrolling.
 
 Sources said that the police commissioner has asked all subordinate officers to file situation reports on the current law and order situation in the city.
 
 All police stations in the city have been asked to file status reports to the police commissioner.
 
 “The checks will continue. Those picked up from the lodges will have to explain why they were in the city,” a senior police officer said.
 
 Police commissioner George, Tamil Nadu chief secretary Girija Vaidyanathan and director-general of police T K Rajendran were among senior officials who were briefed by governorC Vidyasagar Rao at Raj Bhavan on Friday.
