 HC officials while confirming the suspension on Wednesday refused to disclose anything further about the nature of allegations levelled by the 22-year-old male domestic help. “This is a sensitive matter on which we cannot comment. I can only confirm that the suspension order has been issued and the ADJ will remain suspended till further notice,” said an administrative official of the high court who did not wish to be identified.
 
 Meanwhile, a close associate of the judge told TOI that Singh had been falsely implicated in the case.
