AHMEDABAD: The AMC’s board meeting on the civic body’s annual budget turned unruly on the second day, with both the Congress and the BJP trading charges. Congress corporators also damaged the mike and other property of the AMC after the ruling BJP suspended a Congress councillor belonging to the minority commmunity.

 During the discussion on the budget, Congress leaders raised the issue of lack of basic infrastructure in minority-dominated areas like Sarkhej and Danilimda, among others. Congress leaders further alleged that the BJP was neglecting these areas and was not bothered about them. 
 
 During the discussion, Congress corporator   alleged that Prime Minister   had gone to Pakistan to enjoy biryani and also to attend the birthday of Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif without any invitation.
 
 This led to a heated argument between the two with BJP corporators and Congress councillors nearly coming to blows. Meanwhile, the BJP councillors demanded that Shaikh be suspended for the day. BJP corporator and former Mayor   alleged that grants for installing statues of former prime minister Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi were not coming from Pakistan. Hence their statues should be removed from the city and country, Shah said.
 
 This was enough for another round of shouting and confusion while Shaikh was supended. This further angered the Congress corporators who rushed into the well of the house. However, the ruling party members cleared the AMC budget for the year 2017-18 and left the hall.   workers then damaged the mike of the mayor and even other property as well.
 
 The civic body then called for the police.
