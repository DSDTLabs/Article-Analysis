MELBOURNE: Legends   and   heaped praise on  , just stopping short of calling him as their favourite to win this year's  .

 Laver said the six-month break that Federer took to rejuvenate himself and treat a troublesome knee last year might have been the best decision the 17-time major winner had made in his career. “It is amazing to think that Federer is playing as well as he is at the moment. He was out of the game for six months and it's probably the best thing... he hasn't had this much time to prepare for specific people, knowing if his forehand is working, if his backhand is working,“ the 78-year-old Laver, the only player to have won the calendar slam twice, said.
 
 Laver was excited about a renewal of the Roger-Rafa rivalry . “Federer coming at 35, playing some of his best   that I have seen in a long time, and Nadal ... yeah it would be nice to see them in the final again,“ Laver said.
 
 Nadal has a 23-11 edge over Federer in head to head and leads 6-2 in Grand Slam finals. The last time the two met in a major was at the same venue in 2014, which Nadal won 7-6, 6-3, 6-3 but Federer beat him in Basel 6-3, 5-7, 6-3 in the 2015 final.
 
 Emerson was categorical in his prediction that Federer would trump Nadal if they clashed in the final.“What has hurt Federer against Nadal is that the Spaniard puts really lot of spin on his forehand into Federer's backhand. And if the balls are not going to rise high it's not going to hurt.“
 
 Both Laver and Emerson were unanimous that Federer's improved backhand would be the key to tackling Nadal. Emerson said, “Federer has im proved his backhand out of sight. Even at 35 years of age he is hitting his backhand really , really well. He has not only added the slice, but he is coming over more consistently , and it's more of a weapon now.“
