 The weatherman has predicted more showers in the hilly areas in the next 48-hours. There would be snowfall in some regions of Uttarkashi, Pithoragarh, Rudraprayag, Bageshwar and Chamoli. The heat wave, however, continues unabated in the plains. Dehradun recorded 38 degrees Celsius and Pantnagar 40.4 degrees Celsius. The director of the Met Office at Dehradun, Vikram Singh said the showers were "pre-monsoonal" and during this period thunder storms and thunder showers were a normal phenomenon.
