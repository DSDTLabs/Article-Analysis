VADODARA: A remark from its most illustrious alumni has ensured that MSU guest house too becomes Wi-Fi enabled. It was in January last year that Nobel laureate   aka  , during his visit to his alma mater, had remarked that he wanted to stay in the campus but did not do so for want of Wi-Fi. 

 Citing his own example while talking on lack of infrastructure to engage Nobel laureates in the country, Venki had said that he had to shift to a hotel as the university guest house where arrangements were made for his stay did not have Wi-Fi facility. “Forget Nobel laureates, for any professor from the west this is the minimum standard required. This is a problem at Baroda university, other universities have their own set of problems,” he had said.
 
 “I still remember his remarks and I am happy to share that we have ensured that the Wi-Fi facility is available at our university guest house,” said MSU vice-chancellor professor Parimal Vyas, adding that nearly 300 guests will be able to register to access internet at the university guest house. tnn
