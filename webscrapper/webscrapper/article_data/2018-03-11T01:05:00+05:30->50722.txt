It isn’t unusual to bump into the much-loved and prolific author   on a walk in Landour, observing a wildflower or gazing at the snow-clad mountains. Bond has always loved to walk around the hill town, though his growing popularity has meant his walks in Mussoorie have become infrequent.

 The 83-year-old writer may not take rambling treks anymore but he is still active. Last year, he attended a dozen literature festivals in various parts of the country and released five books. Not only has he become a frequent flier, he walks around Delhi airport’s massive Terminal 3 without help. His grandson Rakesh pipes up to say Bond makes his own bed every morning.
 
 And no fad diets for him. “I am not a fussy eater at all. But yes, I love good food,” he chuckles. His favourite breakfast is fried eggs and buttered toast. Lunch and dinner are the usual — dal and rice, chapatti and sabzi. On special days he has chocolate cake, pulao and mutton curry, and fish and chips when he’s out at a restaurant.
 
 Bond, who was first published more than 65 years ago, still writes something every day. “I am still working pretty hard because I feel there is so much I could still write, and write better than I did in the past because there is always scope for improvement,” he says. 
 Does he feel ancient? “Not really. If you are reasonably healthy, it doesn’t matter how old you are. Age for me is all in the mind. I don’t feel any different,” he says.
