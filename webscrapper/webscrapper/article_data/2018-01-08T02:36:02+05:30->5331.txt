GHAZIABAD: Nearly 50 armed personnel from four police stations in Ghaziabad conducted a massive search operation in Niwari area on Sunday to nab robbers who had allegedly looted cash from a scrap dealer. The police searched for robbers in the vast canefields from 9.30am to 1.30pm, but failed to arrest them.

 The complainant, Munna, who is in his early 30s, had alleged that four men robbed him of Rs 10,000 when he was walking back home from Niwari to Dhaulri village in Meerut. The robbery took place around 8.30am on Sunday on Mohammadpur road which has canefields on either side of the road.
 
 “While walking, I saw a man standing on the road. He signalled me to stop. When I stopped, three more men emerged from the canefields and threatened me at gunpoint. They snatched Rs 10,000 from the pocket of my trouser and then escaped back into the fields,” the complainant said in his report.
 
 Munna soon told the locals about the robbery, who in turn informed the cops.
 
 Based on the complaint, an FIR was lodged against the four unknown men at Niwari police station.
 
 “The robbers could not be held despite a search operation lasting for four hours. Four SHOs and the   circle officer carried out the search. Presently, we have no leads about who the robbers were. The police in Meerut and   districts have been alerted. Several teams of police personnel in groups of two or three, have been deployed to conduct searches in the area,” SP (rural) Arvind Maurya told TOI.
