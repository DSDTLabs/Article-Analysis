CHANDIGARH: Projects developed in Design Innovation Centre were presented and displayed in the project advisory committee duly chaired by vice-chancellor of   (PU) Prof Arun Kumar Grover at   (UIET), Panjab University (PU), Chandigarh, on Thursday. P J Singh, CMD Tynore Orthotics Pvt. Ltd., who was also present at the meeting, signed an MoU for developing extensor glove for hypotonia patients. 

 The industry,   and GMCH, Sector-32 have been involved in the development of the Design Innovation Centre, where UIET, Panjab University, has developed 37 prototypes, some of which are clear dental aligner, bite force measuring device, dual extrusion 3D Printer, amid others. The products being developed are using latest technologies like neural networks, machine learning and deep learning. Some of the prototypes developed are already in use at PGIMER ,GMCH-32, Fortis Mohali and Dr Harbans Singh Judge   (HSJIDS), PU, Chandigarh. Besides this, software for automated creation of clear dental aligner as a cost effective and aesthetic solution to align the patient teeth, software for maxillofacial, craniofacial and oral reconstructions for trauma/cancer/accidental cases who have some damage in their face and skull have been developed. 
 
 Filament extrusion machine, motion analyzing glove for physiotherapist for accurate measurement of PIP finger joints, software for automated designing of foot orthotics for the patients to support their feet having irregularities because of birth defects or some injury, have been designed. Energy-saving smart switches have been designed which can be controlled by bluetooth, infra-red sensor and Wi-Fi.
