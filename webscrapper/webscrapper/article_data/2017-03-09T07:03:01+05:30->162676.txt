GURUGRAM: The next time you visit the  , a multi-coloured wall will greet you with visual messages on women’s empowerment.

 To raise awareness about women’s issues, school children painted graffiti on the walls of the commissioner’s office on International   on Wednesday. 
 
 The department hopes visitors to the building would look at these graffiti and get sensitised on issues related to women and traffic rules as well.
 
 The event was flagged off by police commissioner Sandeep Khirwar. “We chose the Government Girl’s School-Khandsa for this cause and gave the students an opportunity to imagine the messages visually about women’s safety and empowerment,” said ACP Manish Sehgal, spokesperson for the  .
 
 The messages on the wall were about social issues, including dowry, molestation, sexual harassment and stalking. They also contained stern warnings. In one painting, a person is seen behind bars, after he makes sexual advances towards a child.
 
 “The idea is to sensitise people by reiterating the message visually. The numbers are on one side, but to tackle a social problem, we have to try all means,” said Sehgal.
 
 Khirwar also interacted with children about a new feature which the Gurgaon police might introduce soon — a portable solar traffic light.
 
 “When the visibility reduces, it gets difficult for cops to regulate traffic on the road. This light might come handy in such a situation,” said Sehgal.
 
 As the city faces major traffic snarls in areas which are dug up because of construction work of underpasses, these might be used for the management of traffic, officials said.
