CHANDIGARH: Haryana became the fourth state to ban   on Tuesday, less than 10 days ahead of the release of Sanjay Leela  's controversial film on January 25. Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, which are also ruled by BJP, have already banned the film despite the censor board clearing it. However, the Aditya Nath Yogi government in Uttar Pradesh has decided not to ban the film.

 On Tuesday, the Haryana cabinet headed by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar formally approved the proposals made by two ministers   and Vipul Goel to ban the film in the state. "Film Padmavati/Padmaavat banned in Haryana," Vij tweeted on Tuesday.
 
  
  
 
 The film had faced stiff opposition from some BJP leaders in Haryana. In November, both Vij and Goel had urged information and broadcasting minister Smriti Irani to ban the film.
 
 Controversial Haryana BJP leader Suraj Pal Amu, who had quit as party's chief media coordinator in November, had led protests against the film and had even offered 10 crore as "reward to behead" Bhansali and the film's lead actor  . Accusing the Haryana CM of "humiliating" the Rajput community, Amu had called him "arrogant".
 Amu had organised meetings in districts like Panchkula and Bhiwani in which he was critical of the Haryana government. Other Rajput leaders like Deva Thakur too had announced that they would launch a strike against the film.
