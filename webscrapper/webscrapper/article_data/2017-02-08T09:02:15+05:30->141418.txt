NASHIK: Before the  , official candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party ( ) from prabhag 14 Ahmed Raza Kazi withdrew his   form on Tuesday.

 On the last day of   of nomination forms, Raza cited reasons of being sidelined by the party. “There were a lot of issues with the distribution of AB forms. The party looks at minority as an option. I found that the Sena candidate in this prabhag is stronger,” he said, adding that he will now support   candidate Shaikh Haji Shaikh Mujahid.
 
 Mujahid is known in the political circles and has been especially close to the Shiv Sena. He expressed his happiness with the support and said that his party will definitely win the civic elections.
 
 Raza’s withdrawal leaves the BJP with three candidates in prabhag 14 now. 
 
 Chief of the Municipal Workers’ Sena and sitting corporator,   said, “They (BJP) have been responsible for making 10 of our candidates invalid. Now, three of their candidates are supporting us.” Apart from Raza, two more BJP candidates will support them.
 
 An officer bearer of BJP said that Raza’s withdrawal will not make a difference to their vote bank. “As far as Sena’s accusation over the AB form goof up goes, our MLA has already said that they were unable to procure and submit the forms,” said the leader.
 
 On Wednesday, a decision will be taken on the Shiv Sena’s request of giving the party symbol to 10 candidates who will contest independently.
