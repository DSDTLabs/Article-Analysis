NEW DELHI: Around 9,000   and 5,000   will be deployed at the upcoming   stations to keep them safe and hassle-free.

 The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which is in charge of security at  , said that it has requested the ministry of home affairs to sanction deployment of 5,000 personnel to provide security cover at 92 stations of the upcoming corridors of Delhi Metro as part of its Phase III project. 
 
 Apart from CISF personnel, 62 trained security dogs and eight teams of bomb disposal squads would also be deployed for the upcoming corridors, which will open this year. At present, 7,524   provide security at the 168 stations of Delhi Metro.
 
 “We have already deputed 1,400 personnel at the 28 stations of Phase III that have opened, primarily at the Violet Line (Kashmere Gate-Escorts Mujesar),” said a senior CISF official. CISF would also deploy more personnel at the Majlis Park-Durgabai Deshmukh South Campus section of Pink Line that is going to open from Wednesday.
 
 According to CISF, the Phase III stations of Delhi Metro, some of which are already operational and rest would open this year, are the most fool proof ones from security point of view compared to the Phase I and II stations. CISF took over the security of Delhi Metro on April 15, 2007. 
 
 At its annual press conference on Friday, CISF also said that the recent initiative to limit the size of baggage carried by passengers to 15 kg has also proved successful.
