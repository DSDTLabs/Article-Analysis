IDUKKI:   leaders are planning to end their protest and begin a land agitation instead. Adivasi Gothra Maha Sabha leader M Geethanandan will announce it on Friday at Munnar.

The minister implied that they were engaged in drinking and immoral activities under the guise of protest.

 Meanwhile, the UDF will conduct a cultural event and meeting at Munnar on Friday evening to express solidarity with Pembilai Orumai’s protest.   leaders Lathika Subhash, Shanimol Usman, Idukki DCC president Ibrahimkutty Kallar and MLA PT Thomas will lead the programme.
