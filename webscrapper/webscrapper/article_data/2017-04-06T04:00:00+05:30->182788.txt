Chennai: Barely a year after salon chain Naturals acquired Vyomo, to offer home salon services, it has quietly shut down the services due to poor patronage. The transaction cost was Rs 100 crore and was effective April last year. 

 CK Kumaravel, co-founder, Naturals said that @home services, which were seeing close to 50 orders a day initially are seeing 15 orders only now and it was not economically viable to sustain a separate vertical with a backend team managing it.
 
 “We were expecting along the lines of 3,000 orders a month, which itself was conservative. The number of orders was going further down since demonetisation; we were able to make a meagre 5% of the expected target. People wanted a salon experience and our home based services could not measure up,” he said, adding that the few orders are largely from nursing and expectant mothers who cannot come to the salon. The chain continues to take orders at home but they are routed through the outlets.
 
 Business started crumbling and there have been allegations of the salon chain defaulting in payments to the vendors owing to the drop in the number of orders. “Payments have not come in for the past few months. They kept passing the buck when we reminded them to pay up and the point of contact changed each time,” said a vendor who did not wish to be named. Kumaravel admitted to facing some issues and is hopeful of resolving them in the next couple of months. 
 
 While he says that employees of @home have been absorbed into the salon business, the app is no longer operational. “The founders of Vyomo are no longer a part of Naturals @home,” he added.
 
 Abhinav Khare, co-founder, Vyomo, said that he had parted ways at the end of their lock out period in October 2016. “I am employed in a tech fund now and I left the @home set up after six months since the acquisition,” he added. The other co-founder Akash Bhunchal also left post the lockout.
