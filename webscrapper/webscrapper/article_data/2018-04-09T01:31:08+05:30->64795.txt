 During peak hours — 7am to 10am and 5pm to 9pm — there will be three trains every hour, or a train every 20 minutes. Two trains will depart at off-peak hours. Passenger capacity will initially be 750 per train and it will be increased to 1,250 later.

 NHSRC operations officials said the   will soon float a tender to shifting the container and locomotive workshop, to make way for the elevated station. The bullet train will have a design speed of 350kmph and a top operating speed of 320kmph. 
 
 Trains currently plying the route take about seven hours to travel the distance, while flights takes about one hour.
 
 Indian Railways operates about 20 trains between the two cities every day. There are also 10 flights between the cities. “We are planning to have 35 pairs of bullet train services, which means the trains will make 70 trips a day,” an NHSRC official said.
