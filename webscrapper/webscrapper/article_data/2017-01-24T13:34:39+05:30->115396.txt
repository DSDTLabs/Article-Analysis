 'The same team that was behind ensuring that the Tamil film   made it to the Oscars last year is the muscle behind ensuring eligibility for our film in the Best Adapted Screenplay category. They are handling the publicity abroad, and securing theatres to screen our film there, apart from other necessities to ensure that we are eligible to be considered for the Oscars. We have crossed the first step and made it to the long list. After this, there will be three rounds of selections, and other rounds of considerations.'
 
 
  
 Speaking about the category of selection, director   explains, 'Some reports suggested that Pushpaka Vimana is a remake, but that is not true. I am a film buff and a big fan of world cinema. I have been in the film industry for eight years, but didn't get a chance to work with an established director, so I learnt the art by watching international films. I referred to many of them to see the relationship between a father and son/daughter, and even that of a mentally-challenged man ' the characteristics of my leading man. That is when I noticed that the character I wrote had many similarities to that of the protagonist in the Korean film, Miracle in Cell No. 7. I have adapted some parts of that movie, Life is Beautiful and The Pursuit of Happyness in Pushpaka Vimana. We waited for a while to reveal this fact as we were securing the rights for Miracle in Cell No. 7.'
