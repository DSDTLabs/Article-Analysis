 It was a mega event that was not just a riot of colours but was about about our rich culture. This year too the celebrations witnessed thousands of woman on scooters and motor bikes participating in the shobhayatras wearing gorgeous traditional costumes. Women in bikes and scooters were dressed in the traditional Maharashtrian nauvaris (nine-yard saris).  
	
	 






	
	 





 The processions across the city saw participation of men, women as well as kids from all communities. There were shobhayatras in Girgaon, Dadar, Thane and Dombivli which are known to be opulent, with as many as 40, 000 people participating in it.  
	
	 





 The rehearsals for this event had begun at least two months ago for most of the groups. There are over 60 different groups across the city that participate in the celebrations. 
	
	 





 Thousands of people gathered on Thane’s roads to watch the various performances of malkhamb, nashik dhols, pathaks and more. The event had people carrying saffron flags and traditional armour as they marched all over Thane’s roads to celebrate Gudi Padwa.
