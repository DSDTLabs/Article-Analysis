JALANDHAR: Describing steep   as a ‘parting gift’ of the BJP-led NDA government to the people,   president   on Friday said the Centre had already ruined the country’s economy with measures like demonetization.

 He said by increasing the petrol and diesel rates to an unprecedented level, the Union government is further exacerbating the situation.
 
 Jakhar also challenged the SAD to leave the Union cabinet to build pressure on the   government against the fuel price hike.
 
 Earlier, Jakhar rode a bullock cart as part of a protest near the   Bhawan where local party activists burnt an effigy of the Union government.
 
 Addressing a press conference along with local bodies’ minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, Jakhar said the NDA government has betrayed the people of the country at every step.
 
 He said though Congress had planned nationwide protests on Saturday, they held the protest here a day in advance in view of busy schedule of leaders for the Shahkot byelection.
 
 “If SAD is even slightly sincere towards the farmers, then it should ask Union minister Harsimrat Badal to resign so that pressure can be built on the Modi government,” he said. He said “But come what may Badals cannot leave the ministerial berth as enjoying power at the Centre is the most important thing for them.”
 
 He said with rates of petrol and diesel spiraling, the countdown of NDA government had started. Jakhar also urged opposition parties to unite to fight the BJP.
 
 Sidhu said petrol and diesel prices should also be brought under the GST. “Even if they put it under 28% slab in GST, which is highest, the petrol price can’t be higher than Rs 55 per litre,” he argued.
 
 “Dr   was a great arthshastri (economist), but those running the government now can be called anarthshastri (expert in ruining) or viyarthshastri (good for nothing),” he quipped.
