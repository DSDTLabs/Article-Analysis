MUMBAI: The number of   on the   has gone up by 22% in 2016-17 over the previous year. This comes at a time when the government has been pushing for cashless transactions.

 A reply to a query put up under the   issued by Mratunjay Tewari, joint general manager (information technology) of Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC), states that the number of failed transactions touched nearly 1.02 crore in 2016-17 as compared to 83.64 lakh in 2015-16. About 55% of the total railway ticket bookings are done through the online booking system.
 
 A few regular users of the ticket booking website said that the railways need more advanced technology to ensure that the number of failed transactions is reduced to zero.
 
 Dombivli resident Rakesh Daftary, who procured this information under the Act, said that he had reserved three berths from Kalyan to Coimbatore. “I encountered three failed transactions due to which money was deducted from my bank account, but no ticket was booked,“ Daftary said.
 
 Money deducted on failed transactions is credited back to the user's account in three or four days.
 
 Mira Road resident Sohail Ahmed said his son booked a ticket which turned out to be a failed transaction. “After that, we could not book a ticket at once as there wasn't enough balance in the account.“
 
 IRCTC's public relations officer Sandeep Datta said, “We are aware of the problem and working on introducing a better system.“ He suggested that passengers load money in the IRCTC wallet to “ensure almost no failed transactions.“
 
 However, Daftary asked why such problems do not crop up while booking flight tickets, for instance.
