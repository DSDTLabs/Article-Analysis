 In April, a few residents, including screenwriter Salim Khan and actor Waheeda Rehman, had written to the BMC opposing its plan to instal a public toilet on the Bandra Bandstand promenade. In his letter to the local ward officer, the mayor said, “I have attached the letter sent by Salim Khan wherein he has brought my attention to the public toilet erected at Bandra Banstand. Every day, several walkers pass by the spot and this could inconvenience them... the walkers have demanded that the toilet be relocated. Please take the required action against the issues mentioned in the letter.” 
 
 Ughade said, “We had surveyed the area and identified certain crowded locations to provide urinals. In the first phase, we plan to erect portable urinals at Bandstand, Linking Road and Hill Road. Residents are worried that the urinals will not be maintained, but we have made all provisions, including sewerage line, water and electricity connections. We will also look into problems that develop after they urinals are operational.” The BMC plans to soon have a discussion with the residents.
 
 Among the other sites ide-ntified for portable loos are another spot at Bandstand near Bandra Fort, Carter Road and near the railway station.
