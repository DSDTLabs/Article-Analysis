 In an exclusive interaction with TOI Entertainment, veteran actor Shakti Kapoor shared how he wished his daughter   missed a chance of working with an icon. "Shraddha is very unlucky that she didn't get a chance to work with such a handsome man. She wished he (Vinod Khanna) played her father in some movie of hers. He was the most good looking man on earth, who was very close to her father and helped her father so much. It's me who's more broken as he helped me in the journey to become Shakti Kapoor."
  
 While the 58-year-old actor grieved the loss of the Bollywood legend’s life, he recalled a story of Vinod Khanna’s magnanimity. He said, "There are few people who were that close to Vinod ji and his family like I was. I have lived in his house for six years when I was doing a film called 'Qurbaani' which was my first major break. He gave me place to stay when I had no money as he came to know I had no place to stay. I was trouble as I was moving from one place to another. Then one day he told me that he had a huge apartment in Juhu which was vacant and that was like heaven for me. He used to pay the electricity bills and the maintenance. He was the man with a big heart."
  
 While many know of his bond with the star, what fans don't know is that Shakti Kapoor shared a great bond of friendship with both of his sons Rahul and  . The trio catch up on life and more from time to time.
