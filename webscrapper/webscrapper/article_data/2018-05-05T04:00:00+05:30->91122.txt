Mumbai:  , which last year entered the consumer and   lending space through its fully owned subsidiary  , on Friday raised Rs 2,000 crore from marquee foreign investors through a preferential offer at Rs 450 per share. 

 Among the funds that invested in the fundraising process were   (run by billionaire investor George Soros),   (one of Facebook’s early investors), Steadview Capital (which was an early investor in Ola Cabs), DFS Dragoneer (an early investor in  ) and Chandler, one of the largest FPIs investing in the financial sector in India, sources said.
 
 The latest round of fund infusion by IVL Finance came close on the heels of its Rs 2,000-crore rights offer less than two months ago. Sources said that against its Rs 2,000-crore offering, the demand for its stocks was for about Rs 3,300 crore. Strong opportunities in India’s consumer lending space, combined with the execution capabilities of the Indiabulls group, attracted such marquee investors to the offer. Data show that compared to China’s personal loan market which is worth about $5 trillion, India’s is just about $40 billion, meaning China’s market is 125 times India’s. However, the size of China’s economy is just about fives times India’s. Analysts believe that the consumer lending opportunity in India is vast and the industry is at the cusp of explosive growth, sources said.
 
 In Friday’s relatively week market, the IVL stock closed 1.8% lower at Rs 488.
