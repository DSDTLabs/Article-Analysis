NEW DELHI:   on Tuesday claimed that   vice-president   had violated the   by linking his party symbol 'hand' with various religious figures and urged the   (EC) to freeze the symbol.

 A party delegation led by Union minister Prakash Javadekar and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi along with office-bearers Anil Jain and Sidharth Nath Singh lodged a complaint with the EC against Rahul. 
 
 "The grand old party Congressâ€™s grand new leader has tried to give communal colour to the elections by his statement in which he co-related the Congress's 'hand' (party symbol) with various religious figures. This is a clear cut case of corrupt practice," Naqvi told reporters.
 
 At Congress's 'Jan Vedna Sammelan' earlier this month, Rahul had made comments co-relating his party's symbol with gods, violating the provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, model code of conduct and the SC guidelines, BJP said in its complaint.
