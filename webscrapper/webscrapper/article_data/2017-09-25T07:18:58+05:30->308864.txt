HYDERABAD: The   working in government colleges here on Sunday demanded job security and implementation of GO 16, which was issued to regularise their services. They said that the government should take steps to pay them salaries for 12 months, instead of 10 months.

 “From the day the government announced that teachers will be promoted as lecturers, we are afraid that we may lose our   any day . This move could effectively cost nearly 2,000 lecturers their jobs. So, even if the government is not willing to regularize our jobs, they should provide us with some kind of job security ,“ said   , president of the Telangana Government Colleges' Contract Lecturer Association at their state council meeting.
 
 He further said that they were forced to forego two months' salary every year and urged the government to treat them on par with regular employees and pay them salary for the entire year. They also demanded financial support to the families of contract lecturers, who lost their lives while in service. “The families of contract lecturers, who died in the past few years, have not even received any monetary support. Apart from monetary aid, we should be provided health insurance,“ said K  , general secretary of the association.
 
 Mid-day meal scheme announced three years ago is yet to be implemented in junior colleges. The move will help in attracting more students to government colleges, the association said. “During the admission time, when we go for door-to-door campaign asking parents to enrol their wards in our colleges, they are questioning us why the mid-day meal scheme is not being implemented.Most parents say they would rather admit their children in residential colleges where students get food. Unless the mid-day meal scheme is implemented, the position of junior colleges will not improve,“ said S   from the association.
