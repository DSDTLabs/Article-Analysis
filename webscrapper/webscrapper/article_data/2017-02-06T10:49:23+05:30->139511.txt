DEHRADUN: A day after the BJP released its poll manifesto for the hill state, chief minister   said that the manifesto was a compilation of schemes which have already been started by the   government.
 
  The BJP manifesto promised free laptops and smartphones to underprivileged meritorious students and appointment of   within 100 days of coming to power besides other things.
  
  Taking a dig at the BJP for terming its manifesto a “vision document”, Rawat said, “A day before our friends released their manifesto, which they have termed as vision document, but it is a blurred vision. There is a lack of commitment in their manifesto. A manifesto is binding. A vision is an indication and after 16 years of existence the state needs a road map and not an indication.”
  
  The CM said that with its manifesto the opposition party has officially endorsed the projects initiated in his tenure. “The Congress government is already distributing laptops to meritorious students through the education department and the social welfare department. The government on its part has completed all formalities for the appointment of Lokayukta. So what is new in the vision document of the BJP? It is simply the duplication of Congress projects,” Rawat said.
