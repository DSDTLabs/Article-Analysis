GANDHINAGAR: The Estimates Committee of the   has sought action against   (AMC) for exposing lakhs of citizens, living near Pirana garbage dump, to toxic smoke for three decades. The committee has accused the   of “negligence and doing little to mitigate a public health hazard.” (The committee scrutinises government policies and administrative actions.) 

 The policy audit body has also pointed out that the leachate — water leaking through Pirana mound — from the 75 lakh tonnes of waste is now polluting even groundwater. This water is pumped out by private boring installed in nearby residential areas.
 
 In its report tabled in the state assembly, the committee has said that during its visit to the Pirana landfill and surrounding areas, the panel had noted that the site was a serious health hazard. 
 
 “It’s not only releasing toxic elements hazardous to people but also polluting the river and nearby water bodies,” the panel has stated in its report. 
 
 It has further said that the site should have been closed earlier. The site has now turned into a mountain and has garbage many times more than its capacity. “The constant fire and smoke is causing hazardous air pollution in the area,” the report states.
 
 Apart from demanding closure of the Pirna landfill site, the Estimates Committee has also sought upgrading of the facilities of central effluent treatment plant around Ahmedabad to ensure that untreated toxic effluent does not flow downstream into the Sabarmati. Apart from action against the AMC, the committee has asked the civic body to follow waste management rules of 2001. Urban local bodies are not following the set guidelines for garbage disposal even for Pirana site.
 
 An independent research has claimed that landfill leachates that seep into groundwater contain toxic compounds like plasticizers (phthalates, benzenesulfonamides), phenolic antioxidants, chlorinated phenols.
