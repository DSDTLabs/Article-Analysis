 "It's going to be a great event. And people will be talking about it. We're a modern family, and I think people need to see, and I want to normalise the beauty of our family. That's why I'm making it public and I'm going to share my wedding with the world," Martin said.
 
 The 'Livin' La Vida Loca' hitmaker and his fiance are currently planning their invitations, and have yet to decide on a location for their wedding.
 
 "Right now we're just dealing with the invitations and everything. We also have to deal with the fact that most of my fiance's family is from Syria. So maybe they won't be able to come into this country. So we might consider doing it in Stockholm or in Spain.
