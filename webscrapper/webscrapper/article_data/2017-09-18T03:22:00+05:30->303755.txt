Panaji: The Union home ministry may have cancelled the license of the Indira Gandhi National Open University (Ignou), under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, but this development is in no way concerned with Ignou’s academic activities, official sources in Goa said.  All Ignou programmes will continue as scheduled. “These are only administrative procedures and have nothing to do with academics. Organisations are required to file a ‘nil report’ if they have not received any foreign fundings during the year. But, this procedure may not have been followed,” sources said. In the July 2017 admission session itself, 5,511 students enrolled for the Ignou programmes in Goa. Of these, 3,720 are new students. From Goa, 2,368 registered in July for graduate degree programmes, 1,609 for masters degree programmes and another 1,500 for postgraduate diploma, diploma, and certificate courses. The Union home ministry has cancelled licences of 4,842 NGOs and organisations, including Ignou recently, under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act for failing to file annual returns from 2010-11 to 2014-15 despite reminders. A list by University Grants Commission’s distance education bureau released in October last year shows that there is not a single institute in Goa authorized to run distance education programmes.  This makes Ignou the only authorized body to offer courses of higher education through distance mode in the state.
