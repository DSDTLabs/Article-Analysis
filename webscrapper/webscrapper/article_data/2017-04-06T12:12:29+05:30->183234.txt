According to a report in Mumbai Mirror, Sidharth Malhotra’s hair has been giving troubles during the shoot of his upcoming movie ‘Reloaded’. Apparently, there are continuity issues which could turn out to be a major blunder if left unnoticed.

Since, Sidharth sports a crew cut in the remake of the cult movie ‘Ittefaq’, this is creating continuity problems for ‘Reloaded’. 
 
 The source revealed to the daily that due to the unprecedented “hair” issue, the promotional song will be shot just before the release of the movie.
