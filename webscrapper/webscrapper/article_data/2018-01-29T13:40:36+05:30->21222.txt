  Parag Madhukar Dhakate, conservator of forests, Western Circle, Kumaon division, told TOI, “Samples of pug marks, droppings and hair remains of the animal have been sent to the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, for tests. It has not been determined whether the deaths were caused by a leopard or a tiger.”
  
  The forest staff said that the animal which is responsible for the deaths is active in a 20km radius in the locality.
