Having made a splash at the Indian box office, 'Padmaavat' has reportedly overtaken the highest Saturday collection for a Hindi film in the US and Canada.
 Ajit Andhare, COO, Viacom18 Motion Pictures, the studio backing the movie, says, “We are overwhelmed and humbled with the response received by our film from audiences across the globe. Treading on a path to break records set by giants like 'Dangal' and ' ', 'Padmaavat' continues to create milestones, especially in international markets. Domestic trends are outstanding, despite the film not playing at all in three states and releasing partly in two through the holiday weekend. The strategy to widely distribute the film using Paramount in select international markets and going direct in others, while exhibiting in multiple languages and formats like 3D and IMAX 3D have added that extra punch. We hope it will turn out to be a landmark film in Hindi cinema.”
 'Padmaavat', produced by Viacom18 Motion Pictures and Bhansali Productions, is playing worldwide in 2D, 3D and IMAX 3D.
