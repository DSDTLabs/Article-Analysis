PUNE:   from Bhavani Peth and Yerawada areas have tested positive for   at a   this month.

 “Five people have tested positive for leptospirosis in July. Among them, four were residents of Pune city, two each from Yerawada and Bhavani Peth, while the fifth one was from Baramati,” a state health official said. Incidentally, civic health officials were clueless about the four cases when TOI contacted them. “As per our information, there is only one confirmed case of leptospirosis. A Warje man who died of the disease is the sole case so far,” infectious diseases expert Sudhir Patsute, in-charge of the PMC’s disease surveillance cell, said.
 
 Incidentally, when TOI reported about the death of the leptospirosis on July 10, even then the civic health officials were clueless about it. It was only after the TOI report that the officials initiated surveillance and preventive measures. “Leptospirosis is grossly under reported due to lack of awareness about it among medical professionals and difficulties in diagnosis,” another state health department official said. 
 
 In cities, rodents that infest the sewage system with free living animals act as carriers. Even light showers choke the poorly maintained drainage systems leading to flooding. This causes a spurt in leptospirosis cases in the monsoon.
