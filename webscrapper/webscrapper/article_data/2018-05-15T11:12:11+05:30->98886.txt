PUNE: A 20-year-old thief’s plan to extort money from a techie in return for the latter’s valuables was foiled by GPS tracking technology.

 
  
 
 Instead of cash landing in his pocket, the suspect — who had stashed the loot in the cloakroom of the   — landed in the police net on Sunday. 
 
 Buddhadev Bishnu   had on Thursday stolen cash, foreign currency, a laptop, a cellphone and two tablet devices from Sandip Patil’s house in Dattawadi. The police tracked him down using the location finding service on one of the tablets. 
 
 On Thursday, Biswas was passing by Patil’s house when he saw a window open. “Biswas managed to open the lock of the door through the window and fled with the bag,” said assistant inspector Ganesh Kharage of Nigdi police. 
 
 The bag contained Rs1,650 in cash, 2,100 US dollars, 250 euros, a laptop, two tablet devices, an international driving licence, debit and credit cards and a European health card. He also stole a cellphone. 
 
 Patil, upon discovering the theft, called his cellphone and came in contact with Biswas, police said. 
 
 By then, Biswas had stored the bag in the cloakroom. “He demanded Rs20,000 from Patil in exchange for the valuables. He even threatened to destroy everything otherwise,” Kharage added.
 
 Meanwhile, Patil lodged a police complaint. “We discovered that one of stolen tablets was on and traced its location to the railway station on Sunday morning,” Kharage said.
 
 “We noticed a person drying his clothes near platform number one. When we started questioning him, the suspect ran away. We chased and caught him,” Kharage said.
 
 The police found a cloakroom receipt on Biswas and recovered the bag with its contents intact, Kharage added.
 
 According to the police, Biswas had recently quit his job as a waiter in a restaurant in Pimpri Chinchwad. He needed money to return to his native West Bengal and took this step.
