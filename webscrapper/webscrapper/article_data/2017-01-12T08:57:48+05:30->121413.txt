PANAJI: In an interesting twist to the poll scenario in the capital city,   candidate for Panaji constituency Krishnaraj ‘Raju’ Sukerkar may withdraw from the contest on “health grounds”. 

 Sukerkar told TOI that he was admitted in a Mumbai hospital due to high stress levels and had been advised to undergo medical tests. He had undergone some tests on Wednesday and it would take him another day or two to complete the remaining tests. “I’ve not withdrawn from Panaji. I will decide by end of the week,” he said.
 
  president Anand Shirodkar as well as alliance partner and   (MGP) president Pandurang ‘Deepal’ Dhavalikar also told TOI that a decision on Sukerkar’s withdrawal would be taken in a couple of days. 
 
 If Sukerkar withdraws, MGP may field its own candidate. “We are thinking on those lines,” Dhavalikar said.
 
 Sukerkar’s candidature on defence minister and former Goa CM Manohar Parrikar’s home ground had rattled the  .
 
  Sukerkar, a close friend of Parrikar, had switched alliance when former Goa RSS chief Subhash Velingkar parted ways with the parivar over medium of instruction issue to float his own party. 
 
 Sukerkar had maintained that friendship and politics were separate and he was fully committed to taking on the BJP and its sitting MLA Siddarth Kuncalienker. Panaji is considered to be Parrikar’s turf from where he was elected a record five times to the assembly. 
 
 But Sukerkar’s entry had jolted BJP as it would have given an edge to former   MLA Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate, who is planning to contest on   ticket in alliance with Congress. Retaining Panaji seat, a source said, was a matter of prestige more for Parrikar rather than the BJP.
