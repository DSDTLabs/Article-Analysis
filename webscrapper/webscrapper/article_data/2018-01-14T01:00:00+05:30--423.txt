The crew of ' ' is looking forward to the film’s second schedule, which is expected to roll at a foreign location soon. For the first time,   and  , the two heroines of the film, will face the camera together. Diana, who played the title role in the original and shot for the first schedule of the sequel last year, asserts that she’s excited to team up with Sonakshi, the new ‘Happy’ in the story, to be directed by Mudassar Aziz. Says Diana, “We have just met a few times but we’ve never worked together. It will be a lot of fun. She seems like a very cool person to work with, so bring it on.”

 The first film revolved around a girl who runs away from her wedding. The situational comic-drama featured Abhay Deol, Ali Fazal and Jimmy Sheirgill, and was among the box office surprises of the year in 2016. A year later, the makers decided to take the story forward with additional new members in the cast. Given how the first part fared, is there a pressure now to outshine the first film with the second?   says, “People didn’t know what to expect from 'Happy Bhaag Jayegi' but that’s a great place to be in. It was Happy’s journey and it was a strong character to play. Writers are sketching characters that are stronger and more real. Today, if you ask me, I feel a greater sense of responsibility towards the film. No one would make a sequel, if didn’t make commercial sense. I don’t feel any pressure because like the first film, Mudassar has written the sequel very well. It’s just as funny and has layers to it. Our first schedule was like a batch reunion. The next schedule will be a lot more fun with the new members joining in.”
