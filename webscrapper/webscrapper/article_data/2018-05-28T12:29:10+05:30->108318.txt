Canadian singer-songwriter   is in awe of American   John Mayer, who he said always tries to keep learning to grow more.

 According to a report, Mendes met Mayer in 2016, and calls him one of "really, really good friends".
 
  
  
 "The most incredible thing I learned from (him) is that no matter how much experience you have, you never are done learning; there's always something to be learned," said Mendes, who released his self-titled album 'Shawn Mendes' last week.
 
 Citing an example, Mendes said, "John will send me new music and ask me what I think? When that happened to me the first time, I was so impressed that he didn't see himself as a master yet. He's always trying to learn and wants to get better; he always wants to grow with the people and not get left behind."
 
 It was in April 2017 that the two first performed together at Mayer's concert in Toronto, collaborating on a duet mash-up of Mendes'   and Mayer's  
 
 Since then, Mayer has become a mentor to Mendes.
 
 "He's a badass," said Mendes, adding, "He's just so smart and intellectual. He has a very interesting view on the world â€” a view I've never heard from anyone else."
 
 "Our friendship has just begun and there's a lot to happen in the future," Mendes said.
