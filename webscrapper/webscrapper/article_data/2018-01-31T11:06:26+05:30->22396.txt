GURUGRAM: The   chargesheet filed on Monday against four members of the axle gang in the Dingerheri double murder and gang rape case brought some relief to the family members of the four other persons who were arrested by   in the same case earlier. 

  The relatives, expressing hope that their children will be freed as the CBI has made no reference of them in the chargesheet, plan to move the high court for their bail on February 2.
 
 However, the next discharge hearing in the case has been scheduled on February 27. 
 
  
  The families of the four boys — Sandeep, Amarjeet, Karamjeet and Rahul Verma, all residents of Mohammadpur Ahir villagein Mewat — have claimed that despite being innocent they have been languishing behind the bars for the past 17 months. “We knew our boys were innocent and the CBI chargesheet has proven that again. They faced hell for last 17 months because cops were too eager to solve the case and get appreciation. We hope to see them free soon though it will take years for the trauma to fade from our memories,” said Karamjeet Yadav, a relative of two accused. 
 
  
  “In the charge sheet, CBI attached the DNA and fingerprint reports of the four accused of the axle gang identified as Dharmu alias Hemant, Munna alias Ayan, Lambu alias Vinay and Jai Bhagwan which has matched. We will now file the bail application in the high court on Friday,” Yadav added. 
 
  
  “My son and three others are lodged in Ambala jail and are waiting for their discharge. Police had framed them and we now want justice as the actual accused have confessed and the CBI has filed the charge sheet against them,” said Brahmjeet, father of Karamjeet. It may be noted that, on August 24, 2016 a 40-year-old farmer and his wife were beaten to death and their two nieces were gang raped by four armed men, who barged into the house in Dingerheri, near Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) expressway.
