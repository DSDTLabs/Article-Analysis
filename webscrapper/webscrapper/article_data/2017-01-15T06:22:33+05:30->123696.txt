In Fazilka, former MLA Mohinder Rinwa has decided to contest as an independent candidate after the party denied the ticket to him. In Maur, Punjab Congress secretary   and party leader Sukhraj Singh Natt have raised a banner of revolt.
 
 Going by the strong opposition to the candidature of former MLA Nirmal Singh Nimma from Bhadaur (reserve) assembly in Barnala district, the party withdrew his name on Friday and announced Jaitu MLA Joginder Singh Panjgraian as its nominee.
 
 In Kotkapura, former Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLA Harnirpal Singh Kuku is the Congress candidate. When his name was announced on Wednesday, many Congress workers opposed his candidature. “We are hurt over the party allotting the ticket to an outsider. Few days ago, we had apprised the party high command of the party workers in Kotkapura opposing an outsider as the nominee from the constituency. We will decide our next course on Sunday,” Sandhu said.
 
 Congress has opted for SAD’s Ferozepur MP Sher Singh Ghubaya’s son   Ghubaya, overlooking Rinwa. Upset with the party decision, Rinwa said, “We will not accept the ticket to a turncoat. I have decided to contest as an independent.”
 
 In Maur, the party ticket has been allotted to Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh’s close relative and three-time MLA Harminder Singh Jassi. Gora and Natt said, “Ticket to outsider Jassi is not acceptable to us. We have lodged a strong protest before the party high command and will decide the next course in a day or two.”
