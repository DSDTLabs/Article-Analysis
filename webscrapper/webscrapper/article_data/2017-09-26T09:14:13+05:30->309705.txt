LUCKNOW:   and   dazzled under the lights as they put   in the driver's seat against   on the opening day of their   final. Both scored chanceless hundreds and were involved in a 211-run partnership for the third wicket as the Reds went to stumps at a comfortable 317 for five after Karthik won the toss and elected to bat on Monday .

 Shaw once again displayed why he is hailed as the next batting superstar to emerge from the fertile stables of Mumbai. He scored a sublime 154 to grab the spotlight at the Ekana International Cricket Stadium.
 
 Shaw's debut century also puts him in a select group of two more players -Sachin Tendulkar and   -who have scored centuries on debut both in the   and Duleep Trophy . He also became the second youngest after Tendulkar to score a century on debut in Duleep Trophy . Tendulkar also scored a hundred on his   debut.
 
 Displaying a kind of maturity that belied his age, the 17-year-old Mumbai lad had comp ete control over proceedings. The only risky shot he played before reaching hundred, was on 99. He flashed hard to a short delivery from Ishant Sharma to send the ball flying over slips for a boundary . Gaining in confidence in the company of Karthik, Shaw kept accumulating runs at a fast clip and his vigil ended a few minutes before close when he edged a Bhargav Bhatt delivery that spun and bounces to keeper KS Bharat. But, before that, he struck 18 boundaries and a six during his 249-ball stay .
