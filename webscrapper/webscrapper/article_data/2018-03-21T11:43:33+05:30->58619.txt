HYDERABAD: The land pooling exercise undertaken by Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) at   and   (Medipally) has run into hurdles owing to the presence of assigned land, forcing   to seek government's approval. The municipal administration and urban development department has already written to the revenue department, seeking advance possession of the assigned lands to HMDA so that it can go ahead with land pooling. 

 HMDA, which had carried out the Uppal Bhagat land pooling successfully, is also in the final stage of taking written consent from farmers and land owners in Pratapasingaram. 
 
 HMDA commissioner T Chiranjeevulu told TOI: "At Medipally, we are looking at 360 acres of land pooling and 520 acres at Dundigal. In both the areas, there are assigned lands. Though assignees have come forward, we have to get the nod of the state government." 
 
 After striking consent agreements with land owners, HMDA is planning to develop roads and other amenities. The ratio of developed land sharing between HMDA and land owners will be based on current market value. Out of one acre of land (4,840 square yards) after roads and amenities are developed, land left for plotting will be 2,800 square yards. 
 
 A senior official of HMDA told TOI, "Assignees cannot transfer or sell the land. Because of this, development has taken a back seat in these areas. So, they have come forward for land pooling with HMDA which will enable them get legal right to sell the plots after their development." It may be recalled the government issued guidelines for land pooling on December 7 last year. 
 
 In Pratapasingaram, HMDA is working on over 160 acres. The commissioner held a meeting with the landowners who gave an oral consent for land pooling. HMDA is also working on land pooling at   near Keesara where land pooling for 200 acres is on the cards. HMDA has also identified Gourelli in Hayatnagnar mandal and   in Ghatkesar mandal for land pooling.
