VIJAYAWADA: The five YSRC MPs in the Lok Sabha will go on an indefinite hunger strike in Delhi on the last day of the budget session once the Parliament is adjourned.

 Party president Y S Jaganmohan Reddy, who is currently on his Sankalpa Padayatra in Guntur district, made this announcement at Parecherla village.
 
 He said that the MPs will submit their resignation to the Lok Sabha speaker on the last day of the session, as decided earlier. After this, they will head to the AP Bhavan in a procession and start the indefinite hunger strike seeking Special Category Status (SCS).
 
 “Party leaders in AP will hold relay hunger strike in all the 175 Assembly constituencies. This will include students from various colleges and universities in support of the indefinite fast of the MPs,” Jagan said.
 
 Jagan has also asked the ruling   (TDP) to support the movement. He has urged CM N Chandrababu Naidu to make his TDP MPs quit the Lok Sabha in support of the demand and join the indefinite hunger strike.
 
 “The fight will definitely mount pressure on the Centre to accept the demand and grant the special status to AP,” he said.
 
 The decision of the   had come well before of Naidu’s decision to sport black badge and his plans to visit the Delhi for two days from April 2.
 
 As Naidu is getting ready for his two-day camp to Delhi to sensitise the national leaders on AP’s issues, Jagan took the decision of the indefinite fast.
