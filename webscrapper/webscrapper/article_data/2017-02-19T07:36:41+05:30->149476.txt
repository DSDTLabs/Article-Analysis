THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Governor   has returned the file recommending the release of 1,850 prisoners prematurely citing that the government had not considered the   (SC) judgements that laid norms for giving relaxation of   by the state governments. 

 Sathasivam himself had been part of one such judgment while serving as the chief justice of India. 
 
 Several criteria for commuting one's death sentence were given in the verdict by an SC bench on a petition by  , an accused in 1993 Delhi blast. 
 
 Sathasivam had headed a four-member SC bench that commuted Bhuller's death sentence to life on March 31, 2014. 
 
 The file that recommends the release of 1,850 prisoners by the state government -- which was returned by the governor to the government for "seeking some details and clarification in view of the latest SC judgements" -- had said the government decision was based on an executive order citing the criteria for release of convicts issued by the state home department on October 29, 2012. It is learnt that several of the criteria suggested by the SC in the Bhuller case were not satisfied by the state government. 
 
 On Saturday, TOI reported the government's unprecedented decision to release 1,850 convicts prematurely. 
 
 Meanwhile, BJP national executive member   said that the BJP would request the governor not to grant assent to the state government's recommendations to release the convicts that would hamper the state's law and order situation.
