Thiruvananthapuram: In a first, the Kerala state   has organized a comprehensive   “Naattukoottam” for children from the tribal and rural settlements from across the state.

  Health minister K K Shailaja who inaugurated the camp at the CWC here on Wednesday had a word of praise for Greeshma who hails from Aaralam tribal settlement at Kannur and went on to win first rank in engineering and secure a job. “Tribal sector is an abode of knowledge and the fact that they have limited access to interact and share them with the outside world is their greatest shortcoming now. The kids who have come for the camp should look up at Greeshma as a role model,’’ said the minister.
 
 Through art programmes, the camp which houses around 250 kids will focus on the   between the children from tribal and rural communities.
