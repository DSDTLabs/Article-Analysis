PATNA: Work on construction of the much-ambitious   track between   and Barh in   rail division has finally been completed. The project, which cost the railways Rs 233.65 crore, envisages to provide a direct coal linkage to the Barh super thermal power station of National Thermal Power Corporation ( ).

 A trial test was successfully conducted recently when an empty locomotive rolled over the track. Modern technology and structural designs have been used to complete the project.
 
 Danapur DRM Ranjan Prakash Thakur said five coal rakes were being used per day to supply coal to the NTPC’s Barh plant. The rakes were using Rajgir-Bakhtiarpur route, thereby affecting movement of passenger trains. “The flyover track will decongest traffic on the Patna-Mokama-Jhajha mainline section of the division,” the DRM added.
 
 He said thanks to the flyover track, the railways can now run 18 to 19 coal rakes per day without disturbing normal traffic movement on the mainline route. “The railways will soon open the track for the movement of coal rakes,” he said, adding the final nod from the Railway Board is still awaited. 
 
 The flyover track is arguably first-of-its-kind in the country. “A triangle-shaped 18km-long flyover track has been built between Bakhtiarpur and Barh. The track has been designed in such a way that the coal rakes will directly reach the Barh power station through Rajgir-Bakhtiarpur route and after unloading coal, the empty rakes will return from   end through the alleviated flyover track on the separate Up line,” the DRM said, adding the railways has created a milestone by constructing the track with the help of modern technology.
 
 The Bakhtiarpur-Barh flyover track was the dream project of CM   when he was the railway minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government at the Centre.
