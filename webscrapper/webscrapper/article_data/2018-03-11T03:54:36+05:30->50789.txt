MUMBAI: Boisar police on Saturday registered an   against the fire officer of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre for not responding to Thursday night’s explosions and fire at five chemical units in   MIDC, which killed three people and injured 15 labourers. The power station is just 7km from the MIDC area.

 “The gravity of the explosion was felt at my home, around 15 km away. So it was inhuman on the part of the fire officer to not respond despite being so close to a disaster,” said Palghar collector Dr Prashant Narnaware, on whose behalf the complaint was lodged under the Disaster Management Act.
