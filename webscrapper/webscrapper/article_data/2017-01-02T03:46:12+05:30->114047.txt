GUDALUR: Chikku, a cattle herder in   in the  , is a worried man. "Water in the   was a little dark last week. When my cattle drank it, they fell sick and in the next couple of days more than half a dozen of them died," he says. Siva, a worker in a farm in the same area, said he went to bathe in the river, but changed his mind since the water was dark in colour. Subsequently two cattle from the farm where he works died. 

 Two elephants in the   camp also died around the same time due to dehydration. Following the deaths, the camp has been temporarily shifted to four different places in the reserve, say the wildlife officials.
 
 Salmonella, a dreaded bacteria, could have caused the death of the cattle and the elephants in captivity, officials suspect. A forest department veterinarian said they have sent the samples to a laboratory and are awaiting the results.
 
 Another veterinarian said Moyar has been described as a ditch even from the days of the British, as sewage from many areas are openly let into this river. The river is now highly polluted, he says.
 
 Madhusudanan, a wildlife researcher in Gudalur, said the cattle become suddenly weak after drinking the contaminated water from the Dhodda Moyar in his farm. Subsequently they died. The condition of two more cattle belonging to Chikku is bad. Two of them were unable to even sit. Once they sit they needed to be pushed to get up. These two may soon succumb to the bacteria attack, he said.
 
 As a precautionary measure the animals, be it the cattle or the elephants should not be allowed to drink water from the river, says the veterinarian.
 
 The animal husbandry department has to collect samples from the river and its surroundings to stop the spread of bacteria. Such infectious diseases carrying bacteria can easily cause health problems to humans too. "This is a warning sign for humans to be on the alert, as the particular bacteria can cause typhoid in humans," he warned.
