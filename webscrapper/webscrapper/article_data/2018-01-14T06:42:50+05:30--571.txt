ISLAMABAD: Following the ouster of ex-PM   from office in a corruption scam last year, the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( ) suffered another major blow on Saturday when Abdul Quddus Bizenjo, a candidate of its rival party, was elected CM of the restive southwestern   province.

 The political crisis has been intensified by speculation, widely circulated in media, that elements of Pakistan’s powerful military were behind efforts to destabilise the region and possibly dissolve the assembly ahead of the senate polls due around March, and the general elections in mid-2018.
 
 Bizenjo belongs to Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q), a party that has just five members in a house of 65. He was the former deputy speaker of the assembly and had played a key role in the ouster of Sanaullah Zehri, a former PML-N CM, who had to step down last week after opposition benches filed a motion of no-confidence against him.
 
 The PML-N has 25 elected MPs in the house but Bizenjo secured 41 votes against his rival Syed Agha Liaquat Ali of   who bagged just 13 votes. This signifies that PML-N MPs also voted for the new CM.
 
 “I will use the short time given to me to find solutions to problems of citizens,” he said, adding that he wanted to complete the   project.
