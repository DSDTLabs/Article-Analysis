Vijayawada: Summer has well and truly arrived in the city. In March itself, the city has recorded temperatures beyond the 40-degree Celsius mark.

 Major streets in the city wear a deserted look in the afternoon. The very few who do venture outdoors are facing a number of challenges, the most uncharitable being lack of proper bus shelters.
 
 State-run buses are the backbone of Vijayawada’s transportation system. Around 4 lakh Vijayawadites use Andhra Pradesh Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) buses on a daily basis. Karl Marx Road (Eluru Road), Mahatma Gandhi Road (Bandar Road), Five Route and Autonagar are the major routes in the city. However, most of the major routes do not proper bus shelters and passengers are waiting on the streets covering themselves against the harsh sun.
 
 “We are unable to wait for the bus on the main roads. There are no bus shelters at Gunadala Centre, Padavala Revu, Vijaya Talkies and other busy junctions on Eluru Road,” said J Hemalatha, a student preparing for competitive examinations.
 
 “Buses pick up passengers near Fortune Murali Park Centre on Bandar Road. But that spot does not have a bus shelter. There is no   here and motorists are rash the streets. Minor road accidents are commonplace here,” says K Anitha, a student of Siddhartha ahila Kalasala. Denizens are demanding VMC and APSRTC arrange temporary bus shelters in the city. VMC officials said that they have included the bus shelters in the summer action plan and will take necessary measures soon. “VMC is implementing special measures considering the extreme heat wave conditions in the city. Bus shelters have not come up at a few junctions considering the traffic there. Temporary shelters will be arranged soon,” said Vijayawada deputy mayor Gogula Ramana Rao.
