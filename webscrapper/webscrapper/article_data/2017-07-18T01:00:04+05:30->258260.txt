Coimbatore: In an attempt to mock the  , a group of members from opposition political parties who are residents of Kannapan Nagar turned up at the collectorate on Monday to present him with a   for not preventing the opening of new TASMAC outlets in their area. However, police stopped the group from entering the building.

 The politicians said they had been petitioning the collector for the past three months requesting him not to allow new Tasmac outlets in their area. “Despite our repeated petitioning and meeting with the collector, he took no action,” said DMK ward councillor Meena Logu. “Just because they need to move Tasmac outlets from highways they cannot shift it anywhere,” she said.
 
 Sanganoor bridge already has too many Tasmac outlets, said the politicians. “Kannappan Nagar has four Tasmac shops, two of them on a main road. One is hardly 30 metres away from a temple and a school,” said Logu. “Now, they are trying to open two more Tasmac shops on the same road, which will increase the number of outlets in the area to six,” she said. “Once the work is complete, ward 45, where I am a councillor, will have eight Tasmac shops,” said Logu.
 
 Politicians said   is a densely populated residential area. “With two Tasmac outlets on the main road, women and school children are finding it difficult to walk on the road as men are often seen in an inebriated condition. The drunk men often get into brawls on the street,” said Radhakrishnan, another protester. “There are lot of accidents on the road because the drunkards walking on to the road disrupts traffic flow,” he said.
