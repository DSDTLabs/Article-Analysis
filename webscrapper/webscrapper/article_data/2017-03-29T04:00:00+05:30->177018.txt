Chennai: Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have pumped a massive $3.6 billion (Rs 23,435 crore) into the stock markets on a net basis so far in March, the highest in a month since February 2013. They have made net investments of $6.37 billion (Rs 41,442 crore) into India on an aggregate basis (debt and equity) in March (till 28th), the highest ever for a month. 

 The surge in FII investments has propelled key stock indices close to their life-time highs hit in March 2015. The benchmark Sensex and the broader Nifty indices are now trading only about 2% lower than their all-time highs. 
 
 FIIs have pumped nearly $5 billion (Rs 32,160 crore) into Indian stocks and about $8.3 billion (Rs 53,808 crore) on an aggregate basis so far in 2017, data with share depository NSDL showed.
 
 Net investments made by FIIs in stocks in March alone is higher than those made in the entire of 2016. 
 
 FIIs have bought more shares in value terms in all but one trading session during the month. 
 
 They invested $1.13 billion on a net basis in equities in the week after the election results to five states were announced in which the BJP swept to power with a massive majority in UP. 
 
 “The recent election results has given confidence to investors that there will be political stability,” says G Chokkalingam, founder and managing director, Equinomics Research and Advisory. 
 
 “FIIs and markets expect a lot of bold economic initiatives from the government,” he says. The surge in the markets is being driven on hopes of timely implementation of GST and has been further strengthened by the recovery in global indices, said Jayant Manglik, president, retail distribution, Religare Securities.
 
 India is seeing good interest from overseas funds as well. The country received nearly $1 billion of inflows from listed overseas funds, driven by strong ETF (exchange traded funds) inflows of $588 million, in February.
