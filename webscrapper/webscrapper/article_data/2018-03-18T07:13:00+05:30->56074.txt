GURUGRAM:   has been crippled by an acute   for the last five days, with residents saying that MCG appears to be indifferent to their problems. Residents said the supply was initially snapped from Huda’s end but now supply is affected because MCG has not been repairing the damaged   infrastructure of the area.

 Around 300 families have been affected. The water supply came in fits and starts during the morning hours before running out again, according to residents. “We have been suffering for the last five days. The supply only comes for 5–10 minutes, mostly during mornings, before drying up. We are really distressed. People who stay at home manage to call up water tankers, but those who go to work neither get to fill up tanks during that fleeting moment when water resumes nor get time to call tankers,” said D P Sharma, a resident.
 
 Residents said nothing was done despite complaints to MCG. “There is no water. For the first two days, the water supply was short from Huda’s end because of some technical issue. Now, it is the water boost pump which seems to have been conked out. MCG is totally uninterested in fixing our issues,” said Bhawani Shankar, another resident. When TOI spoke to MCG officials, they said the issue would be fixed soon.
