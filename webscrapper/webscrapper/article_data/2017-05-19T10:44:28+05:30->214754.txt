Remember   aka Bitti?  , the 23-year-old was   before he was arrested while   on a fake identity. The arrest of Bitti from Kannur, in 2013, created a sensation across the country. Nobody in the bank or elsewhere had an inkling about his identity.

 After four years of his arrest, Bitty is set to walk free after the Rajasthan High Court disposed of a parole violation case on Thursday. His counsel Sarthak Nayak told Mirror, “The high court has disposed of the case of jumping parole. Out of the three months which is pending for jumping parole, he will undergo that sentence. He will be finally be released on July 6 2017.” The apex court had already granted him bail in the rape case.
 
 Bitti, who was sentenced to seven years rigorous imprisonment by a Jaipur fasttrack court, fled in 2006 after getting parole on the ground of visiting his ailing grandmother. After seven years on the run, he was re-arrested in Kannur. In March 2006, Bitty was convicted for raping a 26-year-old German national in a hotel in Alwar, Rajasthan. Bitti is the son of former Odisha director general of police Bidya Bhushan Mohanty.
 
 According to reports, he had met the victim, who was in India for a research assignment, in New Delhi where he was pursuing his MBA. The two fell in love and had travelled to Rajasthan for a holiday. The Rajasthan police said that he raped her in his hotel room in Alwar.
 
 Bitti, then 23, was convicted and jailed by a fast-track court in Jaipur in one of the fastest rape trials in the country. But he was released from the Alwar jail on 15-day parole just seven months into his seven-year sentence, so that he could meet his ailing grandmother (some reports say his mother) at their home in Cuttack. Bitti jumped parole, which was granted after his father stood surety.
 
 Bitti was living under the fake identity (as Raghav Rajan) in several locations and finally he took up a job at the State Bank of India branch in Kerala.
