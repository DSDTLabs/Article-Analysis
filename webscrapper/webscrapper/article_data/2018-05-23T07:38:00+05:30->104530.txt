Chandigarh: A special CBI court of Panchkula on Tuesday deferred the cross-examination of Khatta Singh, former driver of rape convict Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim, as the counsel defending the dera head did not turn up. CBI judge Jagdeep Singh adjourned the case to Wednesday on the request of the prosecution and defence counsel. The dera head appeared through video conferencing.

 Khatta was to be cross examined by the defence counsel for his statements in the journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati and Ranjit Singh murder cases. Trial of both cases is in the final stages and a decision can come soon after the final arguments following Khattaâ€™s cross-examination.
