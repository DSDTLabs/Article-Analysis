HYDERABAD:   seems to have won many hearts in India. If one goes by social media posts flying thick and fast, many Indians want the braveheart, who got injured while trying to save   and   from bullets at a bar in Kansas, to be honoured with an award by the Indian government.

 Several people responded in this vein after Union external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj lauded Grillot on Twitter on Monday night. “India salutes the heroism of Ian Grillot! Best wishes for a speedy recovery,” she tweeted. Grillot is still recovering in the University of Kansas hospital.
 
 
  
 In response to the minister’s tweet, several of her followers came up with suggestions on how to say a proper thanks to Grillot. Jaiprakash Sharma suggested that India should present him with a gallantry award. “I think he deserves a bravery award from India,” Supriya G said. “Grillot, we salute you hero, recover soon,” said Shebaney. 
 
 Others such as Daiwat Joshi and Murugan Frimanyan said that the government should foot the bill for Grillot’s medical expenses.
 
 Abhinav Tandon said that apart from Sushma Swaraj recognising him, Ian Grillot should be felicitated by the Government of India. Buddhadev Mukherjee, in his response, told Sushma Swaraj, “Thank you. You spoke for the diaspora in the midst of our collective grief, we are grateful to Ian for his brave act.” 
 
 Another response to Sushma’s tweet was from Bhupen Dubey. “Offer him citizenship and Shourya Chakra”. Priyajith offered one more suggestion. “He defended our culture. So let’s show him ours. Let’s give him a free tour to RP (Rashtrapathi) Bhavan,” he said. Another suggested that Ian should be invited for the August 15 Independence Day celebrations.
