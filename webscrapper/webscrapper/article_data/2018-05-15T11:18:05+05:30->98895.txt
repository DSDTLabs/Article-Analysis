The   on   ‘Kante Koothurne Kanali’ and ‘Shambhavi’ are all set to premier on May 21.

  The channel posted a special promo on their social media page and wrote, “Maimaripinche Madhyanaalu Sarikotha Serials tho May 21st nundi. #KanteKoothurneKanali at 1:30 PM & #Shambhavi at 2 PM mi Star Maa lo.” (sic) (Afternoon serials that will leave you mesmerised from May 21.) The show ‘Kante Koothurne Kanali’ will be aired at 1:30 PM, whereas ‘Shambhavi’ will be aired at 2 PM.
 
  The promo features clips from both the new shows and has received more than 10k views, 10 shares, 101 likes and few comments. A lot of commenters request the channel to not replace or discontinue the serial ‘Chupulu Kalisina Shubavela’, and the channel is yet to respond. Previously we had written that these new shows will soon be aired on Star Maa, with new shows ‘Maate Mantramu’ and ‘Ganga Manga’ already on air. 
 
  ‘Kante Koothurne Kanali’ was announced more than a month ago, with a promo that showcased how helpless a bride might feel when her father is milked for money and gold by her in-laws during the wedding. ‘Shambavi’ was announced more recently, which many speculated might be the remake of Kannada show ‘Durga’. The promo of this show showed a simpleton named Sivayya impulsively marrying a woman in innocence when the priest of the temple they’re at chides him. It can only be assumed that the woman’s name is  , despite the same not being revealed in the promo.
 
  The promos had both received good response, despite the recent combined promo not receiving much traction. It remains to be seen how the shows will fare.
