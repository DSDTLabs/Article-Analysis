BENGALURU: Chief election commissioner   on Thursday said the state government has been advised not to transfer district deputy commissioners and superintendents of police without its permission.

 Wrapping up his two-day visit to the state to check preparedness for the upcoming assembly elections, Rawat said they have already issued the direction in the backdrop of the recent controversy over the transfer of Hassan deputy commissioner  .
 
 “We were apprised about the transfer of the Hassan DC. While the state government has complete control on transferring officers, including district magistrates and SPs, till the   announces the calendar of events, we are only authorized to advise the government. But, our advice will be binding on the government,” he said.
  
  
 
 After the announcement of calendar of events, the government will have to transfer those officers who have completed three years of their four-year mandatory service in a specific position. Even officials facing charges of dereliction of duty or those posted in their home district will be transferred, he added.
 
 Rawat said his team held meetings with officials and political parties to discuss various issues, including the possibility of a single-phase election. “There were suggestions by a couple of parties to have single-phase elections, as in 2013. The single-phase election worked well that year. However, a final call will be taken once we’re closer to announcing the poll dates,’’ he said.
