 On Friday, Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg refused to say if the government will cut excise duty on auto fuel to ease the burden on consumers.
 
 The government is watching the situation developing from oil prices hitting $ 80 a barrel - the highest since November 2014, and adequate steps will be taken, is all he said said without elaborating.
 
 Asked if the government would cut excise duty on petrol and diesel, he had stated that he has nothing to say on that front. "Just watch."
 
 The BJP-led government had raised excise duty nine times - totalling Rs 11.77 per litre on petrol and Rs 13.47 on diesel - between November 2014 and January 2016 to shore up finances as global oil prices fell, but then cut the tax just once in October last year by Rs 2 a litre.
 
 No sooner had Karnataka polled to elect a new state government, state-owned   (IOC),   (HPCL) and   ( ) on Monday ended a hiatus in revising petrol and diesel prices that began on April 25 and reverted to the 11-month old practices of changing rates on a daily basis.
 
 Oil PSUs are estimated to have lost about Rs 500 crore on absorbing higher cost resulting from the spike in international oil rates and fall in rupee against the US dollar during the nearly three week hiatus.
 
 The benchmark international rate for petrol, used for revising rate on April 24, had gone up from $78.84 per barrel to $84.97 on May 14. It has further risen to $ 84.97, indicating more daily hikes would be needed to level retail price with cost.
 
 Similarly, benchmark international diesel rates during this period have climbed from $84.68 per barrel to $90.28 pr barrel. Also, the rupee has weakened to Rs 67.27 per US dollar from Rs 66.62, making imports costlier.
