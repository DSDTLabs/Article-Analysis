Ranchi: The district police on Friday suspended Lalpur police station sub-inspector Dayanad Soren and constable Ram Prasad Singh for ‘negligence’ after a person died in police custody early in the morning. Police described the death as suicide.

 Ranchi SP Rajkumar Lakra said the CCTV footage has been seized from the police station and Vikas Lakra’s body sent for post-mortem. “Prima facie, it was negligence on part of the policemen on duty who are supposed to be the custodian of anyone arrested. We will look into the matter and the guilty will not be spared,” he said. Asked if the department was sure about Lakra committing suicide in custody, the SP said that they are yet to verify the CCTV footage that captured activities of the lock up round the clock.
 
 Lalpur police said Vikas was arrested at 6am on Friday and he used a torn piece of the blanket, kept in the lock up, to hang himself from the rod of its iron gate. “By the time we saw him hanging, he was already dead,” said constable Singh. A resident of Dhobighat mohalla in Lower Burdwan Compound, Vikas was a daily wage labourer. He was picked up in connection with an incident of theft reported by residents of Balaji Apartment in the same locality.
 
 Vikas’s wife Preety said she had no information about her husband being arrested. “I was told by our neighbours that he was picked up from by Lalpur police early in the morning,” she said, denying any history of his involvement in thefts or any other criminal activities. “Though he used to drink alcohol, he never went to jail or in police custody in the past,” she said.
