PANAJI: A   with some injuries and its carcass in decay washed up ashore dead on   on Wednesday morning. 

 The   was lying on the rock and drew curious visitors to the site. The male   was about 2.3m long. 
 
 “Its tail appeared to have been cut to release it from entanglement in the net,” a source said. 
 
 An eyewitness said that the injured dolphin was seen gasping and in distress a few nights earlier. “It had been released in the water, but appears to have died later,” he said.
 
 Drishti lifeguards on duty informed the forest department about the dead dolphin, but nothing much could be done. “It was later buried near the sand dune area,” a source said.
 
 In May 2016, a dwarf sperm whale had been stranded at   and a few organizations and others tried to rescue it. But, it eventually died in traumatic conditions, exposing a lack of a marine mammal response network in Goa.
 
 It appeared to be injured and in distress, but efforts of tourists and foreigners and local people proved futile in controlling the beach crowd, as people tried to touch and crowd around the gasping mammal.
 
 “A capacity building to set up a marine mammal stranding response network is the need of hour,” a source said.
