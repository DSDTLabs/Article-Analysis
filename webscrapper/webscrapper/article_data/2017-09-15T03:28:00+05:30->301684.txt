Margao: A couple of administrative officials were at the receiving end of Curchorem MLA Nilesh Cabral’s wrath over their “inaction” in processing files over what he called as “irrelevant” and “superfluous” reasons. As   sought to extract explanations from an officer over a particular case, South Goa collector Anjali Sehrawat intervened and took objections over the matter. “This meeting cannot be turned into a bashing (session) by politicians. I take full responsibility of my administrative team. Bring your cases to my attention and I will sort them out,” Sehrawat told the MLAs. Taken aback by Sehrawat’s stance, Cabral explained that his complaints were not aimed at humiliating the officers but to highlight the problems plaguing the system that affected the common man. TNN
