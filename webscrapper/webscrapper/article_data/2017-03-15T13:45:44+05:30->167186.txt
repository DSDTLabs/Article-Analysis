BATHINDA : Rampura Phool police have booked AAP leader from Rampura Phool assembly constituency  , along with his six supporters for beating up a Congress worker and threatening him with dire consequences. A case was registered on Monday on the complaint of Congress activist  , who complained that Sidhu and his supporters barged into his house and beat him up for switching over to Congress.

 Bansal, who is a religious preacher, was earlier with AAP and a contender for party ticket. When the ticket was allotted to Manjit, he left the party and joined the Congress. He alleged, “Manjit Singh Sidhu and 12 persons on came to my residence at Rampura Phool Monday afternoon and threatened me with dire consequences for not supporting him in the elections. When I resisted, they beat me and also pushed my mother.” 
 
 Based on his complaint, Manjit, Pawan Kumar, Sahil Kumar, Inderjit Singh, Umesh Garg, Nonu, Balla and seven unidentified persons, all residents of Rampura, have been booked. 
 
 Manjit, however, has denied the charges. “These are baseless allegations. Jaskaran was threatening AAP activist Pawan Kumar, who lives in his neighbourhood. Pawan called me and I had gone to talk to Jaskaran, but did not enter his house. I had asked Jaskaran to desist from threatening my followers, but he is lying that I entered his house or threatened him. If Section 452 (house trespass) of the IPC is not withdrawn, I will surrender before the police,” he said. 
 
 Bathinda SSP Swapan Sharma said, “A case has been registered against   and others under sections 452 (house trespass), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting armed with weapons) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.”
 
 Rampura Phool SHO Kanwaljit Singh said that, “Accused Pawan’s son Sahil has been arrested and efforts are being made to arrest others.”
