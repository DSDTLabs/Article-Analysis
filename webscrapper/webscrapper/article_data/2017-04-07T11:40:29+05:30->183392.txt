 fame brothers, director   and actor  , have been working hard on their second film  . Anup says, “The third schedule is happening in   after completing the first two schedules in Ooty, Mahabaleshwar and Malshej Ghat. We have captured some amazing visuals.”
Anup also tells us that apart from   and leading lady   there’s a new star in the making, a rottweiler, which has already managed to woo his wife and daughter to such an extent that they want to adopt him and are pestering Anup for the same. “We have some really whacky characters in the film. Mostly theatre artistes, newcomers and a dog, Snoopy, who are sure to make a mark with Rajaratha,” says the filmmaker, adding, “Nirup is going to surprise the audience with his performance in this one. It is a far cry from his previous outing where he had played a subdued character. Here he has really gotten into the character of a wild goofy lovable college kid. His scenes with RangiTaranga Karthik (Rafique, the jeep driver) will have the audience rolling on the floor. Karthik, is an under appreciated gem. I am sure he will make it to the big league with Rajaratha as his role has a lot of meat and screen time.”
 In fact, Anup talks about the comedy as something that will entertain the audience. “The highlight is the comedy that we have shot so far. It is downright hilarious and we have been successful in translating the comedy from paper to screen which was evident from the way the team was reacting to the scenes. We had to take several retakes because of co-actors unable to control their laughter, the light boys unable to hold on to the equipment and the cinematographer shaking the camera. I am a person who hardly laughs, but I was finding it hard to say cut on the mike without laughing,” adds Anup.
