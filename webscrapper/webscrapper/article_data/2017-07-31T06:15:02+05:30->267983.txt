NEW DELHI: The road transport and highways ministry has written to the external affairs ministry to approach the   (DoJ) to share details of   officials allegedly bribed by Boston-based consultancy firm  .

  has also written to the Indian ambassador in the US to reach out to the DoJ to get details of the officials, the amount paid as bribe and name of each project so the NHAI can initiate action against them.
 
 The company has admitted to the criminal division of DoJ that it had paid $1.18 million to NHAI officials between 2011 and 2015. Malik has also written to the external affairs secretary.
 
 “We have already started investigation and have identified that the company had bagged contracts for 16 projects between 2011 and 2015. The firm was blacklisted by NHAI in 2015 for certain deficiencies in one of the contracts,” said a road ministry official.
 
 He said NHAI officials were still trying to figure out whether the company had paid bribe for getting the contracts or after getting them.
 
 Sources said another wing of the road ministry — National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (NHIDCL) — has also blacklisted the firm, which the company has challenged in court.
 
 After TOI broke this alleged bribery by CDM Smith, highways minister   ordered an investigation into the case. 
 
 The DoJ closed the case against CDM Smith last month after the company agreed to pay $4.03 million to the US treasury, which it had earned as profit from “illegally obtained” works for highway construction supervision and design contracts and a water project contract in Goa. 
 
 The company agreed to pay the entire amount in four installments by October 1, 2017.
