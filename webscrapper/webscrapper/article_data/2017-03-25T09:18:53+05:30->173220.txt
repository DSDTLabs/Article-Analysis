LUCKNOW: They had wanted to stifle her voice even as she raised it against the   her since 2008. Little did they know that the ‘VoiceOfVimla’ will stir several in her support, both online and offline. After having acid forced down her throat, Vimla is battling to speak again, but in the meantime, a   storm in her name has thrown up a collective demand to arrest all the accused in her case, setting a precedent for all. 

 When Laxmi, the frontrunner of Stop Acid Attacks and founder of Chhanv foundation, recorded a video message highlighting the issue, people from across the nation shared it. The video features survivors at the various Sheroes Hangout cafe as well as some cafe visitors who spoke against the attack.
 
  Happy at the arrests in Rae Bareli, Ashish Shukla, a campaigner for Stop Acid Attacks, said, “This is welcoming step but action should be swift and targeted in such cases so that no one else musters the courage to commit such an attack. There has been support from all corners which is heartening.”
