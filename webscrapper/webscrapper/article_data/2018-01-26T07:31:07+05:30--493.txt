BENGALURU: The dawn-todusk Karnataka bandh on Thursday was near total in Bengaluru. The response to the shutdown call, to seek PM’s intervention in the Mahadayi

 river dispute, ranged from total to poor in rest of the state.
 
 The day passed off peacefully in Bengaluru barring two incidents of violence. The BMTC and KSRTC did a volte-face by not running their operations. Autorickshaws and cabs were few and costly, and some aggregators resorted to surge pricing.
 
 Namma Metro operated as usual, but trains were not crowded till dusk. Private firms, including IT majors, remained closed or let employees work from home. Nationalized banks remained open.
 
 Schools and colleges had declared a holiday. State government offices saw thin attendance. Malls were shut and theatres suspended screening till evening. Courts functioned, but turnout was poor.
 
 In Malleswaram, one person was arrested after miscreants threw stones at a bakery and a food joint near 18th Cross and damaged glasspanes. Protesters blocked a few vehicles in  , but police dispersed them. Activists jumped on to city railway station tracks, but police removed them before they disrupted train service.
 
 The bandh was total in Mandya, evoked a mixed response in Mysuru, and made no impact in Dakshina Kannada, Shivamogga and Kodagu. The response was poor in Vijayapura, Davanagere, Kalaburagi, Haveri and Ballari.
 
 Shutdown unlikely on February 4
 
 The Bengaluru bandh slated for February 4 may be scaled down. Kannada Okkuta’s Vatal Nagaraj said: “We’re hopeful of getting the Mahadayi issue solved by then. If not, we shall take out a rally in Bengaluru on February 4.” PM Modi is slated to address a   rally in Bengaluru on the day. The BJP alleged it is a Congresssponsored event. The party has threatened a tit-for-tat bandh on Feb 10 when   leader   is visiting Benglauru.
