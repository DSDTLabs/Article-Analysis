  : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( ) has started the work of digitisation of its services and aims to make its offices completely paper-free by August 15, 2018. 

 The EPFO officials have appealed to employers and employees to activate Universal Account Number ( ) and seed bank accounts and   numbers with their PF accounts as early as possible.
 
 Saurabh Suman Prasad, regional provident fund commissioner, Kolhapur, said they have set a target to make   office completely paper-free by August 15, 2018. 
 
 Kolhapur office has jurisdiction over 9,200 establishments and caters to about 11 lakh PF subscribers spread over five districts of south western Maharashtra (Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara, Ratnagiri and  ). 
 
 "We have already informed the employers that our office will soon discontinue all paper claims and accept only online claims (except pension forms). They should expedite the process of UAN and seeding of bank account and Aadhaar number of their employees," Prasad said. 
 
 Till date, only 25% of the UAN allotted members have seeded their Aadhaar and 27% have seeded their bank accounts. Only 19% of UAN allotters have seeded their bank accounts and Aadhaar. The government has already launched the facility of Aadhaar seeding with UAN through the UMANG app and the newly launched e-KYC portal on the EPFO website, he said.
 
 "We appeal to the employers to get facility of digital signature and e-sign to speed up the process to allot UAN to their employees," he said.
 
 He added that they would be setting up camps at various places in Kolhapur region to spread awareness regarding their decision.
