SURAT: City police are developing a special team to guard the VIPs visiting the city as they are shaken by the recent violent protests in the presence of political leaders. The aggressive demonstration by Congress workers before railway minister   in the city has compelled the police authorities to immediately start the project. Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha’s state unit president   was also targeted by   (PAAS) activists.

 At least 40 policemen will be selected for specialized training as personal security officers (PSO). Mostly constable and head constables will be selected to be in the team that will be created from the existing staff at the police headquarters. Senior police officers have begun working on the training curriculum for the team. 
 
 So far the security arrangements were being made by local police stations and special branch of the police commissioner’s office. Majority of the policemen deployed on such duties did not have specific training to guard a VIP.
 
 “From the recent incidents, we have come to the conclusion that a trained man guarding a VIP can perform much better. Hence, we are developing a team of PSOs to ensure that a VIP’s security is not breached. The PSOs will be given specific training to stop anyone from coming dangerously close to the VIP. They can keep the unwanted individuals at a safe distance,” city police commissioner   said. 
 
 Congress workers had gheraoed Prabhu as soon as he got down from a vehicle here on Sunday and garlanded him with a black scarf. Prabhu was also offered a lollipop as a symbolic protest for Indian Railways not meeting the long-pending demands of the city. There was chaos outside Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI) building with insufficient security to guard the Union minister.
