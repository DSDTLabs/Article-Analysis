NEW DELHI: She may not be as famous as some of the big shots in the medical fraternity, but 91-year-old   is credited with hundreds of free deliveries and gynaecological assistance to the needy. She has been honoured with a Padma Shri this year. 

 Like her, Dr Subroto Das has been awarded with India’s fourth highest civilian award for saving the lives of road accident victims. The 51-year-old from Gujarat had set up ‘Lifeline Foundation’ after being involved in an accident more than a decade ago. His foundation has helped more than 1,200 people get emergency medical care.
 
 Dr Suniti Solomon, who diagnosed the first AIDS case in India in 1985 and established India’s first AIDS Resource Group, has also been bestowed with Padma Shri posthumously. She took up the cause of AIDS research at a time when few discussed it due to the stigma attached. 
 
 “Padma awards list this year is a reminder to all. There’s a world out there with lot of good work happening. Contribute! #PeoplesPadma,” union health minister JP Nadda tweeted.
 
 Many in the medical fraternity lauded the government move to award common man’s doctors over those treating the rich and influential of Delhi. The only big name to feature in the Padma awardees’ list is of Dr Mukut Minz, who conducted the kidney transplant of external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj recently.
