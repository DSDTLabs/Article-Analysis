Mapusa:   gram sabha witnessed heated arguments on Sunday regarding ambiguities over who would benefit from the Tillari water works project passing through the village. Gram sabha members alleged that the pipeline is being laid to provide water to the proposed Tiracol golf course and the village will be denied its fair share of water.

 Work on the pipeline traversing from Pernem to Keri via Korgao and Paliem had started a few months ago. From the very beginning, the project had raised suspicions among Korgao locals regarding the government’s motives.
 
 Those attending the gram sabha questioned the panchayat whether the pipeline is being laid to cater to the golf course project at Tiracol, and if Korgao stood to gain from it in any way. Claiming that they have first rights to the water, villagers pointed out that for a pipeline meant to provide water for irrigational purposes, the project plan does not mention any storage tank or have provisions for land acquisition to lay the structure. They also raised questions regarding a portion of the plan which states ‘in case needed, the water can be given for other purposes’ and said the statement is suggestive of the state’s covert planning to provide water to the golf course, keeping the villagers in the dark. 
 
 Sources said a delegation of villagers has also met local MLA and tourism minister Manohar Azgaonkar and chief minister Manohar Parrikar over the issue.
