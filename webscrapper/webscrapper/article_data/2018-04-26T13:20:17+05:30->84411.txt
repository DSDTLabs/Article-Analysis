MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the   on Wednesday ordered notice to the   district collector on a batch of cases including a case seeking Rs 1 lakh compensation to all farmers by stating that the farmers were unable to do cultivation in 2016-17 due to absence of Cauvery water. 

 One V Jeevakumar from Thanjavur has filed the pleas. When they came up for hearing before the division bench of justices C T Selvam and A M Basheer Ahamed, the counsel told the court that marginal and small farmers in Thanjavur district planted paddy for the samba period. They also duly paid premium for   insurance. But, the entire crops failed. 
 
 Due to it, the farmers were forced to leave their native place for survival. They should be rehabilitated by granting a suitable compensation in order to ensure their right to live with dignity. It is the statutory and mandatory duty of the authorities to provide compensation to them without any delay. Insisting on it, a representation was sent to the collector on May 19, last year. But, no action was taken.
