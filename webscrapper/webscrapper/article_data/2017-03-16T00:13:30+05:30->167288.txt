Pimpri Chinchwad: Despite unfavourable conditions, Wakad-based industrial worker Nandkumar Dhumal has grown five to six apple trees in his garden. Every year, the trees bear fruits in April and September. 

 Dhumal made repeated attempts to grow the trees. “I have been sowing apple seeds in my garden since 2000. After a lot of effort, having undergone several permutations and combinations, a sapling grew in 2007 and turned into a tree in 2009. Many believed that it was a one-off incident and that the tree would not survive. The tree flowered and then also bore fruits. There are five to six trees now,” he said. A full grown tree bears 70 to 80  . 
 
 A   employee, the 51-year-old said gardening has always been his hobby. “I’d been toying with the idea of planting apple seeds for a long time. I’ve planted the trees in red soil in large plastic drums placed in my terrace garden. I use vermicompost as fertiliser. The plants are watered in the morning and evening. In the summer season, I use showers for the trees,” Dhumal pointed out.
 
 As such, the conditions in the city are unfavourable for the apple trees. Normally, it takes five to six years for the trees to grow but these trees have now adapted to the present climate. Normally, people tend to undertake additional effort to maintain the trees but I have not been taking such efforts,” he said. 
 
 Dhumal has received several awards and certificates for his work. Dhumal claims the trees can be grown by farmers across  . “The department of agriculture can carry out experiments across the state and help farmers earn an additional income,” he added.
