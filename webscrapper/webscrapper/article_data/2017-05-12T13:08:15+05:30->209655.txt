When it is a   movie, it has to start minting money before its release. It is obviously not something new, right? But it came as a shock to us when we learnt that ‘Tubelight’ has earned Rs 130 Crores already before it hit the theatres.

 According to a report in a leading media portal, the all-India distribution rights of ‘Tubelight’ are sold at a whopping amount of Rs 130 crore to NH Studioz.
  
 The rights have also been sold in Rajasthan and Gujarat and the Minimum Guarantee has been granted at a record price that is reportedly way more that Aamir Khan’s last blockbuster ‘Dangal’. The makers of ‘Tubelight’ launched the first look poster of the movie’s first song titled ‘The Radio Song’. 
 
 Salman Khan took to Twitter to announce the release of the song which will be on May 16th.
  
  Looks like the distributors and theatre owners have complete confidence in Salman Khan’s ‘Tubelight’ and believe that the movie will definitely be one of the biggest blockbusters this year. Well, if we have to go by the looks of the teaser, then we too think that not just will the movie mint money but also this will be Salman’s finest performance till date. 
 
 ‘Tubelight’ is set against the backdrop of Sino-Indian war in 1962, also stars   and Chinese actor Zhu Zhu, in her   debut. The movie is slated to release on June 25th.
