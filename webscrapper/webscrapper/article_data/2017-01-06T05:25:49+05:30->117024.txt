CHENNAI: The grant of permission to Hindustan Unilever by the   to start soil remediation on the premises of its former factory in   has drawn flak from environmental activists.

 A three-month trial will precede the process of remediation to remove the harmful mercury dumped over the years on the premises of the factory that had beem manufacturing thermometers. Environment activist Ni tyanand Jayaram said the TNPCB had convened no meeting of the   ( ), appointed by the Supreme Court Monitoring Committee to monitor the process, between 2005 and 2015. Now without any consultation, the board has accorded permission to the company, he charged.
 
 The trial will be monito red by Scientific Experts Committee (SEC). Nityanand, however, said the SEC was set up only to supervise dismantling of machinery from the company in 2011 and had no other role. Only the LAEC should monitor the trials, he said.
 
 Another activist, G Sundarrajan of  , an NGO, said the remediation should not be limited to the factory but carried out in the surrounding areas where the mercury had seeped into the soil.
 
 He also wanted the TNPCB to come clean about the remediation. It should convene a meeting of the LAEC which alone should approve the standards. A committee with activists as members should be formed to check if the remediation is being done as per international standards, he said.
 
 Official communication from the company said the trial will be monitored by the SEC, TNPCB and Central Pollution Control Board.
