NEW DELHI: Based on the complaint of a member of  's legal cell, Neeraj,   Reva Khetrapal has initiated proceedings in the matter of the Rs 2 crore bribery allegation that sacked Delhi minister   has levelled against chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and his cabinet colleague  . On Thursday, Lokayukta summoned Mishra to record his statement at the next hearing scheduled on May 19 or send a representative. 

  "Lokayukta has decided to hear the matter. It has summoned Mishra to record his statement," said Neeraj, whose own statement was recorded on Thursday. Though Mishra was given a notice to appear for Thursday's hearing, he didn't turn up. "Lokayukta was told about his dharna and he has been asked to either come in person or send his representative to present his version in the next hearing," said Neeraj. 
 
  "He (Mishra) has not levelled an allegation. He has said that he was witness to a bribe being taken by Kejriwal. His statement should be made the basis of the inquiry," said Neeraj. BJP said that Neeraj's petition was filed on the direction of Delhi unit chief Manoj Tiwari. 
 
  The party that AAP has always pushed for a Lokpal to investigate corruption cases against public servants. "Now that serious charges have been levelled against the CM and his close aide, the matter should be looked into by Lokayukta," said a BJP member.
