KOZHIKODE:  , which had been flaunting the tag of the first fully-digital varsity in the state, is all set to abandon the   punching it had launched for   and   research scholars, in 2013.

 The four-member syndicate panel formed to look into the issue following opposition from students has recommended to do away with the practice for all MPhil/PhD scholars, post-doctoral fellows, project fellows and women scientists in the varsity departments and approved research centres. The report will be tabled before the syndicate in its next meeting.
 
 The committee has now suggested reverting to the old practice of marking attendance in the registers maintained by research supervisors. The syndicate panel has recommended that part-time research scholars may mark a minimum of three days attendance in a month at their centre of registration.
 
 As per the report, the heads of departments will be entrusted to grant ‘on-duty leaves’ for research scholars to do field work.
 
 The panel has said that fellowships are to be granted on the basis of attendance report duly signed by the supervisor and recommended by the head of department.
 
 “We have found that the biometric system was affecting the academic freedom of students and limiting their mobility and flexibility required for carrying out research activities. Also, no other varsity in the state had implemented such a system for research scholars,” said syndicate member P Sivadasan, the convenor of the syndicate panel.
 
 The then vice-chancellor M Abdul Salam had ordered implementing the system in October 2013. The decision had sparked off a series of protests, including the 16 day-long White Rose-2 agitation in front of the varsity’s central library.
 
 The varsity had constituted a syndicate panel as the earlier two committees which looked into the matter came up with contradicting recommendations.
