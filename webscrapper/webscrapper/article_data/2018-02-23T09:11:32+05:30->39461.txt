CHENNAI: Former Pakistan diplomat Amir Zubair Siddiqui, who was posted as visa counsellor at the Pakistan high commission in Colombo, had conspired to attack vital establishments in India and pushed counterfeit Indian currency printed in his country for this purpose, says the chargesheet filed by the   at a special court in Chennai on Thursday. 

 The issue came to light after the NIA arrested   agent  , 37, who photographed installations in   including the US consulate in Chennai and sent the snaps to Siddiqui. Hussain also used his accomplices to circulate fake currency in the state. Hussain had been awarded five years imprisonment and is now detained in Puzhal prison. 
 
 The agency filed a chargesheet against Siddiqui, Balasubramanian alias Balan and Noorudeen alias Rafeeque alias Ismail at the special court for conspiring to wage war against the government of India, besides causing an explosion at the American consulate in Chennai and other places in South India. 
 
 "Siddiqui recruited agents from   and Tamil Nadu to set off a series of attacks at vital installations in south India and used Indian counterfeit currency printed in Pakistan to fund his activities," NIA sources said. 
 
 Siddiqui was withdrawn from the Pakistani mission in Colombo even before the NIA's request under the Mutual Assistance Legal Treaty (MLAT) reached the Sri Lankan capital.
