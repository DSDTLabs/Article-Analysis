BENGALURU: Parking his scooter and forgetting the key not only cost a Bengaluru man his vehicle — which was stolen — but also his insurance claim for “careless behaviour”. A city consumer court recently upheld the decision of the insurance firm by stating that “negligent behaviour does not deserve money.”

 The verdict was delivered by the Bangalore Urban second additional district consumer disputes redressal forum on April 5 after hearing the case of M Mahesh from   for more than two years.
 
 Mahesh purchased a   Dio scooter on November 13, 2012, and was using it for daily work. On July 23, 2013, he had parked the vehicle outside a coffee shop in JP Nagar Ist Stage. When he returned, the scooter was missing.
 
 He lodged a complaint with   and contacted   Lombard General Insurance, the insurers of his scooter. A surveyor from ICICI who examined the case later issued a letter rejecting Mahesh’s claim, citing the fact that he had left his key in the scooter. Mahesh appealed against it, but ICICI stood its ground adding that leaving the key in the vehicle amounts to gross negligence, which, therefore, makes him ineligible for claims. Following this, he approached the city consumer court on October 9, 2015 with a complaint against ICICI Lombard.
 
 The consumer court heard arguments from both sides and in a litigation that lasted 30 months, the judges spoke in favour of the insurance firm. They slammed Mahesh for his careless behaviour and lack of clarity in his complaint. They pointed out that he had not mentioned to police or other authorities that he had forgotten the key in the ignition before his vehicle was stolen, but had admitted to the ICICI surveyor that there was a   in the locker of the vehicle which could have made the theft easy.
 
 Summing up the facts, the judges ruled that Mahesh can’t benefit from his own mistake as his negligence had caused the loss, and that the insurance firm cannot be held responsible.
