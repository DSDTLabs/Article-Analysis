Kolkata: Bengal has made a fresh appeal to Odisha and Telangana to plug its forces deficit for the panchayat polls, a senior officer said on Sunday.

  Bengal had earlier written to five states seeking more forces. However, pressed to submit a detailed security plan in the Calcutta High Court on Tuesday, the state chose to make a fresh appeal to the two neighbouring states. Sources also indicated that even chief minister Mamata Banerjee had taken up the issue at appropriate levels.
 
 The state is keen to complete the poll process in one day on May 14. However, on its own, it is failing to match up to the state election commission’s requirements. The state’s proposal for an armed guard in each polling premise and a constable in every booth has failed to cut ice with SEC till now. With the security plan also likely to be under the HC glare, the state is trying hard to plug the force deficit of about 39,000 personnel.
 
 In a bid to step up pressure on the beleaguered poll body, BJP on Sunday alleged that state election commissioner A K Singh had been receiving threats from Trinamool Congress over conduct of panchayat polls, and his mobile was being tapped and landline calls were recorded. 
 
 “The announcement of a one-phase panchayat poll on May 14 has been made under threat and intimidation by Trinamool Congress leaders and ministers. The SEC should apprise the court of the situation in a private statement to clear the air,” BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha told a press conference. “SEC A K Singh had even told a BJP delegation that his mobile phone is being tapped and the landline calls are recorded,” Sinha claimed.
 
 SEC additional secretary Shantanu Mukherjee said the panel has no knowledge of the alleged tapping
