HYDERABAD: It was a big celebration for chief minister   on his 64th birthday on Saturday but two important people were missing at the at Pragathi Bhavan. KCR's son,   and nephew   were conspicuous by their absence. They had not met the CM, at least till late evening, though they did convey their wishes to him on twitter. 

 While IT minister K T Rama Rao was in Chennai attending a few programmes, irrigation minister T   was busy attending a host of functions, including addressing a public meeting in Mahbubnagar. Those who were not aware of this wondered why both of them had not shown up to wish the chief minister, though both did tweet their wishes. 
 
 Among the numerous party leaders, MLAs, MPs and ministers who turned up to greet the TRS supremo, the fact that KTR and Harish Rao were not around was not lost on them. Harish Rao who began his day early, first inaugurated a blood donation camp on the occasion of the CM's birthday at Chitrapuri colony, along with health minister C  . He attended some events in Mahbubnagar and in the evening addressed a public meeting at Narayapet. 
 
 "I was invited by Narayanpet MLA (S Rajendar Reddy) much in advance for this meeting. He thought that getting some works sanctioned would be easy on the chief minister's birthday as one would certainly consider it positively. He used that sentiment," he said in jest. 
 
 
 “Irrigation projects have been conceptualised by KCR. His only desire is to see that every part of the state gets water. What is a chief minister’s post for someone who was willing to sacrifice his life for achieving Telangana?” Harish Rao said. KTR had skipped his father’s birthday last year too. He was in Mumbai for the 25th Nasscom India Leadership Forum. This time, he was the chief guest at the annual convention of Madras Management Association. He also spoke at the YPO and YEO in Chennai.
