Trichy: With farmers complaining poor inflow in Uyyakondan despite the 1,000-year-old canal brimming with water that includes drainage, Public Works Department (PWD) during an inspection found that a branch canal of Uyyakondan facilitating irrigation in and Ariyamangalam was encroached upon by shops in Palpannai junction. Apparently, the PWD on Saturday removed the encroachments in the canal and widened the branch canal to its original width.

 Sources said that farmers belonging to Ariyamangalam, Tharanallur and Panayakurichi were complaining about poor inflow of water in the branch canals of Uyyakondan branching off near Palpannai junction and carrying water for irrigation in Ariyamangalam vicinity. Subsequently, in an inspection by PWD, it was found that the shops in Palpannai junction instead of laying slab over the canal have constructed foot path on the canal.
 
 “Against the actual width of 3m, the branch canal of Uyyakondan was shrunk to 1m in width due to the encroachments. With heavy machinery, we have removed the encroachments and restored the branch canal of Uyyakondan to its actual width,” an official source with PWD said.
 
 Encroachments shrinking the total width of Uyyakondan canal was found in about 300 metre stretch on Thanjavur road.
