There’s no questioning the recent rise in the crimes against  . And one way to fight them is to first stand up against them, especially given that several instances go unreported. Calling out to ladies everywhere, television actress   from Indore, who plays Angoori on  , shares her experiences.

 "When I was studying in Indore, my friend Anushree and I used to travel to college by public transport. One day, a boy came and stood too close to us and started playing with Anushree’s dupatta and was trying to touch us inappropriately. Anushree didn’t react and said we should get down at the next stop. But I realised that keeping quiet would only mean he would do this to some other girl. So I raised my voice and informed people around us. We were about to take him to the police station but he slipped away. I am happy that I at least revealed his intentions to people around so he thinks twice before doing something like this again.” She also wholeheartedly supports the new show Hoshiyaar on &Tv which is on the lines of crime against women."
 
    aka Anita Bhabhi also recalls the incident when she helped a relative who was a victim of domestic violence, “I once helped a relative of mine who was scared to open up about the   she was suffering. I encouraged her to share it with her parents and counselled her to come out of it. It’s great if we can educate people on how to stop crime and applaud those who help and save people.”
