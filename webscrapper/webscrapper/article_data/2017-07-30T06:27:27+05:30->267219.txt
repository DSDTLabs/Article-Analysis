KOLKATA: Parents of   students (boys and girls), with the help of Kolkata Police, are set to launch a carpool app next month to resolve the traffic chaos around the campuses. The schools on Loudon Street and Rawdon Street have been in the limelight as the cops introduced stringent traffic restrictions to ease congestion in the area.

 Earlier, the school authorities introduced several attempts to eliminate traffic bottlenecks, including one-way traffic, demarcated no-parking zones, assigned drop-off and pick-up zones, repeated traffic violation tickets and multi-coloured stickers. But they had little impact. 
 
 A month ago, the cops had allotted parking space at Rawdon Square. However, following a TOI report, an NGO moved   that stopped the park being used as a parking lot. 
 
 Thus, parents came up with a carpool app — ‘EcoSmartPool’, with the tag line ‘By the Parents for the Children’ — that allows guardians to offer seats in cars that are being used for transporting their own kids. The parent-owned pool cars will ferry kids and help in clearing the area. The app will let parents locate which other La Martiniere kid commutes from their locality and pick them up.
 
 “We support the initiative and hope other schools replicate the idea,” said Kolkata Police DC (traffic) V Solomon Nesakumar. Secretary of La Martiniere Schools Supriyo Dhar said, “We hope this will bring down   to some extent.”
 
 Such cars will have ‘e-stickers’ to let them halt near the school gate. There are plans to create a GPS tracker so that parents can view the cars’ positions. “What interests us is our kids will commute in well-maintained and safe cars,” said Manish Dalmia, a parent.
