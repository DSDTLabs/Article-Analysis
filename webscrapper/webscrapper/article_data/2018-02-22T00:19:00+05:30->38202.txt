Pune: Four armed robbers targetted a jewellery shop in Sugandhi Galli at Raviwar Peth and fled with gold jewellery weighing 800 gm, worth more than Rs 18 lakh, and Rs 30,000 in cash late on Wednesday afternoon.

 Manoj Jain (34) of Payal Gold lodged a complaint with the Faraskhana police. Senior inspector B G Ambure said the shop is located in the Nandan Terrace building and is owned by Lloyd Edmund Ferrao. Manoj Jain is Ferrao’s brother-in-law.
 
 On Wednesday afternoon, Jain was manning the shop alone as two other employees had gone for lunch. At 3.30 pm, three armed men entered the shop located in the congested market area and pulled down the shutter. 
 
 They threatened Jain with a sharp weapon and stole gold jewellery weighing 800 gm and Rs 30,000 from the counter. The stolen gold alone is worth more than Rs 18 lakh.
 
 CCTV footage of the crime reveals that three suspects had entered the shop while one stood outside. The suspect, who was standing outside, was talking on the phone, but he kept a tight vigil. “While the three robbers were inside, their accomplice was standing outside the shop, acting as a lookout,” said Ambure.
 
 After robbing the shop, the suspects ran out of the shop and Nandan Terrace building. Three of them then took a right turn towards the labyrinth joining Sugandhi Galli, near the Raviwar Peth railway reservation office. The fourth suspect, who was carrying the booty, ran in the opposite direction. “Jain had tried to chase them, but they escaped,” Ambure said. Faraskhana police and city crime branch officials rushed to the crime scene. Pankaj Dahane, deputy commissioner of police (crime), and Sameer Shaikh, assistant commissioner of police (crime), visited the spot. “We have obtained the CCTV footage and launched a search,” said a an officer.
