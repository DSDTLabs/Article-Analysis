LUCKNOW: In a stunning political development senior   (SP) leader and minister   joined   (BSP) on Saturday. 

 Chaudhary walked into BSP office when Mayawati was addressing a press conference. He said that he decided to shift his loyalties towards BSP because of the feud in the SP camp. He said that Akhilesh Yadav taking over his father Mulayam Singh Yadav as partyâ€™s national president has not gone down well with the party workers. 
 
 "There was all round resentment and that could lead to BJP winning the assembly elections," he said. Chaudhary was immediately given the ticket from Phephna seat in Ballia district.
 
 "I have taken him in the party and he will be given full respect in the BSP at all levels, much more than he was getting in the SP. The party will field him from his old seat in Ballia in the Assembly polls," Mayawati said.
 
 Chaudhary said he has resigned from all posts in the Samajwadi Party.
 
 Referring to the infighting in Mulayam Singh Yadav's clan, Chaudhary said, "It was not merely an internal matter of a particular party at the time of elections. This political party is in power and has the responsibility to check BJP from coming to power."
 
 But, he said, "the manner in which these developments came to an end... before the Election Commission on January 16 only proved that the intention of the tussle was something other than shielding the secular movement and the downtrodden".
 
 "It is also important that anyone can support or oppose Mulayam Singh politically but the manner in which CM Akhilesh Yadav and his people behaved with him .... and he was rejected, has been deplored in the whole country and I am also very sad because of it," he said.
 
 Chaudhary thanked Mayawati for giving him a chance "in the decisive" fight against the communal forces.
 
 During the tussle in the SP, Chaudhary was involved in negotiations with Shivpal Singh Yadav for finding a solution.
