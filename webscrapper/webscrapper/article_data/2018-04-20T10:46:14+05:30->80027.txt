TRICHY: Nineteen out of 20 students who were arrested for protesting at   on April 11 demanding Cauvery Management Board were released from   central prison on Thursday. One student’s release was withheld as he did not get bail. Student activist M  , 23, was also released from special prison for women, while her associate  , 22, was yet to get bail.

 The happiness was however short-lived for two students- Mohammed Ajmal and Peer Mohammed- as they were again remanded in prison by Cantonment police on charges of pelting stones at a KSRTC bus near Sona Mina theatre, before they joined the CMB protest on April 11 night.
 
 Valarmathi, Kurinjithen and two other men were arrested by Thanjavur police when they got down at Thanjavur bus stand on April 7 when they were on their way to Kathiramangalam to express their solidarity with the residents who have been protesting against ONGC oil exploration.
 
 On being released, Valarmathi termed the governance in Tamil Nadu an ‘undeclared emergency.’ “Without shutting the hydrocarbon project, it is not possible to form the Cauvery Management Board. Tamil Nadu is acting at the behest of BJP and corporates. We will be unfazed by their repression towards us,” Valarmathi told the reporters on Thursday.
