MUMBAI:   president Uddhav Thackeray has urged non-BJP parties to consider the option of boycotting the next polls citing the EVM fiasco, saying the   (EC) lacks integrity. Launching an attack on the  , Uddhav said international observers should be invited to monitor India’s polls. “Just like they have international umpires for IPL matches, there should be observers from other countries to keep tabs on the electoral process in India,” he said.

 Addressing a press meet on Thursday, Uddhav alleged there were grave discrepancies in counting of votes in Palghar and demanded poll officials should be suspended. He said Sena has written to the EC over the irregularities. “Should need arise we may move the courts too,” he said, adding, “We think the Sena hasn’t really lost the by-election. It’s all because of EC’s machinations.”
 
 He said he would not accept Sena’s defeat in Palghar. “More than 8 lakh voters voted, of which over 6 lakh rejected  . So it’s not our defeat,” he said. He also praised “the people of UP for killing UP CM Yogi Adityanath’s arrogance in Gorakhpur, Phulpur and Kairana.”
 
 There was speculation that Sena might announce withdrawal of its support to the Fadnavis government on Thursday evening. But Thackeray avoided a question on this, telling mediapersons, “I am not here to answer your questions but to give answers to the ‘janata’ (people).” He reiterated that Sena would go solo in all future elections.
 
 Uddhav alleged the EC had perpetuated a “corrupt election system.” “Balasaheb Thackeray was once robbed of his voting rights by the EC on grounds of corrupt electoral practices. But today the EC presides over a corrupt poll system,” he said.
 
 “By 6pm on day of polling, the electoral officers announced 46.5 as polling percentage. The papers were duly signed by EC officers. But hours later a lakh votes were added and EC officers revised the percentage. This is unbelievable,” he said.
