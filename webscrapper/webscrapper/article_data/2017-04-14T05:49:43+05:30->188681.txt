AHMEDABAD: Imagine that you walk out of the city airport in this summer heat, thinking you’ll hop onto a cool cab, but the mobile app refuses to show any   available. 

 This has become a common experience for many travellers across the city, as cab drivers of private cab aggregators, Uber and  , have been on strike for the past five days.
 
 Commuters depending on these aggregator services are in a major fix. “My car is under repair in a workshop. I thought I would take an Uber or Ola cab. However, since the drivers are on strike, it is difficult form me to manage amid this blistering heat,” said Tushar Patel, a resident of Prahladnagar.
 
 Sources said that the cab drivers are protesting over insufficient pay and cuts in incentives.
