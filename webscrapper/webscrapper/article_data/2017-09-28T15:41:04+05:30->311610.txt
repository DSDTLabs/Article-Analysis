NEW DELHI: India's senior team goalkeeper   said the country needs to "make the most" of the opportunity to host the   U-17  .

 With just eight days to go for the biggest footballing event India has ever witnessed,   called it a great honour.
 
 "We need to make the most of this opportunity," Gurpreet said.
 
 The senior national team custodian thinks that India has to use it for the betterment of football.
 
 "It's a great honour for us as a country and footballers and football lovers to have something like the World Cup happening in our nation," he said.
 
 With six venues across the nation hosting the matches, the infrastructure has been revamped and modernised according to FIFA guidelines on a massive scale.
 
 Gurpreet thinks it should also encourage the fans to turn up at the games.
 
 "I think the modernisation of the infrastructure will be a plus no doubt, but I hope that it also educates the Indian population about the game even more."
 
 He also had some word of advice for the players representing the country in the World Cup.
 
 "I think the boys are very lucky to have an opportunity like this. I wish I had such a platform. It will certainly help them to develop their careers. I hope they use it in the right way."
