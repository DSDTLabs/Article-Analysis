PATNA: The   (MCI) has given approval to the   ( ) to start Doctorate of Medicine (DM) in neurology from August. The three-year post-doctorate course deals with the study of disorders of the nervous system and their remedies.

 “With two seats, the IGIMS will be the only government college in Bihar and Jharkhand to run a DM in neurology course,” neurology department head Dr Ashok Kumar said on Thursday.
 
 According to sources, in February this year, the MCI had denied permission to the IGIMS to run a DM in neurology course, citing faculty crunch as a reason.
 
 Dr Ashok informed this newspaper the neurology department was able to fulfil all the criteria required for the course, including the appointment of two assistant professors. 
 
 “As of now, the department has three professors, apart from me. Dr Abhay Ranjan is an associate professor, while Dr Janardan and Dr Sanjeev Kumar have been appointed as assistant professors,” Dr Ashok said.
 
 Several other IGIMS departments had sought the MCI’s permission to start many new courses. However, only the department of pathology had received approval for running a Doctor of Medicine course in February.
 
 IGIMS director Dr N R   said different departments had fulfilled the required criteria for starting new courses and would submit a compliance report on May 29. “We expect to receive approval for other courses as well,” he told this reporter.
