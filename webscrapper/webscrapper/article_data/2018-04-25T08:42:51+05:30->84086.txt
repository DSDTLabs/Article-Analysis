PANAJI: The vaccination drive by the directorate of health services (DHS) against   forest disease (KFD), also known as monkey disease, seems to be bearing results, with the number of cases reported during the cashew season, especially from March-May, registering a significant dip.

 
 
  
  
 
 State epidemologist Dr   said, this year, about 55 cases have been recorded since January, whereas in 2017, about 280 cases were detected, with the majority being reported during the cashew season extending from January to May.
 
 “Our vaccination drive is still on and will end before monsoon. It look like the measures to control the disease have worked. Though we will register more cases in the next few days, the number will be small compared to last year,” said Betodkar.
 
 “Last year, the disease was prevalent in more areas and had affected a larger number of people, whereas this year the cases have been localised and limited to a few areas. Also, no critical cases have been reported this year, nor has any KFD-related death occurred,”   said, discussing about indications that the disease has taken a beating.
 
 This year, a few cases of KFD have been reported from places like Cumthol, Carambolim-Buzruco, Caranzol and   in Sattari taluka. However, no cases have been reported from other talukas in North Goa.
 
 Meanwhile, Betodkar said, people should not stop taking precautions against KFD although the numbers have come down. Anit-KFD vaccines are available at the community health center in  , and primary health centers at Sankhalim, Dharbandora, Cansarvarnem, Betki and Marcaim.
