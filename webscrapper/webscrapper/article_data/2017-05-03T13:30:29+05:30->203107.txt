Haven’t we always come across headlines that say “This year’s biggest box-office clashes” or “It’s SRK V/S Aamir this Christmas”? These big-budget clashes sure make us excited and pepped about upcoming movies and what’s better than having more than one option for a great weekend watch, right!

 But, have you ever wondered why these movies only have   actors clashing to give a big hit and emerge as the box-office king? Why have we never heard leading ladies of Bollywood having a box-office fight? 
 
 It’s not that Bollywood lacks any talent when it comes to actresses. In fact, we feel that female stars have better screen presence and could help mint more money for movies if propagated in a sensible manner. Are women in movies only for objectification or as eye-candies?
 
 Despite having several women-oriented films that have done wonders at the box-office, why hasn’t there been a single contemporary actresses’ battle to be witnessed on screen? Imagine   and Deepika Padukone’s big releases coming out in theatres on the same day. 
 
 We’ll have ‘Padmavati’ and ‘Tiger Zinda Hai’ release on the same day! Won’t that be just amazing to see these arch-rivals showcasing their talent and fight hard to be touted as the box-office queen?
 
 Wonder when something as phenomenal as this would happen. We would love to see Bollywood divas have a friendly clash, would you?
