' ' movies might be holiday favourites for many families, but they aren't for  , who starred in the films as a child actor.

 According to reports, on a show, Culkin admitted he doesn't watch the classic comedies.
 
 The actor told,"I don't really watch them all that often,". 
 
 In fact, the   character described it as "background radiation at   time".
 
 "I've had people want to sit down and watch it with me," he told the host, "which is, like, both flattering and creepy". 
 
 If Culkin does catch one of the movies, he tends to think more about his time on set than the plot itself.
 
 "I can't watch it the same way other people do," he said.
 
 He doesn't even make an exception come December 25 (Christmas).
 
 "So, when it comes on ... which it comes on, I'm sure, every Christmas, every Thanksgiving...you don't watch it?" DeGeneres asked. 
 
 "No, not really," he replied.
