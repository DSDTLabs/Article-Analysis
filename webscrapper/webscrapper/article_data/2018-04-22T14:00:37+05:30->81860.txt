HYDERABAD: Sunrisers Hyderabad will be happy to be back home after mixed luck on the road, where they won one and lost another.

 
 
 
 The high of three wins out from three outings, including their first win at the Eden Gardens, was flattened by the presence and power of ‘Universe Boss’ Chris Gayle in Mohali. It was not hard to fathom why Kings XI Punjab opted for a strip short of any help for the bowlers given the potency of Hyderabad’s attack, and in trusting their instincts upfront, Punjab were well served by   XI’s first century courtesy Gayle.
 
 
 
 That the Sunrisers came within 15 runs of Punjab’s total without any contribution from Shikhar Dhawan, who retired hurt after being struck a painful blow, is an indication of a middle order justifying the faith. Skipper   has led the way with two half-centuries in two away games and that should augur well for the Sunrisers when they host Chennai Super Kings on Sunday.
 
 The mercury’s been rising, but the heat and oppressive conditions of a 4PM start should not deter from it being a full house at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium for the top of the tree clash of teams with six points from three wins apiece. Unlike the Sunrisers, who started their campaign emphatically with a nine-wicket win over Rajasthan Royals, and escaped to victory over Mumbai off the last delivery with one wicket to spare and defeated Kolkata Knight Riders by five wickets, all in low scoring encounters, Chennai have switched gears adroitly.
 
 The tournament opener was as close as it can get, but by defeating Mumbai with one wicket and one ball to spare, Chennai announced their comeback to the league after two years out, in style. They followed it with a command show against Kolkata as Sam Billings strutted his stuff and though they lost a close one to Kings XI by four runs, they turned on the style at their new ‘home’ in Pune against Rajasthan Royals.
