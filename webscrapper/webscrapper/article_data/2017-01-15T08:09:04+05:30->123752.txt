THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Rajan   set up by the state government to review the structure e of the state higher education council act and the functioning of the commission has submitted the commission report to education minister C Raveendranath here on Friday. 

 The commission ruled out the need for any   in the Act passed by the   in 2007. 
 
 However, the commission, recommended some additions and deletions in the existing act so as to enable the council to receive and manage central government funding through   (RUSA), Gurukkal told reporters in a news conference here.
 
 The commission has suggested the government to put an end to the practice of the council nominees representing the council in university syndicates. Instead, the executive council members should be nominated to academic councils of universities. 
 
 The recommendations of the commission include the following. Evolve common academic guidelines for universities in the state for mutual recognition/approval/equalisation of academic programmes /areas of studies and nomenclature thereof of various programmes conducted by universities/higher education institutions outside the state and outside the country, evolve programme to improve access of different-abled students to higher education.
 
 Since the expiry of the tenure of the last council on 11th April 2016, the activities of the council have virtually come to a standstill, though the council continues to function nominally with a skeleton staff. In the absence of decision making officers/authorities, programmes such as cluster of colleges, erudite scheme, and training programmes for teachers/students/administrators have all been discontinued, crippling equitable and qualitative development of higher education in the state. 
 
 Therefore, immediate reconstitution of the council shoud be a top priority of the government, the commission report said.
