HYDERABAD: In tune with the decision of the South India   (SIMTA), Lorry Owners’ Associations in Telangana and   have decided to go ahead with the indefinite   of   vehicles from Thursday morning.

 “All transport vehicles will come to a halt from 6 am on March 30. Only vehicles carrying essential commodities are exempted from the strike,” said SIMTA president Gopal Naidu.
 
 Meanwhile, the state government has directed district collectors to ensure that there is no shortage of essential commodities during the strike although sources said that Telangana transport minister P Mahender Reddy is likely to call the striking unions for a second round of talks in a day or two.
 
 The first round of talks was held on March 27 wherein the minister assured leaders of the transport association that the state government will try to solve problems that can be dealt at its level and would take up with the central government the issues under the ambit of the latter. 
 
 Sources told TOI that the transport minister has already directed transport principal secretary Sunil Sharma to again initiate a dialogue with AP government for striking a deal between the two states for a ‘single permit system’, which is one of the top demands on the list of the Lorry Owners’ Associations from the two Telugu states.
 
 SIMTA secretary G Durga Prasad explained that in undivided AP, there used to be a single permit system, wherein lorries from AP could enter neighbouring states like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Odisha after paying for a single permit costing Rs 5,000 for each state per annum.
 
 After the bifurcation of the state, both Telangana and AP had not signed this single permit system agreement due to which   are paying Rs 5,000 every month instead of per year for entry into other states.
