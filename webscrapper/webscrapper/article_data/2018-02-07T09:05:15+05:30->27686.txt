HYDERABAD: Task Force sleuths and   police have busted a narcotics racket operating in the city and arrested three peddlers, including a Nigerian national. Police have seized 75 LSD blots, 30 grams of charas, a gram of heroin and 30 grams of ganja from their possession.

 Agala Alumah Friday, 30, a Nigerian national staying in Goa,  , 27, a Kashmiri from Goa, and   Sunkara, 19, a BBA student of St Paul’s Degree College in Himayatnagar, were arrested at Madhushala Bar & Resturant in Hyderguda for possession of drugs on Tuesday.
 
 Yash Sunkara used to visit Goa frequently. During one such visit, a year ago, he met Abid after a request from a common friend. Yash had purchased LSD from him and they became friends. Subsequently, Yash started procuring drugs from Abid to sell them in Hyderabad. “Yash used to inform his clients through Snapchat, a social networking app, and would take order for narcotics from them,” DCP, Task Force, P   said.
 
 Yash used to purchase drugs at a lower price and sell it for profit. “Yash used to purchase LSD blot from Abid Nazir for ?1,000 to ?1,500. He would sell the same for ?2,000 to ?3,000. Abid Nazir was procuring drugs from Nigerian peddler Agala Alumah Friday,” Task Force inspector, S Srinivasa Rao, said.
 
 A few days ago, Yash asked Abid to bring LSD and charas to Hyderabad as several customers were asking for the drugs. As per the request, Abid Nazir and Agala Aluma came to the city along with the contraband. While they were about to handover the drugs to Yash, police arrested them.
 
 During investigation, police learned that Agala Alumah Friday came to India on a two-month tourist visa in May, 2013, and did not return. Narayanguda police produced the trio along with the seized drugs before court and they were remanded to judicial custody.
