NEW DELHI: The   body protesting against Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s ‘Padmavati’ – retitled ‘Padmavat’ – issued a ‘warning’ on Wednesday, saying it would impose a ‘janata (people’s) curfew’ if the film is released in India.

 Chief of Rajput   Lokendra Singh Kalvi said any theatre screening the Deepika Padukone-starrer would face “detrimental consequences.”
 
 “We cannot allow our invaluable legacy to be ruined because of the film as it brings disgrace to Rani   and is an attack on Rajput pride. It presents distorted facts and threatens to shake India’s cultural identity... We will impose a janata curfew if it releases,” Kalvi said. He added that there can be no compromise on the issue.
 
 Kalvi said ‘janata curfew’ would be a peaceful protest against the screening of the film in theatres across the country. He claimed there were enough volunteers to do so.
 
 Kalvi claimed that he has held meetings with CMs of Telangana, Uttarakhand and Chhattisgarh, and was assured that the film will not release there. Rajasthan has already refused permission to screen the film citing people’s sentiments, and Goa has said it would not be released in peak tourist season.
