Noida: In an attempt to create political space for the disabled and to allow them to exercise their franchise in a dignified and accessible manner, the Gautam Budh Nagar district collector—as per the directions of the Election Commission of India— has drawn up several measures to make polling booths disabled-friendly during the upcoming assembly elections. While a set of facilities will be made available at nearly 250 booths including ramps for the disabled and Braille ballot papers for the visually impaired, the senior citizens and women will be assisted in casting their vote by district officials on poll duty.

 Speaking to TOI, district magistrate N.P Singh, who is also the returning electoral officer, said that nearly 250 polling booths have been identified in GBN, where physically challenged or senior person will be helped by district staff, NCC cadets and Anganwadi workers.
