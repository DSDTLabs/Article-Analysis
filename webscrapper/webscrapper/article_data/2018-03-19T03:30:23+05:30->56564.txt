AGARTALA: Hundreds of representatives of BJP’s ally in   Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura ( ), including a minister, joined a demonstration in New Delhi on Sunday in which they raised their demand for a separate state of Twipraland.

 This led to speculation about the equation shared by the two allies, even though   had, while entering an alliance with IPFT before Tripura assembly polls, said creation of a separate Twipraland was not on the table.
 
 Opposition parties raised IPFT’s participation in the rally for a separate state. “The party, that became a partner in the government despite the statehood demand being rejected, has gone back to its original stance to press for a separate tribal state. It is a bad sign for the BJP government in Tripura,” said Jagadish Debbarma, vice-president of IPFT’s rival tribal party Indigenous Nationalist Party of Twipra (INPT).
