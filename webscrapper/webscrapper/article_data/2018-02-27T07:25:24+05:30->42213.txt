KOLKATA: Kavita Davies, a lawyer based in the UK, was connecting with her friends in India, when she came across a post by on of them. In the post, ADCP (south) Aparajita Rai had sought donations for petty criminals severely addicted to drugs so that they are able to pursue vocational courses. Kavita did not think twice before enlisting as one of the first volunteers.

 Sanjeev Das, a forester from Tripura, had lost his wallet containing several thousand rupees and important documents during a past trip to Kolkata. He was grateful when the cops found it for him. On February 8, when   announced on its Facebook page that they were looking for sponsors to help these men come out of the vicious crime-for-drugs cycle, Das declared he wanted to donate the recovered amount.
 
 
  
 A Kolkata Police Facebook appeal for crowdfunding a rehabilitation project for addict-criminals — Project Shuddhi — has elicited an overwhelming response. The respondents include the Sonika 27 Foundation, the NGO set up by relatives and friends of model  , who died in a car crash on Rashbehari Avenue last year. The foundation agreed to fund the rehabilitation of five such men.
 
 Even people like Sunil Kumar from Howrah, who found donating large amounts at one go difficult, wanted to be a part of the project. He convinced the cops that he would sponsor at least one person for a month and then arrange Rs 9,000 each month from his salary for the next five.
 
 Just 18 days since the project was launched, 26 individuals, NGOs and corporates have enrolled themselves as sponsors. Another 35 are waiting to be clared by Lalbazar. A corpus of Rs 5.5 lakh is already in the kitty.
