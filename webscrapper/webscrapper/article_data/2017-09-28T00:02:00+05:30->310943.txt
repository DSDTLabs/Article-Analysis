Pune: When some men approached the driver of a sports utility vehicle (SUV) to tell him that one of the tyres of the vehicle had suffered a puncture, he promptly stepped out to check the damage. As the driver was examining the tyre, the thieves made away with a bag containing Rs4.23 lakh from the vehicle. The incident occurred outside the main gate of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) around 7.15pm on Tuesday. 

 Labour and security contractor Rangnath Gadge-Patil (64), a resident of Nigdi, owns the SUV. On Tuesday afternoon, while the contractor and his manager Devappa Kitturkar stepped out of the car to visit PMC for some work, driver Vilas Thanambir stayed back in the vehicle.
 
 Thanambir was seated in the vehicle when a man diverted his attention by saying that a tyre seemed deflated. While the man from the spot, Thanambir stepped out of the vehicle to check the tyre. Not seeing any damage, he returned to his seat only to find that the vehicle’s rear door had been opened and the bag was missing. Ghadge-Patil said, “The driver is an old and trusted employee. The miscreant tricked him and stole the bag” “On Thursday morning, a conductor from the Lower Parel bus depot in Mumbai called to say that my bag was found. I reached there and found that the business documents were intact, but the cash was gone,” he added.
 
 Shivajinagar police’s senior inspector Prabhakar Shinde said, “CCTV cameras installed at PMC haven’t captured images of the men. We are working on certain clues to detect the case at the earliest.”
