Close on the heels of a Mollywood actress being abducted and harassed,   actress   took to her social networking site to reveal a horrific experience in her life. The actress revealed that the programming head of a leading TV channel made unwanted advances at her during a meeting and she had asked the man to get out once she understood his intentions. 

 “A common reaction from people, both in the industry and outside when they hear things like this is to say, ‘film industry is like this. You knew so when you joined. Why complain now or act supposed?. My response is this, I didn’t come to the industry to be treated like a piece of meat or to follow the standards of exploitation of women already practised.”
 
 The actress also urged women to speak out against such instances so they are nipped in the bud. “The incidents of rape, molestation, manhandling and disrespect to women are rising at alarming rates. Our education is failing us. I am not a victim and I don’t intend to play one. I am speaking out on behalf of all the girls who are not speaking out due to fear. Fear of men and fear that they will be punished as women for speaking out,” she wrote.
