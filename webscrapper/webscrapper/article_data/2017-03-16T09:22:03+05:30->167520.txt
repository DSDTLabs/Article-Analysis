NEW DELHI: BJP’s resounding victory in the recent state elections has had a global impact. At least two world leaders have called Prime Minister   to congratulate him on the results, marking an unusual international interest.

 The Prime Minister’s official handle tweeted on Wednesday that the Emir of  , Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and French President   had called   to congratulate him on his party’s victory.
 
 
 
 
 
 The calls indicate several things, sources said. First, that the victory was a midterm endorsement for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his policies.
 
 Second, that his government would have the mandate to continue with a reforms programme, which may not have had the required energy if he had lost.
 
 Third, Modi’s disruptive actions like demonetisation was seen to be a step backwards for India but the victory has signalled to those watching from outside that such moves had received a political thumbs-up from the voting population. 
 
 It is also the first time that domestic state polls have garnered so much international attention.
 
 This comes in the context of other countries going through possibly major electoral changes this year, particularly the Netherlands, France and Germany. Modi’s continuation may be seen as a sign of stability.
