NEW DELHI: After 20 private trucks managed to transport around 350 tonnes of garbage to the   on Saturday,   decided to use 35 trucks on Sunday night. 

 East Delhi, which has around 40 lakh residents, generates around 2,300 tonnes domestic waste every day and has accumulated around 9,000 tonnes of garbage since Friday. Each truck can lift around 20 tonnes of garbage every day.
 
 “We wanted to hire 23 trucks on Saturday, but could get only 20,” said an official. The trucks partially removed the garbage lying along main roads while inner roads connecting highly populated areas remained untouched. According to the records at Ghazipur, the trucks made 76 rounds to the landfill site. East corporation spokesperson Yogendra Singh Maan said commissioner Mohanjeet Singh had asked the trucks to remove garbage from colony roads as well. Mayor   urged the residents to minimise waste generation and dispose of wet waste first. 
 
 The cleaning operations began around 10pm and would continue till Monday morning mainly in Ramesh Park, Mother Dairy, Seemapuri, Mayur Vihar and Shakarpur. 
 
 Resident welfare associations (RWAs) across east Delhi said they were suffering due to the crisis created by politicians. Vijay Kochhar, president of Geeta Colony RWA, said “Dhalaos were full on the very first day. No EDMC truck has come to help us. So we are helping ourselves with self-help groups. We are collecting garbage in plastic bags from homes and transferring those using bicycles. Politicians should focus on doing something right instead of just fighting with each other.”
 
 B S Vohra, president of East Delhi RWA Joint Front, said, “Situation is only growing worse and contrary to EDMC’s claims, we have not seen any truck clearing our areas. The real problem is with people throwing garbage on streets.” V N Bali, who heads RWA Federation of Delhi East, said the associations in Krishna Nagar and Preet Vihar had set up small groups to supervise the work.
