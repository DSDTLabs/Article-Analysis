The final schedule of Imtiaz Ali’s next film has now taken lead actors 
  and 
  to the streets of Punjab. After travelling to exotic locations around Prague, Amsterdam, Lisbon and Budapest, the two actors along with a large crew, were spotted shooting a portion of the film on home soil.
 
 SRK and Anushka created quite a fan frenzy in and around the neighbourhood, as a number of fans rushed to the shooting location to grab a glimpse of the stars. While Anushka managed to sneak away, leading man Shah Rukh was seen posing for selfies with fans and even taking time out to wave at those waiting eagerly to see him.
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
 Once shooting got on the way, SRK was seen in a crisp white shirt (much like the one we’ve seen before during the international schedule). Anushka was spotted in a de-glam, traditional avatar sporting a salwar kameez. According to reports, the stars are expected to shoot a Punjabi song sequence that would allegedly be choreographed by director Ali himself.
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
 The film will see the two co-stars team up for the third time on-screen, after hits like ‘Jab Tak Hai Jaan’ and ‘Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi’. The yet-untitled film, which is slated for an August 11 release, will see Shah Rukh playing a tour guide, while Anushka will be seen playing the role of a Gujarati girl on a world tour. The adventure-romance will be clashing with Akshay Kumar and Bhumi Pednekar’s ‘Toilet: Ek Prem Katha’ which was originally expected to hit theatres in June, but was pushed back because of shooting delays.
