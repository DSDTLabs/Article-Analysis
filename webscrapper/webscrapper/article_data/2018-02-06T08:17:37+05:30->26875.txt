CHANDIGARH: The Union ministry of home affairs ( ) is contemplating some policy governing the   posted in Union territories. The policy would be finalized within a period of six months.

 A formal statement in this regard was made by the counsel for MHA before the Punjab and   high court on Monday during the hearing of the case related to repatriation of DANIPS cadre officers from Chandigarh. The counsel said he has received an email from the MHA in this regard.
 
 On hearing the MHA’s response, the division bench headed by Justice Mahesh Grover directed the counsel to produce the copy of the mail on the next date of hearing.
  
  
 The bench also ordered to extend the stay on the repatriation of eight officers of DANIPS cadre from the post of deputy superintendent of police (DSPs) in Chandigarh police to Delhi till February 14.
 
 The matter is pending before the HC in the wake of a petition filed by the Chandigarh administration through its home secretary challenging the orders of the Chandigarh bench of   (CAT), which had ordered the MHA for repatriation of eight DSPs of DANIPS cadre from Chandigarh police to Delhi.
 
 With these orders, eight DSPs –– Pawan Kumar, Satish Kumar, Chepyala Anjitha, Rashmi Sharma, Deepak Yadav, Krishan Kumar, Sukhraj Katewa and Rajiv Kumar Ambasta –– would continue to function in Chandigarh police till February 14.
 
 The CAT had repatriated of these officers after hearing the petition by some police inspectors of Chandigarh police, demanding their promotion on the post of DSP.
 
 In its petition, the Chandigarh administration had argued that if all DANIPS officers are repatriated instantly, it will have grave and serious effect on the overall law enforcement of the city and such consequences would not be in the larger interest of the administration as well as the citizens.
 
 It was further submitted that losing eight out of the existing 17 DSPs will deplete the police force dramatically and adversely affect its working.
