 This is the first time that an SHO-rank official has been suspended in the hometown of deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya for his failure to curb cow slaughter. 
 
 Kaushambi superintendent of police VK Mishra suspended   SHO Sameer Singh on Tuesday. 
 
 Besides, constables Ghan Shyam and Mahesh Kumar were sent to lines as they did not take corrective measures to check cow slaughtering in the area, Mishra told TOI.
 
 On Tuesday morning, the carcass of a cow was found near Karari block, the SP said, adding that when locals informed the police station, the SHO neither visited the spot nor made any attempt to ascertain the identity of the person who had killed the cow. 
 
 The SP said the SHO should have taken immediate action but he showed laxity and did not make efforts to compile information on miscreants involved in the incident. Mishra not only suspended the errant SHO but also shifted SSI (senior sub-inspector) of Karari police station to another police station. 
 
 Mishra claimed Karari police have been asked to register a case under appropriate sections and efforts are underway to arrest miscreants involved in the incident.
