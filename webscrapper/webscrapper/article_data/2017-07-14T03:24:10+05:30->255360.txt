KOLKATA: The   (CBFC) has taken cover under guidelines of the Cinematograph Act, 1952, to explain why it has asked to mute four words/phrases in 'The Argumentative Indian', the documentary on  . Filmmaker   has refused to buy the argument, saying the guidelines are "so subjective that any dialogue can be censored citing them". 

 The board had objected to "Hindu India", "Gujarat", "Hindutva" and "cow". "All CBFC members are given the authority to interpret the guidelines their way. There is some higher authority who has instructed them to function this way. The entire system has left me frustrated... The voice of opposition is needed for a functional democracy," Ghosh told TOI on Thursday. 
 
 "We are public servants and have to abide by guidelines," said CBFC member Mala Dutta Ghosh. "All our recommendations are based on guidelines." 
 
 But guidelines are open to interpretation. "It's true guidelines can be interpreted differently. But as public servants, we give our views based on good faith. Under Section 5B of the Cinematograph Act, each board member is empowered to give his/her view independently. We have to substantiate our views by matching them with the guidelines," added Mala Dutta Ghosh. 
 
 CBFC sources said documentary had violated guidelines 2 (XV) and 2 (XII). The committee had asked for the word "Gujarat" to be muted where Sen mentioned "criminality of Gujarat". 
 
 “Guideline 2 (XV) says the board shall ensure that the security of the state is not jeopardised or in danger,” said a source.
