VADODARA: Soon, when you board an  , you will see a   behind the driver’s seat. Also visible will be the name of a police station. If you face any harassment, all you have to do is approach that   and give the specified number to the cops who will track down the auto within minutes. 

 In a bid to tackle crime and harassment of rickshaw passengers, the police have launched a project in the city. All the registered autorickshaws are being given a special number that will be displayed inside and on the outer body of the auto. “We are in process of giving unique number to every auto that is operating in the city. This number will be the identity of the autos. Name of the police station in which the auto is registered too will be mentioned with the number,” said A K  , traffic ( ). 
 
 “The idea is to have a complete database of the autos along with details of its owners. We are gathering address, phone number and other details of every auto driver before assigning him this number. The data of auto drivers will be stored in a software,” Wanani told TOI. 
 
 “It’s difficult to usually remember the license plate number of an auto. This new number will be mentioned in bold and visible letters in the autos and it will be easier to remember,” Wanani added. 
 
 If the passenger’s purse or any valuable goes missing while travelling in any auto or if the auto driver harasses the passenger, he or she can approach the police station that is mentioned in the auto. All that the cops have to do is enter the unique number in their software and all the details of the driver or owner will be on the screen. The city currently has about 15,000 registered autos. Ove next two days, nearly 5,000 autos will get the unique number and registrations will be divided among all the 21 police stations in the city.
 
 “Citizens, especially women, often travel in autos during late nights. This move is aimed to ensure their safety. The project will be launched soon,” Wanani added.
