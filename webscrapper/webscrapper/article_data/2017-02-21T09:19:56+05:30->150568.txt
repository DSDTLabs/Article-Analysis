CHENNAI: Two days after Tamil Nadu assembly expressed confidence in the   government in a trust vote — amid ruckus created by the   after the speaker refused a   — the party has taken the issue to Madras high court.

 DMK working president and leader of the opposition in the assembly   on Monday filed a PIL on four points. 
 
 One, it sought that the court direct the authorities to produce a videograph recording of the adoption of confidence motion; two, it asked for an interim stay of the decision of the speaker; three, that the court issue an order to restrain Palaniswami and his ministry from taking any policy decision in any manner; and, four, that it issue an interim direction to the speaker asking him to conduct a fresh secret ballot on the confidence motion moved by Palaniswami by allowing all MLAs without the eviction of any of them, under the observation of a monitoring committee consisting of the secretary to the governor, the chief secretary and an official from Election Commission of India.
 
 Stalin also urged the court to declare as illegal, null and void the speaker’s decision of February 18 on the confidence motion that Palaniswami had moved. 
 
 Senior advocate and former DMK Rajya Sabha member R Shanmugasundaram on Monday morning raised the case with the first bench and sought an urgent hearing. A bench of acting chief justice Huluvadi G Ramesh and justice R Mahadevan asked him to file the petition, so that it could be heard on Tuesday.
 
 The court will, it is now clear, on Tuesday take up for hearing the first of the PILs bringing the Tamil Nadu assembly’s February 18 proceedings under  .
 
 Another MLA from the O Panneerselvam faction is preparing a similar petition in court. An earlier bid to move an urgent house motion before a judge during the weekend did not succeed since the acting chief justice was away.
