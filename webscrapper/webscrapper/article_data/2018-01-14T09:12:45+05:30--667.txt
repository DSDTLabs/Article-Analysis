TRICHY/CHENNAI: Trichy rural police seized demonetised currency notes worth 1 crore from four people near   on the outskirts of the city on Saturday evening. Acting on a tip, Uppiliyapuram police intercepted a car at Thoppampatti and found four men in possession of the demonetised notes. 

 The notes were of 1000 and 500 denominations adding up to 77.5 lakh and 22.5 lakh respectively. The notes were made invalid by the Union government in November 2016 as part of an effort to wipe out black money. The four men were identified as   from Erode, Vijayan from   in Namakkal, Veluchamy from Salem and Chinnathambi from Thiruchengodu in   district. They were taken to the Uppiliyapuram police station and grilled by the police. 
 
 The accused claimed to have collected the notes from several people. They brought the notes from Salem to   on the promise by one Panneerselvam of Govindhapuram in Thuraiyur that he would exchange the invalid currency for the new ones in circulation. Though the four met Panneerselvam, their deal failed to work out. Hence, they were returning to Salem when the police caught them. 
 
 The police said that they were yet to decide on further action as they were awaiting an inquiry by the   department. The police officials had informed the assistant director of investigation of IT, Trichy about the seizure. A police officer said on condition of anonymity that they had no provision to make arrests for the possession of demonetised currencies.
 
 "We have received information about seizure of 1 crore in demonetised currencies. Once we are are formally informed, we will probe into the source," a senior income tax department official said.
