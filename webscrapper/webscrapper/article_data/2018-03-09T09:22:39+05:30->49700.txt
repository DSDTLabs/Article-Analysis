THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Citing lack of labour laws to ensure various rights of employees in the  , chief minister   said the government would make a strong intervention to formulate or adopt globally-accepted laws.

 
 On a submission by   in the assembly on Thursday, the CM said the employees in the IT sector were under constant threat of termination and that they were being denied deserving allowances enjoyed by workers in other sectors. “The women employees are being denied even maternity leave,” he said.
 
 Though the institutions in the IT sector come under the purview of Kerala shops and commercial establishment rules, they have been exempted from certain clauses to function under shift system and ‘flexi time’ system.
 
 However, adequate labour laws suitable for a fast developing job sector will have to be formulated for the IT sector, besides considering its highly competitive nature, the CM said. “We will also have to facilitate favourable atmosphere for the companies to function here and prevent them from moving out of the state. So, we will have to formulate labour laws with the help of agencies like ILO ( ) which will have global acceptance,” he said.
 
 In the  , Vijayan said, the agreements with the companies demand strict compliance with legal restrictions and salary/remuneration clauses. In case of violations, the government will initiate stringent measures, he said.
 
 The CM also said that the government would examine the possibility of ensuring representation by employees in the consultative committee formed to look into the complaints from employees in the sector.
