AGRA: To “familiarize” cops with their seniors, the Uttar Pradesh Government   (GRP) has begun installing photo frames of the DGP, ADG railways and IG railways at police stations across the state.
 
  Officials said that GRP will install frames with pictures of DGP Om Prakash Singh, ADG Bijay Kumar Maurya and IG   at all 65 stations in the state. So far, 48 GRP stations have been covered.
  
  In Agra division, these photo frames have been installed at   police station,   station, Mathura junction, Tundla junction, Etawah, Aligarh junction, among others.
  
  Speaking to TOI, Agra senior superintendent of police (GRP),   said, “Command and control are of great significance in forces like police and army. The juniors must know who their seniors are as only then they will adhere to the directions issued by the latter. There are times when junior officers are not aware about their top bosses and exhibit some form of indiscipline. By putting up these frames, we will make sure that such incidents do not take place.”
  
  “Putting up photos of seniors is not a new practice. At police offices in the state capital, scores of photo frames of seniors have been installed to motivate junior officials. However, in GRP, this will be the first time when such an initiative has been taken,” added Tiwari.
  
  When asked about the cost involved in the exercise, the   said, “Since one frame comes for Rs 150, the installation part won’t cost us much.” However, some other officials claimed that the cost of each frame is a lot higher. “In my 15-year-old career, I have not come across a police station where photos of seniors are put up. Photo frames of only Mahatma Gandhi, B R Ambedkar or the incumbent chief minister are generally installed. Also, every time a senior retires or gets transferred, his picture will have to be replaced,” said an official who did not wish to be named.
