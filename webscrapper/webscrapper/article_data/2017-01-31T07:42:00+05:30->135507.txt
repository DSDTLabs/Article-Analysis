NEW DELHI: A gang of   including a juvenile, employed on a “contract” by the gang were held from south Delhi after they were found to be involved in more than 15 cases of   crashes over the past few months.

 Police have recovered a stolen foreign-made pistol and some stolen cars that they had   as a getaway vehicle after each heist. The gang belonged to a village in Madhya Pradesh and would flee across states with the booty to avoid detection.
 
 Gokul Prasad, Sawant Sisodiya, Lakhan Sisodiya, Abhishek Sisodiya and Vikash Sisodiya were caught with a stolen Santro car near Vasant Kunj on Sunday night. “They admitted to the crimes during interrogation and directed the cops to the juvenile as well. He has been sent to a juvenile home for counselling,” said DCP (south) Ishwar Singh.
 
 The accused claimed that they used to drive to Delhi from Madhya Pradesh and target wedding program in Chhatarpur and Vasant Kunj. They said that Prasad had taken the juvenile on “contractual bondage” from his mother to execute the crimes while they did the planning. “They had hired the juvenile for Rs 2 lakhs per night and had even created an ‘iqrarnama’ (contract) for this,” said a senior police officer.
 
 Police might book the accused under sections of Bonded Labour Act for their crimes. Prasad disclosed that he had kept some staffers of popular banquet halls and farm houses on his pay roll and they used to pass on information to him about the event schedules and the profiles of the hosts and the guests who were to attend the ceremony at the venues.
 
 The accused would dress up the juvenile and help him gate crash the party. The juvenile was tasked to fix his focus on the bag containing the cash and jewellery and would usually park himself beside the bride and even offer to help her keep the gifts during which he would place them in a bag. After a while, he would walk out with the valuables and meet his associates waiting outside.
