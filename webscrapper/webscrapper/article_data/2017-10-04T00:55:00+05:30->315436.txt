Trichy: Trichy Corporation has finally paid heed to the demands of residents and sanctioned a sum of Rs 11.65 crores to refurbish and relay as many as 38 road work projects in the city. 

 This will be music to the ears of residents as already the arterial roads of the city are in bad shape as it braces for the year-end rains. 
 
 However, a few sections of the most damaged roads in the city were given a miss.
 
 Corporation sources said that roads that are ravaged in recent rains and also new works to relay on the existing roads would be taken up ahead of monsoons in a phased manner. Of the total 38 works sanctioned by the civic body, about 40 per cent of the 65 wards in the corporation limits are expected to be covered. 
 
 Cantonment locality particularly the ward numbers 44, 45, and 46 have received a lionâ€™s share of the road works (both refurbishment and relaying) that includes vicinity like Raja Colony, Lawsons Road, Reynolds Road, Collectorate Road, Bharathidasan Road (AIR office to Head Post Office stretch and also MGR Roundabout to AIR office), Williams Road, and Rockins Road. Road paver finisher machinery is to be used in the road construction works.
 
 Though the Anna Nagar link road along Uyyakondan Canal is riddled with numerous pot holes, it seems the crucial road of the city has not surfaced in the list of road works to be taken up by the civic body. 
 
 But the extension of the same road in front of Ukkirakaali Amman near temple Anna Nagar would be refurbished, corporation sources said. 
 
 Similarly, one of the most damaged roads near Central bus stand, VOC road stretch dotting hotels and gated communities witnessing huge volume of buses plying has not found its name in the Rs 11.65 crores project. 
 
 All the road works are likely to be completed before the onset of northeast monsoon.
