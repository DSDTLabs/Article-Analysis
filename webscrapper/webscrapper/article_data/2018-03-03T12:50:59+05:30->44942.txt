VIJAYAWADA: With the ruling Telugu Desam going all-out crying foul over the ‘injustice’ meted out to the state, state BJP president and   MP K Hari Babu on Friday upped the ante by asserting that no government at the Centre, in post-independent era, had supported   like the   government had done to bail out the new state. 

 He said his party will also seek the special category status for Andhra Pradesh. 
 
 Speaking at a meeting of the Krishna district unit here, he said: “The Modi government has done everything for the state and will do more as promised in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act.”
 
 He said that development of AP is possible only with both the TDP and BJP joining hands and working together. Hari Babu lambasted the   for raking up the SCS issue.
 
  “Accusing our party of not doing anything for the state are mere lies perpetuated by the Congress. We will also seek SCS for Andhra Pradesh,” he asserted.
 
 The MP said that there is no truth in reports that special status was being given to selective states.
