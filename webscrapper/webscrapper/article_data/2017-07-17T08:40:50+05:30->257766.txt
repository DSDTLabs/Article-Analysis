JAIPUR: Information commissioner, Rajasthan, has slapped a penalty of Rs 25,000 on an   at the   in Udaipur, for deliberately denying and delaying information to the applicant since 2014.

 The applicant has been consistently seeking information on five points but is yet to receive it, the order says.
 
 Taking strong action on the attitude of the   officer towards the applicant, the information commissioner has imposed a penalty of Rs 25,000 on him. 
 
  Three years after the plea was filed, the RTI officer on April 7, 2017 sought documents from the information commissioner regarding the case. On May 15, 2017, the information commissioner served a show cause notice to RTI officer A L Sheikh. 
 
 The notice asks why a penalty should not be imposed on him for not issuing the information under RTI Section 20 (1). “The respondent was asked to be present before the information commissioner office on June 29. However, despite repeated notices, the respondent has failed to appear before the information commissioner office,” said Avinash Sharma, information commissioner.
