BATHINDA: Justice   (retd), who is inquiring into the cases of sacrilege in Punjab, visited the town on Tuesday. He revealed that in many cases of desecration, the police investigated the incidents thoroughly. Justice Singh said the commission had directed the police to further investigate such incidents.

 He claimed that the commission had almost completed the investigations into the acts of sacrilege and the report would be submitted to the state government within two months. He also claimed that the commission would also suggest remedial measures to stop re-occurrence of such acts of desecration. 
 
 Torn pages from a ‘bir’ of Guru Granth Sahib were found scattered near a gurdwara at Bargari village of Faridkot district on June 1, 2015. After that incident acts of sacrilege were reported at many places across Punjab. Two persons were killed in police firing at Behbal Kalan in Faridkot district on October 14, 2015, while protesting acts of desecration.
 
 Addressing mediapersons in   on Tuesday, Justice Singh said the state government had referred 122 cases to the commission that occurred in the previous SAD-BJP regime and 15 cases were reported during the current Congress government. “We found more than 122 cases. Prima facie, in many of these the police investigations were not thorough as some angles of investigations were missing. We asked the police to further investigate those cases,” he maintained.
 
 He said five cases were reported in Bathinda and three in   and commission would visit all eight places in two days during its penultimate visit in the field. When asked about three years into the Bargari sacrilege, he said they had almost completed the probe of that case and would submit report soon. On a query about open defiance by SAD president Sukhbir Badal to the commission directions to appear before it, Justice Singh said the commission had the powers to summon anyone and would look at the options in case someone disobeyed its orders.
