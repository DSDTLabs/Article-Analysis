NAINITAL: In a horrific tale of sexual abuse within a family, a 15-year-old girl from   near Nainital, who was allegedly raped by her uncle, gave birth to a child. The teenaged survivor did not reveal the crime till her pregnancy was in the sixth month. The baby was born almost a week ago.
 
  The matter came to light after a dispute arose among the girl’s relatives about adopting the baby. Ultimately, the district administration and the police had to intervene, after which the baby was handed over to the maternal grandparents of the survivor.
  
   , city magistrate of Haldwani, said, “The matter is being dealt with utmost sensitivity. For now, the infant is in the custody of the girl’s grandparents. The culprit will not be spared.”
  
  The girl, a resident of   block in Nainital district, was raped by her uncle towards the end of 2016. She did not mention the crime to anyone. After six months, when her health was affected and she was visibly pregnant, the family realized the truth.
  
  The 15-year-old, after being questioned by her family, broke down and narrated the assault by the uncle, who is a second cousin of her father. “The family then chose to be silent about the crime and not reveal it to anyone, except a few relatives who were regular visitors to the house,” said a source.
  
  The survivor was eventually admitted to a government hospital in Haldwani and gave birth to a baby boy. The family of the victim decided to give up the child for adoption. The question of custody of the newborn became a bone of contention between the relatives, after which the news spread rapidly, and the administration had to intervene to contain the matter.
  
  A relative of the victim said, “Such crime should not go unpunished. If girls are not safe with their own family, then where will they ever feel safe? All we want is justice and punishment for the man responsible.”
