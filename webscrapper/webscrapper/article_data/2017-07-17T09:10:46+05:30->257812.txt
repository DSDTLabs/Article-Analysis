PATIALA: Deputy commissioner   along with senior officials of the state wildlife advisory board on Sunday visited   forest and ordered increased vigil following the incident of a wild animal killing two dogs and three calves over the last fortnight.

 The wildlife officials also called in three dart guns while the deputy commissioner asked the police to constitute two special teams to carry out night patrol in the area. Two traps have already been set up, but the wild animal, believed to be a leopard, is yet to be caught.
 
 According to Hardit Singh  , a senior member of the state wildlife advisory board, from the evidence collected so far it appears that it is a female leopard with a cub. The big cat is said to be targeting small animals of the area which has caused panic amongst the locals.
 
 Amit said wildlife officials and police have been asked to ensure that in case a leopard was roaming around the area it should be caught as soon as possible.
 
 Meanwhile, the wildlife officials got a dart gun from   zoo. Sidhu said the wildlife officials will try and tranquillize the animal. He said the fact that the wild cat was here along with her cub was a serious matter.
