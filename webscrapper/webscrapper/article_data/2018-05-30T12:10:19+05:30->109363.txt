JAIPUR: Upset with daily spats within her family, a 16-year-old girl ended her life by jumping off from the fourth floor of a private university building situated at   under police station area in the city. The deceased girl was youngest in a family with seven sisters and was a student of Class X. The university building is almost 1 km away from her home girl used to live. 

 
 The incident took place on Tuesday morning when the girl identified as   walked out of her house and reached at the terrace of the private institute. “She jumped off and sustained grave head injuries. She was rushed to the hospital where she was declared brought dead,” said an officer with the   police station. 
 
 Police said that no suicide note was recovered from her house and her shocked parents too have not said anything on why the girl took an extreme step. “After a while we will speak to her parents to find out the reason why she took this step,” said an officer. 
 
 However, police will enquire under what circumstances the girl reached at the terrace of the university premises which usually remains locked. 
 
 “We are studying the   footages to find how she managed to reach at the fourth floor of the university. In the primary investigation it was found that in the morning some person comes to check the water storage in the tank which is at the terrace and during this time it gets opened. There could be a possibility that when the girl came the terrace was opened. We will also enquire about it to the university administration,” said a senior police officer. 
 
 Neha is third youngest sister in a family of seven sisters and her father is ailing for a long time. “ The girl has either entered from the main gate of the university or had climbed a wall having a height of 6 feet. CCTV footage will only clarify how she entered into the premises,” said an officer.
