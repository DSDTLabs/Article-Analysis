MUMBAI: It was an embarrassment for chief minister Devendra   after he had to shunt out Panvel municipal commissioner Sudhakar  . It is believed that Fadnavis succumbed to mounting pressure from  , an erstwhile Congress leader who is now a BJP legislator.

 Shinde, the brother of water conservation minister  , who was posted as Panvel’s first civic chief, was at loggerheads with Thakur. But he failed to realise Thakur’s clout. In the Panvel belt, BJP became a respectable force only after Thakur, along with his father  , a former Lok Sabha MP, joined the party.
 
 When Thakur began to move a no-confidence motion against Shinde, a message was conveyed to him that any such move will be embarrassing for the BJP leadership, particularly the CM, and that the proposal should be abandoned in the party’s larger interest. Nevertheless Panvel BJP leaders moved the noconfidence motion and it was passed with a huge majority.
 
 It was alleged that Shinde was an arrogant officer and developmental works in the Panvel civic corporation had come to a halt. Under the rules, the no-confidence motion was submitted to the urban development department led by the CM for approval. In a three-page explanation, the government rejected the proposal saying Shinde’s services were required for Panvel’s development. But for Shinde, it was a short-lived joy—in less than 24 hours he was shunted to an “insignificant” post as the head of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Public Health Scheme.
 
 Shinde’s unceremonious exit is being viewed as a major victory for Prashant Thakur. A BJP minister said Prashant Thakur is more important than Shinde, particularly in view of the ensuing elections to Lok Sabha and state assembly.
