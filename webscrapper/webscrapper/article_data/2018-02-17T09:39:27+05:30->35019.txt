LUCKNOW: In a move that has virtually ended the possibility of any anti-BJP alliance in the UP bypolls,   announced its candidates for both Gorakhpur and Phulpur seats going to the polls on March 11. UPCC president   announced the candidates late on Friday night on Twitter. 

 Manish Mishra, a member of the UP Congress Committee and general secretary of the state unit, will contest from Phulpur. Mishra is the son of former IAS officer  , who quit the services to work with Indira Gandhi.
 
 The party's candidate from Gorakhpur is Surhita Chatterjee Kareem, a doctor who has been associated with Congress for the past 30 years. Congress district general secretary Anwar Hussain said that Dr Kareem was a renowned gynaecologist and social worker who is also the spokesperson of UP Congress Committee and has contested mayoral elections in 2012. She stood second in the election.
 
 The announcement caught several UPCC worker by surprise, as this election is the testing point for the party before the 2019 Lok   election. The seats were vacated by CM Aditya Nath Yogi and deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya in 2017.
 
 The announcement comes even as SP is yet to declare its candidate and BSP has refused to contest the bypolls. February 20 is the last date for filing nominations. While SP and Congress had formed an alliance to contest the 2017 UP polls, a few days ago Krishna Patel faction of Apna Dal had announced that it was in talks with Congress for a grand alliance against   in the bypolls. Now, with Congress going ahead with its list of candidates, that possibility has ended.
