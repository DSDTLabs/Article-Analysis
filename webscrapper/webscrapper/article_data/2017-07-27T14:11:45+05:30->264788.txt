MOHALI: A practising advocate at the district courts carried out the Rs 7.67 lakh robbery at State Bank of India in Phase VII to pay his debts, police said on Wednesday after arresting the 30-year-old man, claiming to have cracked the case within 12 hours.

 A broken registration number plate of the vehicle used in the crime and a carjacking call to a police control room (PCR) landed Manjinder Singh in police net. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Kuldeep Singh Chahal said, “Manjinder met with an accident just 30 metres away from the bank after committing the robbery at gunpoint on Tuesday afternoon. The registration plate of his vehicle fell down. A few minutes later, he called up the PCR saying that his Volkswagen Jetta car bearing registration number PB-23-H-0196 has been snatched.” The police found the car abandoned behind North Country Mall. “The vehicle was the same that was used in the robbery. The registration and insurance documents were in the car. Connecting the dots, we caught the accused from his house,” the SSP said. Manjinder, who got married eight months back, was residing in Sunny Enclave, Kharar. He hails from a village near Zira in  . He had graduated in LLB from Panjab University in 2013.
 
 Police also claimed to have recovered the looted money.
 
 Manjinder had single-handedly executed the robbery within minutes. The heist was caught on CCTV cameras. However, the cameras outside the bank were not working, police said.
 
 A local court sent the accused in police custody for two days. Chahal said the accused confessed to have committed the crime to pay his debts. “We will now ascertain the debts he owed,” the SSP said.
