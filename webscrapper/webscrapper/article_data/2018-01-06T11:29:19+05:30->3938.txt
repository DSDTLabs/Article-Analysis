RAJKOT: An SRP constable’s Insas rifle robbed on Thursday night was found dumped near Aji Dam chowkdi on Friday. Police arrested a minor boy who had committed the crime and his three accomplices who were involved in other robberies. 

 “The incident occurred when constable   (37) of SRP Group 8, Gondal, was walking towards his camp on Thursday night. Two bike borne miscreants arrived from behind and sped away after snatching his rifle,” Aji Dam police station inspector P N Vaghela said. 
 
 The rifle was found near Mansarovar Park by some passers-by.
 
 The cops launched an investigation and soon traced the accused, a minor boy from Jangaleshwar area of Rajkot, who had stolen the rifle along with his accomplice, whose identity is yet to be ascertained and he is yet to be arrested. Along with the boy, police also arrested two accused — Hussein Bukhari (21), a resident of Jangaleshwar, and Rohit Katira (21) alias Kaliyo, a resident of Bhavaninagar area of Rajkot — who had participated in other two robberies along with the minor. 
 
 “During his interrogation, the minor confessed to his involvement in two robberies reported two days ago. In the first loot, he had robbed a trader at a knife’s point of a jacket he was selling on the footpath, while in the second robbery he had robbed a shopkeeper of a cellphone,” Vaghela said.
