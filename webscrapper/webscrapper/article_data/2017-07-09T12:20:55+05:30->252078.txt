Arjun Kapoor’s next film is the comic caper ‘Mubarakan’ and the promotions are in full swing. Of course, the cast of the film also knows how to have fun now and then, as this post will prove.

  
  
 Taking to Instagram,   posted a small Boomerang video of him kneeling down on his knees as his co-star Ileana D’Cruz twirls in a stunning white dress. The video looks comical enough but Arjun’s caption makes it a lot funnier. The star of the movie captioned the post as, “@ileana_official is literally providing me #HawaHawa #Mubarakan”, referring to a popular song from ‘Mubarakan’. That’s one way to promote a song for sure!
