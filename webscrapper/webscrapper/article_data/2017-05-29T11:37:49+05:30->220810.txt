HYDERABAD: The Central Board of Secondary Education’s ( ) decision to scrap the moderation policy seems to have impacted the evaluation process this year as fewer students secured above 90% marks, leaving several school managements in the city worried. 

 According to the figures released by the CBSE, a meagre 7.55% of the total number of students who cleared the class 12 exam secured 90% and above. Out of 8,37,229 who appeared for the examination across the country, only 63,247 secured above 90% and 10,091 secured above 95%. 
 
 Last year, close to 90,000 candidates scored 90% and above and more than 14,000 students scored above 95%. 
 
 The results this year were delayed as the CBSE proposed to scrap the moderation policy on April 25. Under the policy, students are awarded up to 15% extra marks in certain papers if the questions are deemed to be difficult. 
 
 “I was surprised to know that there are fewer students who secured 90% and above this year. The evaluation process was definitely affected due to CBSE’s decision to scrap the moderation policy. Several students complained of securing lower marks in the science stream,” said Seetha Murthy, principal of  , which registered 100% pass.
  
  
 Similar sentiments were shared by other schools. “We are unaware of what exactly happened at the evaluation stage as the number of students securing 90% and above was much higher last year,” said Aparna, principal of  . 
 
 According to principals, economics and mathematics have a high percentage of failure as compared to Hindi core and Physical Education, which have the lowest in the country.
 
 Statistics shared by the CBSE reveals that cases of malpractices in the examination also observed a 106% jump this year. A total of 119 cases were registered across the country this year as against 56 cases last year. 
 
 The CBSE will now conduct counselling for students from May 28 to June 11 from 8pm to 10pm. Students can call up the toll free number 1800 11 8004 and get in touch with operators for general queries related to results. They can also avail of the telephonic counselling facility.
