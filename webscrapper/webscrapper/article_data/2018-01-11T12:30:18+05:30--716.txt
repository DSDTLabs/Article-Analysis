CHENNAI: He may be a debutant MLA and an independent to boot, but that has not stopped   finding a special slot near Gate 4 on the assembly premises to park his SUV. He also gets police personnel to watch over it. 

 The area where   parks his car is where all MLAs, including DMK working president and leader of the opposition M K   alight from their vehicles, and walk into the secretariat complex and assembly hall. All the vehicles stop for a few minutes or a few seconds and immediately leave the area. They are then permitted to park elsewhere on the secretariat premises. Security personnel ensure that other vehicles come nowhere near the area. 
 
 Dhinakaran comes to the assembly around 11.15am and walks out in a huff when he is disallowed from speaking. His vehicle remains at the same place until he walks out of the assembly and addresses the media. 
 
 “When former chief minister   was there, we never allowed anyone to park the vehicle in the area. But after her death, there is no such protocol. Ministers and Stalin’s vehicles leave immediately after dropping them,” said a senior police officer who serves in the secretariat. “In the morning we don’t allow anyone to park their vehicle there. Since Dhinakaran comes late, and all MLAs are inside the assembly hall, there is space and his driver parks the vehicle in the slot,” he said.
