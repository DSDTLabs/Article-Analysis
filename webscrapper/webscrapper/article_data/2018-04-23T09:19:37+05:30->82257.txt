NEW DELHI: A 55-year-old man was stabbed to death by his son-in-law at his house in east Delhi’s Pandav Nagar on Sunday evening. He allegedly conspired to kill him to teach his wife a lesson as she had left him and had gone to stay with her father.

 Police said that the matter was reported around 4pm when they got a call from the victim’s son, who was the first to spot his father, Prabhu Dayal, lying in a pool of blood. Soon after this, a police team reached the spot and the man was taken to   where he was declared brought dead.
 
 DCP (east) Pankaj Singh said that the accused, Neeraj, managed to flee before anyone could spot him. “We have formed teams to look for him,” he said.
 
 Police said that Neeraj got married to Dayal’s daughter in December 2016. “They had a love marriage and barely a few weeks after it, the couple started having heated arguments. They involved parents in the fights but days after their issues were resolved, they would again start fighting,” said a police officer.
 
 The matter worsened to a level where Neeraj’s wife left him and went to live with her father, Dayal. Police said that since then, he had been asking her to come back home, but she refused. Neeraj had constantly been trying and despite repeated attempts, when nothing worked out, he conspired to kill her father to teach her a lesson.
 
 Prima facie it appears he entered the house on the pretext of sorting things out, but when things worsened, he stabbed him in the chest and fled.
 
 Dayal’s son told the cops that he called out to his father several times, but when he didn’t get any response, he went to check on him and noticed him lying in a pool of blood. He then raised an alarm and alerted everyone. There was no one at home apart from both of them when the incident happened.
 
 Police said they have registered a case and are looking for the accused. They said they are raiding all his possible hideouts. The robbery angle has been ruled out, cops said.
