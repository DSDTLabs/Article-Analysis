BENGALURU: Fed up of streetlights not working and the   in your locality? Running from pillar to post to to get sanctions for your building plan or your  ? Fret not. Help is now at your fingertip. All you need to do is click a picture of the   and the garbage dump and post it on Janahita, a mobile application launched by the Karnataka government. Developed by   (KMDC), the   is exclusively mean to redress grievances and offer services related to civic issues. Citizens can also apply for building plans or birth/death certificates through the app, and the services will be delivered within a fixed time.

 “This app will change the way the 264 urban civic bodies, including BBMP, function in Karnataka as it promises to address public grievances quickly and with conviction,” said  , minister of state for municipal administration. It’s expected to become more vibrant and effective in the coming days as former UIDAI chairman Nandan Nilekani has agreed to share software developed by eGovernments Foundation free of cost, he added. 
 
 Anyone can download the app and file complaints. Once a picture is posted on the app, it’s automatically forwarded to the municipal authority concerned. All urban local bodies, including ten major corporations of the state, have been mapped on this app which can locate the exact area specified by the complainant using the geo-location of the pictures.
 
 To ensure there’s no laxity on the part of the authorities concerned, senior civic officials can also directly monitor the complaints and see whether officials have solved the issues within the specified time, said an urban development (UD) official. In case of a lapse in delivery, the issue will be forwarded to the head of the department and higher authorities’ dashboard automatically. Those monitoring the dashboard can then recommend disciplinary action against the erring staff.
 
 Khandre said that they have fixed time frames for redressing different categories of complaints received through the app. For example, common civic complaints like non-functional streetlights, overflowing bins, broken footpaths have to be addressed within a day of the complaint being lodged. Similarly, a building plan will have to be issued within a fortnight and birth, and death certificates within 3-7 working days.
