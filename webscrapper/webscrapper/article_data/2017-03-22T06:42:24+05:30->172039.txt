MUMBAI: From April, you will get   (RC) for   or   purchased in Maharashtra instead of the paper documents. 

 “Earlier too paper RCs were replaced with smartcards, but the scheme was discontinued in December 2014,” said an official. “It is good that we are switching back to optical smartcards as it enables a smooth online process. It is easier and faster to update data on the card whenever there is a transfer of vehicle/owner or change of address.” 
 
 The system will be operated through the newly upgraded software of Vahan at RTOs across the state, including the Tardeo, Wadala, Andheri and Borivali RTOs in Mumbai. 
 
 According to an official from  , the tender process for awarding contracts to smartcard providers was completed recently and the cards will be distributed from April.
 
 Ronjana Mukherjee, who had bought a new car last year, said, “I am glad the   is replacing paper certificates with smartcards.” She hopes the RTO will allow those with paper certificates to apply for conversion to smartcards. Officials said this decision could be taken once the new system of smartcards is implemented from next month.
 
 The smartcard RCs, said an assistant RTO, will come at a price—around Rs 300, besides the cost for sending the card by courier, unlike the paper RCs. The card has a RFID chip which stores all data pertaining to the vehicle such as owner’s name and address, its chassis number, model, make and registration details. Once implemented, said sources, city RTOs will print nearly two lakh smartcards annually for new vehicle registrations.
