LUCKNOW:   will be   copies of the annual examination to be held on March 1. 

 Moreover, this year when the   swoops on its  , it would come equipped with a camera. The decision has been taken because there have been incidents of mass copying in the past but no action could be taken for want of evidence.
 
 Despite being caught by the squad, centres would deny cheating took place. Some institutions would also allege that the flying squad intentionally maligned them due to some personal interest.
 
 "At times, cheating material, mass copying and writing on tables at the examination centre are reported but during the investigation, due to lack of evidence, a centre could not be barred. That's when the recording would come handy," said LU vice-chancellor SP Singh. 
 
 The flying squad will not only record examinations to be held in 39 centres but also the seating plan, admit cards and students' identity cards during the inspection. He said that any unfair means reported at the colleges made examination centre, will have 10% UG seats deducted as punishment.
