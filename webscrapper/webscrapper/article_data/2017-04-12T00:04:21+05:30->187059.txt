MUMBAI: The BMC, which is the country’s richest civic body with a budget of around Rs 25,000 crore, took 19 days on average last year to resolve a complaint, revealed a study released by the NGO Praja on Tuesday. In 2015, civic officials needed a fortnight to redress grievances. 

 Despite the considerable resources at its disposal, the civic body seems to be cutting a sorry figure with the number of civic complaints rising by 32% from 2015 to 2016. The NGO’s study found that out of the total 81,555 complaints received in 2016, action was not taken in 42% cases. 
 
 Another finding was that in L ward (Kurla, Sakinaka), which saw the highest number of civic complaints (7,498), action was taken in 53% cases and only 29% plaints were convincingly resolved. Meanwhile plans are afoot, to carve out a new ward out of the existing L ward in an attempt to provide better civic services. 
 
 Populous areas in the western suburbs were also at the receiving end of civic apathy. In 2016, K West (Andheri, Oshiwara, Versova) and K East (Jogeshwari) wards witnessed 6,374 and 5,901 complaints. While roads get a lion’s share of civic funds, Mumbaikars are unhappy with the city’s motorways. In 2016, as many as 13,475 complaints were received in connection with Mumbai’s roads. Citizens have also a gripe with crumbling drainage networks and deteriorating management of solid waste and water supply. However, there has been a gradual decrease in the total number of complaints registered in connection with pockmarked roads; from 27% in 2014, the grievances fell to 20% in 2015 and 17% last year. Nitai Mehta, founder and managing trustee of NGO Praja Foundation, pointed that there is no effective tool for Mumbaikars to complain about the condition of roads that has led to a drop in the number of complaints. 
 
 “When the ‘voice of citizen’ app was active, there was a rise in complaints. However, after the app was discontined in November 2015, the number of complaints dropped,” said Mehta. 
 
 Activists said things on ground were much worse than what has the report had indicated. Nikhil Desai, an activist from King’s Circle, said, “Two of my complaints are pending with the BMC since last six months.”
