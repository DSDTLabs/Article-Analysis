PUNE: Contrary to admission by   ( ) authorities that very few buses have fire extinguishers as they are stolen when buses are parked on road at night, Pune   (RTO) said that all buses that come for fitness tests have fire extinguishers.

 Speaking to TOI on Tuesday, Pune regional transport officer B I Ajri said, “On an average, 5 to 6 PMPML buses come to the RTO every day for annual fitness certificates. It is mandated by the RTO that public transport buses, including that of PMPML, should have fire extinguishers or else they will not be given the certificate. The fitness certificate is given following inspection of fire extinguishers and other things on buses.”
 
 A few days ago, PMPML authorities said that fire extinguishers had allegedly been stolen from buses by unidentified people. On Monday, when PMPML chairperson and managing director Nayana Gunde was asked about the number of fire extinguishers on PMPML buses, she said that she will have to check.
 
 Earlier in response to a RTI query filed by a transport activist, the transport body said it has not conducted any fire safety audit or bought fire extinguishers in 2017-18. Some months ago, PMPML public relations officer   told TOI that the transport body has a little over 400 fire extinguishers.
 
 On Tuesday, a senior PMPML official admitted that in many cases, fire extinguishers are either kept at depot or garages to be used at the ‘right time’.
 
 “There are fire extinguishers but they are not kept inside buses in most cases. They are kept either at the depot or garages and during the time of inspection by RTO, the equipment is mounted on buses. We are taking these issues very seriously. Such things shouldn’t happen and senior officials have decided to set things in order,” the official told TOI.
 
 When contacted, PMPML public relations officer could not state the number of fire extinguishers on buses and at depots.
