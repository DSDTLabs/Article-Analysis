PANAJI/MUMBAI: Prime Minister  , who was in Mumbai for official functions on Sunday, made an unscheduled visit to   to meet former defence minister and Goa chief minister Manohar   who is undergoing treatment for pancreatitis. 

 Sources said Modi was accompanied by Union minister Nitin Gadkari, Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis and governor C Vidyasagar Rao. “Modi spent almost 10 minutes alone with Parrikar and enquired about his health. He also wished him a speedy recovery,” sources said.
 
 Hospital sources said Modi reached the hospital around 8.45pm to meet his former cabinet colleague Parrikar and took an update about his health from the doctors. There were several speculations about Parrikar’s health throughout Sunday, including the fact that he was moved to an ICU, which the hospital didn’t confirm.
 
 In a statement issued late in the evening, Ajaykumar Pande, vice president of the hospital, said, “It has been brought to our notice, various malicious and misleading reports/ rumours are floating with regards to the health of Goa chief minister. We categorically deny all such rumours. We reiterate that honourable chief minister of Goa is being treated and is responding well to the treatment.”
 
 Earlier in the day, South Goa MP and BJP spokesperson Narendra Sawaikar said “on the advice of his doctors”, Parrikar will continue with the treatment for pancreatitis in Mumbai. “CM’s treatment is in the right direction and he is responding to the same. However, he needs sufficient time to recover and be focused on the treatment. Expert doctors are taking good care of him. We all pray for his speedy recovery,” he said in a statement here.
 
 Parrikar, who had complained of a stomach pain on Wednesday, was referred by the Goa Medical College and Hospital doctors to Mumbai on Thursday. He is under the care of Dr P Jagannath, chairman, department of surgical oncology at the hospital.
