MUMBAI: The appointment of consultants to frame draft laws related to the home department has angered the opposition, which objected to the move alleging that it could violate secrecy.

 In his reply, chief minister   said that the   government has appointed three private legal consultants to draft bills related to the home department. 
 
    had objected to the move over the issue of breach of secrecy. “What is the reason behind appointing private consultants when the state government has a full-fledged law and judiciary department. Appointing private consultants to do this work could lead to loss of confidentiality,” said Rane.
 
 While replying to the query, Fadnavis clarified that the private firms will work under a department’s officials and law officer. “They (private consultants) won’t intervene the department’s routine work and function under the guidance of officials. They will start working only after getting clearance from the law department,” said Fadnavis. .
