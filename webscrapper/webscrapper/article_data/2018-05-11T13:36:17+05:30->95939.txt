NEW DELHI: The   on Thursday dismissed a petition seeking to ban   candidates from contesting   assembly elections, saying promising socio-economic uplift of a minority community is not akin to seeking votes in the name of religion, which is a corrupt electoral practice.

 A three-judge bench headed by CJI   dismissed the petition by   chief   as it disagreed with counsel Vishnu Shankar Jain’s argument that Congress’s election manifesto promising a plethora of schemes for the minority community was an enticement to woo Muslim voters in the name of religion.
 
 When Jain argued that there was a constitutional injunction against political parties seeking votes by promising benefits to a particular community in its election manifesto, the bench said, “A promise to remedy the socioeconomic backwardness in a community is not akin to appealing to them or seeking votes in the name of religion.”
 
 “Constitutional injunction and injuncting a candidate from contesting elections operate on different planes. The issues raised by the petitioner can be agitated before an appropriate forum after the elections. Needless to say, after the election is complete from all angles, if the petitioners feel aggrieved, they can take recourse to statutory remedy as provided under the Representation of the People Act, 1951,” it said.
