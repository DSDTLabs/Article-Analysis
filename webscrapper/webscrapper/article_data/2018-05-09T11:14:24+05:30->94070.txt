PANAJI: Goa University, which landed the 68th spot in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2018 declared last month, has released its ‘closer analysis’ of the drastic slip in its rank since the 20th position it earned at the first   in 2016. 

 Immediately after the NIRF 2018 was released,   had issued a statement saying that the varsity had “successfully maintained its presence in the top 75 universities in the country despite increased competition from new entrants to the ranking system”. 
 
 Now, GU’s ‘closer analysis’ states that the varsity has “in fact, improved its overall performance in total score from 37.16 (in 2017) to 40.66 (in 2018) by 3.5 points”. 
 
 “GU improved on parameters such as teaching, learning and resources, and research and professional practice, to which NIRF gives highest weightage (30 each),” the statement reads. “The categories under which GU dropped points are graduation outcomes, outreach and inclusivity, and perception.”
 
 The university said scores under ‘outreach and inclusivity’ had dropped because, being the only state university in Goa, it is mandated to keep very few seats for students from outside the state. On the other hand, national and private institutions score higher in their regional diversity as they can take in students from across the nation.
 
 About losing out on the parameter of perception, GU has stated that in 2018, all the marks for perception came from employers and research investors only, as against the previous years of NIRF, when the perception of academic peers and the public was also taken into account.
 
 GU has further stated that among state varsities, it is among the top 25 universities in the country (at 24). “If one only takes the multi-faculty universities into consideration, GU is in the top 20 state universities nationally,” it has said.
