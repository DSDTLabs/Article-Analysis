NEW DELHI: US-based  , the world's second largest hotel group, is betting big on India. It plans to have 100 hotels here in next five-to-seven years that will include opening a couple of its legendary  , while the majority will be mid-market brands.

 Hilton president and CEO Christopher J Nassetta, who was in Delhi on Tuesday, told TOI: "When I took over about a decade back, our presence in India was zero. We are at15 properties today with18 in the pipeline.We were late in coming to India but will now be investing tens of millions of dollars here to have 1,000 hotels in next two decades."
 
 The hospitality major's lo gic is simple: India has the fastest growing middle class and economy in the world. America, with its 320 million population, has 3,600 hotels. "The ease of doing business here is getting better under the present leadership. We need to pick up speed here. India with 1.3 billion and a booming middle class needs much more. The demand, both globally and in India, will be for the mid-market segment," Nassetta said.
 
 The CEO's fiveto seven-year blueprint for India has three to four top-of-the-line Waldorf Astorias and five to 10 Conrads in India, while the rest will be mainly mid-market properties like Garden Inn and Hampton. At present, Hilton has five of its brands in India — Conrad, Hilton,  ,   and Hampton — in 11 cities, including Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. Pune got a   last year. Hilton used to be the world's largest hotel group till 2015-end when Marriott International acquired Starwoods Hotels. Hilton today has 1.1million rooms operational and in the pipeline, while MarriottStarwood has 1.1 million rooms ready and in service.
 
 “It's really important for us to succeed here. India has a very large middle class that we need to serve. A lot of our patrons come to India for business and leisure. We need to serve them here. India is a huge outbound market and we want that when they travel out, they should think Hilton,“ Nassetta said.
