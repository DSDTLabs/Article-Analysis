BHANGAR: Come what may, the Power Grid project will be set up in Bhangar,   leader   said on Sunday. The agitators can talk to the administration if they want, but nobody can stall the project, he said. 

 "Don't get incited by outsiders. People of Bhangar need electricity. We can switch off power supply to some villages to make them understand how life is without electricity," the minister added.
 
 Sunday saw the united face of the strife-torn Trinamool in Bhangar after party chief   categorically said she would not tolerate any infighting. On Sunday, all three leaders of three major Trinamool factions in   - Abdur Rezzak Molla, Arabul Islam and Kaizar Ahmed - took part in the meeting and tried hard to convince the locals why Power Grid is necessary for the overall development of Bhangar.
 
 "You can have a dialogue with us. But don't ever think that the Power Grid project will be revoked," said Molla. Arabul, too, echoed his views and said setting up the project is major challenge for them. "People are with us. People want power. Agitation by a handful of people cannot derail the project," he said.
 
 There was tension in the area after alleged Trinamool cadres attacked villagers a few days ago. A section of villagers have been opposing the power project.
