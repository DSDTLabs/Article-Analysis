CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and   high court has made it clear that it cannot issue any directions to allow a sportsperson to appear in the trial of a sport in the absence of any law around it.

 Justice   passed these orders while dismissing a petition filed by a minor boy from Rohtak, Mayank Rathee, through his grandfather  .
 
 The petition was filed for seeking directions to allow the petitioner to participate in the trials for under-14 or under 19 Indian football team.
 
 The counsel for the petitioner submitted that the the boy was being coached by his grandfather, a trained coach from NIS, Patiala. The petitioner said he is studying in Class 7, at a private school in Rohtak, and had participated in National Athletic Children Games on October 30, 2017, at Rajiv Gandhi Sports Complex, Rohtak, and acquired 5th rank. 
 
 The trials for qualifying in the football team, in his age group, had taken place, but he was not allowed to participate in it, hge pleaded.
 
 Hearing the contentions of the petitioner, Justice Jain observed said the counsel did not cite a law to swupport the petitioner’s contention. “Merely by saying that the petitioner is getting coaching from his grandfather, who happened to be a trained coach from the NIS, Patiala, would not be sufficient,” held the judge, while dismissing the petition on January 19.
