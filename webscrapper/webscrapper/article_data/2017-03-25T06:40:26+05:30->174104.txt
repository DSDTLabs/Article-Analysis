GANDHINAGAR:   Narendra Modi on Friday spoke in New Delhi to   and   members of Parliament (MPs) from Gujarat. He did not talk about the upcoming assembly elections in the state but asked the MPs to aggressively reach out to voters in their respective areas. Modi told the legislators to physically move among people and also reach out to them through social media.

  A senior BJP MP claimed that reports that they had talked about the elections with the PM were mere rumors.
 
 “Modi did not say anything related to Gujarat elections. The reason for this was that some MPs from Rajasthan, Goa, Diu, Daman & Dadra Nagar Haveli were also there,” the BJP MP said. “But he did ask the MPs to spend maximum time in their constituencies and address people’s problems proactively.”
 
 “He asked us to organize public functions to inform people about the central government’s schemes. MPs were to be bridge between the people and state and central governments,” an MP from Gujarat said.
 
 The Prime Minister also asked them to take part in political activities planned by local units of the BJP from April 6 (BJP’s foundation day) to April 14 (Dr Ambedkar’s birth anniversary)
 
 “Modi also expressed concern about MPs not using social media and technology to the maximum,” the MP said. “He asked all the MPs to have local social media plans through which they should be in touch with voters on their mobile phone. He asked them not depend too much on local media and reach out to voters through social media.” The Prime Minister asked MPs to use cellphone-based social media to stay in touch with residents of their respective areas.
