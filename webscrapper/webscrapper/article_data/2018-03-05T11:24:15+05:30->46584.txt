LUCKNOW: The news of   extending support to   evoked an aggressive reaction from   on Sunday.

 Speaking at a public meeting in Preetam Nagar in Allahabad,   ‘Nandi’ termed SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav as ‘Ravan of Kalyug’ and BSP chief Mayawati as Ravan’s sister Surpanakha. In stark contrast, Nandi called PM Narendra Modi as Lord Ram and chief minister Yogi Adityanath as Lord Hanuman.
 
 Nandi did not stop there and called SP leaders Shivpal Yadav as Kumbhkaran and Akhilesh Yadav as Meghnad.
 
 The UP minister also dragged in Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal saying he was Marich.
 
 At another public meeting in Allahabad, UP health minister Siddharthnath Singh claimed that the saffron party’s winning streak will continue. “We will not lose elections because EVM stands for ‘Every Vote for Modi,” Singh said.
 
 Meanwhile, state power minister Shrikant Sharma said people of UP will never endorse the deal between ‘bua’ (Mayawati) and ‘babua’ (Akhilesh Yadav). “The deal (BSP’s support to SP candidates) between the two is a result of their desperation. It’s sole aim is to manage Rajya Sabha and Vidhar Parishad seats on a giveand-take formula,” the minister said Former state   president Laxmikant Bajpai dubbed the political realignment as “alliance of the opportunists”. “Since childhood, I was told that once flood arrives, even archrivals like snake and mongoose come together on the same branch to save their lives,” Bajpai said.
 
 “Both the parties are rattled by the performance of BJP in the north-east and the voters in UP will read between the lines in their desperate move to temporarily come together,” he said.
