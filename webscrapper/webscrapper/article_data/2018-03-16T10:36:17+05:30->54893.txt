Karan suggests Preeta about asking for a lift. Preeta mocks that there is no car around and hears the sound of a car.  Kareena asks him to call Karan but the phone doesn't get connected since it is switched off. Preetaâ€™s phone is at home. Rakhi suggests him to call Prithvi but his number also is not reachable.  Sherlyn calls Prithvi and says he was waiting for Karan and Preeta to reach out to him and that he has checked his phone multiple times.  Prithvi shouts that he wants an apology from Karan at any cost. Sherlyn gets annoyed of his temper and disconnects the call. The driver stops the trolley with a jerk, faking it to have broken down and says that they might have to stay on the way, in rental rooms in a hotel building. Preeta gets afraid and looks behind for Karan.
