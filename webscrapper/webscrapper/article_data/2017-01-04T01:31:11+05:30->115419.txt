NEW DELHI: After spending a night at a slum, Delhi BJP chief   took to   to connect with people. In an hour-long live chat session, Tiwari slammed CM   for allegedly letting down Delhiites. He invited Kejriwal and his team for a public discussion on problems faced by people.

 Tiwari recently highlighted the problems faced by slum-dwellers in Inderpuri Gas Godown. Though the Delhi government sent a team to address the problems, AAP criticised him for playing politics. “I have gone to slums, Valmiki colonies and rural areas. Everyone is facing a lot of problems. I’m not here to run down Kejriwal….I invite him for a discussion with public on problems they are facing today,” Tiwari said.
 
 Hitting out at the CM, Tiwari said that AAP was unable to fulfil its promises. Referring to the government’s recent plan to slash DTC fare, which it couldn’t implement, Tiwari said, “Their style (of politics) is to give a lollipop to everyone...Don’t lure people by promising a fare cut...Look at the condition of public transport system. People are fed up. They (AAP) have not been able to do even 2% of the work they had promised.” 
 
 Tiwari said that the chief minister should answer why he was always at loggerheads with the Centre. “Atalji was the PM and Sheila Dikshit was the CM. Did you hear about any tussle? Kejriwal should explain why is he in constant tussle with the Centre.” 
 
 On demonetisation, Tiwari said that youths need to understand the importance of a cashless economy. “I don’t care if Kejriwal,   and Mayawati don’t understand it… But the youth of this country should under the importance of it. It will shape our future,” he said. He added that Kejriwal, the key person behind the India Against Corruption movement, was now “with corruption” because he was opposing demonetisation.
