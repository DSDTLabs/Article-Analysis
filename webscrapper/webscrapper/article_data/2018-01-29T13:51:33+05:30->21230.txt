BHOPAL: It would seem outlandish even in a Bollywood script but a gang of kidnappers hijacked a Dial 100 police vehicle, stripped the cops and went dressed in khaki to kidnap a girl from her home in a remote village in MP's Panna district in the wee hours of Sunday.

 No one knew about the sensational incident till noon, when a local reporter in   tehsil, about 60km from the district headquarters, broke the story. Panna SP Iqbal Riyaz confirmed to TOI that three cops, including an officer, were overpowered and tied up and the gang was in possession of a Dial 100 vehicle for about 45 minutes. A massive search operation is on to nab the culprits, he said.
 
 According to Riyaz, Dial 100 got an SOS around 11.30pm on Saturday. ASI Subhash Dube, head constable Prakash Mandal and driver Sharafat Khan responded to the call and went to Bamori village in Amanganj tehsil where they found a man lying facedown on the ground on the outskirts.
