THANE: A 47-year-old   that has been providing   to hundreds of families at   has turned highly toxic resulting in the death of over 18 large fish, which floated to the well’s surface on Sunday.   fear that the contamination could be a result of the seepage of waste sewage water from nearby drains. 

 The incident came to light when a group of women went to collect water to cook food but instead saw over a dozen dead fish floating over the blackish water. They immediate alerted other locals who guessed that there could be more dead fishes inside the 17ft height well.
 
 While this well, constructed in 1970, supplied drinking water to residents of Shastri Nagar and the neighbouring Savarkar Nagar during these times of water cuts, the extreme pollution level here has forced them to look for other options. 
 
 Harsh Morye, a resident, said, “Many children and women have had stomach upsets and other ailments. Looking at what the water has done to the fish, we think that this could be the cause of our illnesses.” 
 
 He added that it is only after the recent road construction works that the water has turned sludgy. 
 
 The ignorance of the civic body, despite numerous letter to them have left the residents frustrated. A civic official said, “There are many wells in   that have been tagged unusable because of pollution. This could be one of them. We will look into the matter.”
