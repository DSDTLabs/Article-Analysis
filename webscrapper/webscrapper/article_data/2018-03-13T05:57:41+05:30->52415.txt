NAWANSHAHR/JALANDHAR: Sand prices have shot up across   due to a squeeze in supply caused by the recent crackdown on illegal mining after chief minister Amarinder   tweeted photographs of mechanized sand mining in the   in   last week.
The sand prices have either doubled or sand for construction is not available as legal mining too has come to a halt due to strict implementation of restrictions on use of machines in mining.
 
 “Till a week back, a trailer load containing 200 square feet of fine sand, was supplied for Rs 2,500. After mining in local quarries has stopped, we have to source it from   and the rates have gone up to Rs 4,500 and even Rs 5,000 per trailer. A tipper containing 1,000 sq feet sand was being supplied for Rs 15,000 and now it is available for Rs 25,000,” revealed Nawanshahr-based Ripudaman Singh, who supplies sand for construction.
