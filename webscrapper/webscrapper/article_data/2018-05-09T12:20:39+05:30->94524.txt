IMPHAL:   chief minister   on Tuesday distributed various incentives under social security schemes to selected beneficiaries at a camp of the 'Go to Village' (GTV) mission in the   area here. 

 
 Launched by him on May 1, the GTV mission was introduced with the key objective of bringing such benefits to the doorsteps of people and also to address their grievances. 
 
 Biren said people would no more face the inconvenience of visiting government offices for enrollment of different schemes or registering their grievances. Officials would visit different localities across the state to listen to people's woes for redressal, he added.
 
 The chief minister said deserving people, who were left out of the   ( ) database and who do not have BPL/AAY cards, may also seek benefits under different social security schemes by simply submitting an application to DCs or SDOs. He added that people, especially youths, should make full use of these schemes. 
 
 Exhorting the youths to stay away from drugs and other intoxicants, Biren said agar and lemongrass cultivation is a profitable occupation which they may take up with government assistance. He added that total of 60,339 applications were received by the state government the day the scheme was launched.
