 Charlie   said he decided to build a rugged physique after getting into fights as a kid. 

 The 37-year-old actor says he once got roughed up as a child and decided to work on his built and fighting skills.
 "All the lads used to fight. I didn't want to be involved, but I didn't have a choice. I got battered by five lads once and never wanted to be in that position again. So I started training a lot and learning how to fight," Hunnam said. 
 
  
  The Hollywood star said he still continues to train so that he can defend himself and his loved ones when needed. 
 
 "I still train, I still want to know that if I ever was in a position where I had to defend myself or somebody I love, I've got the tools to do it. 
 
 "I don't want to walk down the street feeling fear but I also don't want to project this idea that if you mess with me it's going to be a bad day for you," he said.
