 Now, Sudip Bandyopadhyay’s directorial debut, ' ', aims to take us back to an era of simple stories that can be enjoyed by all age groups. The film revolves around the Srivastava family, whose oldest member, Nagesh ( ), has difficulty in accepting change. Meanwhile, other members of the family — played by actors like   and   — are fighting their own battles. Interestingly, there is no antagonist in the film. Instead, destiny challenges every character’s hope, even as they struggle to keep their optimism alive.
  
 'Hope Aur Hum', produced by Samira Bandyopadhyay and presented by Thumbnail Pictures, releases on May 11.
