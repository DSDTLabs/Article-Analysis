LUDHIANA: A four-year-old girl,  , has been crushed to death by a car on a 33ft road of Daba on Saturday afternoon. The toddler, along with her family, was sitting outside the house when a speeding   crushed the toddler, and left two other family members — grandmother   (65), and Raghubir’s sister Reshami (50) — injured. The injured were rushed to hospital, where the girl was declared dead. Angry residents of the area vandalized the car, while the car occupant managed to flee from the spot.

 In his statement to the police, Sanjana’s father Sanju Kumar, a migrant labourer, said the entire family was sitting outside the house, because it was a holiday. He said: “At that time, a speeding car crushed my daughter and injured my mother and aunt. The car occupants immediately fled from there, abandoning their car.” Daba police reached the spot and took the car into their custody. They also started a probe to trace the car occupant.
