SURAT: While the   in   (SMC) has drastically trimmed the   hike proposed by urban planners, the   (Fostta) stated that the traders’ community was against paying even half a per cent hike in property tax. 

 In a letter to mayor Asmita Shiroya, Fostta office-bearers have stated that the wholesale textile market in the city is passing through a tough phase post-GST and business turnover has fallen by almost 40%. 
 
 Many small traders have shut shop in the last seven months after the GST was implemented in July 2017. The rest of the traders’ community is finding it very difficult to operate their businesses due to technical glitches in the GST portal and state governments’ decision to implement e-way bill provisions. 
 
 Fostta president Manoj Agarwal told TOI, “We are yet to get details of the property tax hike in the commercial properties by the civic body. However, the traders are against even half a per cent increase. If this happens, then the entire traders’ community will come out in opposition.” He added, “The GST and e-way bill provisions have hit the traders hard. The textile goods transporters have informed that they will not be taking delivery of fabrics to other states without e-way bill.”
 
 A textile trader Rajesh Jalan said, “It has become very difficult to operate business since the past seven months. The demand for polyester fabric has decreased and that we are facing many problems filing the GST return and generating e-way bills. We can’t tolerate the civic body increasing property tax.”
