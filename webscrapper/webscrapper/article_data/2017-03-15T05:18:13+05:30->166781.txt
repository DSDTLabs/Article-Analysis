NEW DELHI:   and its   allies, including RJD and NCP, on Tuesday staged a walk out from   during question hour to protest the alleged efforts of   to form the government in Goa and Manipur despite the party not having adequate number of MLAs.

 Congress leader in the House   said democracy was being murdered. When Speaker   said she would not allow question hour to be disrupted and members should raise such matters in the zero hour, Kharge said if they were not allowed to raise the issue in the House, where else would they go.
 
 Finance minister   said since Kharge has used “strong words”, the remarks should not go on record. “If it is going on record then we would like to give an answer,” he said.
 
 The Speaker said nothing beyond the questions and answers will be allowed to go on record.
 
 Congress, NCP and RJD members then staged a walkout. They returned to the House once question hour was over. Congress has alleged that the BJP is going against the law in forming their governments in Goa and Manipur.
