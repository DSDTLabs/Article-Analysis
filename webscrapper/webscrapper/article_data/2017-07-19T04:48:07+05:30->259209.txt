GHAZIABAD: The   has cleared a proposal to install   lamps for streetlighting on the   instead of the original plan to use sodium vapour bulbs. The proposal was cleared in a board meeting of GDA on Monday.

 According to the original detailed project report of the elevated road, sodium vapour lamps were planned to be used for the purpose. However, the GDA changed the scope in the work and decided to use LED lamps in order to save energy costs in the long run.
 
 “About 1,000 LED lamps will illuminate the elevated road from poles set up on its either sides. Steel brackets will emerge from poles on one side of the road to suspend another LED lamp below which will illuminate the road running underneath the elevated road,” GDA executive engineer   told TOI.
 
 According to GDA officials, use of LED lights will save at least 2,200kW of electricity per day as compared to sodium vapour lamps. 
 
 This would amount to per-day savings of Rs 16,500 approximately.
 
 The GDA had originally planned to inaugurate the Hindon Elevated Road in July. However, construction work on the project has not been completed in time owing to delay in clearances from certain government departments. Work has been rescheduled and a fresh date for completion of the project will be notified soon.
