CHENNAI: Within days of AIADMK MP A Navaneethakrishnan threatening in the   that the party MPs would commit suicide if the Centre did not constitute the   before March 29, another party MP in the same House has said he would resign the post as a mark of protest against the Centre. 

 Soon after announcing his decision to resign, A   said he would reconsider his decision if the party headquarters asked him to do so.
 
 The DMK and other opposition parties have been seeking the resignation of all AIADMK MPs to put more pressure on the Centre, but the AIADMK's stand is that its MPs have been pushing the Centre by not allowing both the Houses of the Parliament to function.
 
 "I will submit my resignation to the Rajya Sabha secretariat in a few days. Despite all steps taken by chief minister   and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam, the Cauvery management board has not been set up. The Centre is acting against Tamil Nadu's interests," said Muthukaruppan.
 
 The MP said he would request all other party MPs to follow him. "Amma had fought for the sake of delta farmers and it was she who gave me this position. I am happy to resign from the position on the Cauvery issue," said Muthukaruppan before he backtracked.
 
 The AIADMK MP claimed that he had raised the Cauvery issue with Prime Minister   as well as BJP president Amit Shah, but did not explain as to when and where he raised the issue with both of them.
 
 "As an MP, I did whatever could be done for the sake of Tamil Nadu. When people are not able to get water, there is no use in holding the MP post," he said.
 
 Taking a dig at Navaneethakrishnan, he said, "Only if we are alive can we fight for our rights. There is no point in committing suicide". Muthukaruppam became MP in 2014 and his term ends only in 2020.
