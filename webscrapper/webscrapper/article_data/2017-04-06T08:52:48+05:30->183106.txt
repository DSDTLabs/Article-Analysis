NEW DELHI: Interviews for appointing about   have started and the number of enrollments in   in the forthcoming academic session will be more than last year, government said on Wednesday. 

  Responding to a Zero Hour mention in the Rajya Sabha by senior JD-U member  , HRD minister   said vacancies of lecturers in the SC/ST and physically challenged categories in JNU have not been filled for years."Now the process and interviews have started. In a couple of months, 300   would be appointed and if there were 970 MPhil and PhD students last year, then the number this year will be more," he said. 
 
  Raising the issue, Yadav said students from rural and far-flung areas of the country come to JNU for studies. But the number of enrollments in MPhil and PhD courses have come down from 970 to 102 and as a result students were desperate, he said. 
 
  As members tried to raise questions following Javadekar's statement, deputy chairman P J Kurien said "I have no reason to disbelieve what the minister has said." JNU students have been agitating against the new admission policy at the varsity and had also gone on a day- long strike to protest the "massive seat cuts" in MPhil and PhD courses.
