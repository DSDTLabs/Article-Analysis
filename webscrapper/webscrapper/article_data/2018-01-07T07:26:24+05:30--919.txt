PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The property   department of Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corpotration (PCMC) has for the first time crossed the Rs 100-crore mark in   tax  .

 Sharing this information with TOI, Dilip Gawde, joint commissioner, PCMC, said the department has collected Rs 113.28 crore in   tax by online means till January 3, 2018. “This is 36.18% of the total property tax collection of Rs 313.09 crore. The civic body has received Rs 73.39 crore in cash/ demand draft (DD) and Rs 126.42 crore via cheques,” he added.
 
 The civic body collects property tax from around 4 lakh properties. The people had only two options for payment of property tax — cash and cheques — till 2009-10 when the civic body started accepting online payments. “Only 2% of the property tax collection was done through online means in 2009-10,” officials from the PCMC tax department said.
 
 However, there has been a steady   in those opting for the online methods. People find it more convenient since they can pay taxes sitting at their houses and even on holidays. Also, the young generation is more tech savvy. We expect the number of property holders paying tax through online methods to increase in coming years,” Gawde said.
 
 “The property tax collection target for 2017-18 is Rs 555 crore. So, we need to collect around Rs 150 crore in the next three months to achieve this target. Since the deadline for payment of property tax with arrears for second half of the fiscal expired on December 31, the department has started a drive to recover the arrears and tax from the defaulters. We have collected Rs 1.54 crore from 16 property holders so far. We will start drive to seize properties of defaulters for recovery of arrears in February,” he added.
