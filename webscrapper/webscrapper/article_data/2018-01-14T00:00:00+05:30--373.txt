Benaras Club recently threw a Christmas bash for its members. The entire venue turned into a hue of red and white, which was the unspoken colour code of the evening. The entrance was decorated with a Christmas tree, a cut out of   and thermocol snow balls, giving a perfect feel of the festival.  , secretary of the club, welcomed the guests.
Some great music added to the evening. A music band, Band of Brothers, from Delhi, kept the guests entertained. The foot-tapping music gave enough reason to people to hit the dance floor. 
 A non-stop medley of Punjabi numbers like   Ban Gayi, Wakhara Swag Ni, Dil Le Gayi Kudi   Di with a dash of Bollywood like Main Tera Boyfriend and Ladki Beautiful kept everyone on the dance floor.
