PUNE: Five neonatal intensive care units (NICU) and preventive health checks for senior citizens are among the healthcare provisions in the draft civic budget presented on Monday.

 Two NICUs at   in Bhavani Peth and Rajiv Gandhi Hospital in Yerawada will become functional by March. The other three are expected to start by next March.
 
 Senior citizens above 60 years within the municipal limits will be able to avail free health checks. These include high-end radiology (including MRI, CT scan) and pathology diagnostics under the   scheme which is likely to start at all PMC-run hospitals and dispensaries next month.
 
 “These crucial projects will be executed phase-wise for the healthcare needs of urban poor in the slums, and for senior citizens,” Anjali Sabne, PMC’s assistant medical officer of health said.
 
 The health department has joined hands with   and   to start the NICU at five PMC-run hospitals. The department has joined hands with a private laboratory for diagnostics.
 
 The civil and electricity work will be done by PMC, Finolex industries and Mukul Madhav Foundation. The industry partner and foundation will provide training to people at these NICUs, Sabne said.
 
 All the NICUs will have 12 beds each including medical equipment, including a paediatric ventilator, warmer, incubator and phototherapy units.
 
 “PMC will purchase the machinery. We have made a provision of Rs 2.5 crore for both NICUs,” Sabne said. 
 
 There is no rider for senior citizens. “The individual has to be a resident of Pune city and have a valid prescription from a medical practitioner, either practising at a public or private hospital or clinic,” Sabne said.
