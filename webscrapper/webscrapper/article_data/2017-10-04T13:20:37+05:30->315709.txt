SURAT: Surtis are famous travellers but most among them would be forced to change their tour plans this   vacation due to   and a fear of unknown triggered by the ongoing economic reforms in the country. There has already been 35% drop in the number of tourists going to Singapore, Bali, Dubai and Hong Kong during Diwali vacation. Same trend has gripped domestic tourism and the number of tourists going to Kerala,   and Goa has fallen by over 30%, tour operators said. 

 An estimated 10,000 people from the city tour abroad while 2 lakh Surtis visit different parts of the country during the Diwali vacation. The number of people cancelling their bookings could rise further by October 15, 2017, they added.
 
 “The tours and travel segment is facing its worst Diwali season in the past 15 years. International tour bookings are getting cancelled. Groups from textile, medicine and real estate segments are cancelling their booking in blocks. There is cash crunch in the market,” Himanshu Kapadia, a prominent tour operator, said.
 
 “People don’t have much cash. And they are scared to use their credit and debit cards so as not to attract the attention of taxmen. Then, some also blame the Goods and Services Tax (GST) for negative impact on their business. Lack of clarity on GST has made many businessman overly cautious and thus avoid spending. There is about 35% less business for us this year,” said Vineet Panchal, owner of another tour company. 
 
 “People are spending minimum on travelling this year. Those who spent Rs1.5 lakh per person on international tours earlier have picked up domestic destinations with an expense of Rs50,000 per head. Many from city plan to go to  , Silvassa and Saputara for holidays,” said Raju Choksi, who runs a well-known tour and travel company in the city.
