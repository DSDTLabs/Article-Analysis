RANCHI: Three large Himalayan Griffons, the largest species in the vulture family and a rare variety of migratory bird from the Himalayas were spotted by   at the famous Charowa Dam reservoir of Hazaribag. 

 Goswami who is a former teacher of   here and also runs a club named 'Birds Buddy' said he has found many birds from the Himalayas visiting Charowa regularly in winter but this month he spotted at least 20 Indian and White Rumped Vultures, three Himalayan Griffons and four Egyptian Vultures.
 
 "Charowa which is situated in the midst of four hills is a patent nesting ground of vultures which are usually found within a radius of 10 kms and Charowa Dam being the dumping ground of carcasses, it is their favourite haunt for food," said Goswami. 
 
 Charowa dam is home to the largest and the smallest vulture, the Himalyan Griffon and the Egyptian vulture respectively. Two other intermediaries, the Indian Vulture and the White Rumped Vulture also visit the place in winters. Goswami who is also a member of the   (BNHS) said that now these vultures are either threatened or critically endangered species.
 
 He said   (Gyps Himalayensis) which is also known as the Himalayan Vulture is 115-125 cms in size. These vultures have long and spiky pale brown ruff, the head and neck is white with slaty black beak and the legs and feet are pinkish with dark claws and covered with feathers. The feeding habit of these scavengers is also unique, as they prefer the fleshy part of the carcass. 
 
 Goswami said that authorities should take immediate steps to protect the rare species.
