CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Captain  , on Friday, expressed concern over the fact that the blast in Canada’s Toronto suburb on Thursday night was targeted at an Indian restaurant frequented by the large Indian community in the area. He condemned the “cowardly act of terrorism” that left 15 people injured.

 Pointing out that he had raised the issue of Canadian soil being increasingly used by radical forces with Canadian Prime Minister   during his visit to India earlier this year, Captain Amarinder Singh said no country could afford to ignore the growing danger of terrorism except at its own peril. The incident, which comes just a month after 10 pedestrians were mowed to death by a van driver in Toronto, showed that no nation is immune or safe from this menace, he said.
 
 “It is the collective responsibility of all nations to fight terrorism,” he said, adding that he had sought Trudeau’s cooperation for the same during their talks in February. On his part, the chief minister said his government is willing to extend all possible help to   to counter the terrorist violence.
 
 Amarinder underlined the need for all countries to work together to eliminate terrorism. He also urged the Indian government to direct the Indian mission in Canada to extend all possible help to Indians and Indo-Canadians injured in the explosion. He urged the Indian government to take up the issue with the Canadian government so that the two countries could work in coordination in the war against terror.
