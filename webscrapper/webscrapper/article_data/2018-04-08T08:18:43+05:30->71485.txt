CHANDIGARH: The forthcoming elections for the   panchayati raj institutions (PRIs), likely to be held in July, would be conducted under the existing provisions and rules in two phases. Also, 50% seats would be reserved for women as per the legislation adopted during the last assembly session.

 Punjab rural development and panchayats minister   said the delimitation exercise of wards for the elections was in the final stage. He said, “The proposal to prescribe matriculation as the minimum qualification and not more than 2-child norm on the   pattern has been dropped for the time being as there was no consensus during extensive deliberations.”
 
 Bajwa clarified that the exercise had been initiated to have broader discussion after this issue was taken up in the cabinet meeting. After consulting experts and stakeholders in the PRIs poll it had been decided to first create awareness on such vital issues, he added.
 
 About conducting the elections for PRIs in two phases, the minister said elections to the block samitis and zila parishads would be held in the first phase followed by that of panchayat panchs and sarpanchs. The minister added that the two election phases would have a gap of about a month.
