KOLKATA: There is no mistaking the three-storey yellow building off   in Bowbazar. It houses the famed  , a library set up with an aim to help the youth hang out meaningfully together — by reading and deliberating. That was 100 years ago, after the world had seen its first war. Santi Institute, as the name suggests, was christened so by its famed fathers as a quest to find peace while reading together.

 As the public library celebrated its centenary recently, the members turned the pages of history to remember luminary figures like Ashwini Kumar Dutta and  , the first president and secretary of the library respectively, who decided to start the library with just 21 young members and 27 books. The present building came up much later, in 1938. Initially, the library ran from an address on Baburam Seal Lane. People took interest and started flocking the place in search of stimulating discussions. Soon, the library became the meeting point of revolutionaries and freedom fighters.
 
 After facing space crunch, the members sought help from social worker Dharmadas Adhikary, who leased out for 999 years a cottah of land at the present address for a rupee. Among the regulars, who would visit the library during those days, were Surendranath Banerjea, Subhas Chandra Bose, Bipin Bihari Ganguly, lawyer Radha Binod Pal, educationist Triguna Sen and historian  . “Today, the library has over 41000 books,” said Governor  , who was present at the function along with former governor and ex-chief justice Shyamal Sen.
 
 Stacked with books from floor to ceiling, the lending room will help you travel back in time. “Reading is on the wane but fortunately, we have more than 800 members. Along with the free reading services, we have also started charitable work like healthcare clinic and supporting the needy girl children,” said Mahadeb Mukherjee, a young member, whose family has been associated with the library for generations.
