ZIRAKPUR: For the residents of Zirakpur, it is that time of the year again when fields in and around this dusty down are set afire by farmers for getting rid of the residue of the previous crop, leaving a thick cloud of smoke for the people to breathe.

 Even as the farmers are setting crop stubble on fire, the district administration has been lax in taking action against them. Avinesh Puri, a resident of   on VIP Road, said, “Something should be done. They are risking us to asthma, bronchitis and other respiratory problems.“
 
 When contacted, chief agriculture officer  , said farmers knew it better that burning stubble could lower the fertility of their land. “But due to the non-availability of heavy vehicles and proper farming equipment; they have to burn it,“ he said.
 
 Singh said a team of agriculture department used to guide farmers from time to time to not burn stubble. “But all farmers tell the same story: of nonavailability of proper ma chinery,“ he said.
 
 As per records with agriculture department, a major problem of stubble burning is in the Dera Bassi block, which has 22,000 hectares under cultivation.While 12,000 hectares is under paddy, the rest is for vegetables.
 
 There is 31,000 hectares under cultivation in Mohali. Of this, 25,000 hectares is used for paddy, while the rest 6,000 is for basmati.When contacted,   deputy commissioner   said, “Teams are working. We are taking strict action against violators.“
 
 However, VIP Road resident   described the government's attitude towards the issue as “totally insensi tive“. “The ashes of this are dumped near residential societies and complexes here. Every child and oldage person is having breathing problems these days because of this. To prevent it, the government must get sensitive towards the public,“ he said. “When will the government realize that this is harmful to our health.
