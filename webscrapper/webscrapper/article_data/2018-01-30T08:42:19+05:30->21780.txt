SEATTLE:  .com Inc on Monday opened a rainforest-like office space in Seattle, US, that it hopes will spark new ideas for employees. While cities across   are seeking to host Seattle-based Amazon’s second headquarters, the world’s largest online retailer is still expanding its main campus.

 The Spheres complex, officially open to workers on Tuesday, is the pinnacle of a decade of development. The Spheres’ three glass domes house some 40,000 plants of 400 species. 
 
  
  
 
 The glass orbs were built to let Amazon workers escape from emails, meetings, reports and deadlines to walk along stone paths beside waterfalls, let ferns from   brush their shoulders and the moist, tropical air fill their lungs. Amazon, famous for its demanding work culture, hopes the Spheres’ lush environs will let employees reflect, spawning new products or plans.
 
  
  
 
 Instead of enclosed conference rooms or desks, the space has walkways and unconventional meeting spaces with chairs. 
 
 The biggest sphere is 90 feet high and 130 feet wide. Inside, visitors first notice the warm, moist air, about 72 degrees and 60% humidity, compared with the 30% humidity in a typical office. 
 
  
  
 
 Eyeglasses fog over and sweat beads on foreheads while bodies adjust. Just inside is a five-storey wall cascading with greenery. The climate varies throughout so visitors can find a “micro-climate” to their liking. The temperature swings as much as five degrees, and ventilation systems simulate an outdoor breeze.
