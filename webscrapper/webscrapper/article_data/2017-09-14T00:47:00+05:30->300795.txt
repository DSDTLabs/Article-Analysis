Coimbatore: A 32-year-old man was sentenced to life on Wednesday for killing his wife after she refused to give him money to buy liquor.

 The convict, identified as Ravi, a daily wage labourer, committed the crime on March 24, 2015.
 
 Ravi, the Variety Hall Road police said, was an alcoholic. On the day of the crime, Ravi came home drunk and asked money from his wife Leena to buy more liquor.
 
 When Leena refused, Ravi picked up a quarrel with her and in a fit of rage strangulated her using her dupatta. The police subsequently arrested Ravi and lodged him at the Coimbatore Central Prison. 
 
 He was charged for murder under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.
 
 The case trial was held before the Coimbatore District Court, which on Wednesday sentenced Ravi to life term imprisonment and also imposed on him a fine of Rs 1,000.
