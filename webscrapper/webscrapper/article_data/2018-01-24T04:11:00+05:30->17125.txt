Vadodara: Ahead of draft budget presentation, the opposition Congress in the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has sought a white paper on the financial condition of the civic body.  The opposition has stated that the state government had delayed several grants throwing the VMC into unprecedented financial crisis. The opposition has pointed out a series of issues that had cropped up due to the tight financial situation of the civic body. It has alleged that despite the situation, the VMC had continued to spend on events as well as beautification and ignored civic works. Opposition Congress councillor and former opposition leader Chirag Zaveri in a letter to the chief minister on Tuesday stated that the civic body had not received an instalment of Rs 33crore towards octroi grant from the state government. He added that around Rs 70 to Rs 75 crore was also pending from the state government towards education tax. Zaveri said that the civic body was in a hand to mouth condition. He added that recently the contractors had made representations when their payments were being delayed by the civic body. The civic works in the city were also suffering due to the delays. The letter points out that the VMC had not been able to clear medical bills of employees in time. The payments to hospitals empanelled with the civic body were also delayed and they were reluctant to take cases referred to by the civic body. The civic body was also not able to pay the subscription for the portal it uses for online tendering and was unable to upload tenders there. Automobile companies were not willing to repair and maintain VMC’s vehicles and its vehicle pool had to do so. The payments for petrol and diesel for the civic body’s vehicle pool were also erratic, Zaveri alleged. Zaveri pointed out that the civic body was unable to clear cases of pensioners. It had not paid Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd for water drawn from the Narmada canal, the letter claims.
