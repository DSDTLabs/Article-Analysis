GHAZIABAD: Three men were thrashed, and two of them shot in their legs, on Sunday night in what police termed a   at   on the  . But by Monday morning, the attack had attained a communal colour as the victims insisted they had been targeted because they had opposed plans to build a mosque in the area. 

 Their claims were supported by Umanandan Kaushik, city president of the  , forcing an interjection from the police, which lashed out at attempts to turn a clear case of   into a communal attack.
 
 "This is a simple matter of road rage but people are trying to give it a communal colour. Just because the two groups involved in the scuffle belong to different communities, every issue is assumed to be communal in nature," said Ghaziabad SSP Deepak Kumar. 
 
 Seven people were named in the FIR, four of whom - Reyaz Khan, Rahul Malik, Nadim and Shaheed -have been arrested. The four attacked men - Vikas Mishra, Abhishek Mishra, Rakesh Garg and Rahul Rajouriya - are all VHP members, police said.
