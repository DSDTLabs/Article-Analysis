PUNE: A cabbie was booked twice in two separate cases of assault on policemen in the last five days and for attempting suicide at Shivajinagar Police Station on Wednesday. 

 His family members said he was agitated after a fight with them and may have vented his anger on policemen.
 
 The Shivajinagar police booked   (27) of Khed and his accomplice Rakesh Dilip Sarmane (32), a resident of Bhosari. Both allegedly attempted suicide by banging their heads on the table at the police station. They also tried to damage computers and attempted to break the glass panes at the police station. Both were admitted to the Sassoon  .
 
 Senior police inspector Rajendra   told TOI, " On Saturday, traffic police constable Ramdas More (32), attached to  , penalised Padmane on North Main Road. This irked him. He waited for More's shift to get over. He then followed More, intercepted him near Shivajinagar Police Colony and beat him up before fleeing in his car," he said. However, More recognized Padmane. He reported the matter to the Shivajinagar police giving details of the car, which was traced on Wednesday. 
 
 "Padmane was brought to the police station. He became agitated when the police decided to arrest him for assaulting More. His relative, Sarmane, too became aggressive. Both of them banged their heads on the table to avoid arrest," Mokashi said.
 
 The duo also beat up constable   and allegedly tore Bhalerao's uniform. Bhalerao later filed a complaint against them for assaulting a policeman and attempting to commit suicide.
 
 The police have booked them under sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharging his duty), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from duty), and 309 (punishment for attempted suicide) of the Indian Penal Code.
