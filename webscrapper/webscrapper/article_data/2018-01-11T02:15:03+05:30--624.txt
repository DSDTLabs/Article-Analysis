THANE: After shuffling for more than 10 hours between several civic hospitals, an eight-year- old, who was bitten by a snake finally got treatment in a private hospital in Thane. 

 The girl,  , was bitten by a snake on Tuesday evening when she was playing outside her house at Bhatana in Virar. “She came home crying with fang marks on her hand. We took her to a public health centre where the doctors gave a medical note asking to shift the girl to Vasai   Municipal Hospital. But as there were no ventilators we had to bring her to   (TCH). Even TCH did not have ventilators for kids and so we had to take her to a private hospital with e elp of an NGO,” said Naresh Pared, uncle of the girl.
 
  “A doctor from the Vasai Virar Municipal Hospital had called informing that the tribal girl was not treated as there were no beds available, which is why she was moved to Thane. The girl was given basic treatment at the civic hospital in Virar after which she was brought to Thane around 11pm on Tuesday,” sa- id Avinash Kirpan upa- sarpanch at  . A local NGO is bearing all the medical expenses of the tribal girl. The doctors at the hospital claimed that the girl’s lungs are infected due to which she is finding it difficult to breathe. 
 
 “There are no ventilators for children at the Civil hospital and seeing her critical condition we were not sure if she would survive till she was shifted to JJ or KEM. The doctors at Civil hospital had stated that due to the venom there was water in the girl’s chest and bones and she was finding it difficult to breath. So with the consent of her family we decided to admit her in a private hospital and bear the charges for the same,” said  , chairman of the NGO Swami Foundation.
