HYDERABAD: The Telangana Southern and   have submitted their tariff proposals for the financial year 2017-18 proposing that no tariff hike be imposed for all categories of customers in the current financial year.

 Power discoms also proposed to extend free power supply for cultivation in polyhouses and green houses, a move being promoted by the state government.Until now free power was being given to nearly 20 lakh agriculture connections for farming under the conventional method. For providing the free power, the state government has been reimbursing an annual subsidy of about '4,200 crore to discoms.
 
 Telangana State Southern Distribution Company Limited (TSSPDCL) chairman and managing director   submitted the tariff proposals to Telangana State Electricity Regulatory Commission (TSERC) secretary   on Thursday.
 
 The discoms submitted their tariff proposals five months after submission of Annual Revenue Requirement to TSERC. Generally, tariff proposals are submitted along with ARRs but the two discoms sought more time to submit tariff proposals as they could not get the nod from the state government whether to increase or decrease tariff for the financial year starting April 1, 2017.
 
 The two discoms did not give their tariff proposals despite re minders from TSERC.
 
 The power utilities waited for the clearance from the government on power subsidy and finalisation of   (UDAY). In their proposal to the government, the discoms had proposed a tariff hike to certain categories of consumers, but this was turned down by chief minister  . The CM announced in the assembly that there was no need for a tariff hike. KCR's justification was that the government had taken over 75% of the discom's debt amounting to '8,923 crore out of the total '11,897 crore. Discoms were also relived of the interest on the loans an amount of `890 crore.
