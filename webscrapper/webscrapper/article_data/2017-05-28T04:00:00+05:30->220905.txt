Surat: Heritage committee, tourism committee and Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI) will hold second Gopipura Heritage Treasure Hunt here on Sunday. At least 25 heritage structures, including temples and havelis, would be covered during this 2.5km-long heritage walk.

 “The purpose of the walk is to make people aware of their heritage. We have a tendency to visit historical places abroad but don’t care about our monuments in city,” said Bhadresh Shah, coordinator of the heritage walk.
 
 There are many heritage structures in Gopipura. Parshvanath Jain temple in the area has country’s biggest 55 feet dome. Agam Jain temple is also unique for its embossed Panch Dhatu plates. Shetrunjay and Samet Shikhar are two of the most holiest of places for Jains. Many wish to travel there. However, those who can’t travel there, can visit Shetrunjay near Parshavanath temple and Samesh Shikhar near Agam temple here which have replicas of the original deities. 
 
 “All these temples were built 400 years ago. There is a lot of history attached to them. Their construction patterns, embossment on the walls, shapes and sizes of the doors and windows are unique,” said Shah. The area also has the houses of Kavi Narmad and Jyotindra Dave and a Sanskrit Pathshala. Jains and Hindus lived like a single community 400 years ago in the city . 
 
 “Surat has more than 2,200 properties identified as heritage value. Unfortunately Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) doesn’t consider any of them to be of heritage value,” a history lover said. 
 
 Sanat Reliya, a hotelier, said, “We need to propagate about these sites. People should be first asked to see our own heritage monuments and then travel abroad. We need to do much more to conserve our unique monuments.”
