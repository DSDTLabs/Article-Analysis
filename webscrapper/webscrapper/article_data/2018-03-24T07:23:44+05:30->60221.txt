CHENNAI: A   seeking   of a large group of   families that has settled on the sands of  , and relocate them in a suitable alternative spot, failed to move the Madras high court, which dismissed the PIL.

 A division bench of Justice S Manikumar and Justice Bhavani Subbaroyan, rejecting the public interest plea of Kanimozhi Mathi on Friday, pointed out that civic authorities had not been informed about the occupation by gypsies. Though the Chennai corporation has a duty to maintain cleanliness of the Marina Beach, until there is a failure on its part to perform its duty, and unless it is brought to its notice, a direction cannot be issued to it for mere asking, reasoned the bench.
 
 It was the petitioner’s case that though the Marina Beach had an envious tag of being one of the longest beaches in the world, its cleanliness quotient was poor and played as a spoilsport. Regular walkers along the sea shore were forced to put up with open defecation on the stretch from   to Buckingham canal. They are hardly able to enjoy the breeze and sunrise, she added. As if this was not enough, now a group of gypsy people have set up their tents on the Marina promenande, near the corporation swimming pool, and they too had started using the sprawling beach space as their toilets. No person can cross the nearly one square kilometre without stamping on human excreta near their settlement, said the PIL-petitioner. 
 
 The intolerable foul smell was repulsive and can cause diseases to persons who go to the locality. “It is very sorry to see the condition of a place of international importance even though Swachh Bharat had been coined as a slogan of the nation for the past four years”, she added.
