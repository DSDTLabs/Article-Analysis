VADODARA: A labourer murdered his former wife and five-year-old son before committing suicide in Gavasand village near Padra on Thursday.

 The couple had separated last month with mutual consent following which the woman   (30) married her paramour Arvind Mali.
 
 Police said that   (35) and Sapna, who hail from  , were married for eight years and had moved to Gavasand. However,   and Arvind started liking each other while working together as fabricators in a private company. According to police, Gaud and Sapna had arguments initially, but recently they decided to separate mutually. On March 15, they got divorced and Sapna and Arvind got married.
 
 On Thursday, Gaud called Sapna to come and collect some of her luggage which was lying in his house. However, instead of Sapna, Arvind reached there. When he did not find Gaud there, he called him on his mobile but there was no response.
 
 At the same time, Gaud went to Sapna’s house where he slit her and their son Karan’s throats and then committed suicide by hanging himself with the ceiling fan.
 
 Cops said that when Arvind returned home, nobody opened the house when he knocked. On peeping inside through the window, he saw Gaud hanging. He immediately called the police, who broke open the door and found the three bodies.
 
 “Although the couple separated mutually, there may be a possibility that Gaud would not have been able to come to terms with it because of which he killed the mother-son duo before hanging himself,” said M K Swami, police inspector, Vadu police station.
 
 Gaud already had a wife in Madhya Pradesh but after he fell in love with Sapna, they both married and fled to Padra.
