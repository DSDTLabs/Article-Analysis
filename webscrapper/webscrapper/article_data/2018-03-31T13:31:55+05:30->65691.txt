BENGALURU: Even as the Union sports ministry is hoping to get official clearance for its delegation to the   Commonwealth Games, the Sports Authority of India (SAI) has, in a stunning move, unilaterally sanctioned the tour for five of its officials.

 
 The irony of it all is that the SAI delegates are all set to leave for the Games even as sports minister   and his ensemble are waiting for the final nod from the cabinet secretary and the Prime Minister’s Office. The ministry had proposed the names of eight of its officials but in all probability, only four of them — Rathore, Dhiraj Singh (OSD to minister), Rahul Bhatnagar (secretary, sports) and Neelam Kapoor (SAI director-general) may be cleared, sources told TOI.
 
 The five SAI officials bound for Australia are Meena Bora (regional director), Radhica Sreeman (regional director), PC Makholia (project officer, teams), Abhay Java (OSD, teams) and Rajesh Rajagopalan (consultant, TOPS).
 
 While the first three will be in Gold Coast from April 4-9, the other two will visit the Australian city from April 8-15. The dates are exclusive of journey time and as such the first batch could leave either on April 1 or 2, sources said.
 
 With the accent on economic austerity and government guidelines stating that ‘foreign travel must be restricted to most necessary and unavoidable official engagements’, sources wondered how SAI could act on its own.
 
 “Guidelines state that all proposals of foreign tours by SAI officials have to be submitted to the sports ministry for prior approval. But neither has SAI forwarded the names to the ministry nor has it explained the purpose of the tour. Ideally, SAI ought to have got the ministry’s approval before issuing the sanction letter. In fact, it is the ministry which is the sanctioning authority. But they approved the tour on their own and marked a copy of the sanction letter to a few officials in the ministry,” sources said.
