NAGPUR: “The new   laws introduced in this year’s union budget have brought about several changes which require income tax payers to make payment in time or pay a hefty penalty of up to Rs10,000. It is in this context that the   should encourage clients to pay tax in time,” said Girish Ahuja, an expert on direct   from New Delhi. 

 Ahuja was speaking at a seminar on ‘Finance Bill 2017’ organized by the Nagpur branch of   at a city hotel on Tuesday. 
 
 Ahuja said, “Things will be fast-tracked as online payment of tax returns has been introduced. Besides giving transparency a boost, the new tax system will also ease the work of CAs.” 
 
 On the introduction of restrictions on cash transactions, Ahuja said, “It is a fine move as people can pay cash up to Rs3 lakh only. This means that you cannot receive this much cash in a single transaction.” People also cannot withdraw money from their current or saving accounts if the amount exceeds the limit. Only those cash transactions will be allowed which are coming in the form of a loan, he added.
 
 He praised the decision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in reducing the cash limit of donations accepted by political parties from Rs 20,000 to Rs 2,000. All the political parties will now have to pay taxes regularly and they will come closer to the banking system. This will reduce generation of black money as they will have to submit receipts and complete information of the donors, he added. Julfesh Shah and Umang Agrawal were present at the seminar.
