 According to Ola Fleet Technologies chief financial officer Sandeep Divakaran, the company will invest Rs 300 crore to provide 5,000 new cabs to unemployed youth enrolled in the employment bank of labour department. The permits of these cabs and driver partners will be issued by the state transport authority under the Fleet Taxi Operators' Scheme, 2018. 
 
 “This collaboration is instrumental in advancing our mission of enabling mobility for a billion Indians,” he said.
 
 In the other MoU signed by Uber, it will create a portal to access the names and details of eligible driver partners and facilitate them to register with Uber through its helpdesks maintained in RTO offices. The driving training will be provided by the state. Uber will then help the drivers get on board its platform as and when an opportunity arises.
