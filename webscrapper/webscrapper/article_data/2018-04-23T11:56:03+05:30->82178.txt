TUTICORIN: Condemning the   at Udankudi in Tuticorin district on Saturday night, BJP state president Tamilisai Soundararajan made an appeal to the state government to ban the yatra carried out by MDMK general secretary Vaiko against Sterlite in Tuticorin district.

 Shortly after the incident, Vaiko told reporters that such incidents of violence would not stop him from campaigning. He also raised doubts if the BJP was trying to disturb the campaign to show their support to Sterlite, against which he is fighting.

 Three persons were injured in the clash from both sides and were taken to a nearby hospital. The police used lathi-charge to bring the situation under control.
