NEW DELHI: South Africa emerged winner in the three-Test series but India gave them a royal thrashing in the six-ODI series that concluded on Friday. Now, the focus shifts to T20Is where the two teams will lock horns in a three-match series beginning Sunday.

 
 
 
 
 #The Proteas ended a three-game losing run versus India on home soil in T20Is last time out by claiming an 11-run victory in March 2012.
 
 #India come into this meeting having won four in a row, their longest run in this form of the game since their seven-game streak between February and March 2016.
 
 #South Africa have tasted defeat in back-to-back T20I matches at the Wanderers, their worst run at the venue although they did see off India when they last encountered one another there (March 2012).
 
 #Virat Kohli is 44 runs away from becoming only the third batsman ever to reach 2,000 in T20 Internationals; he currently has the highest average of anyone to register 10+ knocks in the format (52.9).
 
 #Yuzvendra Chahal has taken more T20I wickets since the start of 2017 than any other bowler; heâ€™s managed to record 23 with an average of just 14.1 since the start of last year.
