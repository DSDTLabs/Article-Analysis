CHANDIGARH: The   government in   may finally go in for   by the end of this month. There has been talk of adding more faces to the council of ministers, but the matter was earlier deferred due to the civic body elections in four cities.

 On March 27, replying to a query regarding the expansion of his cabinet, chief minister Amarinder Singh had said that he would seek an appointment with the Congress president in this regard soon after the budget session. The chief minister presently has his plate full with a whole lot of portfolios, including transport, agriculture, and excise and taxation and nine of his   ministers are left with just a couple of departments each. He had inducted nine ministers, seven in Cabinet and two as ministers of state on March 16.
 
 Where names of senior MLAs like three-time Dera Baba Nanak MLA Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, five-time Amritsar MLA O P Soni, four-time MLA from Ludhiana (North) Rakesh Kumar Pandey, Guru Har Sahai MLA Rana Gurmeet Singh Sodhi and Amritsar (West) MLA Raj Kumar Verka, there are speculations that chances of younger leaders like Vijay Inder Singla, All India Young Congress president Amarinder Singh Raja Warring and Kuljit Singh Nagra are also bright.
