MUMBAI: Bombay   on Thursday took the   ( ) to task, asking how it closed a complaint which alleged corruption against former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan in the allotment of public   lots only on a clean chit from the urban development department (UDD). 

 “How do you close it? How do you form opinion? You must investigate it. How do you decide if an cognizable offence is made out or not? It is for the court to do that?’’ said a bench of Justices   and Bharti Dangre, who heard a public interest litigation filed by activist Pravin Wategaonkar.
 
 In December 2014 Wategaonkar received a letter from the ACB informing him that his complaint was forwarded to the UDD, seeking its comments, and that it had replied that “since no provisions of development control regulations (DCR) have been violated in the approval of public parking lots proposals, an FIR cannot be registered.” His petition said the complaint was not about DCR violation but abuse of the office of the CM.
 
 Wategaonkar said, “They have closed complaints only on comments of the UDD without independent application of mind.’’ The judges questioned the practice of the ACB forwarding complaints to the departments concerned against whom allegations are made. “As if the concerned department is going to accept that offence is committed. We are seeing this now in every matter,’’ said Justice Dharmadhikari.
 
 The judges said ACB must investigate complaints, and it is for the court to decide whether to proceed with it. They said there may be private persons colluding with a public servants, and no there was no sanction required for prosecuting such persons. They also pointed that earlier a person could file a private complaint against public servants, but a new notification bars this. The bench has decided to club this PIL with another where the notification was challenged and hear them together on February 26.
