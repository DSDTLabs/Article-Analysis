NEW DELHI: While the search for the missing Indians ended on a tragic note, junior foreign minister   was singled out for special praise by foreign minister Sushma   for his efforts over the past few years. 

 
 “I cannot praise him enough. He faced all sorts of hurdles and difficulties. While in Badush, he spent three nights sleeping on the floor in a small room,’’ Swaraj said. “He still managed to trace the bodies. He got the concrete proof which I needed to be able to declare the Indian workers dead,’’ she added. 
 
 Singh said it would take 10 days to bring back the bodies of all 39 Indians from Iraq as there would be legal processes involved. Singh, who visited Iraq several times to find out the details of the Indians abducted in 2014, also took a dig at opposition parties for targeting Swaraj on the issue. 
 
 “The external affairs minister had said that they (the Indians) will not be declared dead without proof and she kept her word. Opposition takes things in a different way. You have seen it in  ,” he said.
