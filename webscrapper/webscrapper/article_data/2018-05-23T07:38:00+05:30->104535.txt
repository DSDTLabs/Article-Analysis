Dharamshala: Tibetans living in exile across India would be provided funds under the livelihood support programme, funded by USAID, at a minimum interest rate, the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) announced in Dharamshala on Tuesday.

 Dr Lobsang Sangay, president, Central Tibetan Administration, said the total budget under this initiative had been fixed at Rs 21 crore. The funds would be awarded to sweater sellers, trinket sellers on pavements in tourist destinations, those raising horses and mules for traditional caravan services and those running taxi services at the interest rate of 4%.
 
 The programme, to be implemented between June and August, aims to help 1,525 beneficiaries and their families residing across 45 Tibetan settlements in India.
 
 Last year, the programme was limited to extending support to Tibetan sweater sellers. Out of total beneficiaries who were provided funds under this programme, 42% were women. Importantly, the entire amount was repaid by beneficiaries.
 
 “We hope that the program will be successful this year too and the beneficiaries will repay the entire amount. This will not only help expand the livelihood support programme next year, but will also help us secure more funds,” he said.
