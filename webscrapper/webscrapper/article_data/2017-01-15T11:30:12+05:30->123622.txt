 The delay and uncertainty over the formation of a secular ‘mahagatbandhan’ has come as a boon for the Bharatiya Janata Party ( ) and Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party ( ).
 
  With the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC),   (GFP), United Goans Party (UGP) and   (NCP) yet to make up their minds about hitching their bandwagons together, undecided voters are now even more confused over the ability of the combine to pose a serious challenge to the BJP.
  
  With less than 20 days to go and with some candidates yet to be announced, the delay has also allowed the BJP and MGP to kick-start their campaigns on a positive note.
  
  “Such a situation is unfortunate. It is damaging the Congress more than anyone else,” a senior Congress member said.
  
  Speaking to STOI, chief minister   gleefully accepted that the Congress and GFP stalemate had worked in the BJP’s favour.
  
  “The setting that is being done to form an alliance will go in favour of BJP. The alliance itself is being done against their will and they are contradicting their own statements. They are compelled to form an alliance because they have no other option,” Parsekar said.
  
  Even though the BJP is yet to announce eight candidates, all others have been given the go-ahead to campaign in their respective constituencies. The Congress, on the other hand, finds itself at a loss as aside from 27 constituencies, contestants have yet to be finalized. Uncertainty over the alliance also puts candidates in a spot when queries are raised by voters.
  
  “By now, all the candidates should have been announced. It is demoralizing. At least this time we should have released the names earlier,” a prospective Congress candidate said while speaking on condition of anonymity.
  
  The confusion within Congress and GFP is heightened as decision-making has been left to the party high command in Delhi. “Nobody knows what is going to happen, including  ,” a source said.
