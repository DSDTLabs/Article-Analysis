New Delhi: Calling the EVM demonstration by the   a diversionary tactic, Delhi   chief Ajay   said that any doubts regarding these machines should be put before the Election Commission of India on May 12. 

 He was referring to an all-party meeting called by the poll panel to discuss issues related to EVMs and voter-verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT).
 
 Maken said when the special assembly session was called by the Aam Aadmi Party, he was expecting that corruption charges against chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and problems faced by the people of Delhi would be discussed. 
 
 “Issues expected were 1)CM taking bribe, 2)Dengue on rise, 3)Water and Power shortage, 4)Metro fare hike by 66%. But none discussed in Assembly,” he tweeted. 
 
 The Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee (DPCC) chief said Kejriwal was diverting public attention from matters pertaining to failure of governance and corruption. 
 
 He maintained that the   candidate had lost its deposit in Rajouri Garden by-election where VVPAT was used. BJP-SAD candidate M S Sirsa had won the bypoll. AAP then questioned the credibility of his win alleging that EVMs were not tamper-proof as claimed by the poll panel. 
 
 A VVPAT machine that is connected to an EVM prints a slip containing the poll symbol and the name of the selected candidate. The slip is visible to the voter from a glass case for a few seconds after which it is cut and dropped into a sealed drop box.
 
 Maken also demanded that such VVPAT machines should used at the earliest and the current EVMs should be tested before the  . “EVM be tested before EC! …. VVPAT should be implemented asap,” he tweeted.
