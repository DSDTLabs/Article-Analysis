INDORE: Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) will shift the   of   from centre of the   to the place near the divider of the road between   and Bada Ganpati. 

 “The statue will be   near the divider within 10-15 days. And if required a small traffic circle would be developed at its place to regulate the vehicular movement,” said IMC public works department in charge Shankar Yadav. He said that the work was being undertaken on trial and error basis. “We have completed most of the improvement work at this square along with road widening,” he added. 
 
  “We have written to the civic body asking them to remove the statue since it is affecting the smooth flow of traffic,” said ASP (traffic) Pradeep Singh Chouhan. 
 
 The civic body had earlier reduced the size of the rotary of this square, but the traffic woes remained the same, he added. 
 
 The traffic pressure is always high in the area with movement of school buses and heavy vehicles. The situation becomes critical in the evening due constant vehicular movement in absence of signals leading to jam. 
 
 Apart from road engineering flaws, the ongoing development work such as lying of underground supply cables and drainage lines also hampers the flow of traffic on the stretch from Bada Ganpati to Rajmohalla under Smart City project.
 
 Officials have been making numerous experiments to solve the traffic issues especially the jams. But when all of their efforts were in vain, they decided to remove the rotary.
