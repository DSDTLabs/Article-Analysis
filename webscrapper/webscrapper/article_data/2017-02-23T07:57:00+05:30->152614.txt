NOIDA: Vehicle owners, who had to shell out more money for delay in their licence renewal following revision of rates for transport-related paper work by the state government, can now get their money back.

 The state government had revised rates for transport-related work like getting a driving licence (DL), registration certificate and licence renewal on the basis of a gazette notification issued by the Union ministry for road and transport on December 29.
 
 After the revision, the   had started charging Rs 1,200 for each licence renewal after DL expiry from those applying for renewal after the due date. These applicants included even those whose due date for renewal expired before December 29.
 
 Earlier, if a DL holder failed to get licence renewal within the due date, a fee of Rs 50 used to be taken from the applicant. However, after the rate revision, the renewal fee has been hiked to Rs 1,200 for renewal, plus Rs 200 for the smart card. However, transport commissioner K Ravindra Naik has now clarified that the new rates are applicable only to those DL holders whose renewal period lapses after December 29. Applicants whose licence expired before that will now be eligible for a refund of Rs 1,150 subject to a written application to the   (administration).
