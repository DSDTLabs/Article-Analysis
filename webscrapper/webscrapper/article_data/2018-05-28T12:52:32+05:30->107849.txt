MADURAI: It is a disgrace that the Prime Minister of the country has not come forward to offer a few words of comfort to the people of  , who have been affected by the police firing, charged DMK working president  . 

 
 He was speaking to reporters after attending the marriage function of a party cadre. Stalin said that the Tuticorin shooting incident required the Prime Minister Modi to visit the spot immediately or at least he should have sent one of the union ministers, but the PM did not even have a few words of comfort for the people. 
 
 “This makes us wonder if he is the PM of India, which Tamil Nadu a part is of or if he is the PM for some other country,” he said. 
 
 Answering a question on internet being disconnected in three districts, Stalin said that he was continuing to reiterate that the ruling government was non-functional and one couldn’t ask for an explanation or justice from such a government. 
 
 Responding to information on chief minister   visiting Tuticorin on Monday, Stalin said that he was uncertain about the visit.
 
 In a press statement released on Sunday, M K Stalin has said that DMK condemned the killing of people who had been protesting peacefully against an industry which was polluting their environment. It is impossible that the shooting took place without the knowledge of chief minister, DGP, Tuticorin superintendent of police Mahendran, Tirunelveli DIG   or south zone IG. 
 
 Hence all the above mentioned officials including the CM should be booked for murder, he has stated.
