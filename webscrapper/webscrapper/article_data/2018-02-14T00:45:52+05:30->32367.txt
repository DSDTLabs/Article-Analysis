Chennai: Corporation commissioner   on Tuesday released a preliminary report compiled by representatives of the Rockefeller Foundation-supported 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) programme, which identified six key areas the civic body needs to improve in order to make Chennai more resilient in case of a natural disaster.

 Chief resilience officer of 100 RC for Chennai, R Krishna Mohan, and the programme’s global president, Michael Berkowitz, presented the report to the commissioner. The report identified managing water systems, improving metro city governance, encouraging civic engagement, ensuring service delivery to vulnerable and low-income groups, planned urbanisation and financing resilience building programmes as the areas on which the corporation must work on.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Berkowitz said 100RC’s primary focus would be to help the Greater   build a strong network connecting local and global cities. “We are facilitators and we help facilitate knowledge sharing in key resilience building areas. The ideas and questions posed in the preliminary report may not be new but sometimes even the best ideas fail due to lack of network,” said Berkowitz.
 
 Mohan told TOI that the next step is to look for solutions. “In the next six months, we will discuss projects that would help build resilience in the identified areas. Talks are on with a few major IT firms who want to chip in and contribute meaningfully,” Mohan said.
 
  “The Dutch government’s water ministry is keen on investing in helping Chennai develop and manage its water bodies. Already, teams from the Netherlands have visited twice. It is this knowledge network that 100 RC can provide for the corporation,” Berkowitz said.
