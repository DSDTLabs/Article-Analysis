CHANDIGARH: The   warning sparked panic on Monday, sending worried parents rushing to schools in Chandigarh and making urgent inquiries about when classes will end, even though the dreaded strong winds never blew across the Tricity during the entire day.

  
  
 
 According to weathermen, there was undue panic as it was only a regular   warning and nothing major. Residents blamed the Haryana government for the scare as it was the first to issue the advisory and order the closure of schools till Tuesday.
 
 It was around 11.30pm on Sunday that the UT administration decided to close schools at 12noon. While many private schools followed the orders, others declared a holiday. Parents received messages at late night.
 
 Sacred Heart School media coordinator Manisha Sharma said, “We were constantly getting calls from parents who were panicking over the forecast of a major storm. The school functioned till 12 noon and we decided to cancel the other events scheduled. Rather, there was unnecessary panic.”
 
 “Chandigarh was quite restrained in its decision. I think a lot of schools and parents must have been pressing the administration. Since the weather department had predicted a thunderstorm at 2pm, schools were asked to close at noon, which was a sensible precaution,” said ABS Sidhu, director-principal, Saupin’s School, and vice-president, Independent Schools Association.
 
 Many private coaching institutes also cancelled their classes. Bhavneet Goyal, a city based private tutor, said, “Keeping the panic in mind and the way governments were issuing advisory and closing schools, we also decided not to hold classes. But I don’t think it was needed.”
 
 Students of government schools were happy to get an early day off. For Tuesday, they were told to stay at home if the weather was bad. As many as 773 students out of 1,279 (60%) were present in Government Model Senior Secondary School, Sector 8; 755 out of 1,123 (67.2%) in Government Girls Model Senior Secondary School, Sector 18; 752 out of 1,024 (73.43%) in GMSSS, Kaimbwala; 1,038 out of 1,800 (57.66%) in GMSSS, Sector 19; 212 out of 403 (52.6%) in Government High School, Sector 19 and 318 out of 550 (57.81%)in Government Model High School, Sector 7.
