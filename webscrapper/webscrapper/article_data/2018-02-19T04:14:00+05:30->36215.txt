Vadodara: All-rounder Yusuf Pathan has been dropped from the Baroda team playing in the ongoing Vijay Hazare Trophy. 

 Baroda has qualified for the quarter-finals in the tournament after a fantastic performance and will play against Saurashtra in Delhi on February 22. Yusuf will be replaced by another player Akshay Brahmbhatt. BCA officials said that selection committee was divided over the decision to drop a senior player ahead of a crucial match. 
 
 “Yusuf played six matches in the tournament but didn’t perform well. So, it was decided to drop him and give chance to another player. His poor performance is the only reason behind leaving him out,” said a BCA official. Sources in the association said that two selectors were against dropping Yusuf as they felt that the winning combination should be retained. But other three, after consulting the team coach, opined that the all-rounder should be dropped. 
 
 The 35-year-old player was included at the last moment in the team ahead of the tournament. Earlier, he wasn’t even considered in the team of probables but his name was included during the selection of final 15 by the selectors provided he passed the fitness test. “It is for selectors to decide which player will be part of the team,” said Snehal Parikh, secretary (in-charge), BCA. 
 
 Yusuf scored just 79 runs from the six matches he played in the tournament and his highest score was 28. He bagged one wicket too in the tourney. Yusuf was playing his first tournament for Baroda as he was banned by BCCI for six months after he failed in the doping tests last year. Interestingly, Akshay wasn’t picked up for the Baroda team that played in the Under-23 tournament this season. 
 
 “A section of selectors was against picking up Yusuf While one player was picked up despite failing the fitness tests, Yusuf was asked to give tests if he wanted to join the team,” another official said.
