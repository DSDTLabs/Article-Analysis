Bigg Boss Bangla Season II finalist  , who is currently in Mumbai to pursue a career in national television, is a   freak. She has lost 6.5 kilos in the past three months and tells us how, “I hate going to the gym and follow basic fitness thumb rules. I realised losing weight is not rocket science.” The actress does 1,000 skipping a day and follows it up with 100 burpees. “Four days a week, I walk from my home in   to   Ramada, which is around 6 kilometres. I follow a high-protein and low-carb diet for most part of the week, but eat everything on Sundays,” she added. A biryani lover, Priya either orders for fave dish on Sundays or savours donuts. “Having food of your choice on a certain day of the weeks keeps cravings at bay,” said the actress.
