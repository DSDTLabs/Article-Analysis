NEW DELHI: A survey conducted by data mining firm IDinsight suggests that 87 per cent of rural Indians approve mandatory linking of   to government services. In case of private services though, a lesser 77 per cent of the respondents in the survey said they would agree to link their Aadhaar with private services.

 
 However, it's important to note that the survey commissioned by investment firm   was restricted to the rural areas of three states- Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and West Bengal.
 
 The respondents in three states have suggested that the primary reason for linking services with Aadhaar is the fact is that it is easier to enroll through this process. Resultantly, 66.9 per cent of the respondents used the analog version of Aadhaar (the letter) as an identification proof to open their bank accounts, according to the survey. While 17.2 per cent of them used   (Know Your Customer) to open accounts even as 15.9 per cent did not use Aadhaar, it added.
 
 The survey also witnessed an increase (82 per cent in 2017-18 from 72 per cent in 2016-17) in case of Aadhaar seeding for receiving food ration subsidies via the   (PDS). 
 
 The survey revealed that more number of errors have emerged in case of Aadhaar compared to Voter IDs. The demographic error rate in case of Aadhaar is 8.8 per cent while that in Voter IDs is 5.7 per cent, the survey showed.
