BHUBANESWAR: The police on Saturday shifted the inspector in charge of   station,  , and two woman sub-inspectors (SI)s to another place after a video of two girls alleging police torture went viral. 

 The girls had been picked up a week ago for being involved in a brawl. After receiving bail, they shot a video detailing their injuries - allegedly received in the custody of   Police - and posted it on social media."We were beaten up by police at the station. They (the cops) warned us against complaining," one of the girls told a private news channel.
 
 The woman officers had picked up the girls on May 6 after receiving information that they were involved in a clash with another group of people in the locality. The officers claimed the girls had roughed them up when they went to defuse the situation. The officers gave a written complaint against them and they were booked under section 341, 294, 323, 325 and 353 of the IPC. "The girls were remanded in judicial custody after the case was registered," said DCP Anup Nayak.
 
 Police said the probes into the two cases - of the girls beating the women officers and allegations of police torture - would be investigated separately.
 
 "Both matters are under investigation. An additional DCP-rank officer has been given charge of the probe. For a fair investigation, we have shifted the woman officers and the inspector in charge," said twin cities police commissioner Y B Khurania.
 
 DGP R P Sharma had on Friday suspended the inspector of   police station,  , for allegedly assaulting an elderly woman on May 7.
