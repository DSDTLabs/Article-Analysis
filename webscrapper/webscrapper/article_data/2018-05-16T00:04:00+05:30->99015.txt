PUNE: The Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) will sign a Memorandum of Understanding with the Singapore government for drawing up a development plan for PMRDA region spread over an area of 7,246 sqkm.

 PMRDA commissioner Kiran Gitte said that the MoU will be signed on May 16 in Mumbai with officials from the Singapore government . Consultants from Singapore will be appointed for drawing up the DP of PMR region.
 
 The government decided to appoint Singapore town planners after doubts were raised over the efficacy of state town planners. Union road transport minister Gadkari in an interaction with PMRDA officials had said that urban planners in the state lacked expertise.
 
 According to Gitte, officials from Singapore will work closely with PMRDA authorities for 10 months and ready the development plan, which will be an economic development plan unlike the land use plan developed by town planners in the state. “A 50-year development plan for the region will be drawn up by consultants from the Singapore government and all aspects will be looked into,’’ said Gitte. 
 
 Earlier, the Singapore consultants had worked in   capital   on similar lines.
 
 The chief minister had earlier visited Singapore and met Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to draw investment for Pune’s development.
 
 For this project, 60 % of the cost will be borne by PMRDA and the rest by the Singapore government. The DP project is estimated to cost between Rs 10-15 crore.
