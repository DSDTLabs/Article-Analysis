PUNE: There have been some cases of flouting the norm of having a balcony   or hand railing not less than 1.2 metres. 
 
 Architect Prakash Walade said, “The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has its restrictions, which most buildings adhere to. We had incorporated a glass balcony using a high quality 12mm glass in a building. It was strong but looked fragile. The corporation insisted on installing a steel member (structure) but it provides only visual safety.” 
  
 According to Walade, the prescribed norm for a balcony wall is compromised with on occasions. “Ideally, a balcony parapet should be opaque till the prescribed  . Also, if one installs a grille, the gap between two must be four inches,” he said. 
  
 The city engineer of PMC, Prashant Waghmare, said there were no specific guidelines of the civic body regarding the balcony parapet or hand railing. “We follow the provisions of the National Building Code. If we find the height of a parapet is lower than the prescribed limit, we follow-up on the issue for raising the height,” he said. 
  
 Waghmare, however, did not clarify if the completion certificate was granted before the follow-ups were done. 
  
 The chairman of Architects, Engineers and Surveyors’ Association, Ravi Kanhere said PMC had a provision for a parapet height of 1.05 metres, but there were no guidelines on hand railings and gap between the members. “There is a need for ethical construction practices and an intention to make a good structure,” he said. 
  
 The architect said, “There is no problem in railings made of high quality glass with good fittings.”
