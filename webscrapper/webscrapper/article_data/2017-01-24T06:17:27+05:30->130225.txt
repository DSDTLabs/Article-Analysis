AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Monday sought a report from the designated   on whether the second chargesheet filed by the CBI in the 2004   encounter case forms part of court record or not. The HC query was in response to a petition filed by IPS officer and a former investigator in the encounter case,  , who has challenged the lower court’s order denying him a copy of the second chargesheet that was filed in February 2014. The high court has kept further hearing on February 1, asking the CBI court to submit its report before then.

 Verma through his advocate Rahul Sharma has challenged the lower court’s rationale that since the chargesheet has not been taken on record because of want of prosecution sanction against the accused, the document does not form part of court records. Hence, the court reasoned it cannot part with the document.
 
 The first chargesheet in this case, in which eight police officials, including present in-charge DGP of Gujarat, P P Pandey, has been named, has been committed to the court of sessions. Verma’s request to obtain a copy of this chargesheet is pending before the sessions court.
 
 In the second chargesheet, four intelligence bureau officials, including the agency’s former special director, Rajinder Kumar, were named for hatching the conspiracy to kill four persons including Ishrat. They have been shown playing active part in not only abducting and illegally detaining four persons, but of also framing them as   operatives who had come to Gujarat to kill then chief minister   in order to avenge the 2002 riots.
