Most TV actors shoot for their episodes just a day before they are telecast. So, it takes us by surprise when   tells us that he has been filming for his role in Nikkhil Advani’s '  —  ' since October. The actor, who debuted with Ashutosh Gowariker’s ' ', tells us, “I started shooting by the end of October and it has been an amazing journey so far. But my character enters the show when the plot shifts to Pakistan. I play the antagonist in it and I didn't have a problem because I have seen the kind of content Nikkhil sir makes, and I think this is a dream role for any actor.”

  
  
 Talking about his character and the look, Sahil says, “I play  , a Pakistani. He is a lunatic who does all the wrong things, but believes they are right. It’s a dream role for any actor. I had to grow a long, messy, not to forget, itchy, beard, and wear green lens to look intense.”
 
 Interestingly, Sahil had taken up a show on television after a year-and-a-half. “I didn’t want to do shows just for the sake of it. I know I might offend people, but I think most of the content on TV is regressive. For me, it’s important to do work that I can be proud of, and not feel embarrassed about. Though I hadn’t been doing TV show, I did do some interesting short films and international projects,” he signs off.
