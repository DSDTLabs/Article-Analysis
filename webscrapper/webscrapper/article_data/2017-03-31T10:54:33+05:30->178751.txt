ROHTAK:   legislature party (CLP) leader   on Thursday slammed the   government for discriminating against   parliamentary constituency over water-sharing for farm and domestic use. 

 Choudhry, who toured over a dozen of villages under the Bhiwani-Mahendergarh Lok Sabha seat, said, "The summer season is yet to peak but the villages lie at the tail-end (of canal) have no water right now. Imagine their situation in the next two-three months, when mercury would shoot up like anything." 
 
 Choudhry, who is an MLA from Tosham assembly segment of Bhiwani, said the Bhakra water used to be delivered via Yamuna river to the constituency in rotation after 32 days. "Now, the water is being given after 40 days. The level of water remains low during the rotation period, which again deprives farmers of their share," she said.
 
 The pathetic condition, which the people of Bhiwani-Mahendergarh constituency were reeling under due to cut in water share, had failed to evoke action from the state government, she alleged. 
 
 The contentious Satluj-Yammuna-Link (SYL) canal water, which could revive the fortunes of the farmers of south Haryana, was not been taken up by the   government seriously, alleged Choudhry.
