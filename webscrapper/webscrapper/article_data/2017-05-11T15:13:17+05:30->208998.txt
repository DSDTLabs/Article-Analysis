THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: BJP state leadership has approached Reserve Bank of India ( ) seeking a thorough probe into an alleged nexus between public sector banks and resort lobbies on Munnar hill top.
 
 BJP state president   submitted a petition in this regard to   SMN Swami on Wednesday.
  
 Drawing the attention of the RBI to the controversies raging over the land encroachment and the damage to the environment in Munnar in Idukki district, Kummanam told the RBI regional director that many resorts had obtained huge loans from public sector banks even after they were issued stop memo by the local bodies and were facing several inquiries for land grabbing. 
 
 Many banks have landed in deep trouble following the non-repayment of loan by some resort owners. Banks have to evoke   (Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002) for taking possession these land and buildings. In some cases it was found that the land mortgaged to the banks did not belong to the loanees, he said.
 
 "I request you to kindly initiate an inquiry into the loans given by the banks to these resorts flouting all banking norms, and take stringent action against those involved in using public money to finance non-viable and highly risky and litigation prone projects."
