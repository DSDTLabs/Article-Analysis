Lowering and maintaining the blood sugar levels is the prime goal of   treatment One doesn't however know when this savior treatment might take the form or a tormentor. Under certain circumstances the medications might lead to a drop in mood sugar level (lower than normally required), inducing in the patient a state of hypoglycemia. Repeated episodes of sudden, austere drop in the blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia) in diabetes patients not only elevate the risk of various heart ailments [cardiovascular diseases (CVD)] but at times might lead to death of the patient The role of   in increasing the vulnerability towards CVD and death has not been explored sufficiently till date. Researchers therefore assessed various undetermined aspects that would modulate the association between hypoglycemia and CVD and death in diabetics. The findings of the study were presented at the "EPI|LIFESTYLE 2017 Scientific Sessions" held in the month of March 2017 in Portland.

 Four hundred and sixty four diabetes patients aged at least 65 years were recruited in this study. The information on episodes of severe hypoglycemia and that of CVD events (coronary heart disease, stroke, or heart failure) and death was procured from their hospital records and emergency department visits.
 
 Of the entire study population, 65 patients suffered with hypoglycemic events before suffering with a CVD event or before death. Adjustments for various shared risk factors revealed that patients who encountered episodes of sudden, sharp dip in blood sugar were 1.6-times more likely to be hit with CVD and 1.8 times more likely to die, as compared to the diabetes patients in whom the blood sugar levels remained stable.
 
 Austere dip in the blood sugar levels might increase the risk of heart diseases and at times be lethal for diabetes patients. It is therefore crucial to monitor the diabetes treatment meticulously and to look for various signs of hypoglycemia.
