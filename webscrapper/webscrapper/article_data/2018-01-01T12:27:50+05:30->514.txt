SAMBALPUR: With   being underway in   town,   on the outskirts has turned vegetarian. 

 Amapali is transformed into Gopapur during the yatra.
 
 Though there is no restriction on the consumption of non-vegetarian food as such, people believe that since Lord Krishna and Balaram stay in Amapali during the 11-day yatra, residents should refrain from having non-vegetarian food as a mark of respect to them.
 
 Sushil Mohapatra, the core committee member of the Dhanu Yatra organizing committee said, "There has been such a tradition at Amapali since 1947. People selling mutton, fish, chicken and other non-vegetarian items here keep their shops shut during the festival."
 
 The concept of Dhanu Yatra has been borrowed from   and Mathura Vijay. With the beginning of the festival, the small town of Bargarh is transformed into Mathura and the Jeera river, which flows along the town, into Yamuna. The balya leela of young Krishna is enacted in Gopapur. The enactment includes vastra haran, kalia dalan, killing of demon warriors like Putuna, Sakata, Truna, Baka and Dhenu. The enactment at Gopapur ends on the ninth day of the yatra when Lord Krishna and Balaram arrive at Mathura accompanied by Akrura, a minister of Kansa, to participate in Dhanu Yatra. 
 
 Mohapatra said if someone comes to Amapali during Dhanu Yatra, s/he will be transported to mythological Gopapur with graffiti on balya leela scribbled on the walls of every house here. It is believed that Lord Krishna and Balaram visit all the houses of Gopapur. The devotees pay obeisance to the gods.
