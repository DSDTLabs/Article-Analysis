Mumbai: The   (SAT) on Thursday allowed   (PW) and its network entities to continue with audit works of listed companies till the end of fiscal 2019 or till a new tribunal bench is formed.  , however, refused to grant a stay on Sebi’s order which bars   and its network entities from taking up audit work from new companies that are listed, the tribunal modified its January 19 order.

 SAT’s presiding officer J V Devadhar has already recused himself from hearing the Sebi versus PW matter, while member Jog Singh would be retiring on February 19. So in effect, after that date, there would be only one member to hear the pleas at the tribunal.
 
 The Sebi order relates to PW’s alleged role in auditing Satyam Computer Services, which in 2007 had disclosed a fraud of over Rs 8,000 crore. In January, Sebi had barred PW and its network entities from auditing any listed company in India for two years. Subsequently, PW and its network firms had moved SAT.
