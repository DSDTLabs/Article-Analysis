  : In the ongoing probe into botched cataract eye surgery cases at   hospital, the food and drug administration officials have raised suspicion over the quality of eye medicines purchased by AIIMS administration. 

 The drug inspector pointed out that AIIMS hospital failed to follow their protocol of accepting the quality certificate from the chemist shops, which are being operated on the hospital premises. According to assistant drug inspector, the samples of eye medicines have been collected from the chemist shop, from where medicines were bought by the patient's kin for the cataract eye surgery. However, the drug inspector could not find the stock of medicines of the same date and batch which were bought for the patients for the surgery. So the samples of same medicines of different batches were collected for the lab test. The team of food and drug officials recorded the statement of AIIMS ophthalmologists Dr Lubna Khan and Dr Lipi Chakravarty and collected the samples of medicines used in surgery from the stock kept at AIIMS hospital. 
 
 However, the AIIMS administration is also conducting probe into the botched-up cataract eye surgeries to detect the cause of spread of bacterial infection in patient's eye and the medicines used during cataract surgery. The operation theatre's culture samples have been sent for microbiology test. 
 
 Assistant drug controller Beniram Sahu said, "The collected samples of used medicines in cataract surgery have been sent for testing in state's laboratory in Raipur while some have been sent to central drug laboratory at Kolkata and the report will be received in next 15 days. The drug officials alleged that the AIIMS administration failed to take quality certificate of medicines from the chemist shops which are being operated inside AIIMS premises. This is raising suspicion on the quality of medicines used in the cataract surgery."
