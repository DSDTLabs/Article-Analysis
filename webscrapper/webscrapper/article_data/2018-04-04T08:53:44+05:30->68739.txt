FAIZABAD: Retaliating against continued harassment by her husband, a woman killed him using a rolling pin in Ambedkarnagar district on Monday night.

 She was arrested along with her minor daughter, who allegedly aided her mother in killing her abusive father. The incident took place in Hussainabad Khanpur village under Zaidpur police station.
 
 According to the police,   (45), was regularly beaten up by her husband Gauri Prasad   (50), an alcoholic.
 
 Around midnight on Monday, the couple had an argument over Rajbhar’s habit of consuming liquor. As the quarrel intensified, Sumitra hit her husband with a rolling pin several times. As a result, Rajbhar was crtically injured and began bleeding. Other family members arrived on hearing the commotion and took Rajbhar to the district hospital, where doctors declared him brought dead, said the police.
 
 SHO of Zaidpur police station   said a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder had been lodged against Sumitra on a complaint by the deceased’s sister. Rajbhar’s body has been sent for postmortem.
 
 “The deceased’s sister Jamurta Devi has also named his daughter (15) as an accused. Both have been taken into custody. The girl supported her mother in the act, the complaint says,” said Singh.
 
 “The killing was not intentional. The woman and child were harassed regularly and beaten up by Rajbhar. The wife has retaliated after her patience ran out. The minor daughter was regularly witnessing the harassment and hence did not try to save her father,” said Singh.
