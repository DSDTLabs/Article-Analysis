KOCHI: The Kerala high court on Friday quashed two notices issued by   district collector T V Anupama to  , owned by   in which former minister   is a director, on charges of violating the Kerala Conservation of Paddy Land and Wetland Act.

 Justice A K   said the notices were issued on wrong survey numbers and criticized the collector for the laxity with which they were issued. It shows that the basic land records were not perused while issuing notices, the court said.
 
 The notices were issued under Section 13 of the act.
 
 The Section 13 of the act allows the collector to restore any paddy land reclaimed by violating provisions of the act and to realize its cost from the holder or occupier of the land.
 
 It was submitted on behalf of the collector that the errors occurred in recording the resurvey and block number in notices asking representatives of the resort company to appear before her on February 23. The company approached the high court instead of citing the errors before her and obtained a stay on further proceedings.
 
 
 
 
 Notices were later issued by correcting the errors but the proceedings were kept pending. The collector then informed the court that the corrected notices, issued without knowing about the interim court order, could be withdrawn and company representatives could be given a hearing.
 
 In Fridayâ€™s order, the court said the collector was careless in taking action and the notices were issued without applying mind. The district collector is an important post that carries high responsibility and the responsibility and the accountability of the person occupying the post is revealed through their actions. A perusal of notices prepared on the basis of incorrect facts and belief gave an impression that they were prepared by a student, it said.
