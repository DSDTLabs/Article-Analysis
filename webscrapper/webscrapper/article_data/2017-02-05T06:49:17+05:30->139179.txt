CHENNAI: Calling a man who had raped his own daughter as a 'man by appearance, but animal by behaviour,' the Madras high court has confirmed   awarded by a  .
A division bench of Justice S Nagamuthu and  , dismissing the appeal of Hakkim who was 35 in November 2013 when the incident occurred, rejected defence arguments relating to delay in lodging a complaint and lack of evidence on the person of the victim in order to convict the man.
 
 The Podanur police said Hakkim's wife caught him sexually assaulting their daughter, 12, at their house on November 9, 2013, and lodged a complaint. Police registered a case under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act on November 14.
 
 A mahila court found him guilty and awarded him imprisonment for life on June 4, 2016.
 
 In the present appeal, his counsel said the `unexplained delay' of five days in lodge the complaint raised doubts over the evidence of the mother and the victim.
 
 Rejecting this, the bench said the victim was too yo ung to approach police and may not have known the consequences of the act.
 
 As for the mother, the only perceivable reason is that she hesitated bringing the sexual exploitation in the open to maintain the family's `honour and prestige' and to protect the girl's future.
 
 The lawyer then argued that the medical report did not corroborate the complainants' evidence as there was no presence of semen on the girl's person.
 
 Rejecting this, too, the bench said there was no argument of ejaculation, and even assuming it was so, the semen would have been washed off as the victim was examined about five days later.The father deserved the maximum punishment of life imprisonment, the bench said and dismissed his appeal.
