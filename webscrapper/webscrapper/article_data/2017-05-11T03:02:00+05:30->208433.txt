Times News Network Panaji: Minister for panchayats Mauvin Godinho, on Wednesday said the government would consider amending the Goa Panchayati Raj Act to provide stability to the grassroots-level bodies. He also said he is keen on providing more powers to each panchayat’s elected representatives, especially to the sarpanchas. “The job of the panchayat secretary is executive. He needs to take executive decisions as per the law. But sarpanchas cannot be denied powers that ought to be theirs,” Godinho said. Meanwhile, the directorate of panchayats on Wednesday announced the list of wards to be reserved for women candidates in the upcoming panchayat elections.  In five-member panchayats, ward numbers one and three will be reserved for women, while in seven-member panchayats, ward numbers three and four will be set aside for them. Ward numbers three, five and eight will have women candidates in panchayats comprising nine members, while eleven-member panchayats will see ward numbers one, two, three, five and eight reserved for women candidates.  These reservations have been executed in keeping with the rotation policy. The directorate of panchayats is now working out the nitty-gritty of seat reservation for SC/ST and OBC candidates.
