Navi Mumbai: The state public works department ( ) is in the process of repairing and rectifying the 70-m long uneven stretch of road on   which had a wide linear gap in the metal expansion joint. The faulty expansion joint had recently caused a fatal mishap in which a 26-year-old biker was killed after his twi-wheeler skid due the gap.

 The   police had registered an FIR against the PWD officials. This has finally woken up the PWD authorities and in order to prevent further mishaps on the Jui bridge, they have put up barricades so that bikers do not go over it. Barricades have been put up for one lane of both the carriageways on Jui bridge where there is an expansion joint. So, all vehicles are not allowed from plying on the first lane of both the carriageways.
 
 PWD’s deputy engineer Pravin Naik said, “A Thane-based engineering firm Technogem Consultants Pvt Ltd has been assigned the job to carry out repairs of the bridge. On Wednesday, PWD secretary (roads) C P   held a meeting with the firm’s engineers, who then submitted a technical solution to resolve the problem. The firm’s engineers presented a design to close the gap. As the Jui bridge is more than three decades old and it was widened by expansion joint in 2013 as a part the Sion-Panvel highway project, the firm will now recheck the tensile strength of the piers of the bridge and other necessary technical parameters. The firm will be submitting the engineering design proposal on Monday and repair work may begin from March 21.”
 
 Meanwhile, senior inspector   of Vashi police station said, “We have sent a letter to PWD’s executive engineer seeking the names of the concerned PWD officials responsible for the installation of the ‘faulty’ metal expansion joint. Accordingly, the officials will be named as an accused in the FIR for the biker’s death.”
