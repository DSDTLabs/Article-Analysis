UTTARKASHI: Union home minister   celebrated New Year with jawans of the Indo   Border Police (ITBP) at Nelong valley in   district bordering China on Monday. Joined by   director general R K Pachnanda and other officials, the home minister interacted with the soldiers and reviewed the operational preparedness of a forward ITBP unit here. 

 Singh said the Centre has undertaken a special project to connect all the border posts along the   frontier with roads. “This would enhance the operational efficiency of the officers and also reduce the instances of mountain-related sickness among them,” he added. In his address to the soilders, Singh lauded the great work done by the jawans in bone-chinning conditions at 11,636 feet above sea level. 
 
 He said, “The Himveers are working with high morale in the Himalayan borders. The ministry of home affairs is aware of the services rendered by the ITBP personnel and are trying to extend all possible support to the force.” 
 
 He added, “ITBP soldiers deployed at posts above 9,000 ft will also get lightweight clothing and mountaineering equipment, earlier given only to soldiers deployed above 11,000 feet.”
