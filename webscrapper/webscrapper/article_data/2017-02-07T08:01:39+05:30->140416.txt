LUCKNOW: His ticket to contest assembly election cancelled,   leader and advisor in the handicap welfare department   defected to   on Monday. Mansoori, who was taken into BSP in the presence of  's deputy Naseemuddin Siddiqui is president of Muslim Pasmanda Samaj, which represents the backward among the community. His defection comes to the advantage of Mayawati, who is making every effort to win over the Muslim vote bank. He was originally a BSP functionary who had defected to SP just before the 2012 assembly elections. 

 Mansoori, who sent his resignation letter to SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said his decision was driven by gross neglect of the backword section of the community in the SP regime. “None of our demands, including reservation for Muslims were met despite the community having voted heavily in favour of the Samajwadi Party in the previous assembly elections,” he said, speaking to TOI.
 
 A Persian term meaning ‘those who have fallen behind’, Pasmanda samaj comprises a significant proportion of the population amongst Muslims. Political experts said it is this very section which has been demanding reservation on the likes of other backward caste and SC/ST. 
 
 Mansoori was appointed advisor in home guard department just before 2014 Lok Sabha elections but was removed after a few months. Later, he got appointed as advisor in the handicap welfare department. Mansoori also got a ticket to contest from Bilgram Mallawan assembly constituency in Hardoi but a fortnight ago his candidature was cancelled.
 
 The defection by a minister rank SP functionary to BSP comes days after two other senior SP leaders, Ambika Chaudhary and Narad Rai switched to Mayawati’s camp.
