Actor   said her and  's children are bilingual as they mostly converse in "Spanglish". The actor, who has three-year-old   and 16- month-old   with Gosling, said they are keen to raise their daughters in a Cuban household.

  
  
 "Esmeralda mostly speaks Spanglish right now. It's really cute. She's definitely bilingual," Mendes said. The ' ' actor said her partner believes it is "really important" for them to make their daughters familiar with not only the language, but also the culture and cuisine. 
 
 "And it's really important for us to make sure that she's not only just familiar with the language, but also with the culture."
 
 "My mom, who lives 15 minutes away, makes it easy because she speaks to the girls in Spanish and cooks them Cuban food. And we're always listening to Cuban music. It really is a big part of our way of life. I wouldn't have it any other way," she adds.
