Lucknow: Of the 100 badly-performing   in the country, as many as 23 are in  , according to Niti Aayog. Advisor to   Alok Kumar said a joint effort between the Aayog and UP government would help lift UP’s backwardness.

 Kumar, who was in the state capital on Saturday, told TOI: “The average progress of the state in key social welfare and human development indicators was far below the national average. A high-level delegation of Niti Aayog was here to review the progress in the eight key sectors identified by it, on which it is working with the UP government.
 
 A group of top bureaucrats led by chief secretary Rajive Kumar deliberated with Niti Aayog team at Yojana Bhawan to draw up a strategy for lifting the state from backwardness. The participants also deliberated on how UP, which performed above average in 50s and 60s, has now declined to below national average. The UP team, headed by Kumar, comprised cabinet minister Siddharth Nath Singh and principal secretary, planning, Sanjiv Saran. “The state, despite being most populated in country, is still reeling in backwardness and is below the national average in many areas – from infant mortality to school dropout rate,” said Alok Kumar.P 5
