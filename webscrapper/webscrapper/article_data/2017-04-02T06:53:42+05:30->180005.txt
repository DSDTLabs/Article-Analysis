BENGALURU: Former Union finance and home minister   said on Saturday the   lacks the organizational structure to take on the widespread and deep-rooted   and  .

  He said the BJP and RSS today have the structure and reach which the Congress had from the 1950s to the '70s. "Over the past 20 years, the Congress organizational structure has weakened. We need to build it in the next two years if we want to give a fight to the BJP in the 2019 elections. Otherwise, it's going to be very difficult," he said at the launch of his book 'Fearless in Opposition'. 
 
  Citing Tamil Nadu politics, Chidambaram said: "At every booth, 100 workers will be present from the AIADMK and 50 from the DMK. The Congress will have five. This is the rationale behind the regional parties' success in Tamil Nadu. We need to have committees at the booth, panchayat, district and municipality levels." 
 
  Declining to comment on political pundits' analysis of lack of strong leadership, he said: "With the organizational structure in place, there will be a collective leadership. Of course, a numero uno will emerge but then every party has a one, including the BJP." 
 
  Chidambaram said barring Kerala, Karnataka and Rajasthan, to a certain extent, no other state has a strong Congress organizational structure."We need feet on the ground to convert people coming to us into votes," he said. 
 
  On the recent loss of face for the Congress in Goa and Manipur, he said the fastest feet (BJP) on the ground using the governor's office stitched together a government. "If such was the case, with the fastest feet putting together a government, then Usain Bolt should become the prime minister of this world," he said.
