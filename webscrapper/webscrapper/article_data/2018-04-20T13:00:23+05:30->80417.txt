SHIMLA: Welcoming the decision of the Supreme Court in the Justice Loya death case, chief minister   said that   president Rahul Gandhi must apologize to the entire country for his conspiracy and attempt to defame   president and also to defame the Indian judiciary. He said that the Congress had been uprooted from most of the states in the country and the party was resorting to conspiracy and raising baseless issues in sheer frustration. 

 In a statement issued in Shimla on Thursday, Jai Ram said that the decision of the SC in Judge Loya death case has completely exposed the Congress and its associates. He said that Rahul held a press conference on this matter and also met the President, along with 150 MPs. “As he had failed to do anything in politics, the SC has exposed his conspiracy to use the judiciary for his political rivalry,” he added.
 
 The CM said that while the Gandhi family wants to control the country always, it starts conspiring against every “poor” individual who wants to serve the nation. He said that the Supreme Court had stated that Justice Loya’s death was natural and therefore dismissed the PIL, stating that it was politically motivated and had been filed to settle political scores. He further said that the Congress made a deliberate attempt to defame BJP president   and also finish him politically. 
 
 “The SC further observed that it was a veiled PIL, which has been filed by someone unknown and was completely politically motivated. It further stated that the PIL was a blatant attempt to defame the judiciary, especially the SC, which was very unfortunate,” he added.
