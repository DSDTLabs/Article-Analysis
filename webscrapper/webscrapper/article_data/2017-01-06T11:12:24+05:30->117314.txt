BHOPAL: Congress legislator from   constituency   alleged that chief minister   has not upgraded   to a tehsil and urban panchayat because Congress has been winning the seat. 

 In a press conference at the   in capital on Thursday, Sisodia said, "The chief minister made an announcement to upgrade Myana to a nagar panchayat before the 2008 assembly elections. Addressing a public meeting on September 17, 2008 when before a crowd of 5,000 persons he assured that Myana would be elevated. Till now, no such effort has been made by him because the constituency elected a Congress candidate."
 
 Sisodia said while people kept demanding urban panchayat status, he raised the issue in the state assembly on February 24, 2015. The then minister for urban administration Kailash Vijayvargiya denied the chief minister ever made such a promise in a public meeting. "The minister said the chief minister does not make such announcements," Sisodia said.
 
 He claimed that while the minister denied the announcement was made, he had a copy of the district collector's letter to the chief secretary dated September 24 informing the government that the CM had made the promise.
