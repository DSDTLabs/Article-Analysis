 and Vivaan Shah-starrer, '  Mein   Deewana', addresses the subject of teenage pregnancy. Writer Manish Harishankar, who also dons the director’s hat for the film, says that the story attempts to address a serious issue in an entertaining manner. 
He adds, “While the issue is old, there has been a major rise in such cases. According to recent data sourced from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation ( ), the past three years have seen a 144 per cent rise in the number of girls below 15 undergoing abortions. That’s what made me choose this subject for my debut Hindi film. We have conveyed the message with a fun-filled screenplay.” 
 Producer T.P. Aggarwal, reiterates that despite being a social drama, the film is not preachy. “It is quite challenging to tackle a serious subject with a dose of humour, but Manish has succeeded in conveying the seriousness of the issue in a non-preachy manner,” he sums up.
 'Laali Ki Shaadi Mein Laaddoo  ', produced by T.P. Aggarwal and Rahul Aggarwal’s Star Entertainment Worldwide Pvt. Ltd, releases on April 7.
