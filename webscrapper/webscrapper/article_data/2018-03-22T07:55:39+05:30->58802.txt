KOLKATA: Developers in Kolkata are considering a foray into the student-housing sector to meet the burgeoning need of students who annually get admitted to institutions in and around the city. 

 Most private institutions offer hostel facilities for the first year and then ask students to make their own arrangements. A majority of students end up in crammed accommodation with four to five people living in a room with hardly any facility and loads of restrictions.
 
  
  
 
 JLL alternative business head   said, “Kolkata has become an education hub with several private engineering colleges with hundreds of students. All of them need accommodation after the first year. Students have a specific requirement. They need a furnished room with bed, desk and cupboard, an attached bath, Wi-Fi, etc.
 
 Ravindra Chamaria, who has several projects in Sector V, said, “Students from all over the country come to study Kolkata, Durgapur and Asansol. Parents spend lakhs on fees as well as accommodation.It is time student housing changed.”
