COIMBATORE: A special police team from Coimbatore on Thursday nabbed the notorious ‘Irani’ gang members, who posed as policemen to cheat elderly women of   ornaments, from Thane in Maharashtra. The city police also seized a car, two motorcycles and 41.5 sovereigns of gold ornaments from the seven-member gang.

 The gang members, identified as A Yasser Ali, A Thaki Ali, N Fairoze Ali, S Sahit Ali, H Sabeer Ali, P Aslam and R Rakesh Ravindar Sharma, hailed from Thane in Mumbai. They were involved in eight attention diversion cases in Coimbatore and four more cases in other parts of  , police commissioner K   said. 
 
 When a police team was about to nab them from a lodge at Mettupalayam, the gang escaped from there and travelled to   and Kanyakumari. A team led by special sub-inspector Marimuthu collected the information about the gang and traced their location to Thane in Mumbai. The gang was arrested with the help of Mumbai police.
 
 “Though the gang members told our police team that they had kept the gold ornaments in Thane in Maharashtra, our personnel found 41.5 sovereigns of gold ornaments hidden inside a small cabin in their   car,” Periaiah said.
 
 Posing as police personnel, the gang members used to confront elderly women wearing gold ornaments and tell them that they should not wear valuable ornaments. “They would then ask the women to remove the ornaments, wrap it in a piece of paper and switch it with a paper bundle containing pebbles,” a police officer said. 
 
 The gang had snatched a 2.5-sovereign gold chain from B Rameshkumar of RS Puram after waylaid him at Sullivan Street and threatening him at knifepoint. The gang had also cheated 72-year-old C Ponnammal of Sukrawarpet of 10 sovereigns of gold chain two weeks ago.
