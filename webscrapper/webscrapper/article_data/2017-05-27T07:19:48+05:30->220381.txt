BHUBANESWAR: More than 100 students of the   (ITER), under the  , began a hunger strike on Thursday demanding 'legally tenable' job assurances from the varsity. The students are all victims of job fraud who were handed fake appointment letters during campus recruitment in April. 

 Continuing with their protest for the second successive day, the students first laid seize to the ITER main gate and burnt the effigy of R K Hota, dean of placement at the institute, who had resigned on Wednesday. There was a bit of pushing and shoving when the police tried to remove the protesters from the place, but luckily no untoward incident occurred. 
 
 Later, the students resorted to mass hunger strike after their six-hour meeting with the university authorities ended inconclusive.
 
 "The university is trying to pass the buck on the placement agency (Delhi-based Abhay Consultancy). But fraud of such a large scale can't happen without connivance of the varsity staff. We want concrete job assurances from the university. We fear they may go back on their promises once the issue dies down," said a protesting student.
 
 Siksha 'O' Anusandhan University has set a deadline of May 31 for the students to decide whether they want to pursue MTech or MBA at the university (the cost of which would be borne by SOA) or join as teaching assistants, in which case a monthly stipend of Rs 20,000 would be given to them.
 
 But the agitating students say they have no reason to trust the university after they received the shock of their lives when the appointment letters given to them turned out to be fake. 
 
 "We want assurances on court papers which can stand the scrutiny of law that they will pay us Rs 20,000 per month for a year irrespective of when we get a job," a student said.
 
 Jyoti Ranjan Das, associate dean (students welfare) of the university said the students have been frequently changing their goalposts. "Since the university has given them three options, I request the students to stop their agitation," Das pleaded.
 
 Asked about the cost involved in hiring the placement agency, SOA insiders said the university spent around Rs 50 lakh towards consultancy fee and hospitality of the recruiters.
 
 Rachna Mukherjee, chief human resources officer of   India, one of the companies on whose behalf job offers were made to around 20 students, in a statement, said: "Schneider Electric is dismayed to learn about students being misled into believing that they had real job offers from the organisation... Schneider has not authorised agencies/partners to collect any fee for recruitment."
 
 The police have, meanwhile, launched an investigation. "We are examining various documents and trying to understand the modus operandi of the placement agency besides the role of the university authorities. We hope for an early breakthrough," twin city police commissioner Y B Khurania said.
 
 Police sources said a local representative of Abhay Consultancy, who has already been identified, is likely to be apprehended soon. "He can provide key insights on the Delhi-based agency about which very little has been known so far," a police officer said. The police are also likely to interrogate Hota and his staff soon, the officer indicated.
 
 Higher education minister Ananta Das said the government is keeping a close watch on the situation since the future of hundreds of students are involved.
 
 "We are examining what role the higher education department should play at this juncture and would take appropriate action soon," the minister said.
