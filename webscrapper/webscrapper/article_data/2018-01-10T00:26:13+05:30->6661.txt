MUMBAI: Students from Mumbai University’s Department of Law are up in arms against the decision to conduct the LLM first semester exam without completing the required number of 90 teaching days in each semester, as per the UGC criteria. 

 Members of the   of Maharashtra and Goa have intervened in the matter and sought the exams be postponed.
 
 The delay in results consumed an entire term for law aspirants as admissions started as late as October. The last   list was released in the last week of December, with the exams scheduled on January 17. 
 
 A representation of the law students’ council met the university’s examination controller last week, with a member of the Bar Council seeking their demand. The examination controller has promised to look into the demand, but there has been no official word on the same, said the student.
