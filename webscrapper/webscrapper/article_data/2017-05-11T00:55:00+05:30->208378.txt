Mangaluru: In a bid to help visually impaired students write examinations, a Bengaluru-based NGO is inviting volunteers from across the state to become scribes. Not only does the NGO want to help the visually-challenged students, but also give an opportunity for people to turn Good Samaritans. Amrutha Bindu, the NGO started by MBA graduate Prashanth N Rao has helped hundreds of visually-challenged students realise their dreams by arranging scribes who can assist them write examinations. “So far, we’ve managed to enlist more than 1,000 volunteers, based in Bengaluru, Mysuru and Belagavi. Demand for scribes is only increasing every year during various competitive examinations, and we want to ensure there are enough of them,” said Akshatha DC, coordinator for scribes at the NGO. Akshatha said that most volunteers were engineers. Highlighting the need for scribes, Akshatha added, “Once they complete matriculation and enter pre-university, they have to appear for examinations. And they need help from scribes to write these examinations. Around 30% of the visually impaired students in the state do not find scribes during examinations.” Pointing out that there were no longer any restrictions on becoming a scribe, she said, “Regardless of age, anyone who can read and write can be a scribe. However, scribes are allotted in accordance with their area of expertise as well. For instance, an arts student cannot write a commerce paper.” She added that having more volunteers meant that the organisation always had someone to fall back on during examination time. “There are times when scribes call days or hours before an exam and inform us they won’t be able to come,” Akshatha said. While scribes are paid for services tendered in states such as Tamil Nadu, that is not the case in Karnataka, said Akshatha.
