MARGAO: India's under-17 squad were back in training, preparing for the   later this year, but the familiar face of chief coach   was missing at the artificial turf ground in Margao on Tuesday .

 Curiously , after sustaining a period of controversy , the   (AIFF) announced that they had “mutually“ decided to part ways with the German coach and the official announcement came just an hour before the boys trooped out to train, this time under the watchful eyes of technical director   and  's coach education instructor and development officer,  .
 
 “We are grateful to Nicolai for his services towards development of the Indian U-17 National team and wish him all the best for his future endeavours,“ AIFF general secretary Kushal Das said in a press release, without mentioning a word of the complaint that Nicolai was allegedly accused of physically abusing the players.
 
 After disappointing results on foreign tours and home soil, the U-17 side now starts all over again under a new coach who, according to Das, “will be appointed very soon.“ On Tuesday at Fatorda, the team started with a light warm-up and was more of a fun-filled outing for the boys. Applauding and cheering each other, it was evident the boys were relieved after the long-drawn Nicolai saga.
