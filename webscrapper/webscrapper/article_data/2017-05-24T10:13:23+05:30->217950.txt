NAGPUR: The cash from   petrol pump at Bazargaon had been targeted earlier in 2011, but nothing substantial was lost, unlike on Monday when Rs16.75 lakh were snatched away from retired Wing Commander  , a contract dealer. Yadav’s house too had been the target of robbery in 2009, when a 10-member gang barged into the residence at Dabha and decamped with valuables worth Rs1.5 lakh after assaulting the family.

 On Monday, the ex-serviceman was approaching   branch at Ordnance Factory Ambajhari, within the premises of the defence colony when he was attacked. Yadav was alone while heading to deposit the cash when he was attacked by the two, who fled on a bike after snatching the cash.
 
 In both the earlier incidents, police had managed to crack the cases and round up the accused. It is a challenge now before the teams of DCP, crime (detection),  , and Zonal DCP   to ensure a detection in Yadav’s case. If sources from police department are to be believed, then it is just a matter of time before the latest case is cracked too.
 
 Several criminals on record with similar modus operandi have been rounded up by both Wadi police and crime branch for questioning. Police believe that someone close to Yadav, with knowledge of his functioning, had provided the tipoff to the perpetrators. Cyber cell of crime branch is also engaged in data analysis of calls and movements of some suspects, which has already thrown up some clues, it’s learnt.
