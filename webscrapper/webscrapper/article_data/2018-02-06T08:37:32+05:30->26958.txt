BHOPAL: A middle-aged man, known for violent outbursts, hacked his two children to death in their sleep in   town in the wee hours of Monday.   Nishad, 38, fled and is yet to be traced.

 While 16-year-old Kashish Nishad died in her bed, her brother  , 12, died in hospital, said police. Police are yet to find out what triggered Rakesh’s murderous rage. The axe he used to kill the children was found beside railway tracks about 50m from the house in Khirhni Fatak locality of Katni.
 
 Investigating officer SI   said, “Villagers say the accused worked as a labourer and was ‘eccentric’. Whenever he had a dispute with someone in the village, he would go home and beat his family. We are yet to find out why he killed the kids.”
 
 Rakesh’s wife couldn’t give any reason for the horrific attack, he said. “She said she woke up around 4am to find her husband going outside. When she asked him, he said he was going out on work. Then, she heard her children crying and groaning in the next room. She rushed over to find her daughter and son covered in blood.”
