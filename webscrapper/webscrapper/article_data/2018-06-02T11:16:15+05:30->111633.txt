MARGAO: Labour minister   on Friday said the government was attempting to bridge the skill gap between educated youth and the industry by building a talent pool through job fairs across the state. 

 Speaking at the inaugural of a state-level job fair at Sanvordem,   said the objective of such fairs was to ensure that youth get employment in Goa and do not feel the need to migrate to other states to earn their livelihood. 
 
 “The government has to be a facilitator for job creation,” said Khaunte. “Skill gap is a major problem for Goa. Goans are hardworking and sincere, but owing to the lack of sufficient opportunities, they are unemployed.”
 
 The day-long job fair, organised by the office of the commissioner of labour and employment, saw around 50 companies and over 2,000 youth in attendance. 
 
 Khaunte further said the government was providing ease of doing business for firms setting up shop in Goa through the provision of online facilities for registration, renewal, etc.
 
 “We have made it mandatory for employers to obtain NOCs from the office of the commissioner of labour and employment before they advertise for vacant posts in their organisations,” Khaunte said. “This data will help arrest the migration of Goan youth.”
 
 The minister also said the state’s focus is to provide employment to youth from mining-affected areas.
