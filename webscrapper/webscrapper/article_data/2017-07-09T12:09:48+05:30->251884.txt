CHANDIGARH: As many as 93,000 trucks will go off road on Sunday in Punjab as transporters hold a 'chakka jam' to protest against the government's move to disband   in the state, said All Punjab Truck Operators’ Union president Happy Sandhu. 

 “We will not transport   tomorrow,” he added. The state cabinet has approved the   (Regulation and Prevention of Cartelisation Rules), 2017, which bars goods carriage operators from forming cartels or unions in the state. With the the abolition of truck unions, small truck operators will suffer the most as bigger companies will take over the operations, asserted Sandhu. Moreover, freight charges will also be upped considerably following the disbanding of truck unions, Sandhu claimed.
 
 There are 134 truck unions comprising 93,000 trucks in the state, Sandhu said, adding that 70 % cent of the truck operators were engaged in the transportation of foodgrains.
 
 Sandhu blamed the   government for the scenario. “At least 4 lakh people are directly and indirectly involved in the business and they will be hit hard,” he claimed. He rubbished claims that truck unions were an impediment to investment in Punjab. “There are several areas like Ludhiana, Mandi Gobindgarh and Batala which don’t have any truck union. But then why did so many units close down in these areas?” he asked.
 
 Sandhu suggested that instead of abolishing truck unions, the government should fix minimum and maximum transportation charges.
