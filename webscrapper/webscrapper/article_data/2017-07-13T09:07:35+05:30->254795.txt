PATIALA: The   on Wednesday named former   (SAD) minister Swaran Singh Phillaur, his son Damanvir and ex-chief parliamentary secretary Avinash Chander in its charge sheet in the multi-crore synthetic drug racket run by former Arjuna Award-winning wrestler and ex-cop Jagdish Bhola.

 Although this is the fifth supplementary charge sheet to be filed in what is Punjabâ€™s biggest drug haul case, it is the first time that two prominent politicians of the state have been named. Another former SAD minister   was also questioned by ED in 2014, but his name has not been included in the charge sheet.
 
 Phillaur and Chander have been charged with laundering money generated from the drug trade. Jagjitpal Singh Sarao, special prosecutor for ED, said while Swaran Singh and his son face charges of laundering around Rs 5 crore. Chander had allegedly received Rs 45 lakh from the crime. Jagjit Singh and his brother   allegedly raised crores of rupees from the trade.
