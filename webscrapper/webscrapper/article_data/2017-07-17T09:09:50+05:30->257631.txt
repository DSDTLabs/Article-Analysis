CHANDIGARH/LUDHIANA: The   footage of Saturday’s brutal killing of Ludhiana-based pastor outside a church in Ludhiana revealed that people did not come forward to help the victim even as he lay injured for 11 minutes after the assailants pumped three bullets into him.

 The footage shows at least 11 cars, four scooterists, six cyclists and some pedestrians passing by within the span of 11 minutes from 8.36pm to 8.47pm. 
 
 Pastor  , 53, was talking on the phone at   church of   area when the killers struck.
 
 In fact, the FIR reveals that the pastor’s wife Sarabjit and son Hanuk were left to fend for themselves. 
 
 “With the help of my son and some relatives, we arranged a private vehicle to take my husband to the neighbouring DMC hospital,” said Sarabjit.
 
 Although Ludhiana police commissioner   had claimed that he reached the spot at 9.10pm, the FIR does not mention so.
