MADURAI: To prevent money flow in the forthcoming Tamil Nadu and   election, the Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Thursday suggested the constitution of a committee headed by former Supreme Court judge F M   along with few former judges of the Madras high court as members. For that it sought a response from the Bar Council of India. 

 The court also directed the income tax department to raid places of people who pump money to lure voters (advocates) and seized the money, if they get reliable information in that regard. 
 
 The division bench of justices N Kirubakaran and R Tharani heard a batch of cases that wanted to stop illegalities in the coming election that has been scheduled in March. 
 
 State’s advocate general   told the court that many reports came saying that the proposed contestants had been spending huge money for the election by distributing it to some leaders of the bar associations, taking them to Thailand, arranging holiday tours, farmhouses in East Coast Road, purchasing 600 motorcycles etc. Those things bring a bad reputation to the legal profession. The election could be monitored by constituting an independent committee, the advocate general said. 
 
  who headed the bench said, “The advocate general’s submission showed the ground reality. If everybody including the Bar Council of India agree to the formation of committee, the court will appoint the same.”
 
 When the judge asked the advocate general that if the bar council does not agree to it, what could the court do?, the former said the court has power under Article 226 to constitute a committee to monitor the election and can give power to it to disqualify a candidate who indulges in illegal activities. 
 
 Following it, the court wanted a response from the Bar Council of India and gave a direction to the income tax department.
