Yavatmal: A 60-year-old tribal was grievously injured after a tiger attacked him in broad daylight at Hivra (Barsa) in Zari tehsil under Pandharkawda forest range on Wednesday.

 The injured has been identified as Damu Bapurao Attram, a resident of Hivra (Barsa). Hivra is over 10 kms from Pandharkawda. The incident took place when a group of 10 was on its way to Pandharkawda on foot to attend a religious function. Damu could not keep pace with others and was a little behind the group when the tiger attacked. Hearing Damuâ€™s screams, others in the group rushed to his rescue. They somehow managed to scare away the tiger, which disappeared in the nearby forest area. Damu sustained deep injuries on back and head.
 
 One of the group members informed one Natwar Sharma who reached the spot with an ambulance and rushed the injured to a nearby rural hospital. After first aid, Damu was shifted to the Government Medical College and Hospital where his condition is stated to be stable.
 
 According to sources, the tribals had sighted the tiger several times near their village and informed about it to the authorities. However, forest department officials paid no attention to it.
