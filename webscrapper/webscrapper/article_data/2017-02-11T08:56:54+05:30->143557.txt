BENGALURU: Rakshitha R, a regular Metro user, was surprised to hear birds chirping as soon as she got off the train at the Cubbon Park  . Initially, she thought some birdies might have found their way into the underground station. However, to her pleasant surprise, security guards at the station told her that the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (BMRCL) had decided to play bird songs through the day at this station.

 UA Vasanth Rao, chief public relations officer, BMRC, said they are experimenting with theme-based songs for each station. “What better than a theme based of birds for a station like Cubbon Park. Sounds of around 30 birds are played on a loop every day,” he added.
 
 The BMRC otherwise plays classical and instrumental music at the stations. Since May last year, instrumental melody is being played at 30 stations. The genre includes folk, light music, Carnatic and Hindustani. The idea is to give commuters some musical relief even while they wait for the trains. 
 
 A senior BMRC official said the corporation wasn’t incurring any extra cost by playing these music. “While the music is uploaded at the operational control centre in Byappanahalli, the telecom system in the public address mode can be regulated to play the music using speakers placed at every station,” he added. 
 
 Asked if there was any plan to introduce music in the trains, another senior official said that the same may not be possible as announcements come up every 90 seconds. While BMRC operates trains every 5 to 6 minutes during peak hours, the time gap is 10-15 minutes during non-peak hours.
