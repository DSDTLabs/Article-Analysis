Singer-anchor   was in the center of a controversy on Monday, when a video of him abusing a private airline’s staffer at the   airport went viral. “Let me reach Mumbai. If I don’t strip you naked, my name is not   Narayan,” he was seen shouting (in Hindi) in the footage, apparently shot by a co-passenger. 
While Aditya remained unavailable for comment, his father, singer  , spoke to BT about the incident. He said, “Aditya is a well-behaved child, and he has never lost his patience like this before. I am sure this outburst was momentary. Having said that, I haven’t spoken to him about this issue, yet. I tried reaching out, but he didn’t answer my calls; neither did he call back later. This is the age of social media, where every act of a person is scrutinised. Even small mistakes are not spared. I am a simple man who leads a simple life. So, if people think that fame and lineage have gone to Aditya’s head, it is not true. Since I was not present there, what more can I say? I just hope people treat this as a one-off incident and forget it.” 
 The altercation apparently ensued at the airport after a female staff member of the airline told one of Aditya’s group members that they would have to pay `13,000 more for the 40 kg of excess baggage that they were carrying from Raipur to Mumbai. However, Aditya refused to pay more than `10,000. Later, the airline alleged that Aditya had used “unparliamentary language with the female staff member”, and allowed him to board the flight only after he apologised.
