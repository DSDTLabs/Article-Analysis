HYDERABAD: Despite vigilance reports and Upa Lokayukta probe, illegal buildings are mushrooming in  ,   and  . On paper,   claims it’s writing to panchayats to raze these constructions, but nothing has changed on ground. Sources said, former sarpanchs are still giving forged back-dated permissions. Builders who secured permissions are going ahead with glaring deviations, triggering clogging and fire-traps.

 Old illegal buildings mentioned in vigilance report or fresh unlawful structures have not been demolished by HMDA and panchayat raj officials in Manikonda and Narsingi, said sources. The vigilance probe of April 2015 established that of 1,390 buildings in Manikonda jagir, 244 were constructed without permission, 454 built in deviation of sanctions for additional floors. Of these 220 buildings violated norms by one storey, 186 by two, 42 buildings by three storeys and six buildings by more than three levels.
 
 
 
  
 
 In Narsingi, of 36 buildings that came up, 31 were in violation of sanctioned floors. HMDA officials said, these illegal structures have not been demolished because building owners identified in 2015 applied for Building Regularisation Scheme in November 2015 and this is pending in HC.
 
 HMDA commissioner T Chiranjeevulu said: “We have told local panchayat authorities to demolish new illegal constructions. But, they are not doing it. HMDA can only assist them. Earlier, when HDMA carried out demolitions, we are pulled up by courts.” District panchayat officer   said: “If we are given specific information, we will act. We have been demolishing illegal structures in panchayats in Hyderabad and outskirts.”
