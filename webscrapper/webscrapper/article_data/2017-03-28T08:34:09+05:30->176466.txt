NAGPUR: An 18-year-old boy was   by his uncle, who also threatened to kill him, over five months in the city. Eventually, the teenager, studying in  , got frustrated by the sustained exploitation and approached a police station to lodge an FIR against the accused on Sunday.

 The exploitation happened at the residence of the accused, identified as   (55), located in Mahatma Phule Nagar at Ajni. The teenager, a native of Arjuni-Morgaon in Gondia district, had shifted to his place on July 26 in 2016 to study. Volivkar was residing there along with his wife Savita and two children. The teenager was given a single room on the terrace. Volivkar works as a ticket checker at Ajni railway station.
 
 “Some three months after shifting, in November, Volivkar came to my room and slept besides me. Before I could understand his motives, he forced himself on me without my consent,” the teenager told cops. From then, Volivkar started exploiting the complainant frequently. Whenever he resisted, the accused threatened him to kill. As he was frightened, the youth abstained from social engagements. He used to go down from his room only to have food.
 
 On the day he filed a complaint, Volivkar had again gone to the teenager’s room and did obscene acts at 2.30pm. Finally, he decided to approach the cops. He met senior PI SS Sankhe and narrated the episode to him. Understanding the gravity of the incident, Sankhe immediately asked his staffs to register an offence of unnatural sex and   under the   (IPC).
