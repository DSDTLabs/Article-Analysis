NEW DELHI: The data on road crashes in 2015 released by two central agencies have once again exposed lack of uniformity. Though the source of both the reports are state police departments, the transport ministry claims 1.46 lakh people died in road crashes in 2015, while the home ministry estimates the number of deaths to be more than 1.48 lakh.

 Similar differences appear in the total number of crashes and persons injured during 2015. The transport research wing (TRW) of transport ministry had released the road accidents report early last year and the   (NCRB) of home ministry made it public recently.
 
 Comparison of the data from past reports also show similar differences. Sources said several rounds of discussions between officials from both the departments to have uniform details, but it has not helped so far. Raising serious question on the quality of data, the last report of   had estimated over 2.07 lakh people dying in road crashes way back in 2013.
 
 “Road accident data in our country are unreliable and are not good for any research or remedy. What is its use if data can’t be used for remedial action? We don’t include hospital data in these reports despite knowing well that most of the injured persons in road crashes are taken to hospitals," said road safety expert Rohit Baluja.
 
 Piyush Tewari of   said discrepancies in data highlight the need for a uniform data collection and scientific road crash investigation mechanism in India. “Countries that have been successful in curbing road fatalities give high priority to data collection.
 
 Such reports must also indicate the exact causes of crashes so that appropriate measures can be initiated,” said   of International Road Federation.
 
 Sources said the road transport ministry has started an exercise involving experts from IITs and WHO to revamp the format used by local police to report road crashes and forward them to TRW.
