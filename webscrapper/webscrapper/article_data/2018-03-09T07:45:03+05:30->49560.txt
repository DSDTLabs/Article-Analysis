BHOPAL: Over 1.6km of rail kept alongside railway tracks between   and Damoh railway stations has been stolen, leaving officials wondering how this heavy-duty theft was pulled off and why. 

  The   weigh over 100 tonnes - about the same as 100 compact sedans. What heightens the concern for security agencies is that the alleged kingpin, Shamim Kabadi, is suspected to have fled to  , and police can't figure out what anyone would do with track-grade steel. Melting and recasting rails is more expensive than the cost of the steel itself, and regular thieves wouldn't have the equipment or the money for this, say police. 
 
 RPF have arrested eight people from Sagar and Jabalpur districts, but are no closer to cracking the riddle. RPF officer Rohit Chaturvedi, who is investigating the case, said 60% of the stolen rails have been recovered. "I am not sure about the whereabouts of the mastermind, but our efforts are on to arrest him," said Chaturvedi. An RPF officer said they will approach Interpol to track down Shamim.
 
 "It is not clear how they intended to use the rails. The accused sold them as scrap," said Chaturvedi.
