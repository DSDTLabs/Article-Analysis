Trichy: With uncertainty prevailing over the peace talk to decide revision of wages for employees of state transport corporations, around 20 per cent of the fleets in Trichy returned to the depots in protest on Thursday night. The protest against the state government seeking revised wages was little more intense in delta districts with about 30 to 40 per cent of fleets in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts grounded. “In protest against the state government, city and mofussil buses are being taken to the 17 depots in Trichy zone. At the State Express Transport Corporation (SETC) depot at TVS tollgate, several workers did not report for duty since Thursday evening,” said S Arul Kumaran, AITUC member. As the city has several private fleets to connect various parts of the city, the strike did not affect citizens relying on city buses.  However, in Thanjavur, the common public were affected as TNSTC fleets halted services between the old bus stand and new bus stand. “We waited for more than 30 minutes but none of the TNSTC buses started their service from the old bus stand. Private bus operators were running in full capacity,” said J Aravind, a commuter at the Thanjavur old bus stand.  Though TNSTC official sources claimed that 98 per cent of the fleets were running to their respective destinations on Thursday night, AITUC sources claimed that more than 20 per cent buses did not ply in Trichy. “Number of buses participating in the protest will certainly increase on Friday morning,” an AITUC representative said.
