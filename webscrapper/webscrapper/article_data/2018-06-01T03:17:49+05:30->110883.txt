NEW DELHI: Taking a dig at Prime   after BJP’s poor showing in bypolls, chief minister Arvind   on Thursday said that “Modi is not an alternative and people   him removed”. The CM tweeted: “Today’s results show that there is an evident anger against the   government. Till now,   used to ask — what is the alternative? Now, people say Modi is not an alternative. First, remove him (sic).”

 The remarks came in the backdrop of opposition parties celebrating their “unity” against the BJP after the bypoll results. The Aam Aadmi Party, too, has warmed up to the opposition efforts — the most recent instance coming when Kejriwal attended the swearing-in ceremony of Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy. The event was attended by former UP CM Akhilesh Yadav, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and several other heavyweights.
 
 In a separate tweet, Kejriwal took another swipe at Modi, saying people were missing an “educated Prime Minister” like Manmohan Singh. “People are missing an educated PM like Dr Manmohan Singh. PM should be educated. It’s dawning on people now that the PM should be educated (CM),” Kejriwal tweeted, while posting a news report on the falling value of rupee.
