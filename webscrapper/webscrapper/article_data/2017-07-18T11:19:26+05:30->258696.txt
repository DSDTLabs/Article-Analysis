The vast expanse of the   Complex and the smaller but intricate   tucked away in the bylanes of Old City are a picture of contrast and similarity. The royal necropolis is the single largest collection of funerary structures and the final resting place of a dynasty and the Paigah Tombs too are the final resting place of an entire noble family. But while the former in being restored to its past glory , the latter lies in a state of increasing disrepair.

 Away from the chock-a block traffic of core Old City , the Paigah Tombs, also known as  , are located near the Dargah Hazrat Barhaane Shah. Intricately designed and crafted jaalis or lattices instuccoare its key architectural feature. Experts believe that the art was inspired by the Mughal architecture in the north.
 
 According to heritage expert  , it was after 1857 that the   fully asserted their independence from the Mughals. “While the lattice work in marble was done in the north, the lattice work in stucco was done here, which is unique. The tombs are intricately designed and executed,“ he said.
 
 But while the tombs complex, which is in the custody of the department of archaeology and museums (DAM), received a facelift a couple of years ago, the deterioration has begun anew.
 
 Large portions of the stucco lattice work are broken. The gaping holes in the jaalis have become larger with each passing season.Soot and patina have covered the structures.
 
 Faiz Khan, who is a member of the Paigah family , said that it was in the 1980s that the necropolis was handed over to DAM for better upkeep. The family , however, continues to be the owner.
 
 On maintenance of the heritage complex, Khan said that he had approached previous governments apprising them of the need for maintenance and conservation. However, he is yet to write to the current government.
