Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court has issued a notice to the Haryana government on a plea challenging the decision of Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP government banning beef in the state under the Haryana Gauvansh Sanrakshan and Gausamvardhan Act, 2015.

 The petitioner has argued that new law was passed by the state government without considering the views from general public and enacted in violation of the fundamental rights of the people.
 
 Justice T P S Mann of the HC has taken cognizance of the issue after hearing a petition filed by a Delhi resident C R Jaya Sukin. The state government has been asked to file its reply by May 5 on the contentions raised by the petitioner.
 
 According to the petitioner, not only are the fundamental rights violated but the change has also rendered a large number of people jobless. The petitioner also claimed that more than Rs 5,000 crore worth business was shut after the Act was implemented.
 
 As per the provisions mentioned in the Bill, the sale of beef has been completely banned in the state. The legislation has set an imprisonment for not less than three years and the same may range up to 10 years, if anyone found slaughtering of cows or selling beef, along with a fine of up to Rs 1 lakh. It also includes an additional imprisonment of up to one year, if fine not paid.
