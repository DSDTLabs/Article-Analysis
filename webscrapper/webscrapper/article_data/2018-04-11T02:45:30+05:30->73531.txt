MUMBAI: Cricket can bring political arch-rivals to a common table. NCP president   on Tuesday paid city BJP president   a visit to discuss the state of affairs in the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA), particularly in light of the stringent recommendations of the Lodha committee. 

 The visit came soon after both chief minister   and BJP president Amit Shah came down heavily on Pawar last Friday.
 
 Pawar was also learnt to have discussed the current political situation in the state and the ongoing agitation of the NCP against the BJP-led government over the agrarian crisis as well as the strained BJP-Shiv Sena relationship.
 
 Shelar only said it was a courtesy call by Mr and Mrs Pawar. A senior NCP politician said Pawar and Shelar did discuss politics but it revolved around the MCA. “It was a prolonged meeting to discuss the situation arising out of the Supreme Court decision to appoint administrators at MCA,” the politician said.
 
 Recently, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and his son Aditya visited Pawar, as did MNS chief  . A week ago, Shelar called on Pawar in Baramati.
 
 The NCP politician said that in view of the Lodha recommendations, Shelar would have to quit as MCA president. The MCA elections are in June-July. The Lodha committee had made it clear that politicians should be kept off sports organisations.
 
 An MCA meeting to amend its constitution has been convened on April 16. “Several issues of the MCA and appointment of administrators Justice   and Justice V M Kanade were discussed,” the politician said.
