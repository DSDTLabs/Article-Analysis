KOLKATA: Back in the city after helping India to win the Quadrangular Series in Potchefstroom,  , India women's team pacer   has now set her sights on the upcoming World Cup in England.

 The world's leading wicket-taker in women's ODIs believes if the Indian team plays to its potential in the   event, they can spring a surprise or two. "We had a great tournament in South Africa and were deserving champions. This will boost the confidence of our players ahead of the World Cup,"   said.
 
 Jhulan, who surpassed Australian fast bowler  's tally of 180 wickets, in the Quadrangular Series, now has 185 scalps in her kitty. Is 200 her next target?
 
 "I have never set any targets. I simply want to carry on playing and contributing handsomely to the team's cause. That remains my sole motivation. Milestones that have come along the way are a reflection of my achievements over the 15 years I have represented India," she said. The World Cup in June will be Jhulan's fourth and possibly her last. "I don't know if this will be the last (WC) but my mantra is to keep enjoying the game as long as I am fit and performing. The day I feel unfit, I will quit. If I reach the 200-wicket mark by then, it will certainly feel good. Even if I don't get there, I'll have no regrets," she added.
 
 India will face Australia, New Zealand and England in group stage of the World Cup. Talking about the team's preparation Jhulan said, "The team is in good shape. It's going to be a long tournament and we have to be mentally and physically strong to achieve our goal. We have to take one match at a time."
