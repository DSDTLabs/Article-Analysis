PANAJI: The BJP state president and   member   on Friday said the mining issue will be resolved through the court and the GFP will have no reason to not support the BJP in the   elections.

 GFP president and TCP minister Vijai Sardesai had said on Thursday that if the government did not resolve the mining issue, the GFP would rethink its support to the BJP for the Lok Sabha elections. An ordinance to restart mining is the only solution, he had told reporters.
 
  Tendulkar said that the government will not come out with an ordinance. “We will get justice in court,” he said.
 
  BJP has organised various programs to mark four years of Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre. BJP will also meet religious heads to brief them about Modi’s achievements.
