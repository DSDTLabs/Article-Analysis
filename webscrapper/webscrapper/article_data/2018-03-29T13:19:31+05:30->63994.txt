PATNA: Ruling BJP and JD (U) members on Wednesday cornered their government in the legislative council, alleging poor functioning of the   ( )’s   opened in divisional HQ towns.

 Raising the issue through a call-attention motion, BJP member Lal Babu Prasad said a large number of students from across the state come to the BSEB’s Intermediate branch office in the state capital for small corrections in their certificates or mark-sheet.
 
 “Such corrections can be made in three-four days, but students are made to wait for months to get their corrected certificates. The situation has aggravated further after the opening of regional centres as these centres are yet to start functioning properly, while the BSEB has closed all its counters at its HQ at Patna,” Prasad said.
 
 Supporting Prasad’s concern, BJP’s Nawal Kishore Yadav, JD (U)’s Dilip Kumar Choudhary, Hira Prasad Bind and others said none of the BSEB’s nine regional centres, which were opened on March 19 this year, were functioning properly.
 
 Intervening in the matter, CPI’s Kedar Nath Pandey urged the government to allow corrections in certificates from the BSEB’s main office at Patna till the regional centres became fully operative. 
 
 Council’s acting chairman Haroon Rashid said since the regional centres were opened just nine days ago, the government should consider the members’ demand in the larger interest of students.
 
 Replying on the behalf of the education department, cooperative minister Rana Randhir Singh assured the House that necessary steps would be taken to improve the functioning of the regional centres.
