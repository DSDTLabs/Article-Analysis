KOLKATA: A day after four minors were apprehended and an 18-year-old was arrested for beating up a 15-year-old boxer and her father, there is still uncertainty in the faces of the two victims. Almost a week after the incident, the father insists the past is “only for the cops to look into.”

 
 The father, a priest by profession, said his family had moved to the Sukantanagar locality a few months back and they do not wish to attract attention.
 
 “My daughter and son are into boxing. We don’t want to get into specifics but what matters is the cops are looking into the case. It is a sensitive issue,” he said. He insisted his daughter will resume practice soon.
 
 When TOI asked about his daughter’s boxing practise, the priest’s face lit up. He said his daughter is a regular at the   complex since 2012 and the braveheart has appeared for   this year. She has also represented   in 2015 and 2016, her father said. The 15-year-old, who made a brief appearance in between, insisted boxing was her love and she wanted to “concentrate” only on it.
 
 The family, however, spoke to TOI on one condition that they will not discuss the circumstances that led to the incident as the matter is still sub judice.
 
 One of the accused’s mother said: “These are minors and they could have been counselled instead of being arrested.” The relatives of a few others, who were allegedly involved, did not even agree there was something grossly wrong in assaulting the father-daughter duo.
 
 The cops at  , however,said they would ensure that justice was delivered at the earliest.
