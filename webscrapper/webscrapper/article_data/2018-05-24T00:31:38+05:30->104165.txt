 As the SI confirmed the presence of terrorists inside, the cops started moving up. Since the main door was locked, they entered from the door on the left and were caught between gunfire from the drawing room. 
 
 Inspector Sharma and head constable Balwant got hit and fell down as the terrorists dashed for the front door, firing indiscriminately. One terrorist, Atif, was hit while two, Shahzad and Ariz Khan, escaped from the back door.
