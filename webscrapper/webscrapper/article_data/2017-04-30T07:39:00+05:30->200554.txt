Tarn Taran: A day after former Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhbir Badal blamed the ruling Congress government for allegedly implicating SAD workers in fake police cases, Akali leaders in Tarn Taran on Saturday cautioned chief minister Amarinder Singh to stop pursuing vendetta politics or they would launch a statewide movement against the alleged ‘oppression’.

 “The SAD workers are called at police stations and insulted at the instigation of Congress leaders,” alleged Khadoor Sahib MP Ranjit Singh Brahmpura while talking to TOI. He said ever since the Congress had come to power, Akalis were being continuously intimidated.
 
 Citing a few examples, former Akali MLA Virsa Singh Valtoha said in the recent past the police had implicated their working committee member Dalbir Singh Jahangir, who had gone to a police station to inform about an unclaimed body recovered from his village. “One of the Akali supporters, Bira Singh, a Rai Sikh, who had held a gathering at his house during the assembly elections was thrashed and implicated in a police case and a government employee, Sandeep Singh, was also booked,” he claimed.
 
 Valtoha said they were waiting for the inquiry reports of all cases. “We apprehend that the police are also under political pressure. If we are not given justice, we will take to the street,” he said.
 
 Another former Akali MLA Harmeet Singh Sandhu said they had cautioned the Congress government to not indulge in vendetta politics. He gave instances of forcible harvesting of wheat crops of farmers aligned with the SAD by those supporting the Congress. “All such activities are being done on the directions and instructions of the Congress ministers, MLAs and workers in Punjab,” he alleged.
 
 During his visit to Amritsar on Friday, Sukhbir had also alleged of slapping of false police cases against Akalis and had asked the government to not test their patience.
