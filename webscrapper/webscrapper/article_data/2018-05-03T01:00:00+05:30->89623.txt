Vikramaditya Motwane’s upcoming directorial, '  Superhero', aims to present a new   for the common man. The vigilante drama, which also marks Harshvardhan Kapoor’s second outing, features him as a masked activist. The action-packed thriller, presented by Eros International, Phantom Films and Reliance Entertainment, revolves around a group of friends, who set out on the path of righteousness. However, a sudden turn of events change their life, leading to the emergence of the superhero. 

  says, “I’ve felt strongly about this movie for the last four years. Our story looks at what triggered a boy’s personal crusade against the system. In Harshvardhan, I found an actor having no baggage — raw and real — someone who could easily take up the challenge of being a common man as well as a masked superhero. He exhibits all the vulnerabilities of a common man — his anger, frustration and quest for change.” 
 
 Sunil Lulla, Managing Director, Eros International, adds, “There is a Bhavesh Joshi in all of us. The film is about the undeterred motivation that drives an ordinary individual to do the extraordinary.” 
 
 Co-producer Shibasish Sarkar of Reliance Entertainment says, “It is a very socially relevant film. At a time when the youth is actively participating and voicing their opinions on issues affecting the well-being of the society, 'Bhavesh Joshi Superhero' highlights a common man’s effort to make a difference in his fight against corruption.” 
 
 The teaser of the film, which was unveiled recently, has been appreciated not only by the millennials, but also by B-Town’s young brigade, including Ranveer Singh, Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan, Arjun Kapoor and Rajkummar Rao.
