HYDERABAD:  , a migrant worker from Chhattisgarh who had come to the construction site to work just three days ago, woke up to what he thought was a  . 

 Within minutes, he ran to the site near their quarters. Firing up his earthmover he began sifting through the huge mountain of mud under which six victims were trapped.
 
 "It was around 8.30am that I heard the sound. First, I thought it was an explosion or two trucks had collided on the main road. When I came out I heard the cries of the victims from under the debris. I immediately rushed to start my machine along with my helper," said Sahari, who was the first to come to their rescue. "I can till hear them crying for help," he said speaking to TOI.
 
 The workers whose lives changed forever on Monday used to clean leftover mud around pillars which could not be removed by machines. "The group used to come to clear out the mud. I thought no one would come as today is a festival. I don't know why they were made to work even on a festival day," he said.
 
 Onlookers said that the police reached the spot at around 9am and the first body could be recovered by 10.30am only. The second body was recovered by 11.30am, they said. 
 
 A watchman from a nearby building Ramanna, who rushed to help in the rescue operation, said, "I just came to check what was the sound all about and saw the ghastly scene. The iron rods that were placed vertically had been displaced and were tangled in the mud. Luckily, the other workers were working a little away from the spot where the mud came crashing down. That's why many escaped with injuries. Among the dead, Kistamma's hand was severed when the earthmover hit it."
