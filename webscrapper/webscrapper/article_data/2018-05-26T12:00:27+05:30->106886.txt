BENGALURU: Negotiations between   and JD(S) on Friday failed to hammer out an amicable solution on the   assembly seat where both parties have fielded candidates.

 
 The key negotiators, DK Shivakumar, Congress, and chief minister HD Kumaraswamy, JD(S), were to take a final decision but till late evening there was no sign of any solution. Campaigning ends in the constituency on Saturday evening and polling is slated for Monday.
 
 JD(S) argues that its candidate GH   has a good chance of winning compared to N Muniratna of Congress, who is facing allegations of malpractice. Local workers of JD(S) have threatened to work for   candidate   if the party backs Congress.
 
 On its part, Congress argues that it has no reason to give away a seat it has been occupying, notwithstanding any coalition at the state level.
 
 Massive roadshows are being held by both parties with several state-level leaders, otherwise spouting bonhomie, pointing fingers at each other. Congress has even appointed eight MLAs — one for each of the eight wards in the segment — to oversee its campaign.
