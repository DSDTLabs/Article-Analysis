MUMBAI: Around 10,000 housing societies in Mumbai and thousands more in Navi Mumbai, Thane, Pune and other cities are likely to get ownership soon of the land on which their buildings have stood for decades.

 The deemed conveyances can finally come through for them because the government, through a resolution on Monday, removed the condition of submission of occupation certificate as one of the eight documents needed to get the nod. This will help bypass developers in shifting the collective ownership of the society land to the members.
 
 Since 70% of housing societies in the city still do not own the building land, the developers are making money by selling open parking slots, renting out rooftops for hoardings and cell towers, and commercial spaces to retailers. This money can come to societies once the land ownership gets transferred through deemed conveyance to society members who own flats in the buildings. The Mumbai metropolitan region has around 70,000 housing societies.
 
 Moreover, the societies will be able to explore the extra FSI, if any, to add parking slots or other facilities in their interest. In the absence of conveyance, thousands of redevelopment and repair projects are also stuck.
 
 “In case of 40% of the societies (in the city), the ownership is stuck as they could not produce occupation certificates. Most of these buildings have been awaiting land ownership for the last 20-50 years,” said Ramesh Prabhu of the Maharashtra Societies Welfare Association, which has thousands of societies as members.
 
 Cooperative Societies Residents Association president Vinod Sampat said the BMC will eventually lose money following this decision. “The BMC earned huge sums in the form of fine. It imposes almost double the property tax and other charges on societies which do not have OCs. Bypassing OC will help many societies save money and use it for society purposes,” he said.
