LUCKNOW: Emphasising on an   situation in the state capital, DGP OP Singh asked Lucknow police to pull up their socks for the Investors' Summit slated to be held in Lucknow on February 21 and 22. 

 In a surprise meeting at Police Lines late on Wednesday evening, the DGP asked senior officials and in charge of all police stations to change their style of policing. 
 
 "We are more of a reactive police force, but the need of the hour is to be a pro-active one," Singh said, talking to TOI about the focus area of the meeting. He also stressed on the need of improving  . He said   in Lucknow needs to be manned properly to   and deployment of   at congested points has to be ensured. He added that besides the traffic police, personnel from police stations should also be engaged if needed. 
 
 Singh said the woes of the common people must be a priority of SHO and SOs. Crimes against women and children must be addressed quickly, he said, adding that senior officers must emerge as role models for juniors. 
 
 The DGP also focussed on foot patrolling as an effective way of policing.
