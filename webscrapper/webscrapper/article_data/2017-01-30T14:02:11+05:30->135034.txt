BHUBANESWAR: Hitting out at chief minister   here on Sunday, oil minister   accused him of trying to exploit the Mahanadi water-sharing dispute to garner votes instead of looking for a solution. 

 A day after Naveen shot off a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi rejecting the negotiation committee formed by the Union water resources ministry, Dharmendra said the CM is frequently changing his goalpost for political reasons.
 
 The Union minister added that during a tripartite meeting chaired by water resources minister Uma Bharti and attended by CMs of Odisha and Chhattisgarh on September 17 last year, Naveen had agreed to the solutions offered. 
 
 "Naveen made a U-turn after coming out of the meeting on the advice of a subordinate on the third floor (the chief minister's office is located on the third floor of the secretariat)," Dharmendra said. 
 
 Countering Naveen's contention that the negotiation panel has been constituted in violation of the provisions of the Inter State River Water Disputes Act, 1956, Dharmendra said the panel is only a precursor under Section 4(1) of the Act for formation of a tribunal at a later stage. "Under the Act, the Centre has to first try for negotiation. If negotiation fails, then only can a tribunal be formed," Dharmendra told mediapersons.
 
 On  's objection to inclusion of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Jharkhand in the central negotiation panel, Dharmendra pointed out that the Odisha government's water resources secretary only made these states parties in his complaint before the Centre under Section 3 of the 1956 Act (The   circulated portion of a copy of the state's complaint with the media signed by state water resources secretary Pradeep Jena in which Chhattisgarh, MP, Maharashtra and Jharkhand were listed as respondent states). The Centre only acted on the state's complaint.
 
 The BJD said Dharmendra is trying to confuse people instead of helping solve the dispute in the state's interest.
