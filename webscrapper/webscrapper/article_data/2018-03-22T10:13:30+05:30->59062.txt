CHANDIGARH: A man and a woman robbed an elderly woman of her gold ornaments after holding her hostage in her house in Sector 37 on Wednesday.

 Kamlesh Grover, 70, said the two rang her doorbell around 11.30 am. One of them inquired about rooms on rent. Grover refused to take them as tenants. After half an hour, the two came back. They told her that if she wanted to give rooms on rent to girls, they have talked to some of them residing in the same sector and they are willing to shift. The two, however, told the woman they needed to check the condition of the rooms.
 
 Grover, who was alone in the house as her husband was at his shop in  , allowed them entry. Both went to the first floor. When Grover was bargaining with the man about the rent, the woman came from the rear and held her hands. The man tied her up with a dupatta. The accused gagged her mouth with a piece of cloth. The two pushed her to the ground and took away her gold chain and earrings. They locked her in the room and fled. Grover somehow managed to remove the piece of cloth from her mouth and shouted for help. Neighbours rushed to her house and opened the lock. She told them about the incident and informed police. Grover said the man kept telling the woman to kill her.
 
 Sector 39 police registered a case under relevant sections of the IPC. Police were scrutinizing CCTV footage of the area to get clues about the accused. Police said both the accused were in their mid-40s and came on a   Activa scooter.
