While many people might rate paranthas served at   in   poorly for being too oily, but   has been a huge fan of those paranthas ever since she visited Delhi for the first time. “It was probably when I came to Delhi for the first time that my friend took me to Paranthe Wali Gali and I loved gorging on paranthas there. I would love to go there any day,” said Diana. And if you think she would be counting calories closely while having paranthas, that’s actually not the case. “I think I am blessed with genes that have kept me skinny. I love food and I don’t deprive myself, I only try and stay away from packaged food,” she said.
 
  
  
 Diana, who mostly visits Delhi for work, told us that she has some close friends staying in the city and she often goes out with them to check out new eateries. “Delhi has so many options when it comes to food. I love visiting all those cafes at   and other areas. I also love visiting people’s homes in Delhi. I have always thought that people here live extravagantly and maintain nice houses,” said the actress when we met her at a store launch in Noida.
 One of her early memories of visiting Delhi was taking a road trip from here to Agra. “If I had time, I would love to do that again – travel from Delhi to Agra and Jaipur and try food at all the dhabas there.   food is to die for,” said Diana.
