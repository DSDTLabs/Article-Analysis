AHMEDABAD: On Monday, nine Nobel laureates will be among the guests present at the inauguration of the   Exhibition by Prime Minister  . Nobel Media CEO Mattias Fyrenius talked about the planning that had gone into the event and the future of the partnership between the   and India.

  
  “Planning for the event started almost a year ago. It was a fantastic opportunity for us as what we are trying to achieve resonates well with the Indian side. The Nobel Prize Series India-2017 is the most ambitious series of events we have ever organised outside Scandinavia,” Fyrenius said.
 
 He said that the exhibitions, lectures, seminars and round-table discussions they had planned would be spread over three centres – Ahmedabad, Delhi and Bengaluru. “We have never before organised on this scale any event where nine laureates and most top officials of the Nobel Foundation would be present,” Fyrenius said.
 
  
  He further said that the rationale of organising such an event is that it would allow them to work on subjects in science and technology, research, literature and peace-related topics, that are of larger interest. 
 
 “How can that be made possible? One way is to bring the academic world, policy-makers and the business world together. This event will provide us a platform to initiate the dialogue to foster change,” Fyrenius said.The meeting of laureates with Modi on Monday is crucial, he said. “At one level, the laureates bring with them their learning and prestige. On another, they are sincerely interested in promoting ideas and fact-based reasoning,” Fyrenius said “Thus, we are trying to create a dialogue at the political level. If it can somehow affect India’s efforts in this area, we and they would both be proud.” He said that India is important in their scheme of things and they see the event as the beginning of a fruitful partnership.
