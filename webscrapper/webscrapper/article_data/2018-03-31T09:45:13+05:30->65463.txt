NAGPUR: The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in the state has decided to make a big show of strength using the occasion of party’s foundation day on April 6. The event will be held at Bandra-Kurla Complex in Mumbai.

 The party is expecting to gather around 5 lakh workers and supporters to send a clear signal across the country that there was no stopping the   juggernaut. Each district has been given a target of ferrying at least 5,000 partymen to Mumbai to attend the convention.
 
 At the eastern Vidarbha conference of important functionaries held last week in the city, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis explained the purpose of the Mumbai show. “After the BJP lost a few seats in byelections in Rajasthan and recently in Gorakhpur and Phulpur, rival parties have become active and are claiming that the party’s political fortunes were on the decline. One or two bypolls do not decide destiny of a party. The BJP is here to stay because of its commitment to development and nation-building ideology,” said Fadnavis.
 
 He said time has come to clear doubts in party workers’ minds and also to show to the country that BJP enjoyed mass support. Party functionaries were confident about large participation and said if arrangements for stay and travel were made, more party workers could join. At least 50,000 women members of the party are expected to participate.
 
 The Mumbai meet assumes more importance amid all the opposition parties trying to forge a new formation to take on the BJP at the national level and Bengal chief minister Mamata Bannerjee giving a call for ‘Modi-Mukt’ Bharat and wiping out BJP in 2019 elections.
