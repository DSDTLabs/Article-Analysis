KOLKATA: Education minister   on Thursday sent a letter addressing the Union minister of human resources and development,  , opposing the Centre's move to scrap state engineering entrance exams paving way for a central entrance test for admissions to all technology colleges. 

 The minister in his letter has requested   to reconsider its decision to start the exam from 2018. "We have argued that some of the major admission tests like the IITs have been kept out of the purview of the proposed single entrance exam. Why should it be so?" asked Chatterjee in his letter.
 
 The second point of contention is the alleged intrusion of Centre into state's jurisdiction by trying to "break" the federal structure. "The West Bengal Joint Entrance Examination Board, the nodal body conducting the JEE engineering tests, is an established agency. There is no problem in conducting the engineering exams. Why does the Centre want to disrupt an existing system?" he said. tnn
