BENGALURU: Jailed  , son of Shantinagar Congress MLA N A Haris, will have to wait for two more days to know the fate of his bail petition in the attempt-to-murder case against him.

 After conclusion of marathon arguments from both the sides, the   high court on Monday posted his petition for order on Wednesday afternoon. Justice Sreenivas Harish Kumar said in the CCTV footage made available to him by the prosecution, it is   who’s seen assaulting the victim,   L, first.
 
  
 The judge was responding to senior advocate C V Nagesh’s claim that the FIR registered by one of Vidvat’s friends, who’s an eyewitness himself, doesn’t explicitly state that the lawmaker’s son committed any act with criminal intent and which can be proved by evidence. In his submissions, Nagesh further claimed that Vidvat’s injuries were not life-threatening and he, in fact, had addressed media on February 18, a day after the alleged assault.
 
 On the controversial remark in Vidvat’s discharge summary that no untoward incident happened during treatment, Nagesh claimed it was the result of use of ‘bad language’. On Vidvat’s discharge summary details being posted on the Facebook page of the petitioner’s father, Nagesh said the information was in the public domain with a news channel telecasting it on March 5 itself.
 
 
 
 
 Nagesh termed the claim of the special public prosecutor (SPP) that Dr K Anand, who issued the discharge summary, was related to a politician close to the lawmaker, uncharitable. According to him, he’s a plastic surgeon who was the lead doctor in Vidvat’s case.
 
 He read out from the discharge summary that Vidvat’s injuries were not life-threatening as he had only suffered undisplaced hairline fracture on both nasal bones and frontal maxilla and also on ribs at lateral angles.
 
 On March 2, a city sessions court had rejected the bail petition filed by Md Haris and six others.
