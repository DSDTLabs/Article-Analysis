BENGALURU: In what could be its maiden step towards  , Bengaluru on Monday got its first   (STP) which generates 1MW of power using a   

 Chief minister Siddaramaiah inaugurated the STP of 60 million litres per day (MLD) capacity in the Koramangala-Challaghatta Valley, which will reduce sewage inflow into the heavily polluted Bellandur Lake by at least 120 MLD.
 
 The state-of-the-art plant harnesses all the sewage generated by areas between Kanakapura Road in the south and Sarjapur Road in the southeast and uses the activated sludge process with biological nutrient removal (BNR) technology to generate 1MW power. 
 
 Officials with BWSSB, which has installed the STP, said this is the first time that the water board will be using biogas to generate power. "This will be enough to meet 50% of the plant's power needs," said an official. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) assisted in the construction of this Rs 205-crore plant. The project involved laying of a 15km-long pipeline and 60km of electrical cable s and took three years to be completed. 
 
  Officials said that the the treated water from the STP will be used to fill up tanks in the parched Kolar district. The plant is equipped with the best machinery from across the world: Austrian gas engines, blowers from Hong Kong, pumps from Norway, diffusers from the US and submersible mixers from Sweden. 
 
 The contracting agency that built the plant will operate and manage it for seven years.
