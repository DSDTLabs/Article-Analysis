VADODARA: A cursory look at 50,000 kg   including unused water tanks, 15 to 20 feet pipes and   would give you a feel of a  . But the Akota stadium where all these scrap was placed on Sunday played host to a unique sculpture camp that is being sponsored by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation to make sculptures out of scrap. 

 The camp in which noted artists from the city, almost all past students of M S University's famed Faculty of Fine Arts, are participating will continue till January 14. The 25 artists will create sculptures that will be installed at prominent locations across the city. 
 
 The artists participating in the symposium which was inaugurated by state sports minister Rajendra Trivedi will also be paid an honorarium by the civic body much like other camps they attend.
 
 "The art works will be made on the theme 'Spirit of Vadodara'. And a competition to make best out of waste has already started amongst the artists," said Anuj Poddar, who is coordinating the project. 
 
 "In fact, earlier we had decided that the sculptures should be less than six feet. But now I am thinking to limit the size of the sculptures being prepared by the artists as there are even 25 feet long works being prepared!," said Poddar, who was all in praise of VMC which has initiated the first of its kind effort to rope in artists. 
 
 "This camp is also changing our perception towards the civic body. It is more professional than many corporates. Since last 20 days, we already have three trucks, two dumpers, one crane and one JCB machine at our service," he said.
 
 The idea of roping in artists for making art works that could be used by the civic body had come up while VMC was looking to spruce up its lakes and crematoriums.
 
 The stadium has been kept open for students and citizens who can come and see the artists working in the open.
