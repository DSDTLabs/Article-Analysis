PORVORIM: Panchayat minister Mauvin Godinho told the assembly on Tuesday that the government would consider framing guidelines to overcome problems faced by panchayat secretaries while issuing separate   to members of a joint family.

 Godinho, who was responding to a calling attention motion tabled by  , said,“There is no provision (under the Goa Panchayat Raj Rules) for allotment of separate   numbers in the same building. As a matter of practice, however, panchayats allot separate house numbers to such buildings if such a request is received from co-owner.”
 
 He told the House no panchayat secretary had highlighted any problems encountered in this regard. He said 27 applications for separate house numbers were pending in   and 200 in   for want of proper documents.
