 is all set to don the khaki again, after his recent outing as an assistant police commissioner in the horror-thriller Ezra. 

 This time though the actor will be seen in a more humorous avatar in debutant Dominic Arun’s yet-to-be-titled dark comedy. 
 Tovino plays Padmanabhan, who is a suspended police officer in the movie, says Dominic. “He’s a funny character and not the typical heroic cop. He is always accompanied by Balu Varghese’s character Joy who is also suspended from the police force. The shocking yet humorous instances the duo encounter are what the movie is all about,” he says. 
 
 Mumbai-based actress Neha Iyer and Shanthi will play the female leads. Dileesh Pothen, Manoj K Jayan, Vijayaraghavan and Maheshinte Prathikaram fame Achuthanandan are also part of the cast. “The film will start rolling today and will be shot extensively in Ernakulam,” Dominic adds. 
 Meanwhile, Tovino has also signed Aashiq Abu’s next and has finished shooting for his Tamil debut, helmed by B R Vijayalakshmi.
