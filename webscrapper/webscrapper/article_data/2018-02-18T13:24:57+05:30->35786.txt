BERHAMPUR: A 45-year-old man died after coming in contact with a live wire allegedly laid by poachers near Matajhari village under Ganjam district's Buguda police station limit, about 70 km from here, early on Saturday. 

 The foot of the deceased -  , a resident of the same village - caught in the live wire while he was on his way to a pond located on the outskirts of Matajhari. Angry villagers placed Kedari's body on the Buguda-Nayagarh road and blocked it to seek compensation for his kin. The agitators lifted the blockade after police and forest department officers promised to give the man's relatives Rs 10,000 from the district   fund.
 
 "We seized wires meant to electrocute wild animals," said inspector in charge of Buguda police station,  . "We are yet to identify those who laid the wire," he added.
 
 In Buguda forest range alone, 18 cases of poaching were registered last year. Of them, 10 were cases of electrocution. "Poachers mostly kill wild boars through electrocution," said forest range officer, Buguda, P K Sahu. Ten poachers were arrested in the range last year.
