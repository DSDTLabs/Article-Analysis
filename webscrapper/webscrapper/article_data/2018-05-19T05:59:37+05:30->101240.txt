MUMBAI: Six months after a 45-year-old mother of three minor children,   (45), was crushed under a   near   in  , the Govandi police shut the tree-fall case citing it an accidental death as the Daboli University report concluded that the tree was weak and termite infested. 

 
 The police said that the university findings, submitted last month, have indirectly ruled out any negligence on part of the BMC. 
 
 On December 7, 2017, Ghodeshwar, who was employed as a   in a bungalow at Gulab Baug, located on the road opposite Diamond Garden, came to work around 11am. For some reason— probably she was talking on her phone—she decided to sit on a bench near a bus stop opposite Gulab Baug. At that time, the gulmohar tree, standing on the road’s verge to her left, collapsed. She was crushed to death. The gulmohar is not a native tree variety and its roots do not appreciate moisture, said conservationists.
 
 The police registered an accidental death case and sent samples of the gulmohar to the civic garden department, but they could not conclude the reason for the tree fall. “We then sought help from Dapoli University. A team inspected the remains of the tree at the site and collected samples. In April, they sent their report stating that the tree was infested with  . So, we have now closed the case,” said a police officer. 
 
 After the incident, the Govandi police had collected over Rs 17,000 and gave it to the Ghodeshwars as the deceased had three school-going children.
