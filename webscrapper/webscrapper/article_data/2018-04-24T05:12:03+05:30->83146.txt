MUMBAI: The BMC’s decision to construct a mini sports complex and concretise parts of a sprawling playground in Mulund East for over Rs 7 crore has come under the scanner of the Bombay high court.

 Former MLA   and two local residents have filed a petition to save Sambhaji Raje Maidan, the green lung and open space spread over 19,000 sq m.
 
 Advocate Balkrishna  , counsel for the petitioners, mentioned the petition for urgent hearing on Monday before a division bench of Justices Abhay Oka and  . “Produce your decision to construct on the playground before the court,” the judges told the   and scheduled the matter for hearing on Tuesday.
 
 The playground was set up in the 1990s. In 2002, the BMC laid a musical jogging track around it. Earlier this year, the BMC published its plans to develop around 6,000 m of the ground for a mini sports complex.
 
 According to the petitioners, the plans involved setting up a football ground, skating rink, and badminton, volleyball and basket ball courts. There is also a proposal to lay another jogging track, the plea claimed.
 
 Advocate Joshi termed it a “waste of public funds” and pointed out that a skating rink constructed by BMC at a nearby ground a few years ago was lying unused. The petition has urged the court to order the BMC to halt concretisation of the ground and restore it to its former condition.
