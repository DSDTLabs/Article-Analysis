NEW DELHI: After getting bail from Delhi high court on Friday in the INX Media case,   moved a special   court seeking anticipatory bail in the   money laundering case. 

 
 Karti’s lawyer Arun Natarajan told TOI, “Yes we have moved an anticipatory bail application in which we have said that four years have passed since the chargesheet in the case was filed, but there has been no movement. There could be hasty action in the light of what has happened in the INX Media case. My client is only awitness and not an accused and he has already recorded his statement and fully cooperated. I am willing to co-operate whenever required.” 
 
 The pre-arrest bail plea, moved before the court of special judge O P Saini, is likely to be heard on Saturday. Earlier this month, the Enforcement Directorate filed an affidavit in SC alleging that Karti’s father and former Union finance minister   was part of a “conspiracy” to give FIPB (Foreign Investment Promotion Board) clearance to Aircel-Maxis by concealing facts so that the matter was not referred to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs and was cleared by the finance ministry.
 
 The affidavit stated that ED had questioned senior officials posted at FIPB at that time — including the FIPB secretary, additional secretary, deputy secretary and under secretary — who were also part of the “conspiracy”.
