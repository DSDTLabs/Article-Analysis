JAIPUR: Unlike previous years, Jaipur didn’t receive major projects in the Budget presented by chief minister Vasundhara Raje on Wednesday. Instead, the CM made allocations for a few projects and schemes for the capital that may not meet the expectations of citizens.

 In the Budget, Raje allotted Rs 20 crore for developing facilities for heart transplant at SMS Hospital in Jaipur. With the introduction of this facility, the hospital is expected to become one of the leading centres for organ transplant in north India.
 
 For the city, Raje has also proposed the establishment of skill labs for virtual training and simulator-based education in SMS Medical College. A new panchkarma centre is also proposed in Jaipur. For the city’s veterinary hospitals, the government has announced a colour doppler machine among other equipment.
 
 Giving a major facelift to Sawai Mansingh Stadium, a new astro turf will be laid for hockey at a cost of Rs 4 crore. Along with this, a meditation centre and a synthetic training track will also be constructed.
 
 An allocation of Rs 1.5 crore has also been made to install solar lamps and other construction work at Vidhyadhar Nagar Stadium and Rs 25 lakh for an indoor hall and basketball courts at Chaugan Stadium.
 
 Raje also announced setting up a learning centre at the Central Institute of Plastics Engineering and Technology. For rolling out the GST effectively, a centralized call centre and simulation centre have been proposed to be established in Jaipur.
