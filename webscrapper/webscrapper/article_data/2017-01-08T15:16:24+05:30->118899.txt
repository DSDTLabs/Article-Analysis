 10 contestant   might be having a hard time inside the house, but she has some loyal friends outside. One is actress   and the other is the latest eliminated inmate,  . Recently, the two of them met and the topic of their discussion is not difficult to guess, right?

 
 
 Since both of them are close to Bani, both had a great time catching up with each other, and Gaurav took to his Twitter account to share a picture of the same. Along with it, he wrote: When #G met #G #promises #uwereright #aurkuchh ?! Thank u for the beauty n grace , ms G @GAUAHAR_KHAN
  
 
  
 
 To this, Gauahar replied with a sweet ‘Thank You’ message. She wrote: @gauravchopraa thank YOU ... 🙏🌼... N you all that I say it for... Was lovely meeting you , the other G!!!!🙄🙄🙄😝...
