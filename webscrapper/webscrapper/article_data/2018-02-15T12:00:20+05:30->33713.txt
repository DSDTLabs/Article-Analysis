PUNE: The city   has undertaken a special drive to recover pending fines for the past six months from city motorists.

 The fines had been slapped on them through the CCTV camera monitoring system. Police have so far collected Rs 30.52 lakh from 8,330 motorists since February 6 this year. 
 
 However, fines worth around Rs 10 crore are pending from them. Under the drive, motorists are stopped and the vehicle registration number is entered into a mobile phone application ‘e-challan’ to see if they have some pending fines.
 
 Many motorists have not paid fines despite receiving timely messages from the city traffic branch, police said.
 
 Deputy commissioner of police (traffic)   said that the drive is undertaken for two hours every day since February 6. Police personnel are equipped with software which shows pending fines. 
 
 The drive was undertaken to recover fines for the offences committed by motorists. Police have a data base of motorists which is linked to their cell phone numbers. 
 
 If a motorist is found to be breaking traffic norms on the CCTV feed, the grab of the incident is taken and a text is sent to the offender. 
 
 The motorist is asked to pay the fine using online method or by visiting the nearest traffic police division.
