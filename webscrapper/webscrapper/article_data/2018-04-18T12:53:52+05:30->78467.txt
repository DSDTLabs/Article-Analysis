Oh yes, you read that right.   will be doing a new show titled,  ? which will be telecast on a recently launch Tamil channel. This show narrates beautiful stories through soulful songs. “It is one-of-a-kind show in Tamil television... more like doing musicals on television,” begins Madhan Karky, whose online music portal company DooPaaDoo is producing this. 

 He says, “Anup from the channel and I were discussing about doing something new. And that’s when we presented this concept to them. The unique thing about this show is that every day, there will be new stories presented to the audience. We have so many budding lyricists, music composers and filmmakers, and they will be composing and shooting the song. It will be a 30-minute show, where the story will be narrated through three or four songs.” The team has identified almost 25 budding filmmakers to direct the songs. 
 
 “This will give an opportunity to a whole new set of people from different fields. We have stories ready for the next 30-40 episodes,” he says, adding, “There will be minimal dialogues. Primarily, we want to promote Tamil folk songs. There will be almost zilch western music. I won’t be writing any songs or hosting the programme. In fact, there is no host. I will only be taking care of the production side along with the channel.”
