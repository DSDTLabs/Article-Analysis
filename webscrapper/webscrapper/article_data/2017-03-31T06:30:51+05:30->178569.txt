LUCKNOW: Every corporator in the city will now have an additional Rs 15 lakh for their ward’s development, taking their total funds to Rs 85 lakh.

 The corporators have been long insisting that their limit of ward development fund be increased to Rs 1 crore. However, LMC did not have much funds. 
 
 In FY2016’s budget, the executive committee increased the allocation per ward from Rs 60 lakh to Rs 70 lakh. It also provided for Rs 10 lakh extra per ward for emergency construction, on the discretion of the municipal commissioner.
