PANAJI:The directorate of health services (DHS) aims to achieve â€œzero   transmission - annual parasite incidence (API) of less than 1 - by 2020, but it is a mammoth task. The biggest challenge for Goa would be to sustain a API level of less than 1 till 2027, when 10 other states in the country reach the same level as Goa, said deputy director, national vector-borne disease control programme, Dr Anant Palekar.

  
 
 Palekar said, in 2016, they had identified eight high-risk areas with API of more than 1, but they succeded in bringing the number to four in 2017.
 
 Four areas that remain on the list of DHS are Siolim, Margao, Bicholim and Candolim. Bicholim will be the easiest target to achieve, Palekar said.
 
 When DHS speaks about achieving the target of zero malaria transmission and malaria deaths by 2020, it means there will be zero indigenous cases.
 
 When a malaria case is reported from any particular area, the health officials determine the source of infection. If it is found to be an imported infection, where a person suffering from malaria picked up the disease while he was away from Goa, it will be termed as a non-indigenous one.
 
 The incidence of malaria in Goa has drastically reduced during the last few years, yet the DHS will have to work hard in high-risk areas.
