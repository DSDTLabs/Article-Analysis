For the first time in decades, the slender- billed gull was sighted at a reservoir in   district recently. The bird was photographed and identified as Slender-billed Gull (Chroicocephalus genei) by two amateur naturalists, Srikanth Bhamidipati from Hyderabad and   from Bangalore.This bird which usually breeds in   and north of the western   is not a usual visitor for the deccan. It is known to stop by on some parts of Indian coastline during winter but has been spotted for the first time in  . “It was difficult to identify the bird among 30 Brown-headed Gulls and Black-headed Gulls. But, the lack of black ear-covert patch, longish neck, long and slender bill were some striking features which helped us identify this gull,” says Sampada.

 “As a part of Asian waterfowl census we visited various sites in AP and Telangana. This location gave us a huge surprise. This finding shows the importance of unprotected wetlands for survival of rare species” says Srikanth.
