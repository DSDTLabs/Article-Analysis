MUMBAI: The city is preparing to welcome the warmth of the   bonfire, the blessings of til laddoos and the aroma of sweet   rice.

 Friday will usher in a series of winter harvest festivals starting with Lohri, and  , Pongal and   on Saturday. All these festivals acknowledge a debt of gratitude to the sun god for his sustenance.
 
 Housing societies, particularly in Sion Koliwada, GTB Nagar, Bandra, Khar and Andheri, will light the Lohri bonfire on Friday night. “People circumambulate the fire and make harvest offerings such as revdi, popcorn and coconut. Lohri is not a religious festival, but one the Punjabi community celebrates,” says Sardar Himmat Singh, secretary of the   in GTB Nagar.
 
 Makar Sankranti marks Uttarayan or the entry of the sun into Capricorn. “Maharashtrians prepare brown, hard til laddoos with jaggery, while Sindhis make soft malleable laddoos with white sesame, gulkand, rose petals, raisins and pistachio nuts,” says Andheri homemaker Bhagwanti Rai. She bought 500gm box of til laddoos for Rs 140 on Thursday. Sindhis also offer a meal of sweet saffron rice, sai bhaji, radish, carrot and til sweets to little girls on this day.
 
 This year, the favourite motif on kites for Makar Sankranti features Prime Minister Narendra Modi amid a cache of demonetised currency and the new Rs 2,000 notes. “But business is bad. I hope the promise of ‘achhe din’ does not turn out to be a kite-flying exercise,” laughs Sharad Sane, who sells kites near Crawford Market.
 
 On Saturday, Tamilian households will cook pongal rice using rice, milk, sugarcane, jaggery and cardamom.
