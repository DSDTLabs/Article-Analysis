NEW DELHI: The   polls seems to have bucked the trend this year of electing candidates from Jat and Gujjar backgrounds or voting taking place based on regionalism and caste. A   from Kargil, Khadim Hussain, won the post of the college vice-president despite alleged threats received from other candidates who saw him as an ‘outsider’.

 A total of 2,069 students of the eligible 4,600 exercised their franchise in an election held amidst tight security. The college had earlier requested the election committee to “provide better equipment for quick voting” because of “recent cases of violence in the campus.”
 
 Khadim, an   wing cadet, is pursuing BSc (applied life science) at the college. He had earlier alleged that his friend had been kidnapped by locals to stop him from filing his nomination. There was also an alleged attempt by the proposer of another candidate to snatch his identity card.
 
 Scared of going to the college after these incidents, Khadim stuck to campaigning on social media. He had even tried to lodge a police complaint that he had been receiving threats to his life.
 
 A teacher of the college, on the condition of anonymity, said, “The students who come from nearby villages consider the college election a battle of prestige, which can help further their political careers. So, it was natural that they would feel threatened by a Kashmiri.” After the results were announced, Khalid was escorted out by cops for fear of violence against him, the teacher added.
