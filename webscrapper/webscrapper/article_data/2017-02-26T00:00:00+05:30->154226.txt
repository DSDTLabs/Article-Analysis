Prithviraj has often led the way for the Malayalam film industry and his recent social media post, lauding his co-star’s “incredible courage” to get back to films after an assault and also apologising for misogynist movies he’s been part of, has now won him praises for taking a stand.

  The actor, who began the shoot for his next film Adam on Saturday in Fort Kochi along with the actress, took to his social networking page to publish a powerful post. “Today… as my dear friend walks in to the sets to kick start the shooting of her new film Adam, I once again bear witness to an extraordinary moment of courage from an extraordinary woman in my life! Today… she makes a statement that will echo through time, space and gender... that no one or no incident has control over your life but YOU! A statement that you my friend... are making in a million unheard voices!” he wrote.
 
  The actor continued while making a pivotal and even a landmark decision in the career of a Malayalam superstar. “And to those voices I apologise... for at an age and time when I wasn’t wise enough… I have been part of films that celebrated misogyny. I have mouthed lines that vilified regard for your self-respect and I have taken a bow to the claps that ensued. NEVER AGAIN… never again will I let disrespect for women be celebrated in my movies! Yes… I’m an actor and this is my craft! I will wholeheartedly trudge the grey and black with characters that possess unhinged moral compasses... but I will never let these men be glorified or their actions justified on screen,” wrote Prithviraj, while signing off by saying that he will forever be a fan boy of his co-star.
