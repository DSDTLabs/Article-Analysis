Unfortunately, the car I was in did go off track for a while. There are no roads, so you don’t even have a route to follow. The team finally had to send us their location and after battling some network issues, we found our way back,” says Pranitha. The song, Deepave Ninna, has been composed by   and sung by   and  .
