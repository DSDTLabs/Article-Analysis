AURANGABAD: The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited ( ) is yet to arrive at a decision on the demands made by consumers for increasing the time limit for   of meter reading by a couple of days.

 The facility — part of the state power utility’s recently introduced mobile application — enables consumers to submit meter reading on their own to avoid receiving average billing.
 
 As per the current system, system generated SMS is sent to registered mobile number of consumers to make self-submission of meter reading within 48-hours. And the consumers want the time frame to be increased to four days.
 
 When contacted,  , central public relation officer of MSEDCL, said the demand will be discussed by top officials. “The MSEDCL aims to deliver consumer-centric functioning and mobile application is part of fulfilling such objective. Consumer’s feedback on time-limit for self-submission has been already submitted to the top-brass,” he said, adding the official stand on the demand would be declared by this week.
 
 A section of consumers, which has downloaded MSEDCL’s mobile application, said they effectively get lesser time in hand to complete formalities. “The system-generated message arrives by evening, asking for self-submission by the next day. This gives us only one day in hand. The MSEDCL should increase the time limit,” said  , an IT professional based in Pune.
