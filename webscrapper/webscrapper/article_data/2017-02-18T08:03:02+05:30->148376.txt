PUNE: The   ( ) is planning to increase the fine levied on   paan   booming in Camp over the years. 

 Some of the shops date back to 1985, when PCB issued around 150 11-month licenses to run the business. 
 
 Officials said that at the time, veterans of 1965 and 1971 wars were given priority in the allocation process. But the licenses were not renewed once the period got over.
 
 Instead, PCB levid a damage charge of Rs 250 against running the shops beyond permitted time. The same was charged from hundreds of other   shops that cropped up in the area mostly on encroached land. Some had even come up near educational institutions.
 
 “We estimate that there are around 500 illegal paan shops in the Cantonment area. Around 50 are located near schools and colleges. This is prohibited because these shops also sell tobacco products,” said a senior PCB official.
 
 Board officials said they would conduct a survey to find out whether damage charges should be increased. They added that while the fine would remain the same for most, violators in busy commercial districts and those near hospitals and educational institutions would have their charges ramped up.
 
 The shop owners, licensed in 1985 or otherwise, feel PCB’s actions are unfair and that they should be regularised.
 
 “I have been running this stall for over two decades. Rather than fining us every month, they should regularise our stalls giving us licenses. The harassment and threats of encroachment must end. The   has regularised a lot of hawkers. The   should do the same,” said Zaheer Shaikh, a paan shop owner in the Sadar Bazaar neighbourhood.
 
 PCB officials, however, said regularisation was off the table. “There are no provisions for regularising hawkers or encroaching commercial establishments in the Cantonment Act or byelaws,” a senior board official addded.
