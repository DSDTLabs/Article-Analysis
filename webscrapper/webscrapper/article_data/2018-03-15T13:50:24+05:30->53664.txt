MADURAI: The   Madurai bench on Wednesday impleaded officials of the forest department of Madurai in a case alleging irregularities in construction work at   hills.

 One Eswari Sundarapandian from   filed a case. Her counsel told the court that the commissioner of Hindu religious and charitable endowment (HR&CE) department in 2015 floated a tender to construct four rooms and 50 toilets at Sadhuragiri hills, a pilgrimage centre in the Western Ghats. 
 
 The tender clearly stated that the successful bidder should purchase building materials from the recognised quarries. But, the bidder quarried blue metals and sand from the hill itself. 
 
 When this issue was taken to the notice of the Madurai district collector, he said that the authorities collected Rs 79,000 as fine from the contractor. Thereafter, the issue was taken to the notice of the court which in turn on December 22, 2016 ordered probe into the issue and take action in one month. 
 
 But, there was no action on their part. When the issue was taken to the court again, the collector passed an order on the basis of forest authorities’ report stating that there was no wrong in the construction work. The report was not given to the petitioner. It was not known what the forest authorities had told in their report. Hence, the collector’s order should be quashed, the counsel prayed. 
 
 Following it, the court impleaded the authorities in the case and adjourned the case to March 22.
