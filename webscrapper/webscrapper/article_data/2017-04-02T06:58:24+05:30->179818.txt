SASARAM: As obtaining   in Bihar is a tough ask, people from the state are procuring the same from   states, especially Nagaland, with the help of their agents, sources said.
 
  “One can obtain arms licence from north-eastern states within one month of submission of application. It’s a hassle-free exercise in north-eastern parts of the country. People from Rohtas, Kaimur, Bhojpur and Buxar districts are making a beeline for these states, especially Nagaland, to obtain arms licences,” sources said.
  
  “Around 3,000 applications for arms licences are pending in these four districts. People here treat weapon as their status symbol. When they fail to get one from their native district, they use agents to procure the licence from north-eastern states,” said a source, adding such people show themselves as   of the states where they submit the application.
  
  Rohtas arms magistrate Sanjay Kumar said several people have approached the department concerned in the recent past for entry of the details of arms which they managed to purchase on the basis of licence issued from Nagaland. “We verify the licences from the issuing districts and seek  . Police verification is also done before the request is accepted,” said Kumar.
  
  Buxar arms magistrate Anupma Singh too confirmed having received such requests. “We are getting applications from people who have got arms licences from Nagaland,” she said.
  
  Many people, who have managed to procure arms licences from Nagaland through agents, said tedious processes in Bihar forced them to shift to north-eastern states. “I got the licence within one month of submitting the application. I showed myself as the temporary resident of  ,” said one of the licence holders, adding Nagaland issues national permit for arms.
