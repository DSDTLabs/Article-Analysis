NEW DELHI: The government on Friday said a 5 per cent uniform rate of GST will apply on all railway catering services in trains or on stations. 

 "With a view to remove any doubt or uncertainty in the matter and bring uniformity in the rate of GST applicable to supply of food and drinks made available in trains, platforms or stations, it has been clarified with the approval of the competent authority that the GST rate on supply of food and drinks by the Indian Railways or Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) or their licensees, whether in trains or at platforms (static units), will be 5 per cent without input tax credit," a finance ministry statement said. 
 
 In a letter to the Railways, the finance ministry said different GST rates are being applied for mobile and static catering.
