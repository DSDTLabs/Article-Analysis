MUMBAI: Milind  , vice-president of the Maharashtra Housing Area Development Authority ( ), will hold additional charge of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB).

 A chemical engineer by training, he was brought in place of environment secretary Satish Gavai following a June order of the  , principal bench, that the MPCB chief cease to function as chairman as he was not qualified.
 
 While MPCB filed a special leave petition before the Supreme Court challenging the NGT’s jurisdiction, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis directed that Mhaiskar hold additional charge.
 
 “He (Mhaiskar) has been a former member-secretary of MPCB and is well-qualified. We have filed a plea before the SC, but to ensure that the board’s functioning is not affected, Mhaiskar will hold additional charge,” said P Anbalagan, member-secretary, MPCB.
 
 Mhaiskar is expected to take charge on Tuesday.
 
 The   order was issued in a plea filed by Rajendra Singh Bhandari, who had filed a writ petition in the Uttarakhand high court in 2013. Bhandari had said that individuals who do not qualify under the terms of Section 4 of water (prevention & control) rules of the Pollution Act, 1974, and Section 5 of the Air (Prevention & Control) of Pollution Act, 1981, were being appointed as board chairmen and member secretaries. 
 
 The court then directed him to move the tribunal. Bhandari pointed out that persons manning important posts of the state pollution control board, which implements provisions of the water and air Acts, were not eligible as they do not have special knowledge nor practical experience in the field of environment protection and pollution control. The plea was expanded to include all state pollution control boards.
 
 The order is also applicable to chairmen of pollution boards in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Kerala, Manipur, Sikkim, Telangana and Rajasthan.
