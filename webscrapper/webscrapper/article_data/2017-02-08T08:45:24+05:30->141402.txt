MUMBAI: The BMC on Tuesday began the process of taking over amenity space--almost 3,000 sqm--that was in the possession of a  . The move follows a notice to the BMC by Lokayukta last December, asking it to reclaim the plot marked as open space from   Hotel.

 Corporator  , who has been pursuing the issue since 2013 said that this was only a half-hearted attempt to reclaim the space.“The BMC is taking back only 2,988 sq m of space from the hotel. There is another 3,000 sq m of space where the hotel has placed chillers. The amenity space order is, however, still a victory for residents who had been fighting to get back the space from private possession,“ said Miranda, adding that the fight with the BMC to get back the space was a tough one.
 
 A BMC inspection in the past had revealed that Grand Hyatt, owned by  , had misused the basement which was meant to be a parking lot as well.
 
 Prashant Gaikwad, assistant municipal commissioner of H-East ward confirmed taking back the space and said the development plan department is involved in the process.
