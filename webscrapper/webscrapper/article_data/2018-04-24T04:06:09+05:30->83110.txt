MUMBAI: Two weeks after Customs officials arrested Pune-based importer Prasad Kulkarni for allegedly importing restricted air guns by declaring them as   and submitting bogus certificates of various sports bodies and government of India to evade custom duty and claimed huge duty drawbacks, a metropolitan magistrate released him on a cash bail of Rs 5 lakh. Kulkarniâ€™s counsel Sujay Kantawala argued in court that there was no need for the customs department to arrest his client as Rs 73 lakh   had been deposited and a petition filed in the Bombay high court challenging the arrest.
