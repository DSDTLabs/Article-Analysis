ZIRAKPUR: Those waterlogged sections of last year have reappeared on the national highway and internal roads of this town’s   and VIP Road areas. Again, the streets and the complaint boxes of the municipal council are flooded after rain.

 The problem has stood for years. Manoj Das of Gazipur said the potholed internal roads became riskier after showers because it was difficult to spot the dented surface under murky water. “When the potholes are a clear risk to the two-wheeler riders, why don’t they finish road repair before the annual predictable cycle of spring and monsoon rains?” he said. “Where do they spend taxpayers’ money?
 
  resident   said the road condition had not improved in a year. “The main issue for this damage is that a drainage system is not in place. When water gets no exit, it accumulates and breaks the surface,” he said. “After every downpour, our roads become rivers.”
 
  of Zirakpur said one of the worst flooding was on a cut on national highway near  , where logjams are routine. He said the residents had filed many futile requests for proper sewerage to clear the water quickly. Complaints about water accumulation were also received from the   village of Chandigarh.
