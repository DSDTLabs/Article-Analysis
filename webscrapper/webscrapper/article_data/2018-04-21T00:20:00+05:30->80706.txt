Madurai: A barge bound for Gujarat from Odisha was stranded off the Pamban railway bridge after it was caught in a strong current on Friday.

 On Friday afternoon, the Scherzerâ€™s span on the Pamban rail bridge was opened to allow ferry traffic. Two barges from Goa to Kolkata and a tug boat from Kudankulam to Kattupalli port in Chennai navigated through the stretch.
 
 When the third barge from Odisha attempted to cross the bridge, it was caught in the sea current flowing in the opposite direction, and could not navigate through the span, according to Pamban port sources.
 
 With the aid of country boat fishermen from Pamban, the barge was pulled to safety. Considering that the sea will remain rough in the next two days, the barge has been secured with anchors five nautical miles away from shore.
 
 Port conservator Kannan said the barge will be allowed to cross the bridge once the weather turns favourable.
