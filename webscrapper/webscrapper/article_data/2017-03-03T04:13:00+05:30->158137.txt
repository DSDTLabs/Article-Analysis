Ahmedabad: The decision to allow additional PG seats was taken in just over a fortnight. The Medical Council of India (MCI) had issued a notification on January 30 which said that the professor-to-student ratio for PG courses had been changed from 1:2 to 1:3. In the case of assistant professors, the teacher-student ratio was raised from 1:1 to 1:2. 

 Within 5 days of the notification, the MCI sought details of medical staff from colleges across the country, based on which the current hike in seats in PG courses was permitted. In the case of government colleges across the country, the MCI had allowed an increase of 1,358 seats based on these details about teaching staff.
 
 Each postgraduate course in self-financed colleges costs anywhere between Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1.5 crore. In government-run colleges, such courses are free and over Rs 4,20,000 per month is given to PG students as stipend. This is the first time that PG medical admissions will be conducted on the basis of all India PG-NEET tests. Earlier these admissions were conducted by the respective universities.
 
 A cursory glance of the list reveals an increase of 6 seats in radio diagnosis; 5 in anesthesiology; 7 in dermatology and venereology and leprosy; 1 in psychiatry; 10 for MS in ENT; 17 in general medicine; 15 in general surgery and 7 seats in obstetrics and gynecology.
 
 In Gujarat, there are currently 1,200 PG seats. A maximum number of these seats are in BJ Medical College and AMC-run NHL medical college in Ahmedabad. In postgraduate courses, 50% seats are reserved for students from other states while the rest are for Gujarat students. In Ahmedabad, 12 seats have been increased in PG courses; 24 in Bhavnagar; 23 in Rajkot, and 15 seats in Surat.
