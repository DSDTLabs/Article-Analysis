BHOPAL: Speaker   had to adjourn the House twice on Tuesday during question hour after heated exchanges between Congress and BJP over an adjournment motion to debate the suicide of  .

 LoP   told the Speaker that he had given a notice for an immediate adjournment motion. Discussion and all business of the House should be stalled for the debate.
 
 
 Minister for legislative affairs   said that the matter could be taken up during the Zero Hour. “In any case, the notice for the adjournment motion was given at around 9 am today.” Speaker Sharma said, “Let the question hour continue and suicide could be taken up during the Zero Hour.” However, Ajay Singh did not agree. He said, “This is an important matter, there is no question of waiting.”
 
 Thereafter, ruling party members led by several ministers started a ruckus.
 
 “You must listen to the government too,” Narottam Mishra told the Speaker.
 
 Home minister   intervened and came to Rampal Singh’s defence saying, “The issue which the LoP has raised and the incident he is talking about is unfortunate. We are sad, but police investigation is on and before the report comes we cannot accuse anyone without evidence.” In immediate retaliation, senior Congress MLA Mukesh Nayk said, “What is left for a probe when everything is crystal clear.”
 
 Narottam said, “The assembly has been in session for 15 days but no one raised the issue of Congress MLA Hemant Katare and his alleged exploitation of a woman.” Ajay Singh protested and argued that Mishra was trying to divert a serious issue. “Why has no FIR been registered till now?” he asked. As the ruckus intensified, Speaker adjourned the House for ten minutes. As ruckus continued when House reassembled, Speaker adjourned the House for the second time till 12 noon.
