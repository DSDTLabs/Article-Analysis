 and  , who play saas and bahu respectively in the show ' ', have become a source of gossip for people on the set. The two are not on talking terms and what led to this was something very trivial. Apparently, one day when Shubhangi and Namrata were on the set, a fellow co-actor joked about Shubhangi’s upcoming performance in a play. Says a source, “Shubhangi did not get the joke and gave a reply which was out-of-context, which added to the laughter. Like others, Namrata too laughed at it. Shubhangi felt Namrata should have been more sensitive and not laughed along with the others and got upset with her.”

 This incident created a rift between the two. When we spoke to Namrata about it, she clarified, “First of all, I did not crack the joke. Yet, Shubhangi came to me saying that she was offended. We had a discussion that day and I remember apologising to her, but she did not budge. So, I told her that I would not like to speak to her if she felt that I intentionally offended her. I respect Shubhangi, but I think she has stretched this too far.”
 
 Shubhangi, on the other hand, says, “I never asked Namrata to apologise. She unnecessarily took it upon herself. And then she said she did not want 
 to talk to me. So how could I ask her to speak to me again? Anyway, professionally, I think it’s better we focus on our work rather than indulge in such things.”
