VADODARA: If you visit the   (RBI) headquarters in Mumbai, you will be greeted by a huge mural on its wall. The elegant mural has been prepared by a Barodian with the help of two Mumbai-based artists. The work done by Sandip Pisalkar along with   and Shekhar Khanzode has been drawing lot of attention in India’s central bank. 

 “RBI had been looking for artists who could prepare the mural for its headquarters at Fort area in Mumbai. We learnt about the project about six months ago from RBI’s website following which we approached them. They asked us to send photos of our works and some documents. Once selected, we were asked to send samples of the artwork we had planned for the RBI premises,” Sandip, 35, told TOI. 
 
 It took the trio months to prepare the mural that is made of fiber glass and steel panels. The trio made the mural in Mumbai and then installed it on the wall in RBI premises in December last year. It took them 20 days to install the artwork. “The idea was to prepare an artwork on the theme of RBI. So the mural sports RBI logo, old RBI building, industrial buildings, farmers and people that are connected with the bank,” Sandip said. 
 
 As irony would have it, the RBI artwork project got delayed by few weeks due to demonetisation. “There was bit of uncertainty due to non-availability of cash to pay for material. But once finished the project, the RBI was all praises for the artwork. In fact, they gave us three more projects,” Sandip, who completed his   (sculpture) from fine arts faculty of M  , added. Sandip, Praveen, 35 and Shekhar, 37 are all alumni of   of Arts.
