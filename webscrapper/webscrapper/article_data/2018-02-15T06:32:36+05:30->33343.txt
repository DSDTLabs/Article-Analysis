CHENNAI:   can often appear to be an immovable object to exasperated members of the public. On occasion, though, immovable objects get the better of the civic body. 

 Unable to trace the owner of a sedan abandoned in Natesa Nagar, Virugambakkam, on Sunday night, a corporation-commissioned contractor giving the road a new top had his workers tar the stretch around the car, leaving a roughly 16ftx6ft spot where the car was parked untouched.
 
 Ramesh S, a resident, quoted a supervisor for the contractor as saying he did not have any "legal right to move" the car. "The man told me that he had to 'complete the road work on schedule,'" Ramesh said.
 
 Till Wednesday evening, the corporation appeared to be as flummoxed about the car - and the contractor's decision to lay the new top around it - as residents were bemused by the development.
 
 Junior staff members at the Zone 10 office weren't sure if they could persuade the contractor to return and complete the job.
 
 Later in the day, however, corporation executive engineer   said the civic body fix the patch on Thursday. The car was removed by the evening. "We will ensure the work is completed by Thursday," he said.
 
 But residents aren't so sanguine that the corporation will fix the problem so fast. They fear corporation employees will remove the car and leave the sunken spot as it is to save themselves the trouble. And they can't believe that the corporation would allow a contractor to get away with such an absurd approach to the job.
 
 "This is irrational," said   former general secretary M Natarajan. "The owner parked it there illegally. The corporation is spending thousands of rupees only to leave us with this absurd patch. Will the [corporation] council pay the contractor again to resurface it?"
