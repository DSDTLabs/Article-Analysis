INDORE: In a letter written to the   of India, Prime Minister and the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, a city girl has complained against the in-charge of women’s police station and another   for allegedly humiliating her and refusing to register a complaint against her former live-in partner.

 The letter petition, filed through advocate Krishna Kumar Kunhare, has sought action against women police station in-charge Jyoti Sharma and ASI Usha Pawar for refusing to register her complaint of rape despite repeated applications and visits to the police station.
 
 “In the letter, the girl, a resident of   has alleged that while she was kept waiting at the police station, the female police officers at the women’s police station scorned at her and stared at her in a humiliating way refusing to register an FIR despite repeated pleadings,” Kunhare said.
 
 The victim had sought for a case to be registered against  , a resident of Scheme number 78, with whom she had been in a live in-relationship for three years. During this period, she has claimed that the accused promised to marry her and raped her multiple times.
 
 She has also claimed that the accused also mistreated her and did not provide food to her for many days, due to which she allegedly developed calcium deficiency and epilepsy. When she could not bear the mistreatment and the lack of proper medical care, she left the accused’s place and started living as PG.
 
 The accused then ended all ties with her and when she sought to file a complaint against him at the women’s police station, she was humiliated there. However, later she put her grievance before the DIG, who asked her to register FIR at the Vijay Nagar police station.
 
 “The FIR was registered on February 28 and the victim’s medical test was done the next day. The victim recorded her statements before the court on Thursday, fearing that something might happen to her during the pendency of the trial,” Kunhare added.
