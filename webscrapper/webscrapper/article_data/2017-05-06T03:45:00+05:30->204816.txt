PANAJI: Private liquid petroleum gas distribution company,  , wants to bring the days of the drab and heavy metal LPG cylinders to an end with the introduction of composite fibre cylinders in Goa and North Karnataka.

 The composite polymer cylinders are expected to reduce cylinder explosions and will also literally bring transparency to gas supply. The fibre cylinders will have a transparent component for consumers to verify the quantity of LPG supplied.
 
 “Unlike the regular steel cylinders that are heavy and prone to explosion, these new fibre gas cylinders or composite cooking gas cylinders are transparent and safer. They do not explode even when there is a gas leak or fire accident as these cylinders are made of fibreglass,” gas distributor and proprietor of Gas Kart logistics, Murali, said.
 
 The lightweight LPG cylinders will be launched in Goa on May 6 and are currently being manufactured for Bengaluru-based Indogas company and the gas is being filled at Ramnagar in Londa near Belagavi.
 
 Gas Kart is the distributor for the gas cylinders in Belagavi, Dharwad and Goa. Supreme Industries will manufacture the composite fibre gas cylinders, Murali said.
 
 The cylinders will be sold in capacities of 2kg, 5kg, 10kg and 12kg of cooking gas, with plans for a 15kg gas cylinder for resorts and restaurants on the anvil, Murali said.
 
 “Existing customers of Indogas and even Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) and   (HPCL) can migrate to Indogas through an online application. A one-time fee of Rs 5,500 for a 12kg domestic cylinder will have to be paid for the cylinder,” Murali said.
 
 Currently, HPCL and BPCL have no plans to introduce fibre cylinders in Goa.
 
 The lightweight LPG cylinders will be launched today and are currently being manufactured for Bengaluru-based Indogas. The gas is being filled at Ramnagar in Londa
