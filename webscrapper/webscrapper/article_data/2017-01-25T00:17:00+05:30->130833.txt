Bhopal:   Anil Dhasmana on Monday advised top IPS officers of   police to keep a close watch on financial transactions made from Nepal and adjoining countries.

 A 1981 batch IPS officer of MP cadre, Dhasmana had an informal interaction with the officers during his short and personal visit to the city. He was invited over tea by DGP RK Shukla where the officer interacted with top police officials of the state government. Dhasmana told officials to develop coordination with counterparts in districts bordering Nepal and Pakistan to keep a tab on money laundering activities, said sources. The officer encouraged young IPS officers for central deputation. Dhasmana, who joined RAW about 23 years ago, specialises in Pakistan and Afghanistan, especially Baluchistan that has been in focus recently with India raising Pakistan’s “repression” in the region. He also visited Indore on Sunday where he was posted as SP between 1988 and 1991. He joined RAW in 1994 and has served the agency for 23 years during which he has served on important desks, including Pakistan.
 
 RAW chief kept away from media and preferred staying at his close relative’s house in the state capital.
