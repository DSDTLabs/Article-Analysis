Surat: The incinerator unit of Geo-Hybrid Industrial Solution Private Ltd in Palsana taluka was shut down on Thursday following complaints of foul smell emanating from the unit by nearby villagers. 

 The Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) had issued closure notice to the company on September 26 after several representations by people of Baleswar village in Palsana over the years.
 
 The environment watchdog cut off power supply to the units on Thursday and has directed the owners to comply to the environment norms before beginning operations.
 
 The unit located at Gujarat Eco Textile park in Palsana used to dispose of industrial waste from different companies including bio-medical waste.
 
 M S Dasari, regional officer at GPCB in Surat, said, “We have severed their power connection. It will be restored only after compliance with pollution control norms mentioned in the notice issued to them.” 
 
 “People of Baleswar village have been complaining of foul smell from the incinerator for a long time and have alleged that it was affecting their health. More than 10,000 people from Baleswar have filed complaint against the unit,” he added. 
 
 A senior official from GPCB said, “We have measures for air pollution, water pollution and noise pollution. But, we don’t have anything for odour.” 
 
 A resident of Baleswar village Jayesh Patel said, “The foul remains throughout the year. Only when the direction of wind changes do we get some respite. We have demanded permanent closure of the unit and will continue to agitate till our demands are met.”
