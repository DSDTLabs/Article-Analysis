CHENNAI:   has scripted one of the biggest turnarounds at the ongoing Candidates tournament in Berlin. The Russian Grandmaster displayed nerves of steel to beat   in the 12th round of the competition on Saturday evening and move into the top slot. Karjakin, playing with white, won the round in 48 moves to be placed on 7 points along with Caruana.

 
 At the start of the round, Karjakin needed a win to stay in the hunt and the 28-year-old did just that. Caruana opted for the Petrov defence in the opening but Karjakin appeared to have been well-prepared. As the game progressed, Karjakin’s position only got stronger and he was able to inflict the first defeat on Caruana in the tournament. Karjakin’s win brought back memories of the 2016 Candidates where he beat Caruana in the ultimate round to end on 8.5 out of 14 and book a place in the World championship final.
 
 Round 12 also saw Ding Liren register his first win in the competition, stunning Azerbaijan GM  . The Chinese GM had so far scored 11 draws before getting the better of Mamedyarov.
 
 With 2 rounds still remaining to be fought, over half of the eight-player field still has a chance to sealing the deal in the competition. While Karjakin and Caruana lead the pack with 7 points apiece, Ding, Alexander Grischuk and Mamedyarov are in the second position with 6.5 points each in their kitty.
 
 Interestingly, former World champion Vladimir Kramnik too has an outside chance with 5.5 points to his name. Grischuk and Kramnik drew with Levon Aronian and Wesley So respectively.
