AHMEDABAD: The death of a man, who police say ran into a wire fence, fell, and died, has raised doubts whether the sequence of events is so straight forward or whether mob justice was involved. 

 If locals are to be believed,  , a resident of Limkheda in Dahod, came with his gang to commit a robbery near Narol, on the outskirts of the city, in the wee hours of Saturday.
 
 Sunita Chunara, a resident of the area, lodged a police complaint stating that a gang of robbers armed with sticks and stones stormed her house in the wee hours of Saturday. 
 
 “They snatched her gold chain and a pair of ear rings, hit her on the head and fled,” said a senior police official.
 
 “Her cries for help woke up the neighbourhood. People started chasing the fleeing gang, during which Bhabhor ran into a wire fence and fell on his head. He died at LG Hospital later,” the police official said.
 
 Inspector of Narol police station, R A Jadav, said they have registered an offence of dacoity based on Chunara’s complaint and an accidental death case for Bhabhor’s demise.
 
 “We are looking for   footage to verify if Bhabhor was beaten up by the mob while fleeing. If that is confirmed, we will register a case of murder and identify the accused. We are also hunting for Bhabhor’s associates, who managed to escape,” added Jadav.
 
 Local residents said that on hearing Chunara’s cries for help, some residents rushed to help her and saw a gang of robbers run towards a field.
 
  “The residents gave   and managed to nab Bhabhor. He was beaten up before police arrived. He was later rushed to LG Hospital, but succumbed to his injuries,” a local resident said.
