Barnala: Various social, women and student organisations are up against the Barnala district administration’s decision to organize Punjabi actor-singer Gippy Grewal’s cultural night on March 16 to mark one-year of Captain Amarinder Singh government. 

 The outfits have decided to burn the state government’s effigy and take out a   to the venue, Kala Mahar stadium. 
 
 Activists of Punjab Lok Sabhyacharak Manch, Naujawan Bharat Sabha, Punjab Students’ Union, Istri Jagriti Manch, Democratic Mulazam Federation, Jamhuri Adhikar Sabha, Democratic Teachers’ Front, Technical Services Union, Chetna Kala Kendra, Mazdoor Mukti Morcha, Inquilabi Kendra Punjab and Tarksheel Society decided to oppose the night during a meeting on Wednesday.
 
 Punjab Students’ Union activist Pardeep Kumar, Istri Jagriti Manch chief Charanjit Kaur and Inqulabi Kendra convener Narain Dutt said Gippy had glorified gun culture in his songs and presented women in undignified manner. If the administration wanted to collect funds for the district Red Cross Society, it should hold a night of a singer who has contributed towards enriching the culture. They were not against organisation of the cultural night, but opposed coarse songs and those promoting gun culture, they added.
 
 Barnala deputy commissioner Ghanshyam Thori said, “Gippy has been told not to sing offending songs. The proceeds of the night will go towards supporting the poor through the Red Cross Society.”
