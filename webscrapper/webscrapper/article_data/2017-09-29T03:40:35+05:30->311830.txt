Navi Mumbai: It took a little more than eight months for   to respond to a complaint lodged by   corporator Divya Vaibhav Gaikwad regarding junction boxes that have corroded and require to be either replaced or repaired.

 The main MTNL office and exchange is located on the main   road near Shivaji Chowk while the corporator’s ward is just across the road towards Mini Sea Shore.
 
 Divya first wrote on December 5, 2016 and one on August 30, 2017 to the general manager, MTNL Vashi, “as there was no action and senior citizens and others reminded me of no follow-up action’’.
 
 The ward comprises of sectors 1A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. “I am not happy with the response from MTNL after I submitted the second letter as the box that fell down due to corrosion in sector 6 near the market has been repaired with a metal plate at the bottom whereas it should have been replaced with a new one,’’ Gaikwad said.
 
 There are some 25 such boxes in the ward that have to be attended to, she said. “There’s also an MTNL exchange office in sector 7 in the ward and so officers attending office should have noticed. The junction box near Noor Masjid is very much visible and needs to be attended to as well.’’
 
 Deputy general manager, MTNL (Vashi), R C Ram said, “We have started work and some will be replaced and others repaired.’’ However, Gaikwad said the one that fell down in sector 6 has been repaired and not replaced. 
 
 A new junction box costs around Rs 25,000, said the general manager.
