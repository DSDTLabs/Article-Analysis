The   (LBD) has always been a revered classic and over decades, it has served us well, working the hardest among all the party wear hanging in our closets. Often, it has made us go from drab to fab in minutes. 

 However, the overdoing of this oft-repeated, cool, versatile and timeless piece of clothing has led women to look elsewhere when it comes to evening staples. And though the LBD may reign supreme for most because you just cannot go wrong with it, here are a few chic alternatives to the classic...
 
 
 
 The much touted black dress can now take a step backward and allow some colour to take centre stage. 
 
 
 
 Fluid fabrics, drapes, feminine shapes in gold, metallics and sequins are your new LBDs. 
 
 
 
 Strappy, frilly, little dresses can make a statement by staying glamourous without the strict severity of a classic LBD.
 
 
 
 These have taken the world of   by storm and are visible not just on western wear and traditional Indian ensembles, but also as accessories as well.
 
 
 
 Scalloped slip dresses, ones with multi-embellishments, silver sequinned sheer dresses and frilled hemlines are perfect for those lazy summer brunches.
 
 
 You can take your overall look up by a few notches with the right accessories. Keeping it minimal and letting your outfit do the talking is a good idea.
 
 
 
 Your alternative to LBD should make you look not just elegant and comfortable, but also alluring, just by the way of its construction.
 
 
 
 Show off your enigmatic side. Go for colour and bling in a big way to add to the drama. Finish the look with high stilettoes, shoulder-duster chandelier earrings and dark, smokey eyes.
 
 
 
 • It is essential that your look reflects not just your personality but also who you are.
 • If you are a shy person, wear a bright bold colour. This will project confidence.
 • Choose an outfit that accentuates your strengths and conceals flaws. For example — if you don’t like your bottom half, draw attention to your top half by wearing brighter colours or an amazing piece of bling around your neck.
 • Team your ‘little dress’ with colourful heels and matching clutch or some statement jewellery.
 • Don’t wear too much makeup and don’t overdo the perfume.
