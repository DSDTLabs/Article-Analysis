CHENNAI:   (CCFC) coach   started off his journey in the   with a 2-1 win over   on Saturday. The win meant   returned to winning ways after they had lost their last two matches. What was pleasing to see was how the players adapted to Soundara Rajan’s tactics.

 CCFC were playing in 4-4-2 formation under their former coach Robin   Raja. However, the players performed well when they had to switch to 4-4-1-1 under Soundara Rajan. The coach credited his players for adapting to his style and tactics.
 
 “I had only two sessions with the boys. I focused on changing the shape of the team. I saw that there were no communication between the defenders and midfielders. So I tried to gel them together,” Soundara Rajan told TOI.
 
 For CCFC,   and Brazilian forward Charles were on target. The 52-year-old coach singled out Charles for praise. “He was brilliant today. Not only did he score the goal but also created a lot of opportunities. He has a very good work ethic and shows a lot of dedication and commitment in practice. This is the kind of performance I want from my players,” Soundara Rajan said.
 
 Even though CCFC dominated the proceedings from the outset, there were a few concerns about Shahin Lal’s goalkeeping. “He was playing his first I-League match. So he was a bit nervous today. I really hope that he will improve in our next match,” Soundara Rajan said.
