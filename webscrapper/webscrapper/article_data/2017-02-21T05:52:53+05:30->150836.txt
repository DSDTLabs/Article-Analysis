BHOPAL: 'Unreasonable and erratic' power purchase agreements (PPA) entered in to by the state government with private power producers have forced the state power distribution companies to shell out Rs 3,028 crore without having purchased any power. 

 Discoms have revealed in their petition filed for tariff hike to the electricity regulator that, "Surplus situation has led to back down (non-utilization) of the available capacity. Prices for exchange of power are not attractive while there exists capacity constraint for inter-regional power transfer.
 
 However, is a power surplus situation, payment of fixed charges is required to be made to the power producers in accordance with the PPA.
 
 In the past years, it was observed that heavy quantum of power had to be backed down and the petitioners (power discoms) ended up paying fixed costs to the generators against power which was not availed. This was done to respect the agreements entered with such generators.
 
 Going by the numbers in financial year 2014-15 a quantum of 7,099 million units had to be backed down with a fixed cost of around Rs 870 crore. In 2015-16 a total of 17,130 million units having a fixed cost of Rs 2,158 crore were backed down."
