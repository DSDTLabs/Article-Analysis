Bhopal: In an outrageous act, a group of goons open fired at a police team that was returning after producing an accused in a loot and murder case before the court, killing a police constable on the spot in Guna district late on Tuesday.

 The team comprising three police constables took an accused Lokesh Dangi to the court in Shivpuri and were returning to Guna in a passenger bus. At around 7.30 pm when the bus reached Patai village, situated at a distance of around 8kms from Guna district headquarters, it stopped as some passengers were alighting. Meanwhile two armed men barged into the bus and open fired, police said.
 
 “They fired two bullets, one hit a constable, Ashok Kuraiti in his head killing him on the spot,” SP Guna Avinash Singh told TOI.
 
 He said, “There could be two main reasons behind the act, either they wanted to free the accused or they wanted to kill him. We are investigating on both the aspects. However in spite of the firing and one of our men losing his life the accused could not escape,” Singh said.
 
 “Lokesh Dangi is an accused in loot and a murder case and trials are going on,” he added.
 
 “Besides the constable all other passengers who were in the bus are safe and no one has been injured. The accused managed to escape from the spot,” he said.
 
 The police team along with the accused were sitting on the last seat of the bus operated by a private transporter.
