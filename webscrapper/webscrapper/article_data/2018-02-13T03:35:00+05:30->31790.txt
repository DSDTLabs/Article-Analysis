Quepem: Efforts at cleanliness seem to have irked Sanguem residents who are being woken up at the crack of dawn every day by the garbage collector’s persistent honking. The contractor engaged by Sanguem municipal council (SMC) for door-to-door garbage collection sends a vehicle for the task at 6am. The driver honks continuously while making rounds of the town, allegedly disturbing residents. While the contractor appears keen to finish his work early, residents feel SMC should alter the collection timing to 8am. “We can’t keep our the waste buckets out at night, as stray dogs and cattle make a mess of it,” a local resident said. The residents also said the staff hired by the contractor are engaged in other works after 8am, forcing them to finish the task beforehand. SMC chairperson Suryadatta Naik confirmed receiving oral complaints from locals. “Earlier, I had instructed the contractor not to carry out the work before 7 am, as it disturbs residents’ sleep,” he said, assuring that he would raise the issue at the council meeting. SMC has given a year’s contract, valid till March, to a private firm for garbage collection under funds provide by Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. The council, however, provides a driver and vehicles to the contractor. In the absence of SMC’s own garbage treatment plant, the waste is dumped at a site in Carora under Curchorem municipal council. Complaints of irregular garbage collection have also been raised despite every house being taxed for the service. “Sometimes, the vehicles come after 2-3 days to collect garbage and by then, the wet waste starts rotting and smelling foul,” said Kevin Mascarenhas, a resident of Bendvaddo. SMC sources said that garbage is being regularly collected from over 500 illegal houses even though they don’t pay for it.
