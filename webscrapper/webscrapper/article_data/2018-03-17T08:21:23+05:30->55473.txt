KOZHIKODE: The   district collector has submitted a report to the state government clearing the water theme park owned by   MLA   at   of most of the charges of law violations levelled against it.

 However, the 18-page report has found that P V Anwar and family were holding excess land in violation of the provisions of the   in Kozhikode and Malappuram districts. It also says that Kerala Land Board has already granted permission to the Thamarassery Taluk Land Board to register a case against the MLA and family under section 87 of the Kerala Land Reforms Act and to expedite the case proceedings.
 
 
 The report submitted by district collector U V Jose to additional chief secretary (disaster management) has taken a U-turn with regard to earlier findings by the district administration that the park is located in an area that falls under high/medium hazard zonation for landslide susceptibility as per the district disaster management plan.
 
 The new report states that the state disaster management authority (SDMA) has clarified that the park is not situated in a hazard zone.
 
 Also, the district collector's report states that the park is located outside forest zone and there is no Puramboke encroachment. The deputy collector (LR) has stated that the construction of the water theme park did not obstruct the natural flow of water in the area.
 
 However, the report has found that there is deviation from the approved building plan with respect to sheet roof structures and has recommended their dismantling.
 
 The report from the assistant divisional officer (fire and rescue) states that the park has not obtained the final certificate of approval and only a NOC under D&O category. The report said the park should again apply for approval from the local body for the deviations from plan.
