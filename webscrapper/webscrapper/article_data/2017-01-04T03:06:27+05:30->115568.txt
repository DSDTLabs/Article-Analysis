GURUGRAM:   of two men lying along Alipur-Garhi road early on Tuesday created panic as   who spotted them suspected it to be murder, and blocked the road for half an hour to protest police inaction. They calmed down after cops, who reached the spot and carried out a preliminary probe, determined it was an accident. 

 According to police, the accident took place when the deceased, Mukesh (22) and Maman Singh (40), who worked at a factory nearby, were returning home in   late night on Monday. “Looking at the condition of the motorcycle lying near the bodies, we confirmed it was a hit and run case,” an officer said.
 
 An FIR was registered against the unidentified driver at Bhondsi police station, under sections 279 (rash driving), 304A (death due to negligence) of the IPC. Villagers who had blocked the road alleged police never carried out night patrolling on the Alipur-Garhi road. “The duo could have been alive today, had they been spotted by a night patrol after the accident,” a protester said.
 
 The villagers called off the protest, but only after much persuasion by ACP Sukhveer Singh.
