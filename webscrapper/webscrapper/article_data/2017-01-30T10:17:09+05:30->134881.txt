BENGALURU: Smelling blood in the political waters with the resignation of Congress veteran  , the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Janata Dal (Secular) criticized the Congress party for failing to retain one the most senior Congressmen of Karnataka.

 In Madikeri, Union minister   went a step ahead and invited Krishna to join the BJP. “If Krishna wants to join the BJP, we'll welcome him with open arms,“ he said.
 
 Reacting to this, Krishna said it was the first time he was hearing about this and was unaware of any invitation to join the BJP.
 
 In Hubballi, BJP opposition leader in the legislative assembly Jagadish Shettar said the prime reason for Krishna resigning from the Congress is the attitude of the party and the state government, which did not offer him any support.
 
 In Mysuru, JD(S) state president   said no self-respecting person would continue to be associated with the grand old party.
 
 In Chikkodi, Congress MP   urged Krishna to reconsider and said he would meet him and talk about it. “His resignation will surely have an impact on the performance of the party in the 2018 assembly elections. I and many Congress leaders were groomed by Krishna. If he sticks to his decision,I will also decide my next course of action,“ said Hukkeri, threatening to quit the party.
 
 Minister for large and medium industries R V Deshpande, in a press note, expressed his anguish at Krishna's resignation and urged him to reconsider it.
