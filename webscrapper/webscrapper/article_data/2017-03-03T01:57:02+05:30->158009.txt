NEW DELHI: The wrestling duo of sisters Geeta and   are the new brand ambassadors of cleanliness in south Delhi. Agreeing to a year-long campaign on ‘Ho jaye do do haath’, the two athletes signed a contract with the   on Thursday. The sisters will feature in special events, and on banners, radio spots and TV commercials to promote sanitation in the municipality areas. 

 The older of the two, Geeta, reckoned that just as the fear of their father, as depicted in the Aamir Khan film Dangal, led them to the path of sporting success, litterbugs too could do with a dose of fear. “We should make strict laws against public littering. We are ready for a ‘do-do haath’ (fight) for this mission,” she said. 
 
 Babita revealed her embarrassment when foreign athletes visiting India ask her why the streets are dirty and why people urinate in the open. “We must change this mindset,” she offered. “If a country is to become swachh, people have to start with themselves, their home and their locality. Mere sloganeering will not do.” 
 
 Senior corporation officials divulged that the deal is worth Rs 30 lakh to the Phogats. Mayor Shyam Sharma added that the selection of the sisters was unanimous. “One can only imagine the barriers daughters must break to shine in wrestling,” Sharma philosophised. “Similar barriers will be broken in public sanitation now.” 
 
 Quietly left unsaid was the fact that the Swachh Bharat survey, which rates cities on cleanliness parameters, awards extra credits for the presence of a brand ambassador on public hygiene. The civic body had, till now, lost out on the eight points awarded for this and hopes to correct this lapse with the Phogat deal.
 
 “We want to establish south Delhi as an example to the rest of the country, and this partnership will help in that regard,” enthused South Delhi Municipal Corporation commissioner PK Goel.
