AMRITSAR : To discourage farmers from using poisonous insecticides and pesticides and to promote organic farming for healthy living, Khalsa College’s agriculture scientists have developed " " in the laboratory to control growth of harmful insects.

 While talking to TOI on Saturday agriculture scientist and in charge of College’s   Rajinder Pal Singh informed that they had developed friendly insects in the lab for the farmers to use in their fields. "These beneficial insects either feed on pest or lay eggs in the body of larvae of enemy insects and break their life cycles", he said.
 
 The insects developed in the Lab were Trichogramma Brasiliensis, Isotima Jevenesis, Coccinellide, Syrphid , Spider, Carabid, Dragon Fly, Predatory Pentatomids and Abnthrocoriddbugs, he informed.
 
 Head, department of agriculture   said there was a large scale trend of using the insecticides and pesticides by the farmers which also killed the friendly insects. "By controlling them biologically, farmers will not only save money on costly and poisonous substances but will also produce healthier crops in a natural manner." Bal said that the logic was that the friendly pests feeds on the enemy insects and scares them away too to protect the plant.
 
 Project's brainchild and Khalsa College Governing Council honorary secretary,   told that many sugar mills and farmers had already approached them for taking regular services of their Bio Control Lab to protect their crops from harmful insects. 
 
 He informed that college’s agriculture department had adopted 50 acres of agriculture where crops would be cultivated without use of insecticide and pesticides.
 
 Chhina said that college would also hold farmer’s meetings to make them aware of the dangers of using harmful pesticides and insecticides which had already played havoc to human lives adding that they would further expand the research work in their Bio Control Lab.
