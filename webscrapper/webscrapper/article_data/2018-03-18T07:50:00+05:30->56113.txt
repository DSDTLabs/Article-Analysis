GURUGRAM:   has refuted   of   in the death of a one-year-old boy. 

 At a press conference on Saturday, the hospital said the child, Delhi resident Vansh Sharma, had extremely low immunity and his attendants were made aware of the possible complications in advance. Moreover, the medical board didn’t even inspect the hospital while conducting an inquiry and declared that the boy caught an infection in its infection-free ward, it said.
 
 Vansh, who was suffering from Hunter Syndrome — a genetic disorder — was admitted to   on April 24, 2017. 
 
 He died on May 17, 2017, after he had a bone marrow transplant (BMT).
 
 The transplant was done on May 1, after which the child had fever. As his condition worsened, Vansh was shifted to a ventilator in the PICU ward on May 15. He was also kept in a ‘sterile, infection-free’ BMT room for 22 days. Vansh was later taken home, where a doctor declared him dead.
 
 Sharma filed a complaint at the office of the chief medical officer on September 6, 2017, alleging medical negligence.
 
 “We emphatically refute all allegations of negligence. The patient was critically immuno-compromised and thus highly prone to infections. We haven’t received formal information from any authority. The medical board didn’t inspect the hospital during the inquiry, ” said Dr Rahul Bhargava, director, bone marrow transplant, FMRI.
