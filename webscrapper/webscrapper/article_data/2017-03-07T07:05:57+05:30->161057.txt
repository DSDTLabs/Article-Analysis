SURAT: Heavy police bandobast has been made in the city and surrounding areas to ensure a hassle-free visit of Prime Minister   to south Gujarat on Tuesday. 

 Police and other departments swung into action to make last minute preparations for the Prime Minister who will be addressing a public meeting near Surat airport soon after his arrival. Chief minister Vijay Rupani will receive the Prime Minister in the city.
 
 Modi will be visiting Bharuch to inaugurate OPAL plant at Dahej and the newly constructed cable-stayed bridge on   over Narmada river. The Prime Minister will spend around 15 minutes in Surat. Earlier it was not declared that he will address a public meeting near the airport here. Modi was to leave for Bharuch by air soon after his arrival at Surat.
 
 Earlier, since there was no event of the Prime Minister in the city, a number of officers were called for bandobast in Gandhinagar, sources informed. This change in plan has added to the troubles of the short-staffed city police. 
 
 Police are taking all measures to ensure that protesters from Patidar community do not enter the venue of the event. A number of Patidars had tried to enter the venue where deputy chief minister Nitin Patel was being felicitated here on Saturday. However, they were detained outside the venue itself. 
 
 Two deputy commissioners of police will be supervising the bandobast for the Prime Minister’s visit. Police carried out a rehearsal on Monday to check their preparedness ahead of Modi’s visit even as senior officers held string of meetings to see that everything passed off smoothly. 
 
 “All officers have been asked to take strict action against anyone trying to create disturbance. Police will also be carrying out a combing operation in the city before the Prime Minister’s arrival at the airport,” city police commissioner   said.
