However, the universities and the colleges already have a successful model in the state--Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit in Kochi, which had installed a solar plant to meet its power requirements.

 The state would be relying on funds from the   (RUSA), the centrally-sponsored scheme, which also provides infrastructural support to universities and colleges for implementing the project.
