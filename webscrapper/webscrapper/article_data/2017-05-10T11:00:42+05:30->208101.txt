NEW DELHI: If the parallel league system in Indian football does come into force, will losing top Indian stars to the Indian Soccer League (ISL) affect the continuity of the I-League? Former Indian captain   doesn't think so. He feels both   and I-League will have to co-exist for the growth of Indian football.

 "It's should be responsibility of all the league teams not to look at the top stars only. Only top 10 players get to play the ISL and if an I-League doesn't exist, then what happens to the other footballers? It's a job opportunity for those who play in I League and therefore both should co-exist," Bhutia told TOI on sideline of a Sports Conclave organized by   (RSPB) under the Ministry of Railways, here on Tuesday.
 
 Bhutia also made it clear that more matches at the highest levels is the best way to take the sport forward. "During our young days, we got only four to five games at the top. Right now, the footballers are getting 40 to 50 games per year and that is required," he said. "They should start from the grass-root level to make things happen at the top. Any league team be it football or cricket or any other sport should also be interested in nurturing the grass-root talents. We can't be focusing on the stars only," he added.
 
 Meanwhile, India's boxing legend  , wrestlers Sushil Kumar and Sakshi Malik too expressed their feelings on how sports infrastructure should be improved and national sports bodies should be made more responsible. Sushil even suggested on having a body like the   to bring in reforms in the   (NSFs). "I don't mind if we have a Lodha Panel for all National Sports Federation (NSFs). It will only help increase the accountability and transparency of the associations. The coaches need to be accountable. We are in need of qualified coaches," Sushil added.
