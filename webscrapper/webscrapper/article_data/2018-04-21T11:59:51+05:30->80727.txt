This is our way of giving back to the society,” Asokan said.
 
 One such programme is to set up libraries at schools that do not have sufficient funding. So far, FSR team has set up libraries at four schools and organises regular reading sessions there. Through another programme, Vatsalya, FSR conducts welfare activities at orphanages.
