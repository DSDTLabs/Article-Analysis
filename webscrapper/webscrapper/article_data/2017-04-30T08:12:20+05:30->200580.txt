SHIMLA:   Youth Congress president and chief minister Virbhadra Singh’s son Vikramaditya has alleged that Union minister Chaudhary Birender Singh was plotting defections in Congress by ensuring that senior party leaders from the state join  .

 Addressing a media conference here on Saturday, Vikramaditya said Birender, who was in-charge of Congress in Himachal Pradesh before joining BJP, and some senior leaders were trying to sabotage the Congress party ahead of the assembly elections scheduled later this year. He accused Dhumal of befooling the public by making baseless statements for his political survival. Congress under the leadership of Chief Minister   is strongly united and prepared to face the upcoming elections, he added.
 
 In defence of his father, Vikramaditya said false cases were framed against Virbhadra on the directions of Centre and so he has the right to knock at the doors of court to seek justice. He said Central agencies were working especially on the directions of Union finance minister Arun Jaitley.
 
 Reacting to the Prime Minister’s statement on winds of change blowing from Uttrakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi towards Himachal Pradesh, Vikramaditya said people of Himachal don’t want polluted air from Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. Himachal Pradesh is a land of gods and goddesses and it is Himachal which generates fresh air to entire nation, he added. He said Prime Minister had launched ‘Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik’ services from Shimla after the directions from the Supreme Court. 
 
 BJP leaders have made false claim that 73 National Highways have been sanctioned to Himachal Pradesh, he alleges. The Centre actually gave approval for preparing detailed project report (DPR) to only 10 national highways and the amount for preparing the same has not been released, Vikramaditya added.
