LUCKNOW: BSP chief   is all set to criss-cross the state by addressing more than 50 rallies in a span of over a month. According to her campaign schedule, accessed by TOI, the BSP boss will kick off her campaign on February 1 by addressing a rally each in Meerut and Aligarh, the two west UP districts which go to the polls in the first phase on February 11. She will end her campaign in Varanasi, the parliamentary constituency of PM Narendra Modi, on March 4.

 The BSP supremo will touch almost all the districts in her bid to reach out to voters. 
 
 She would not only touch the SP stronghold of Etawah and Kannauj but also Congress bastions of Amethi and  . She will also address a rally in Gorakhpur, the strong hold of BJPâ€™s firebrand MP Yogi Adityanath.
 
 In all, Mayawati is expected to address at least 14 rallies in west UP alone where she seeks to play a formidable Dalit-Muslim consolidation card. The jinx of Noida, however, appears to haunt Mayawati. She will not address a rally in Gautam Buddh Nagar, where her native village Badalpur is situated.
 
 In Rohilkhand and central UP region, the BSP supremo will address a rally each in Lucknow and Kanpur on the same day, on February 14. The very next day, on February 15, she will address a rally in Rae Bareli, the parliamentary constituency of Congress president Sonia Gandhi.
 
 The former CM is also to address at least five rallies in the politically crucial Bundelkhand region. Though Mayawati has been distancing herself from religion, she has decided not to hold a rally on Mahashivratri.
