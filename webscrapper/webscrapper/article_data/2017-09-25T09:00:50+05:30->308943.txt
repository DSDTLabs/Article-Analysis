UDAIPUR: Mud houses, bad roads, poor sanitation, illiteracy , no internet, no signals in cellphones are some of the images that flash into one's mind when one speaks of any rural settlement. Technology , in any form, is the last thing a village would probably have.

 However, villagers at   in   have worked hard to prove the notion wrong.
 
 Gamdi Ahada is definitely one of the first villages in Rajasthan to have a website of their own. The  , a group of enlightened and vigilant residents, have created the website where they share all the information pertaining to the village and panchayat like various events, developmental works & activities, photographs, bills, facilities etc.
 
 “The villagers, by coming up with their website, have not only marked their presence on the web, but also set an example for the rest of the rural areas. The website http:www.gavm.org was launched on Thursday ,“ Dungerpur collector   told TOI. The site would contain all details and data related to the gram panchayat right from its inception in 1959 including voter list, tenures of representatives, action plans, list of ODF villages, job card bearers, MNREGA works etc. In the next phase, the panchayat would soon launch an android app containing details.
 
 “The Gamdi Ahada Vikas Manch has been doing a commendable work by taking the development works ahead. The body had prepared an agenda before the panchayat elections last time and put forth the conditions before the candidates that whoever fulfills the agenda would be elected as the sarpanch. The manch organises monthly meetings to discuss issues and recommends solutions. Massive plantation, voluntary `shramdaan', interlocked block cement roads etc have been some major achievements of the manch in the past.
