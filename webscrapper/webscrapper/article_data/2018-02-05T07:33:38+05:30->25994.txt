HYDERABAD: A spotted deer was found dead at the   campus on Sunday, eight days after a similar deer carcass was traced to a remote area. 

 The spotted deer was found at   in the university south campus. Students suspect the deer was mauled by dogs. "The number of stray dogs on campus has increased rapidly. They sometimes attack students. The deer population has been decreasing due to attacks," said Ravi Jillapalli, founder of Wild Lens at UoH, a wild life protection group. 
 
 On January 25, a carcass of spotted deer with its antlers intact was found in dense forest on the campus. In the past two years, over 50 deers have been mauled to death by stray dogs on campus.
 
 While the blame game between the  , university authorities and the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation continues, students claim that it is the animal which is suffering. 
 
 The animal activist community in the varsity have been crying hoarse about stray dog attacks for years. "While there were meetings between university authorities, forest department and GHMC officials, nothing has been done to save the wildlife on campus," rued Ravi Jillapalli. 
 
 University authorities claim they need to take a more humane route to control the menace. "We have been in touch with forest department and   to save spotted deer. Protection becomes hard as most of deers are killed in forest areas. But we have been conducting drives to eliminate stray dogs," said  , spokesperson of UoH.
