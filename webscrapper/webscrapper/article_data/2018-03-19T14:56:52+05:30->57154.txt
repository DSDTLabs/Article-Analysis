Alina Padikkal, popular serial actress, and television anchor slammed the trollers with a bold   video on her   account. Social media was flooded with trollers who trolled Alina for the latest interview she had given to a   channel. The   video made by a fan became more viral than the original video.

 The troll video was a mix of Alina's answers for the interview edited with sarcastic dialogues from popular movies. This video was trending on social media channels and it presented Alina as a self-boasting celebrity.
 
 Through her LIVE video, Alina made it clear that the whole troll video was completely edited and shows only short clippings from the original interview and she requested everyone to see the whole interview rather than sharing the troll.
 
  
  
 Alina confirmed that it was a face-to-face interview than a 'self-boasting' session, she even questioned the need for her to boast about herself to her viewers who know her from a very young age. She also conveyed to her fan base to enjoy it as a troll but not turn it into a controversy.
 
 As the controversy started rising, the same youtube channel published a video in support of Alina, appreciating her dedication and spirit.
