NEW DELHI: Even though   data shows a fall in the number of fatal accidents, roads remain unsafe past  . Shockingly,   have been traced and booked in only 10% of the   cases. Lack of a deterrent policy is a major impediment in preventing such incidents.

 Cops advocate for a stronger law in dealing with accident victims, though drivers involved in hit-and-run are rarely booked for culpable homicide by Delhi Police.
 
 This year, there were 612 road fatalities till June 15. Of these, about 30% were hit-and-run incidents. In the corresponding period last year, 717 incidents were reported. 
 
 Though traffic cops expect the figures to dip this year following a drive to check movement of heavy vehicles past midnight, experts argue that this is only done on highways and roads within colonies are still not monitored.
 
 Sources said plans to monitor colony roads using CCTV cameras are still on paper. The Mercedes hit-and-run incident reported in Civil Lines last year, too, was caught on CCTV, but cops had to take a longer route to identify the car since the footage was not clear.
 
 “We have been pushing for technology-based policing at night along with regular patrols to reduce the number of fatalities. This will act as a deterrent for drivers,” said a police officer.
 
 Moreover, it is difficult to find eyewitnesses as people, fearing harassment, avoid being questioned by the cops. Studies by traffic police and International Road Federation have shown that in 90% of the cases, the victim dies or turns critical as precious moments are wasted in informing the police and ambulance.
 
 It has been observed that a majority of these accidents take place between 9pm and 4am when police presence is limited.
 
 Experts blame speeding and lack of concern for safety of others as the major reasons for these accidents. Traffic officials said that 50% of the casualties involve pedestrians and two-wheelers, like in the case of the victim at the ITO crossing.
