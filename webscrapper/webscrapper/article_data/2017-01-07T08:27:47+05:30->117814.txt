AHMEDABAD: The   has exonerated five   of a charge of taking a bribe of Rs 10 after a 22-year legal battle. In June 1994, five traffic policemen in Ahmedabad were caught by the   ( ) which charged them with accepting a bribe of Rs 10. They were later convicted and sentenced to two years of imprisonment by a special court.

 However, the HC last month overturned the special court’s judgement saying the ACB was not able to prove its case and that the witnesses were confused about the identity of the accused.
 
 According to the case details, KM Rathod, a police inspector who was then posted in the ACB, got a tip-off that the traffic cops were taking bribe from violators. 
 
 Without recording this intelligence input in the police station diary, Rathod took along a raiding party, a loading auto-rickshaw driver as a decoy and a person as a witness. In their first encounter with traffic cops, the auto driver paid Rs 10 as bribe and ACB sleuths nabbed the policemen — Ratnabhai Solanki, Jagdishchandra Jadav, Vishnubhai Patel, Nandubhai Patel and   — when they were accepting money. All of them were booked for corruption.
 
 Acquitting the cops, Justice RP Dholaria observed that there was lack of uniformity in the versions of the auto-rickshaw driver and the witness and that they were confusing the identity of the accused. The prosecution too failed to link the accused with the bribery case, the judge said.The HC pulled up Rathod saying: “This course of action on Rathod’s part goes against the basic tenets of criminal jurisprudence and fair investigation. The credibility of prosecution’s case becomes suspicious on this count.”
