Breaking the barriers of conventional and unconventional movies, the   and   starrer ‘Raazi’ crossed the Rs 100 crore mark at the box-office. The   and Dharma Productions’ film grossed Rs 1.80 crore on Tuesday, taking its grand total to Rs 106.12 crore.

 With films like ‘Raazi’, the lines between conventional and unconventional cinema is slowly but gradually blurring. Speaking about the same, Alia reportedly said that unconventional can also be conventional and commercial if it connects with people. It is essential somewhere to maintain that balance. The actress also added that she was hoping this film strikes a balance and that she is happy it did. It also reportedly made her believe in the choices that she made as an actor.
 
  
 The actor says there will always be a struggle no matter where one starts from. "My struggles will always be there. It is harder when you have expectations. My struggle is with myself, to outdo and outperform myself, to do something new and different. Just because things are working out for me as an actor in the film industry doesn't mean I don't struggle to make it work," Alia added.
 
 Citing the example of her last release, Alia says she worked like a crazy person and shot for 16 hours a day as they had to make it in a certain kind of budget.
 
 "Now that the film is being appreciated it all feels worth it. But that doesn't mean my struggles are over. It will continue as I will have to prove myself with every film."
 
 ‘Raazi’ is produced by Vineet Jain, Karan Johar, Hiroo Johar and Apoorva Mehta and co-produced by Priti Shahani.
