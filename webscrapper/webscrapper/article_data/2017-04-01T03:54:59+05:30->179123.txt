NEW DELHI: With an aim to provide safe and clean drinking   across the country, the government has set a deadline of 2021 to make clean drinking water available to 28,000 habitations, heavily affected with arsenic and fluoride contaminants in water.

 Water contamination, mainly from arsenic and fluoride, is increasingly being linked with onset of cancer and even hypertension, diabetes and reproductive disorders. Concerned over this, the ministry of drinking water and sanitation has launched the ‘National Water Quality Sub-Mission’ with an outlay of Rs 25,000 crore.
 
 On Thursday, Union minister   told   that a total of 63,968 habitations in the country suffer water contamination. However, over 28,000 habitations are such where the arsenic and fluoride contents are very high.
 
 While West Bengal is worst hit by arsenic contamination, Rajasthan suffers from presence of fluoride in drinking water causing serious health hazards. Tomar told Parliament that these two states will receive the maximum funds to address the problem.
 
 Assuring that the government is working on a plan to provide tapped war to all by 2030, the Centre has asked states to come up with specific proposals.
 
 Data from the ministry of health and family welfare between 2010 and 2015 revealed that more than 16,528 people died due to diseases caused by water contamination across the country. The figures are for five broad diseases caused by contaminated water. Specific information about how many deaths are caused by fluoride or arsenic is difficult to collate. Fluoride is to be blamed for a majority of this contamination but arsenic is not too far behind, while salinity, nitrate and iron content also cause contamination.
 
 The ministry of drinking water and sanitation has also commissioned around 35 research and development projects for improvement of drinking water quality in rural areas.
