MUMBAI: It must be the strangest season in Indian domestic cricket. It began on an absurd note with the Duleep Trophy, which has traditionally been played on a zonal basis, being held under lights with teams which were called India Blue, Green and Red respectively.

 Then, the entire Ranji Trophy was played at neutral venues, which meant that all the domestic teams were sent on a 'Bharat Darshan.' It is therefore no surprise that in another illogical decision, the last leg of the   T20 Trophy which was earlier a knockout and an inter-state affair, will be played on a zonal round-robin basis, this time at the Wankhede here from Sunday.
 
 It's not often that you see the format of a tournament being switched from inter-state in the league stage to interzonal in the final stage, but the previous regime of the BCCI was keen to stage a 'mini-IPL' which would help both the board's important stakeholders -the   team owners and Star Sports. The concluding stages of tournament will be held from February 12 to February 17, which is perfect timing as far as IPL franchises and talent scouts are concerned.
 
 "The format of the league is good, but I think the state champions should be there till the final, and then the zonal league can commence," felt Central Zone skipper  , who had led   to the top of the table in the Central Zone in the league stage. "In an ideal world, the zonal tournament should be in addition to the state tournament, but as a player you can't do anything about it. You've to go about the business as the BCCI schedules it. We've to play and follow the path which the Board is showing us," felt  .
