Margao: Tito Cardozo has emerged frontrunner for the post of the vice-chairperson of the Margao Municipal Council (MMC), the elections for which will be held on Tuesday. The post had fallen vacant following the resignation of Dorris Texeira last month. Sources said Cardozo, who belongs to town and country planning minister Vijai Sardesai’s camp, is likely to get elected unopposed. While BJP’s Rupesh Mahatme was also in the race for the post initially, his recent appointment as a member of the South Goa planning and development authority (SGPDA), paved the way for Cardozo’s elevation to the post of MMC vice-chairperson. Cardozo’s election as MMC’s vice-chairperson will mean that Sardesai’s grip over the council is absolute, with the chairperson of the MMC, Babita Angle Prabhudessai, also owing her allegiance to the Fatorda MLA. In effect, sources said, Digambar Kamat, the seven-time MLA of Margao, whose writ ran over the civic body for decades together, will find himself being pushed out of the power equations in the MMC, ceding the space to Sardesai. Texeira, who belongs to the Kamat camp, was forced to resign after councillors belonging to both BJP and Sardesai camps threatened to oust her by moving a no-confidence motion against her. In the 25-member MMC, while 11 councillors owe allegiance to Sardesai, only six got elected on Kamat’s Model Margao panel.
