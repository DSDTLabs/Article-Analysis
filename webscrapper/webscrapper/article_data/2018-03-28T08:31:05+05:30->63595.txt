PUNE: Retired defence personnel can now hope for a better resolution of their issues relating to employment, welfare and allied matters following the state government’s decision to appoint an independent managing director as head of the   ( ). A government resolution to this effect was issued recently.

 A state undertaking, MESCO was created to liaison with industrial establishments for providing reasonable employment to armed forces personnel who retire early. 
 Since its inception in January 2002, MESCO has grown into a Rs 250 crore company and boasts of 12,000 ex-servicemen as members who are hired by industrial units for various jobs. 
 
 MESCO was, till now, headed by the director of   welfare board, which looks after pension, welfare and allied issues of ex-servicemen settled across the state. Conducting the functions of MESCO and Sainik welfare department simultaneously was seen as a hurdle for a single person as head and there was a demand for long to separate MESCO from the Sainik welfare directorate by appointing a separate managing director. 
 
 State director of Sainik welfare  , who headed MESCO for nine years, told TOI, “In 2009, MESCO’s annual turnover was nearly Rs 5 crore and now it is Rs 250 crore. We have started various schemes, including military tourism, and at least 12,000 ex-servicemen are now working with MESCO.”
 
 Commander   (retd) pointed out, “There were a number of instances wherein the Sainik welfare board officials have misused MESCO’s fund and, therefore, we demanded an independent official.”
