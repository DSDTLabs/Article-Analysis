VADODARA:   Refinery witnessed a ruckus on Monday as sanitation workers went on a flash strike. Some of the workers also threatened to immolate themselves if their demands were not met. The cops had rush to the spot and take control of the situation. The sanitation workers have been demanding equal pay for their work.

 The workers gathered at the gate of refinery and staged protests. Gujarat Refinery officials said the workers have approached the court and the case is being heard. “A legal case is on, then how can we talk with them? The workers have to decide if they want to pursue legal route or talk with the management,” said a senior Gujarat Refinery official.
 
 “The workers didn’t even give any notice before going on strike. So we have talked with the labour commissioner and asked him to declare this strike illegal,” the official added.
