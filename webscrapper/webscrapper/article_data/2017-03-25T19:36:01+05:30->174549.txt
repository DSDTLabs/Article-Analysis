LUCKNOW:   chief minister   on Saturday announced doubling of financial grant given to pilgrims of   from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh. Yogi also said that the state government will get a Mansarovar Bhawan constructed somewhere near Delhi or any other state for the benefit of the pilgrims.

 Presiding over a meeting in the CM secretariat, Yogi said that the financial grant would encourage pilgrimage to Kailash Mansarovar. The previous Akhilesh Yadav-government too had doubled that the grant given to pilgrims of Mansarovar from Rs 25,000 to Rs 50,000. The grant had to be given to those who produce a domicile certificate or a copy of the passport, certifying that they belong to UP.
 
 An average cost of yatra for a person is estimated to range around Rs 2.5 lakh. As most pilgrims are unable to afford the amount, the government had announced a subsidy programme for devotees from UP who are selected by the Centre.
