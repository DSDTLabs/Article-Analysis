What could be more romantic than having a pre-wedding photo shoot on Valentine’s Day. That’s what singer-composer   did with his fiancee   in Kanpur. The 'Galliyan' singer chose Valentine’s Day for his pre-wedding photo shoot and the couple evidently struck all the romantic poses they could think of for the shoot. "Hum dono logon ke ghar par wedding ki tayyariya chal rahi hain. Aise main hum logon ne socha ki apna pre-wedding photo shoot Kanpur main hi karein," says Ankit, adding, "Getting it done in some other destination was not possible for both of us. Meanwhile, I have also to go to Kolkata for a show before the wedding. That’s why we both decided to get the shoot done soon. Also, we chose Kanpur for the pictures because we wanted to add a local touch to our pictures since we both are Kanpuriyas."
The pictures clicked by a local photographer, show the couple in romantic poses and mostly in silhouettes. "We wanted it that was, just a suggestion of the two of us," says Ankit. 
 The couple chose a farmhouse on the outskirts of the city on Bithoor for the photoshoot. They also shot at the   and Ganga Barrage. "Cawnpore Club is a beautiful place and I am really thankful to the club authorities to allow us to shoot there. Since we were having the pre-wedding photo shoot on Valentine’s Day, we also got some romantic pictures clicked in the lobby, the discotheque and the restaurant of the club. The photographer also wanted to click some beautiful pictures of us during the sunset so we decided to click them at the Ganga barrage. The best thing is that the whole shoot went off very smoothly without anyone getting to know of it," says Ankit.
 The couple also plans to shoot a few more pics at the Ghantaghar and other prominent locations of the city, in a couple of days to added to theur wedding album. 
 Ankit and Pallavi will be tying the knot in Kanpur on Feb 23.
