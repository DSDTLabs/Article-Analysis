Panaji: After months of struggle for refunds of Integrated Goods and Services Tax ( ), exporters finally have some respite. The customs commissionerate Goa has launched a special drive to process and initiate refunds by March 29.

 The move will ensure that exporters do not suffer a shortage of capital due to a delay in processing of IGST refunds, the customs commissionerate Goa said on Friday.
 
 The delay in issuing refunds is due to errors made by the exporters and refunds to the tune of Rs 41.42 crore remains pending with the department.
 
 “There are instances of exporters committing errors while filing refund claims. The department is making all out efforts to rectify the errors and has started giving refunds partially with manual intervention,” customs commissioner R Manohar said.
