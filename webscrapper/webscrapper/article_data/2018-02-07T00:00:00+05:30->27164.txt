When  , one of Kannada cinema’s busiest   stars, was offered the role of a cop in this week’s release Samhaara, he was quite upbeat about it. “The characterization piqued my interest, as I was being portrayed as a serious police officer. Of course, my character still brings in the laughs, as audiences would expect that of me, but the twist is that there is no intentional comedy in my lines or body language for that matter. All the humour in   is situational. Whatever I do or say will seem funny to those watching me,” says Chikkanna.
The other interesting bit was his styling. “Director   wanted me to grow out a moustache like what Suriya had in Singham. Given my busy schedule it took me a while to do it, as it would affect the continuity of my other projects. Eventually, when I had a break for a few days, I got the moustache in place and shot my portions in a single, 15-day schedule in  . The team was very accommodating and planned the shoot according to my convenience,” says the actor.
 Samhaara is Chikkanna’s fourth film with lead actor  , with whom, he says, he has forged a friendship. “There is an easy-going camaraderie between us, and this, I think, reflects in our onscreen chemistry, which helps, considering that all my portions are with Chiru,” he signs off.
