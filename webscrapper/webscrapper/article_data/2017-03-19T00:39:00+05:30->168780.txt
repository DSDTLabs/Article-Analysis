Faced with criticism for unchecked corruption, over 20 major government hospitals in the state have decided to hold a sensitisation drive on Monday. Senior officials will take stock of the functioning of government hospitals and initiate remedial measures to curb corruption and bribery. “We held an emergency meeting on Saturday and have instructed superintendents of tertiary care government hospitals to conduct sensitization programme on Monday from 3 pm to 4 pm. Officials will display no corruption placards,” said Dr M Ramani, director of medical education. tnn
