RAJKOT: Chief minister Vijay Rupani’s hometown Rajkot has slipped 11 places to 18th position in the cleanliness ranking in the country for the current year.

 Rajkot had figured among the top 10 in the cleanliness rankings last year across the country and   ( ) had then announced that it would work hard to get the number 1 position in 2017.
 
 However, Rajkot showed reverse trend in   whereas other cities and towns showed improvement in sanitation, open defecation and other criteria for the cleanliness ranking. 
 
 “We have been working hard to make Rajkot city cleaner and improve on the other criteria to enhance our position in the next cleanliness rankings. Our priority will be on segregation of solid waste at the source and citizen’s satisfaction among others in the coming days,”  , municipal commissioner, told TOI.
 
 He added that beginning June 5, RMC is planning to distribute 4 lakh dustbins free of cost for the segregation of solid waste (wet and dry) at the source. This will help in processing and disposal of solid waste in a scientific manner.”
 
 However, the announcement of cleanliness rankings has come as shock to many in the RMC who were expecting to be in the top 10 if not numero uno.
 
 “We have some questions about self-assessment criteria in which we gave 813 marks out of 900. Many cities gave themselves higher marks in this category and this could be one of the reasons for Rajkot slipping so drastically,” a senior RMC functionary claimed. 
 
 In fact, in Gujarat, all cities and towns surveyed in 2017 have improved sanitation rankings over that of 2016 and 2014 except Rajkot which slipped from its 2016 rank for the million plus population cities.
 
 Like most cities of Gujarat, Rajkot too is battling the problem of municipal solid waste pile up that is assuming serious proportion. The waste is dumped at Nakrawadi village on the city’s outskirts, making life a hell for several villages surrounding the mountain of garbage.
