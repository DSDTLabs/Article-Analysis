Keri: Traffic along the Keri-Belagavi road is facing the brunt of the ongoing work of laying cables, lack of proper gutters and a narrow road, which has led to a lot of inconvenience and contributed to accidents and repeated congestion. Since the last two years, during the monsoon, the work of laying cables by telecom companies continues and causes water-logging due to lack of proper gutters.  The narrow Keri-Belagavi road serves as a short cut to the Pune-Bengaluru highway. Heavy vehicles proceeding to Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have been repeatedly facing traffic congestion. The road from Sakhali to Keri has not been widened, but the number of vehicles plying on it is increasing. The number of accidents has also been on the rise. Recently, in a fatal accident, a truck owner and driver Navnath Desai died in Morlem when his truck turned turtle while letting another vehicle pass. The newly elected sarpanch of Keri village, Laxman Gawas told TOI, “Work of laying cables has been going on without informing the panchayat and despite repeated notices to the contractor.”
