CHANDIGARH: Twenty-one-year-old Suraj, a resident of  , Punjab, who died in a road   on April 28, has helped save the lives of three people through organ donation.

 On April 28, Suraj, who was riding a bike, slipped into the coma after a collision with a car. After initial treatment at Rajindra hospital, Patiala, Suraj’s family rushed him to PGIMER. He was declared brain dead on May 5.
 
 This was when the transplant coordinators at the PGIMER apprised the relatives of the deceased of an opportunity to utilise his organs for transplants.
 
 Suraj’s organs saved three terminally ill patients through transplantation of his liver, kidney and pancreas. Ram Avtar, the father of the deceased, said, “When I was told that Suraj’s organs can save the life of others, I agreed after taking consent of my family. There cannot be anything more traumatic than losing your child. If someone can survive with organ donation of my son, I will be happy,” he said.
 
 Dr Vipin Koushal, nodal officer, the regional organ and tissue transplant organisation (ROTTO), PGIMER, said, “Following the consent of the donor family, nephrology and hepatology departments identified several potential recipients who were asked to report at the earliest. The cross match led to identification of three recipients for liver, kidney and combined pancreas and kidney transplants. The condition of the transplanted patients is stable. It would take a few days before the doctors could ascertain if the transplanted organs are functioning normally.”
