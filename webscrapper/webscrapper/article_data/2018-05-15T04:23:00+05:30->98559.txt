Ahmedabad: As the mercury rises and temperatures begin to soar, police personnel, particularly traffic police personnel, are among the worst affected as they are forced to bear the burnt of the heat. Commissioner of police, A K Singh, on Monday, said that the cops are usually forced to work in an environment they cannot control. “Traffic cops are usually at the mercy of the space and behaviour they cannot control. The pollution and heat make a deadly and unfortunate combination,” said Singh, during the launch of the anti-pollution mask by ATIRA and NID. Singh also sought a solution from ATIRA for designing a fabric for police uniforms that helps them stay cool. “It is time that there is a specific technology available to address this issue. What we need is a speciality fabric to help police personnel combat the heat, something that is evaporative,” he said. tnn
