And it has finally arrived! The much-awaited comebak film of Megastar Chiranjeevi, after almost a decade sent fans into a frenzy.   although had lukewarm responses from the trailer, (it was compared to the original) the film seemed to have pleased the audiences. Khaidi No 150 as promised is a treat for Mega fans with the matinee idol's trademark dances, mannerism and intense acting in emotional scenes. Ram Charan's 30 second cameo was a highlight. 

 
 
 Khaidi No 150 deviated a little from the original to match the larger than life image of Chiranjeevi but it looked like the audience had no issues with it. Khaidi No 150 is a good watch as a film but is a must-watch for the avid Tollywood fan, for the mere mania it creates in the theatres.
