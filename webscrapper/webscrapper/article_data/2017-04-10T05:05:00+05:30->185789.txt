Agartala: The shadows lengthened over the Manisen Karbari Para J B School ground as the football match went on. It was almost time to go home, but the boys lingered on — one last shot, one good pass and a goal and then they would all head home. Most of them did after the end of the match, but Phalen Aslong, Hadrajoy Aslong and Ranjit   would never. 

 The three tribal youths from the Longtorai Valley sub-division of Dhalai district died after inhaling suspected poisonous gas while trying to retrieve the football that had fallen into an abandoned well near the school ground.
 
 Police said the boys were playing football when the ball fell into the dry ring well, about 20 feet deep. One after the other the three boys climbed down to recover the ball, but died after inhaling poisonous gas. 
 
 Initially it was the 24-year-old Phalen and 14-year-old Hadrajoy, a Class Ix student, who first climbed down the well to recover the ball, the police said. but could not come out. But when they did not come down, Ranjit, 20, decided to climb down and see for himself. He too met the same fate as the other two.
 
 It was Dhabala Mohan Tripura, one of their playmates, who raised an alarm after about half an hour had elapsed with no sign of his friends. His cries brought together the villagers who informed the police. Late in the evening jawans from Tripura State Rifles and disaster management volunteers recovered the bodies from the ring well.
 
 Dhabala later told the police that Hadrajoy had gone down into the well in search of the ball. “As time passed, Phalen went in to look of Hadrajoy. When he too did not come out, Ranjit went searching for them,” the police quoted Dhabala as saying. 
 
 The bodies were handed over to the families after post mortem on Sunday. The police have registered a case of unnatural death and launched an investigation.
