VIAJAYAWADA: Water resources minister   said real estate developers have the responsibility to bring housing within common man's reach, especially now as   have fallen after demonetisation. He said builders should use latest technologies and bring down construction expenditure. 

 Speaking after inaugurating the 4th Property Show by Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Association of India ( ) here on Friday, Uma said that the real estate developers should use subsidies provided by the government to benefit the common man.
 
 "No state in India has a sand policy like Andhra Pradesh's where sand is free. So the builders should use it and ensure the construction costs come down. Also incorporate technological advancements in building methods such as pre-fabrication for faster, cheaper and effective structures," he said. He said chief minister   will also encourage the builders to come forward with plans to bring down housing costs. He told the builders that the new water resources office was built at a lower cost by using Cisco technology.
 
 He added that the state government is planning to construct 16 lakh houses for the poor in the next two years. "Under NTR Housing Scheme we are also giving Rs 1.5 lakh for poor people to build houses," he added.
 
 Excise minister  , who also inaugurated the show, said the government introduced insurance for workers of unorganised sector to support them further. "Property shows will create awareness among public regarding the latest trends and development," he added.
