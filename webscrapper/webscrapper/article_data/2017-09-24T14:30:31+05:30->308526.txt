TV actress  , who was part of Savitri Devi College & Hospital is livid at producer Rashmi Sharma. Reason?   has been ousted from the show without being informed. The reason cited by the production house behind her replacement was that the actress was not happy with her character's growth on the show and also had some travel plans. However, the actress lashed out at the producer of the show on social media claiming none of the above reasons were true. 

 She shared a long post on her Instagram and Twitter handle and vented out her anger. 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 When contacted, Kishwer confirmed the news and said, "This is definitely one of the bad expereince of my life. I have decided I will never work with the production house,  . I used to travel with a fractured foot to shoot with them and this is what I have got in return. They didn't even bother to inform me about my replacement. If they can do this to an actor like me who has worked in the industry for so long, then imagine what must be happening to the newcomers."
 
 On being asked, if she is planning to report it to CINTAA, the actress said, "Just like you guys even people from CINTAA read my post and called me. They have assured me that a strict action will be taken against the production house. They told me that noone has the right to behave with an artist in this manner." 
 
 Kishwer began her career in 1997 with the TV show Shaktimaan in which she played the role of Julia, an assistant. She has been part of successful shows like Hip Hip Hurray, Des Mein Niklla Hoga Chand, Kutumb, Kasautii Zindagii Kay, Kayaamat, Hatim, Khichdi and   to name a few.
