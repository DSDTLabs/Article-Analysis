NEW DELHI: A passenger and a staffer of a ground handling agency at   airport have been arrested for trying to   in   from Bangkok. The gold was shaped like a key and was painted silver to avoid detection.

 Custom sleuths found the passenger taking help of a staffer to get the gold pass through the security. The accused had smuggled gold using similar modus operandi in the past as well.
 
 On Wednesday, when the passenger landed from Bangkok and was crossing the green channel, Customs officers, who were tipped off about the act, carried out a detail check of the baggage only to find two keys that seemed heavier than normal. 
 
 “The weight of the keys was about 215gms. The passenger revealed that he was working in tandem with the staffer who was also arrested soon after,” said a senior officer.
 
 The accused had earlier smuggled in approximately 750gms of gold. 
 
 “We have recovered 980gms gold in total with a value of around Rs 27.47 lakh,” said the official.
