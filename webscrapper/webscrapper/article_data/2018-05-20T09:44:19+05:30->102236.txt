MANALI : The wait of lakhs of tourists wishing to go to the   pass and Ladakh from Manali got over after the Kullu administration on Saturday decided to allow tourist movement on the   highway with immediate effect.

 “A joint inspection by SDM Manali, police, tourism department and BRO found that the movement of tourists to Rohtang and beyond was safe and all infrastructural arrangements have been made. So, the tourists are allowed to go to Rohtang pass or Ladakh with immediate effect from Saturday,” Kullu DC Yunus said.
 
 Most of the tourists wait for opening of Rohtang pass before planning their trip to Himachal. As soon as the pass opens, tourists from plains make a beeline for Himachal. Not only Manali, but the tourist rush in Shimla, Dalhousie, Dharamshala and other parts of the state is expected to increase from Sunday onwards. Rohtang has enough snow for tourists, which will last for the next few weeks.
 
 Snow from Manali-Rohtang-Keylong highway was cleared on April 8 and Manali-Leh highway was opened on May 11. It took some time for the administration to make arrangements like mobile toilets, parking and garbage collection facilities. 800 petrol and 400 diesel vehicles can obtain online permit to go to Rohtang after paying congestion charges of Rs 50 and permit fee of Rs 500. Rohtang will remain closed every Tuesday.
 
 Manali SDM Raman Gharsangi said vehicles going to Ladakh, Lahaul, Pangi and Spiti will also have to obtain permits online by paying congestion charges of Rs 50 for passenger vehicles and Rs 100 for goods vehicles. “A vehicle can get a permit twice a week. We shall keep an eye on the weather conditions. Tourist movement can be stopped at Marhi in case of inclement weather conditions at the Rohtang pass,” he said.
