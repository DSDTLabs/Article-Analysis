Colva: With Aadhaar gaining importance not only as an identity proof and a document necessary to avail government social security schemes but also for banking and filing tax returns, the 12-digit biometric record is in high demand. Now, the telecom department (DoT) has also joined the bandwagon and made it mandatory for all operators to re-verify their existing and new customers through Aadhaar-based e-know your customer (eKYC). Service providers have to complete the process by February 6, 2018 and have begun informing customers across the state. Several users have already received notifications from their cellular service providers asking them to link their mobile number to their unique identification (UID) number, sending them scrambling to register for Aadhar or rectify their Aadhar data.   Aadhaar registrations and changes are being done at 11 centres across the state. Authorized by Goa Electronic Ltd, the private Aadhaar office at Mathany Saldanha Complex in Margao managed by senior software developer Darshan Naik and his two staff, is finding it difficult to handle the rush, with appointments booked well into the next month. A similar scene was witnessed at Porvorimâ€™s Vtech Computers where Aadhar services are provided solely on appointment and the current waitlist is a fortnight long. A representative of a private telecom operator, however, urged people not to panic and said there was ample time to complete their e-KYC.
