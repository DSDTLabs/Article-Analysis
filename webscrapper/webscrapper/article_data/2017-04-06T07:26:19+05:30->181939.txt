PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: District guardian minister   said on Monday that the separate   for   would be slightly delayed as only a   has been made. 

 “Preliminary discussions are on for the separate police commissionerate and we have also prepared a basic plan. The most important thing is the large police staff for the commissionerate. We will also have to look into the budgetary allocations for the building,” Bapat told reporters after meeting the family members of a girl student who was injured in an attack on Monday morning in Wakad. 
 
 He added that its location is also important, as it should be easily accessible.
 
 Bapat also said that he has spoken to many police officials, including commissioner Rashmi Shukla about measures needed to curb rising incidents of crime.
 
 During campaigning in Pimpri Chinchwad ahead of the 2017 municipal elections, chief minister   had said that there would be a separate police commissionerate for the twin township.
 
 The first proposal for the commissionerate was sent about nine years back by the city police. Last year, a fresh proposal was sent. 
 
 The commissionerate would cover jurisdictions of Hinjewadi, Sangvi, Pimpri Chinchwad, Nigdi and Bhosari. In addition, Dehu Road, Talegaon, Vadgaon Maval and Kamshet police stations could be merged with the new commissionerate. All these police stations come under the Pune rural police.
 
 Similarly, there are also plans to cover Paud and Chakan police stations. Under Chakan police station, there is a major industrial belt. Under the proposed police commissionerate, major highways like the Mumbai-Pune highway, the Pune-Nashik highway, Katraj-Dehu Road bypass and the Mumbai-Pune expressway would also fall.
