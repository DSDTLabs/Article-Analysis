Ponda: Members of the Ponda Municipal Council (PMC) met on Monday evening to enlist the works undertaken by them over the past five years. The meeting was the last one to be held during the current council’s tenure. Elections for a new council have been scheduled for April 29.  In her final address as PMC chairperson, Radhika Nayak said she was satisfied that the civic body had tried its best to make the lives of its citizens more convenient. “We had promised to give Ponda citizens a cleaner and greener town. Our efforts towards this end have been lauded by the government,” she said. The civic body was commended for implementing door-to-door segregation of garbage and for providing the maximum amount of plastic waste to the authorities concerned for further processing. Twelve of the 14 councillors attended the meeting, during which it was resolved to shift spice vendors to the town’s new market complex and to seek assistance from the water resources department to desilt the Ponda nullah. The civic body’s ambitious Golden Jubilee project is expected to be completed in the following tenure, the chairperson said.
