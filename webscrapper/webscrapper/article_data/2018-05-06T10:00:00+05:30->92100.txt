Chanda Dutta.
 
  
 The event began with a speech by Sajjad, who spoke about the book and his experience of writing it. “The idea of this book came to me when I was in Dhaka. But while writing it, I realised it cannot be done anywhere else but Darjeeling, where Anjan Dutt spent a major time of his life,” he said.
 
  
 Following Sajjad’s speech, Anjan read out the chapter of the book which describes his experience of working with director   in his 1994 film, Shilpi. “I do not think that I have reached a point in my life when someone should be writing my biography. However, Sajjad has been very honest with his work and he has portrayed the real Anjan Dutt in his writing,” Anjan added.
