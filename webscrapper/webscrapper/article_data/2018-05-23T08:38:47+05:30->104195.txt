JAIPUR: The residents of   Tila No. 7 have to travel from bikes and tempos to get clean water from far-away places. Reason: Water supplied to them comes for half-an-hour in the morning out of which for 15 minutes they receive contaminated water.

 There are around 200 houses in the area and residents said that they have to face acute   in summers. There have been cases of fights and people have had to go to nearby areas and parks to fill their vessels. Few years back there was no direct water pipeline in the area. Government used to send water tankers to fill tanks already placed there. However, since the direct pipelines have been laid down the tankers are not sent but residents now have to deal with water shortage and contamination.
 
 Sagar  , one of the residents said that contaminated water is being supplied for the last one month and they have complained to their area corporator and even in PHED department but no action has been taken. “There is no use of complaining. It’s been 10 days and no PHED officer has visited the area and we were just given false hope. For first 15 minutes the water smells like sewer water and then fresh water starts coming. Even I haven’t taken a bath since morning and waiting for the tanker we ordered. Don’t know when will government wake up to our plight,” said Narwal.
 
 As government does not supply water tankers, residents order private tankers on every third day due to scarcity.  , executive engineer of that area denied any complaint being received from the residents. “We have not received any complaint otherwise this problem would have been solved. There might have been a leakage from some pipe. We will send our engineers there and will do a proper research. This issue will be solved as soon as we receive our report,” said Katara.
