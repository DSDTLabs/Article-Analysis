CHENNAI: Continuing his scathing attack on   and DMK working president M K  , AIADMK deputy general secretary   on Friday said attempts to destroy the party and the government would never succeed. As   decimated her rivals after the demise of MGR, those trying to split the AIADMK would also be routed, he said while addressing party cadres at Thirunindravur. 

 Sasikala's nephew has been keeping himself busy by reaching out to cadres to drum up support for the party over the last two days. After his first public meeting in Mylapore, Dinakaran on Friday unveiled the statues of MGR and Jayalalithaa in Ambattur and sought to give a pep talk to cadres, whose morale has hit a new low after the demise of Jayalalithaa. Hitting out at his friend-turned-foe O Panneerselvam for revolting against the party high command, Dinakaran said, "Appointed by you all,   ( ) led the party along the path shown by Amma (Jayalaithaa). But she is away in Bengaluru prison. We are confident that we will get her out of prison with your support". 
 
 Dinakaran sought cooperation from the cadres to stabilize the government, which he said had been striving for the people's welfare. "Stalin has been making all out efforts to topple the government. He will not succeed. AIADMK government will remain stable," he said. The former MP has been meeting senior functionaries district-wise in a bid to bring them around as there are reports of defection at all levels. Dinakaran also referred to O Panneerselvam as "zero PS".
