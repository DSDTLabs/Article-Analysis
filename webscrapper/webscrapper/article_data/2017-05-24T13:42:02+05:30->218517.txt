THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Kerala government should adopt an “inclusive attitude“ towards stakeholders of   schools while taking decisions and framing policies related to education, the Kerala CBSE   said on Tuesday.

 While unaided schools are unable to pay the wages fixed by the state government for aided schools, the association was willing to meet the government to fix a new wage scale, they told a press conference here.
 
 Earlier, a meeting of the association, attended by the representatives of around 200 schools, also discussed issues like teacher salaries, fee structure, school transportation, making   compulsory and hosting a national youth festival.
 
 “The state government will be made aware that the fee structures vary in rural and urban areas and there is no blanket high fee structure across the state,“ said association general secretary  .
 
 There should be at least 185 working days in the year. While in the past couple of years, the CBSE adopted a lenient academic pattern, it has now become tougher with a schedule of about 200 working days, particularly in Classes IX and X, she said.
 
 The state child rights panel must consider this while taking decisions about school days, she added.
 
 While the CBSE guidelines call for speed governors with 40km for school buses, the circular also notes that it can vary, depending on the conditions of a particular road and in agreement with the state government. “The association has been in touch with transport minister   to increase the speed limit to 50km in the coming academic year,“ the office bearers said.
 
 The CBSE schools in Kerala teach Malayalam till Class VIII, while the state government has now made it compulsory till Class X, they said.
 
 “The central nature of the CBSE syllabus makes this difficult and we want the government to take a lenient position towards Class IX and X students, particularly with students transferring into and out of the state,“ they said.
