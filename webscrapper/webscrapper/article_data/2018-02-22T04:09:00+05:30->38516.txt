Vadodara: They were to leave for Jharkhand on Wednesday night to participate in the 8th National Deaf Cricket Tournament to be held in Ranchi later this week. But the Gujarat cricket team players were a disappointed lot after they learnt that the tournament has been postponed. 

 The team was told that the tournament couldn’t be held as the ground was not available on all days. 
 
 “All arrangements for the tournament were done but the organizers were told that the ground won’t be available for more than two days while the tournament was of eight days. So, the All India Cricket Association of the Deaf decided to postpone the tournament,” said Nitendra Singh, coach of the Indian Disabled Cricket Team. “The tournament will now be held at Jamshedpur in April,” he added. 
 
 The sudden postponement, however, came as a rude shock for the players who had been practicing for the tournament over last few days. A team from the other state, who had left for Ranchi, had to turn back. All the players had to cancel their train tickets. Gujarat team captain, Imran Sheikh had run from pillar to post for organize a camp to prepare for the tourney. 
 
 The Deaf Cricket Association of Vadodara had expressed its helplessness to support the team due to problem of funds. But Sheikh, who runs a deaf cricket club, was determined to organize the camp. From royal scion, Samarjitsinh Gaekwad to realtor Bharat Sutreja and animal activist, Neha Patel, good Samaritans helped the team in organizing the camp by providing food, ground and accommodation. 
 
 “This is disappointing as the players had trained hard for this tournament. Such sudden postponement shows that our cricket isn’t still taken much seriously by the organizers,” said one of the players from Gujarat.
