The first birthday of Dhruvender, grandson of MP   and son of   and Dr  , was celebrated in a grand way at an upmarket convention centre in the city recently. The guests pampered the baby boy with numerous gifts and wished him a wonderful future. While the white and blue-themed d√©cor embellished with chandeliers and candles was a feast to the eyes, the mellow strains of soulful melodies played live on a saxophone added an extra zing to the ambience. Later, everyone bonded with each other over a delicious spread. This well-decked do also saw   and actor   making their presence felt.
