JALANDAR: Amid reports that AAP MP  , while addressing a rally at Jagraon, asked people to raise their hands if they wanted to see him as chief minister of Punjab, party’s Punjab affairs in charge   on Sunday played it safe on the issue by saying that CM candidate would be announced at the appropriate time.

 Asked about it during a press conference here on Sunday, Sanjay claimed that Mann had only said that he would be happy if he would be made CM. “Who will not be happy if given such a responsibility. Anybody could say that,” he said. When asked if Mann would be their CM candidate, he said that party would take a decision only at an appropriate time. 
 
 Asked other leaders could also start saying so and would it not lead to indiscipline, Sanjay said that Mann only said that he would be happy to get the responsibility and that was the correct context and it did not amount to indiscipline. He was here to address meetings with traders, industry representatives. 
 
 Meanwhile asked about the   president Jagmeet Brar’s allegations that the AAP had deceived him on the alliance issue, Sanjay said, “Brar had always been saying he would give unconditional support to the AAP and we believed his promise. Now what transpired within their party on the issue and why did they decide to field their own candidates only he could tell.” He said that there was no further scope for alliance with anybody and the only alliance in the state was with   brothers.
