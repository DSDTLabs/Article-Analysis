 The common issues, which have been collated from the minutes of several DLC meetings that seem to be pertaining to almost the entire 13 policing districts, include concerns over traffic congestion and road engineering, unauthorised parking, consumption of liquor at public places, sale of illicit liquor, encroachments along the pavements and pedestrian areas resulting in traffic congestion, deployment of police at parks and schools during opening and closing time and incidents of thefts.
 
 “The meetings have been held recently in July in southeast, west, northwest, Rohini, north-east and Shahdara districts which provided a real time feedback on several policing initiatives and led to modifications in key schemes,” said Madhur Verma, PRO, Delhi Police.
 
 Police officers said that “The benefits of this inter-disciplinary approach towards community policing are also reflected in the follow-up meetings where the agenda points and minutes of the previous meetings are laid bare before the gathering.”
