Gurgaon: After environmentalists raised an alarm, the   department has clarified that the dead animal found near   on Saturday was a   and not a  , as it had said earlier. 

 “We had received some pictures in the morning and since only ground staff was present in the area they couldn’t identify the animal properly. However, after the post mortem, we confirmed that it was a civet cat,” said an official in the wildlife department. 
 
 Sharad Gaur, an environmentalist with the Centre for Environment Education (CEE) pointed out that a civet cat shouldn’t have been confused with a hyena that, too, by the wildlife department.
 
 “The animal in the photo is cat-sized with a long tail. The overall impression is that of a large squirrel, which is a civet character. The Indian hyena has long black stripes on a brown body, and the tail is bushy without stripes. The dead animal has round spots, no stripes, and the long tail has rings; all these are characteristics of a civet,” said Gaur.
 
 Sameer Jha, an animal lover who often explore wildlife in Aravalis, also criticised the wildlife department for the gaffe.
 
 “While hyena’s facial appearance is very blunt with a broad snout, a civet cat has a pointed rat-like face with pointed muzzle. The dead animal is definitely a civet cat. The civet looks like a cross between a fox and a cat,” said Jha.
 
 The post-mortem report has confirmed that it was a one-and-half year old civet and the cause of death was road accident.
 
 A carcass was found last Saturday in Mandawar village near Sohna, with damaged limbs and injury marks on its ears and nose.
