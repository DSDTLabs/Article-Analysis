CHANDIGARH: It has been three months since the   estate office launched its ambitious online appointment system, but the project is yet to evoke a healthy response from the public. 

 So far, the estate office has received only 10 applications on the   that was started on January 22, 2018.
 
 Residents can use the portal to book online appointments for availing a total of four services, including transfer on the basis of sale deed (without litigation), transfer on the basis of family transfer deed, transfer on the basis of gift deed, and permission to mortgage in favour of nationalised banks.
 
 The services are also available at e-Sampark centres. Chandigarh boasts a strong network of 18 e-Sampark centres, 11 kiosks, and 14 Gram   centres.
 
 The online system has been launched with an aim to spare residents the ordeal of running from pillar to post to avail the services at the estate office.
 
 A senior official said that residents were not coming forward because of the lack of awareness about the online system. 
 
 He added that many properties in Chandigarh are also under litigation, which makes them ineligible for the service.
 
 As per the procedure, the owner of the property will have to submit a request in the estate office either online or through the e-Sampark counter and upload the requisite form according to his/her request along with a copy of the complete application file. The applicant will get the date and time of appointment to appear in the estate office personally along with original documents as per the prescribed booklet and his request will be processed thereafter. 
 
 The files will be dealt with as per first-come-first-serve basis. A total of 25 slots per day will be given for appointment at the estate office.
