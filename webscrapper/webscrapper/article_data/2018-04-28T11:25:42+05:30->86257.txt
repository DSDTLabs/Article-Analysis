LUCKNOW: UP government has set up a seven-member electoral reform committee to look at the possibility of having simultaneous elections in the state and having a common electoral roll for all elections. 

 The committee, set up under the chairmanship of cabinet minister  , is looking into the viability of having a common electoral roll which can be used for all elections, if it is possible to link the electoral roll to   and possibility to conduct all elections simultaneously.
 
 "I have formed two sub-committees headed by former bureaucrats, first by Anuj Bishnoi to explore probability of common electoral roll, and second by   to study the possibility of holding simultaneous elections. Both committees have submitted their draft reports which will now be combined into one by May 1. It will then be submitted to CM   on whose initiative this work is being carried out, by May 31," said Singh.
 
 The proposal of linking voters' list to Aadhaar card was mooted by Governor   when he asked the CM to look into this possibility as a means of reducing electoral fraud. 
 
 Prime Minister   has been urging for a debate on the idea of simultaneous polls to Lok Sabha and state assemblies.
 
 "UP is probably the first state where such an exercise is being undertaken," said Singh.
 
 A number of suggestions have been received from the committees which, if accepted, would have to be implemented in a phased manner.
