SURAT: All the police stations in the city have been instructed to take strict action against unscrupulous private financiers, who are driving debt-ridden individuals to commit suicide. City police data shows that 45 cases have been registered against private financiers from January 2017 to February 2018.

 City police officers have also been instructed to clear all pending applications related to harassment by private financiers. Cops are confused how to deal with financial cases because some individuals do lodge false complaints too against financiers just to avoid repaying the debt. Police had booked many of the private financiers for extortion and harassment and so far have arrested 93 people while eight accused are yet to be nabbed. Of the total 45 cases, 15 have been registered at   police station since the drive against unscrupulous private financiers began in 2017.
 
 City police commissioner Satish   had ordered the drive in 2017 after a few cases of harassment were reported. “We are taking strict action against all those financiers who are involved in an unlawful activity. We are encouraging people to approach police even in matters involving smallest of amounts to stop them from taking the extreme step,” Sharma said.
