The BJP came tantalizingly close to the halfway mark in  , stopping just a few seats short of an outright victory. In a bid to stop the saffron party from making inroads into south India through the state, the Congress offered support to JD(S), which the latter has accepted.

 
 
 
 1. Strengthens BJP’s winner tag ahead of important state polls where it is in office. Despite falling just short of majority in Karnataka, party gets the better of Congress and boosts its prospects as front runner for 2019 Lok Sabha election
 
 2. Opposition leadership remains diffused. Congress’s losing run against BJP hampers projection of Rahul Gandhi as leader. The federal front gets a boost with Mamata Banerjee and K Chandrasekhar Rao calling for an “alliance of equals” and suggesting Congress should cede ground in states where it cannot be the main challenger to BJP
 
 3. Success of strategies for Hindu consolidation will encourage BJP to vigorously pursue a Hindu vote along with its welfare and develepment programmes like Mudra loans, Jan Dhan accounts, cooking gas and LED promotion, enhanced support for farmers
 
 4. The fight now moves to Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Congress has done well in Rajasthan but will have a fight on its hands in the other two states
 
 5. In the country’s map dominated by saffron, the east coast stands out with regional parties in office in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Bengal. Though not all are opposed to BJP — AIADMK is an ally, BJD has often been neutral — these represent difficult forts for BJP that is number two in Odisha and West Bengal, but not in a dominant position
