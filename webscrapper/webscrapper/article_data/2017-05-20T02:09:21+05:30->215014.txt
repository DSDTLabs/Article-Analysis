BENGALURU: The   on Friday requested   to conduct a comprehensive inquiry into the death of   Anurag Tewari in Lucknow. “We will extend full cooperation to UP government in this regard,” chief minister Siddaramaiah said.

 The move comes in the backdrop of Tewari’s family alleging he faced harassment as food and civil supplies commissioner in Bengaluru. 
 
 The family suspects foul play in his death even though the autopsy report suggests he could have died of asphyxia. The issue took a political turn with UP minister Suresh Kumar Khanna telling in the assembly that Tewari was about to expose a Rs 2,000 crore scam in the Karnataka government’s food and civil supplies department.
 
 Denying the allegations, CM Siddaramaiah said, “There is no scam in the food and civil supplies department, please do not speculate. We will request UP government to inquire and we will cooperate with the authorities.”
 
 Sources in the bureaucracy, meanwhile, maintained that Tewari was not subjected to any harassment from any quarters. Karnataka food and civil supplies minister U T Khader said was with thedepartment for just 132 days and worked for just 38 days.
