HYDERABAD: Former attorney general Mukul Rohatgi on Thursday urged the Hyderabad High Court to quash the   case filed against Koneru Madhu in the Emaar-APIIC land scam case. Madhu is the son of  , the key accused in the case. 

 Appearing for Madhu, the former AG told Justice B Siva Sankara Rao, who was hearing the quash petition, that CBI went on presumptions in the case rather than relying on evidence. Of all the villa plots sold in the project, money pertaining to two came into the Dubai account of Madhu and this was later returned to the plot owners, he said. Except this, there was no material against Madhu nor did he play any role, Rohatgi said. CBI too was not able to provide any proof that he conspired with the accused to sell away all the plots at a throw away price, he contended.
 
 According to Avinash Desai, the counsel who roped in Rohatgi, the allegations made in the chargesheet did not fulfil the ingredients of any offence at all. Madhu's father must have told Stylish Homes promoter T Ranga Rao to instruct the two villa plot buyers to deposit some amount in his son's account, the former AG said. And upon instructions from his father, Madhu returned that money . â€œIt is incorrect to see a conspiracy in what happened between a father and his son," Rohatgi said.
 
 The judge sought CBI's response and posted the case to Monday.
