CHANDIGARH: PGI has been directed by the Union health ministry to gradually turn cashless, post-demonetisation. Although   has introduced Mobikwik, PGI has only started   for credit and debit card for patients so far. According to data from the PGI, 22% of the transactions is being done from these swipe cards since currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 were scrapped.

 Every day, there are over 5,000 OPD patients who visit the institute. “The other app-based payment systems come with additional charges. So, we have swipe card machines to turn cashless,” said Manju Wadwalkar, official spokesperson, PGI.
 
 Resident doctors have Paytm in the doctors’ canteen to enable cashless payment. “Two days after demonetization, we introduced Paytm in our canteen,” said Dr Seran Kumar Reddy, president, Association of Resident Doctors, PGI. The canteen for patients near the doctors’ canteen does not have cashless facility available. “We have to pay 2% on every transaction, so this is not profitable. Most patients carry cash,” said a worker at the tuck shop at the PGI. 
 
 All the fee counters have swipe machines. “But there are times when the server goes down, adding to the queues,” said Gurmeet Kaur, a patient who had had to wait longer to pay the registration card.
 
 The Government Multi-specialty Hospital, Sector 16, has done away with Rs 2 cost of the OPD registration card in its efforts to go cashless. “Instead of installing swipe machines or some online system of transaction, for such a small amount that would have turned costlier, we decided to start it for free,” said an official in the health department, UT.
