LUCKNOW: Getting a registration number of your choice for your new vehicle may become possible in the days to come as the   office has sent a proposal in this regard.

  (RTO) Lucknow gets several requests for registration numbers of choice in a month, but can not allot it outof-turn. “People say they would wait for their preferred number tilltheend of theongoing series. Many peoplekeep their vehicles unregistered till then,” said sources.
 
 
 The RTO office has sent a proposal to transport department to let it allot the requested registration number in current series and out-ofturn on extra payment.
 
 “To let people have a personalised registration number, an amendment would be required in the MV Act since it would involve generating extra revenue by charging extra fee,” said sources.
