 : One person was killed and two others injured, including an Army man, purportedly after a welding gas cylinder went off in  , 7 km from here, on Wednesday.
 
  A bomb disposal squad and police forensic team have been investigating the matter.
  
  Pithoragarh superintendent of police Ajay Joshi said, “Nirmal Kumar, 45, and his helper Vishal, 22, both residents of Pithoragarh, were welding iron rods at a garage construction site in Cantt when the blast took place, killing   on the spot and injuring   grievously, while an army man who was standing nearby received minor injuries.”
  
  “The cause of the blast in unknown yet but, primarily, it doesn’t seem any work of sabotage. Presumably, it was an accident that might have caused due to high-tension electric line or welding cylinder blast,” said SP.
  
  “Vishal has been admitted to the district hospital. He is shocked and is unable to talk about the accident. We have sent a bomb disposal squad and forensic team for investigation,” added the SP.
