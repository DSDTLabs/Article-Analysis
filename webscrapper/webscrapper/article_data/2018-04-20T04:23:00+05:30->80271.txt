Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court’s order restraining publication of news on the surge in revenues of the company owned by  , the son of BJP president Amit Shah, will continue to be in effect after the petitioner on Thursday decided to withdraw his review petition seeking that the gag order be lifted.

 The issue pertains to an article which had appeared on a news portal in October last year.
 
 Justice Paresh Upadhyay, who had restored the gag order passed by the civil court, had agreed to hear the review petition filed by a tribal rights activist, Ramesh Bhabhor. The petitioner contended that due to the HC’s prohibitory order, he cannot discuss with members of Scheduled Tribes from other states about the condition of freedom of speech and expression in Gujarat.
 
 The court had even asked Jay Shah’s advocates to put forth their arguments on why the gag order should not be lifted so as to allow people to discuss the issue in public fora. Shah’s lawyers were expected to argue their case on Thursday.
 
 However, in the morning, petitioner’s advocate Paresh Waghela requested the court to permit him to withdraw the review petition.
 
 A civil court in Ahmedabad had restrained media from publishing news about Shah’s company, after he filed a Rs 100 crore defamation suit against the news portal. The gag order was relaxed by the civil court earlier this year. Shah objected to the relaxation and Justice Upadhyay on February 20 reinstated the blanket ban.
