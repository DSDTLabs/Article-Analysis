Ludhiana: For lighting arrangements inside the Pakhowal Road Indoor Stadium, civic officials have decided to utilize solar energy. At present, there is no electricity connection in this indoor stadium, which is hardly used, and at night time, the stadium looks like a haunted arena. Officials claimed that installation of rooftop solar panels has begun under the Smart City Mission, and in the first phase, solar system with a 10kw capacity has been planned.

 Constructed at a cost of Rs 85 crore, the air-conditioned indoor stadium is running without a power connection, because MC authorities did not try to get it so far, fearing hefty bills, especially as the stadium hardly comes into use. Inaugurated in November 2016, the stadium has only been used for organizing events, and there is no provision for the practice of games.
 
 MC commissioner Jaskiran Singh, while confirming the move, said solar panels were being installed on the roof of security office at the stadium’s entrance, so as to generate electricity through a natural source, and provide light at least inside the stadium. “But for events, organizers will have to depend on generator sets,” he added.
 
 Notably, the stadium has a seating capacity of 4,000 people, and a sports arena of 1,100 square metres. In this stadium, along with indoor sports activities, there is provision for a club house, library, separate dressing rooms for players, practice grounds for teams, 74 shops, lifts, and a double basement with a capacity of parking 250-300 cars. Around 74 shops are also available in the stadium, and MC has to sell these shops, but so far, officials have not taken any decision in this regard.
