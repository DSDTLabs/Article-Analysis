HYDERABAD: After a long wait, MMTS services between   and Bolarum will soon be a reality.

 On March 14, Ram  , commissioner of railway safety, South Central Circle, Secunderabad will carry out an inspection on the 10 km electrified stretch, along with principal chief electrical engineer A P Padhke and divisional railway manager of Hyderabad,  .
 
 “The over head equipment from Malkajgiri to Bolarum was energized at 25 KV on February 2 and the trial run of an electric loco was done the next day,” said Noor Ahmed Ali, general secretary of the suburban Train Travellers’ Association, Malkajgiri.
 
 “If the railway is able to run the trains on time, there will be no demand for augmenting express trains with additional stoppage at certain station. There should be a particular platform for the Bolarum-bound trains, sothat people will not have to run from one platform to the other or cross tracks,” Noor added.
