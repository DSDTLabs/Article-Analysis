Bathinda: Muktsar police on Thursday releasedthe CCTV footage of the six masked men who robbed Rs 10.27 lakh on Wednesday from the SBI’s Sarawa Bodla village branch. The intruders had decamped with digital video recorder of the bank branch and mobile phones of the bank employees. The police collected the footage from some other places in the village. In the footage the six persons could be seen riding different motorbikes of black colour and all seemed young, said a police official.

 Muktsar SSP Sushil Kumar said that, “As the robbers had decamped with a DVR from bank the police collected CCTV footage from other sources in the village and we are hopeful of arresting the persons involved in bank robbery at the earliest.” He, however, did not divulge any more details and said it could hamper the police efforts to nab the culprits. 
 
 The six masked persons looted Rs 10.27 lakh and 50 gm of gold jewellery at gunpoint from the bank branch. The masked men were armed with three weapons and three knives. Sarawa Bodla is the native village of notorious gangster Harjinder Singh. The branch has the strength of five employees but three were on leave on Wednesday, leaving behind two employees and a peon when the crime was committed. As there was no security guard in the bank branch the culprits managed to escape easily.
 
 Bathinda Range DIG Ashish Chaudhary claimed that the police were leaving no stone unturned to arrest the persons responsible for the heist.
