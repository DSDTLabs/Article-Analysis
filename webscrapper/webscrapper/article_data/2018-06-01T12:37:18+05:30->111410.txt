A wise man once said that all stories are love stories. Filmmaker Zoya Akhtar’s films have always had a strong undercurrent of love and romance. At a recent event for her upcoming film, the director spoke about the importance of love stories in Indian culture. She believes Indian culture feeds off the idea of love a lot more than the West. Talking on the subject, she said, “Different cultures go to cinema for different reasons. A few reasons why our audience goes to the movies, is for escapism, fantasy and aspiration. They watch films with the hope that they will get something from it, which they don’t have.”

 According to Zoya, the restrictions on romance in Indian culture play an important part in our obsession with the thought of love. She adds, “Sadly, love is still a taboo in our culture. We’re still not completely allowed to have love marriages, there are restrictions on dating. Your parents still decide who you get to spend the rest of your life with. The ultimate fantasy in India is to see a boy or girl fall in love and end up happily, no matter what sort of opposition happens in their life. Love stories will always be big in our films, till our culture changes.”
