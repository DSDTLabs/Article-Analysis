VADODARA:   at the   (BCA) on Friday when the hurriedly conveyed managing committee meet passed the   for year 2014-15. Members of the ruling   approved the balance sheet during the meet. 

 But members of the Royal Group accused the management of acting with malaise. “The total advanced budget for 2014-15 was Rs 15.50 crore of which BCA spent Rs 13.42, thereby saving Rs 2.08 crore. We spent Rs 9 crore towards cricketing expense, Rs 1.50 crore for ground maintenance and property expense and Rs 1.5 crore for administration and establishment expense. We had fixed deposit of Rs 125 crore in 2014-15. The IT returns too have been filed,” said BCA treasurer, Amul Jikar. 
 
 Managing committee member and Royal Group supporter, Jatin Vakil, however, said, “This is contempt of court. The Gujarat high court had asked the association to maintain status quo and not take any policy decision. We will inform the court about this meeting.” 
 
 He added that they got email about the meeting being held at 11 am on Friday and everyone was asked to be present at 1.30 pm. “We were not even given copies of the balance sheet. What was such hurry to approve the balance sheet? Their intention is not good,” Vakil told TOI. 
 
 “BCA is a trust and there were some operational difficulties. The recent   took lot of time to assess the situation and hence we had to call this meeting,” Jikar said. 
 
 Sources in BCA said that had the association not passed the balance sheet by March 31 they would have faced penalty from the income tax department for late filing.
