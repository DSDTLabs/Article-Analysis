PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Work on the waste-to-energy plant at the   garbage   is expected to start within a month. An area of 6.24 acres has been allotted to a single entity consisting of two private companies by the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation for the purpose. 

  
  
 The   (waste-to-energy) plant will be on design-build-operate-transfer basis for a period of 21 years. The companies have to ready the plant within one-and-a-half years. 
 
 Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar had formed a technical advisory committee to consider the plant’s technical and financial models. Hardikar said the plant is being built under the Swachh Bharat mission. Three companies had submitted the tenders of which the one with the lowest bid was selected. Two companies have joined hands to build the plant at a cost Rs 208.36 crore. 
 
 The PCMC, which has done mechanical composting and sanitary landfill at the depot, may consider giving Rs 50 crore for the project. “While the city generates at least 800 tonnes of garbage daily, the joint bidders have been asked to set up a plant which can process 1,000 tonnes of garbage every day,” environment department officials said.
 
 The plant has to generate at least 11.5 MW power every day. Officials said the operator is free to sell the power to any power utility. If it is unable to find buyers, the PCMC will purchase power at the rate of Rs 5 per unit. The scope of work includes segregation and recovery of municipal waste, processing compost from biodegradable waste and recovering energy. “According to pollution control rules, power generation projects should have no atmospheric emissions except combustion gases, with pollutant levels within the limits mentioned by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board or the Central Pollution Control Board,” they said.
