 Mahajan spoke about   and her skills of governance. “I would like to recall the legacy of a great woman who belongs to this soil and whose contributions for women’s uplift was remarkable. She was Ahilyabai Holkar. A noble, saintly and courageous woman, he had been a queen of Indore, but more importantly, she was the queen of hearts of the people,” she said. 
 
 Ahilya Bai is still remembered and worshipped for her great administrative qualities and dispensing justice without fear or favour, the Speaker said, adding, “I feel privileged to represent this constituency for the last 28 years which was once ruled by this legendary woman.”
 
 The Lok Sabha Speaker could not stop expressing her love for Indore and its people while addressing parliamentarians from six nations and deviated from her written speech to give details of the city that is known for its culinary delights.
 
 “Indore is known for eating. We have 56 shops lined up for people to eat. We have named it 56 Shops (Chhappan Dukaan),” she said, adding: “We have a Sarafa Bazaar -- essentially a bullion market, but it transforms into an eating destination by night. I don’t know if the delegates will get to go to these places; but we have arranged for a tour to Mandu."
