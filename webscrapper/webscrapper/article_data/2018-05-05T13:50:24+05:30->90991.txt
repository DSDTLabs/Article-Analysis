MADURAI: Electronic and bio medical wastes pose new challenges to the city civic body in solid waste management, said   corporation commissioner Aneesh Sekhar. He took part and inaugurated the capacity building programme of urban civic bodies and stakeholders on waste management rules 2016 on Friday. 

 According to health officials there are around 300 clinics and 50 major hospitals in Madurai city.
 
 The commissioner said that the civic body is dealing with around 700 tonnes of garbage every day. With the available resources and infrastructure facilities they are trying their best to effectively dispose them. In order to reduce the amount of garbage being produced, a fee is imposed by the civic body to collect them under waste management rules. 
 
 “It is an established rule that those who create pollution have to take the responsibility and pay for it. Nobody can get away without paying the price. This concept will help to reduce pollution to an extent,” Aneesh Sekhar said.
 
 City engineer A Mathuram said that Madurai has been a frontrunner in implementing the waste management rules, when compared to other cities in the state. Thirteen years ago, the corporation had to keep buying garbage bins every six months as the bins corroded. “We found a solution by fabricating dumper bins using stainless steel, which was the first in the country then. Many cities took cue from us. The bins are in good condition and serving the purpose even after 13 years,” he said.
 
 The city is facing garbage and sewage problems due to its population density. For every km there are 20, 000 people, which is very high. The population has to scatter and the city has to expand in order to bring about a solution to such issues,   added.
