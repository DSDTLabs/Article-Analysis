CHENNAI: In a big twist in the tale, the   government's chief prosecutor on Monday told the Madras high court that 119   legislators staying in two resorts, including Golden Bay Resorts at Koovathur, have given affidavits.
 
 This goes against AIADMK general secretary 
  .
  
 A submission to this effect was made by public prosecutor of Tamil Nadu R Rajarathinam when habeas corpus petitions alleging that AIADMK legislators were being kept in illegal confinement resorts came up for hearing. 
  
 A division bench of Justice M Jaichandren and Justice T Mathivanan, before which the pleas came up for hearing on Monday, reserved its orders on the matter.
  
 Earlier, K Balu, representing a voter seeking to servant liberty the MLA representing his constituency, said none of those kept in the resorts were free and that Tamil Nadu chief minister   himself had gone on record stating that the   were under illegal custody.
  
 Congress lawyer A P Suryaprakasam sought constitution of a court-appointed team to visit the resorts to ascertain first-hand what is the status of the MLAs there.
  
 Advocate Preetha, who filed a petition on behalf her aunt and MLA Geetha, said she feared for their safety.
  
 Rajarathinam, however, relied on the reports complied by revenue and police officials of Kancheepuram district, and said all the 119 affidavits did not have any complaint of illegal custody. He opposed any suggestion to depute court's own team.
  
 The bench, on its part, said it had its own legal limitations while hearing habeas corpus petitions, where the statement of the detenue alone would matter. However, when counsel wanted the court to summon the MLAs concerned for personal account, the judges did not heed to it.
  
 The AIADMK has a total of 134 MLAs in the assembly while the DMK has 98 MLAs including mine from allies.
  
 In the ongoing 
  , the latter had so far been claiming the support of 129 MLAs.
