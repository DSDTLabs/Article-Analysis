HYDERABAD: Over a dozen victims left blind in one eye, due to botched eye surgeries performed in 2016 at the state-run Sarojini Devi Eye Hospital, staged a protest at the   on Wednesday, demanding better compensation.

 Six of the victims received only Rs 1lakh each as compensation a few days ago, but they are demanding that a higher compensation of ?10 lakh be paid to all 13 victims.
 
 The victims are also threatening to go on a hunger strike if the   ( ) does not enhance their compensation.
 
 The issue had snowballed into a major controversy in 2016, when the hospital administration admitted that six persons had lost their eyesights due to botched surgeries and had given an assurance that the rest were being treated and would regain sight. NHRC took cognizance of the incident and ordered a compensation of Rs1 lakh each. However, the victims feel it is too meagre an amount, an amount to sustain themselves.
 
 Manikyam, 76, was among the victims who gathered on Wednesday at the hospital to demand higher compensation. “I lost vision in one eye completely after the cataract surgery. Now I am unable to do farming,” he said. Another victim, 27-year-old Nagalakshmi, who is a mother of two, ran into a series of family disputes after losing her eyesight.
 
 Victims said they had hoped for a recovery but did not regain their eyesight, and hence were demanding higher compensation.
 
 “NHRC had then decided the compensation amount only for six victims, without consulting with them. The amount is too meagre to compensate them for the loss of livelihood. Apart from the six who were given compensation, there were others who did not recover and have been doing rounds of the hospital,” said  , state secretary,   that organized the protest.
