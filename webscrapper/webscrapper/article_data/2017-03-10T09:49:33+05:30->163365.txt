AMRITSAR: For the first time the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) in Pakistan has decided to hold a mega Holi function in Lahore to appease the minority Hindu community. Talking to TOI on Thursday,   chairman Siddiq-ul-Farooq informed that they had decided to hold Holi festivities at Hazrat Ayesha Siddiqa Model Degree College on March 12. 

 Giving details, ETPB deputy secretary (Hindu affairs) Faraz Abbas said that earlier the Hindu community of Lahore used to celebrate the festival at Krishna temple, where they didn’t have sufficient space to play Holi. “Keeping in view the problems faced by the community, this year we have made Holi celebration arrangements at the open ground and the hall of Hazrat Ayesha Siddiqa Model Degree College,” he said.
 
 The ETPB had received confirmation of more than 300 Hindus and Sikhs arriving in Lahore from Sindh and Peshawar to celebrate Holi festival, he added. In view of their security, ETPB claims to have made elaborate arrangements in Lahore in this regard. “Security gates and   cameras are being installed at the venue, which will remain under round the clock under police protection,” he added.
