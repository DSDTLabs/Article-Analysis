Traders, manufacturers and business establishments require to file   ( ) returns from the month of July even if their turnover was nil, commissioner of   KK Khandelwal said on Monday.

 Addressing the media, Khandelwal said returns for the month of August can only be filed once the returns for July are submitted. "Delay in filing the return will invite penalty of Rs 200 per day till the time tax return is filed. 
 
 An additional 18% interest will also be charged on the pending amount of tax till the time of payment," he said.
 
 The commissioner also reminded people about the last dates and certain revisions that the government introduced to ease out the process. Khandelwal said till date, around 20% of the traders have not filed their GSTR-3B. 
 
 "The last date for filing returns for the month of July was September 20. Only after updating the returns for the month of July will one be able to file for August," he said, adding that the last date applied to both new registrants and those migrating to the new system.
 
 The department observed that the migration process, in case of large number of applicants, is incomplete in the wake of non-submission of form REG-26. 
 
 "Nearly 500 dealers in the state have not filled up the REG-26 form. Their migration to GST will not be considered valid till they do so," Khandelwal said. He added the last date for migration is September 30.
 
 On the composition scheme in which those with turnover of less than Rs 75 lakh annually annually can opt for a hassle-free tax filing, Khandelwal said the last date has been changed from August 16 to September 30. 
 
 "Both new and migrating dealers can opt for the composition scheme. The last date for filing GSTR-I is October 10. In order to avoid last minute rush, people should begin filing their details now," he said.
