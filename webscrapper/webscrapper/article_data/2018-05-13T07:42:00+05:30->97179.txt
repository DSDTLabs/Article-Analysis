FAZILKA: Unavailability of water in areas at the tail-end of   minor canal, has forced the farmers of Patti Sadiq, Jhuradkhera, Shergarh, Wariamkhera, Heeranwalai and   villages to resort to protest. Farmers from these villages staged a sit-in on the national highway near   village in Fazilka district on Saturday, disrupting the traffic.

 Protesting farmers raised slogans against the officials of the water resources department for not cleaning the canals properly, resulting into virtually no water reaching them.   of Patti Sadiq said the farmers of the area were suffering initially due to canal closure and then due to non-availability of water.
 
 “Scarcity of water has affected our crops and orchards. We are feeling helpless. We are also confused whether to sow cotton crop or not,” he said.   said several farmers of the area had recently met the executive engineer (XEN) of the water resources department but nothing had changed even after that.
 
 Shergarh village’s   alleged that the department had been informed that some influential farmers, having political affiliation, were stealing canal water by tampering with the sanctioned water outlets and thus obstructing the water to flow towards the tail-end. He alleged no action had initiated by the department to check the water theft and the farmers living at the tail-end of the canal were made to suffer. 
 
 “We are left with no other option but to stage dharna at road to make our grievance heard and will continue with the same till we get full share of our water at the tail-end,” he added.
 
 Meanwhile, the local administration and the officials of the water resources department were trying to persuade the agitating farmers to end blockade, assuring proper supply of water in the canal.
