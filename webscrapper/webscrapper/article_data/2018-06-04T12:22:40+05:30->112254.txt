TRICHY: State minister for food R   said that it was late chief minister   who played a major role in getting the Cauvery Management Authority gazetted, while staking claim in the victory of the issue. It was the efforts taken by the late leader with the assistance of legal experts that paved way for finding a permanent solution to the problem, he added while speaking at   on Sunday. 

 The minister dismissed DMK working president M K Stalin’s allegations that the AIADMK was scheming to ensure that the DMK MLAs do not participate in the assembly proceedings when the crucial vote of confidence is taken, following the court verdict on the disqualification of 18 MLAs. “We are in majority and are ready to prove it anytime,” he said.
 
 Kamaraj said that the DMK legislatures and its allies walked out of the assembly stating the   shooting issue. “Stalin earlier said that the reason for boycotting and walking out of the assembly was the Tuticorin issue and demanded the permanent closure of Sterlite’s copper unit. Now he has accused the AIADMK of keeping their MLAs out of the assembly,” he said. “The earlier tenure of DMK was a minority government. The present AIADMK has been ruling the state with full majority. So, we are ready to prove our majority in the assembly at any time,” he added.
 
 “It is the government’s intention to release water on June 12 from the Mettur reservoir as per custom. However, we cannot raise the sluices of Mettur reservoir when the water level has not attained 80 feet. We hope that farmers will get water to cultivate kuruvai,” he also said.
