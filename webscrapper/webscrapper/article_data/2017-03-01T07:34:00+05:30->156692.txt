AMBALA: Former Congress MLA   and two others were held guilty by an Ambala court on Tuesday for   in 2009.   Sanjeev Arya pronounced the order in the case. The quantum of sentence will be announced on March 2.

 Pankaj Khanna, a journalist of Naraingarh town, had committed suicide by consuming poison on June 10, 2009. In his suicide note, the journalist had alleged that Ram Kishan and two of his associates had harassed him and police had booked him in a false case on his direction.
 
 On the complaint of journalistâ€™s father Yashpal Khanna, police had registered a case against Ram Kishan and two others under Section 306 (abetment to suicide) IPC. After investigation, police had given a clean chit to Ram Kishan. However, Yashpal moved the district court requesting that the name of Ram Kishan be included in the FIR. Ram Kishan challenged the matter in the high court, which dismissed the appeal.
