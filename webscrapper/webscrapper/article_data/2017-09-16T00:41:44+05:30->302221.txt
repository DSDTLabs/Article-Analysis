MUMBAI: The police recorded the   of a female   of deceased   Karan Joseph upon her arrival in the city from Delhi on Friday. She was among the last two people Joseph had spoken to on the phone before he fell to his death from a 12th floor flat in Bandra.

 The police also recorded the statement of the watchman of Concorde Apartments on Thursday, after TOI reported that a resident of the 11th floor had seen a “thin and bald guy” — a description that fits Joseph — perched precariously on the ledge of the floor above just four days before Joseph’s fatal fall.
 
 The 12th floor flat from which Joseph fell to his death has had media entrepreneur   as a tenant for a year now. The police also recorded the statements of Shah, his business associate Vidhi Shah and two of Shah’s domestic help. “So far there is nothing. As per their statements, Karan had stepped out on the ledge to pick up money. He was not dangled,” senior inspector Pandit Thackeray of the Bandra police station said.
 
 The investigating officers visited Shah’s apartment once again on Friday afternoon.
 
 One of Joseph’s friends, a singer-songwriter, said that he had moved into a flat on Carter Road, Bandra, last month. “I have no idea how he ended up at Rishi Shah’s home on Bandstand,” she said. 
 
 She said that she had had an unsavoury experience of working with Shah.
