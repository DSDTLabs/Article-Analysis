Ludhiana: The sale of swine flu vaccines has decreased this year due to change in strain of viruses and hospitals reporting lesser cases. Till now in 2018, only one case of a 70-year-old male has been reported, who eventually died in a Patiala hospital. In 2017 most of the cases reported were in summer. 

 G S Chawla, president, Ludhiana District Chemist Association said, “In winters vaccination for swine flu was in big demand. With a significant number of cases having been reported during the winters in 2016 and 2017, there was panic and preventive measures of vaccination were much in demand. But now this winter there has not been a single case reported.” 
 
 He further added, “We have no idea about the new strain, but certainly as there are no cases till now so the vaccination is also not in demand. Apparently, earlier the demand for vaccination began before winter, as vaccination should be taken for 3-4 weeks, but now the winters are about to end and there has hardly been any report. The demand for the mask required as a prevention has also decreased.”
