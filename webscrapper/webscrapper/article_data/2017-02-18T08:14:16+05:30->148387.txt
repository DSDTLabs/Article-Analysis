PUNE: A prime concern in India is the use of money and muscle by political parties to garner votes, feels Indian-American researcher  .

 Vaishnav, author of ‘When Crime Pays: Money and Muscle in Indian Politics’, was speaking at a function organized by the   on February 16.
 
 “I have conducted many interviews in constituencies represented by politicians with serious criminal cases against them, like murder and robbery. One of the startling things people said was the politician in question was a protector of people. This was why they usually got elected,” Vaishnav, a senior South Asia fellow at the Carnegie Endowment, said.
 
 The basis of his book, according to him, is over 70,000 judicial affidavits he and his team examined, all filed during the last three Lok Sabha elections.
 
 “If you look at the data for the past three Lok Sabha elections, the number of candidates with criminal cases has increased. Candidates with such cases against them are 21% more likely to win than a candidate without the same. What is prevalent in the Indian society is the Robin Hood-image of these politicians,” he remarked.
 
 Vaishnav also drew parallels with populist leaders who are increasingly getting elected world over, saying that one should not reject the average voter.
 
 “People who voted for   are more intelligent than one thinks. They voted on just one plank — Washington is not hearing their pleas. They know that Trump himself is a part of the elite. They are not voting for sustainable solutions. They are just looking for someone who will smash the system, which is not addressing their concerns about various issues. But the truth is Trump and his kind will not offer sustainable solutions for fear of writing themselves into irrelevance,” Vaishnav said.
