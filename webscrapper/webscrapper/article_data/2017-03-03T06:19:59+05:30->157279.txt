Wildlife activists claimed that there are several pits all along the railway track on this route. These pits have water even in summer, which attracts wild animals making them prone to accidents while crossing the railway line. They demanded for closing of all such pits, while limiting the speed of train to 40 kmph and sounding horn while passing through the forest patches.
