PANAJI: Members of a few parishes of Tiswadi, especially the   deanery, will hold a walking ‘Kakllutichi Yatra’ (Divine Mercy) pilgrimage to   and St Jude Church, Gancim, on February 18. Nine parishes — Agasaim, Azossim,  , Curca, Goa Velha, Mandur, Neura, Siridão and Talaulim (Santana) — form part of the Goa Velha deanery.

 The pilgrims will arrive at Our Lady of Guadalupe church, Batim and proceed to Gancim hill along the road past the Batim lake and village.
 
 The church in the less-frequented part of the village attracts crowds on special occasions such as the annual feast of the saints and on the feast day of Divine Mercy, which is celebrated two Sundays after Easter.
 
 The church on the hill came into prominence in 1994 after   claimed she had seen an apparition of Mother Mary outside the church compound.
 
 The devotion of Divine Mercy has gained ground in Goa in recent years. It was Polish saint   Faustyna Kowalska, who saw apparitions of Jesus, who first inspired the Roman Catholic church to devotion of the Divine Mercy. Kowalska who was canonized in April 2000has been accorded the title of “apostle of Divine Mercy".
 
 Archbishop Filipe Neri Ferrao will be the main concelebrant at the holy mass at Gancim.
