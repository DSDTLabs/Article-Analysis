NAGPUR: With the water crisis looming this summer, architect-cum-activist Pradyumna   has proposed that the domestic sewage water can be treated at home. 

 Speaking at a lecture organized jointly by   and   to celebrate World Water Day on Thursday, Sahasrabhojanee said, “I have commissioned a unit in the city which is being monitored. Sewage water can be treated at home instead of sending it to   plant and later release it into natural sources.” 
 
 According to him, the sewage treatment plant (STP) in Bhandewadi may not able to cope with the expansion of the city. “Where does the sewage water from places will go as the city will expand in the future? The ever-growing cities will put a load on STPs,” he said.
 
 Sahasrabhojanee said that the water treated at STPs is supplied to industries and is mainly used to cooler machines in factories which is eventually converted into steam. This poses a problem to the farm sector since the same water can be used for crops, he added.
 
 The city gets 750 MLD water 85% of which goes into sewage. The sewage water from houses is usually human excreta and water used for washing utensils and clothes. This can be treated at home,” said Sahasrabhojanee.
 
 “There are two main challenges in water conservation — scarcity and pollution. Scarcity is caused by overuse of water in urban and rural areas and pollution through normal use. We are also at a risk of depleting thousand-year-old aquifers before finding a better solution to water shortage,” he added.
 
 Sahasrabhojanee opined that the natural water cycle of evaporation, condensation and precipitation can be used as a basis for treating sewage water. He said this will save millions of rupees which are being invested in STPs.
 
 “We have to turn to nature to solve our water problems. We have tried to implement solutions which have failed. Decentralizing treatment of sewage water and charging exiting natural sources with treated water will solve our problems,” he said.
