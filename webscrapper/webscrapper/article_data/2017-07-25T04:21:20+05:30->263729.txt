NEW DELHI: A clutch of opposition parties will hold a protest in   on Tuesday morning against the suspension of   MPs from the Lok Sabha as they accused the government of trying to stifle the voice of political rivals through its brute majority. The dharna, barely two hours ahead of President-elect Ram Nath Kovind’s swearing-in, will make for an unprecedented political contrast of sorts.

 The plan for a dharna at the Gandhi statue was finalised when Trinamool, NCP and the Left met at Congress chief Sonia Gandhi’s office to discuss the suspension of MPs on Monday. Congress called the five-day suspension of six members “harsh”, but leaders have refrained from attacking the Speaker. Instead, they accused the government of ignoring the opposition’s demand for a debate on mob lynching, which they said was agitating the country.
 
 Also, Congress is set to go after BJP MP Anurag Thakur for allegedly filming proceedings of the House. Party whip K C Venugopal has written to the Speaker for action against Thakur, while MP Sushmita Dev has asked the LS secretariat for unedited footage of House proceedings. Congress members said recording of House proceedings was barred by rules, and Thakur had committed a serious offence for which he must be penalised.
