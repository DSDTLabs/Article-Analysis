NEW YORK: The adult film actress   on Monday filed a lawsuit accusing   Donald Trump of   for a tweet suggesting she lied about an incident where she was warned not to discuss an   with Trump.

 
 Daniels, whose real name is  , sued over an April 18 tweet in which Trump dismissed a composite sketch that Daniels says depicted a man who threatened her in 2011 to stay quiet about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump. “A sketch years later about a nonexistent man,” Trump wrote. “A total con job, playing the Fake News Media for Fools (but they know it)!”
 
 In a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, Daniels says the tweet was “false and defamatory”, arguing that Trump was speaking about Daniels and that he “knew that his false, disparaging statement would be read by people around the world, as well as widely reported.” Daniels also claims she has been “exposed to death threats”. Trump and his lawyers were not available for comment.
