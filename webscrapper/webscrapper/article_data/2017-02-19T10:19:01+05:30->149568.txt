KOLHAPUR: A police patrol on Friday seized over Rs 33 lakh in demonetised currency notes of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 from two people travelling in a car on the Halkarni-Basarge road in   taluka.

 The Gadhinglaj police station registered a case against   and  , both residents of Belagavi in Karnataka.
 
 Inspector   said that as the model code of conduct is in place for the zilla parisahd and panchayat samiti elections, flying squads were formed to keep an eye on illegal activities.
 
 “During a ‘nakabandi’ operation on Friday, the cops stopped a car on the Halkarn-Basarge Road, which enters Maharashtra from Karnataka, and found Rs 33.50 lakh in the scrapped currency notes. The cash was kept in a bag on the back seat,” he said.
 
 “We detained the two men and informed the election commission officials about the cash seizure. Later, the suspects and the cash were handed over to the election office for appropriate action,” said Hasabnis.
 
 Hasabnis said that interrogating the suspects was a problem as they could only understand Kannada. “Finally, we managed to get a translator who helped us communicate with them. They did not speak about from where they got the cash from and where they were heading,” he said.
 
 “We suspect a gang is operating on commission basis and finding NRIs who can help them in depositing old notes in   (RBI),” he added.
 
 When contacted, the returning officer in-charge, said, “We have passed on the information to the income tax department, which will take custody of the cash and the duo. We will be able to take action as per the guidelines issued by election commission only after the I-T officials give the report.”
