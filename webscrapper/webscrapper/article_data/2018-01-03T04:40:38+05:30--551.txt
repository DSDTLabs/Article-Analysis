 Iggy Azalea said that she is going to continue to eat whatever she wants to because she is on a "freestyle diet" after the festive period.

  
  
 
 Taking to her   account, Azalea said of her and friend, who is also called Iggy: "Me andd Iggy keep seeing some diet being advertised on TV with people eating basically anything and saying they're 'freestyling'. Now I can't stop eating stuff and saying 'I'm on a freestyle diet'."
 
  
  
 However, according to a report, although her healthy eating has gone out of the window, the 27-year-old rapper has decided to take her skincare very seriously and has been smothering her legs in tropical-scented oils to keep her legs smooth.
