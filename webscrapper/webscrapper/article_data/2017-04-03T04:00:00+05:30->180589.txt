Ahmedabad: A complaint of causing death due to negligence has been lodged against a doctor, Anand Yadav, of Khokhra at Amraiwadi police station. Complainant Harishsinh Rajput has said that his 26-year-old son Pradeepsinh, suffering from a pancreas disease, was rushed to Dr Yadav’s hospital on March 24.

 “Pradeepsinh’s condition worsened after Dr Yadav administered an injection. Rajput was asked to shift his son to another hospital. As Rajput, an auto driver, did not have enough money to get his son treated in a private hospital, he shifted his son to the civil hospital where his son died in the evening,” said a senior police official. Amraiwadi police said that an FIR has been lodged against the doctor. tnn
