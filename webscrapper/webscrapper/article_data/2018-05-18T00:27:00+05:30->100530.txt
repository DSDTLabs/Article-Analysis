 and players are upbeat over ‘Trichy Open Tennis Tournament’, which started on Thursday, saying that it could help popularise the sport in the city.

 They said that the tournament would help create awareness about tennis among the general public and about how the tennis courts in Anna Stadium, which have a very good infrastructure, could be utilised in a more effective manner.
 
 Though inter-college and school-level tennis tournaments are being held in the city, there was hardly any state-level tournament conducted. 
 
 Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu’s (SDAT) Trichy district tennis coach R Suresh said that the ongoing tournament would help make Trichy a hub for tennis events in southern Tamil Nadu. "This is the first time that a tournament has been held in such a professional manner in Trichy with enough line and chair umpires," he said. The coach also said that good prize money for top performers would also encourage parents to send their children to tennis coaching in the future.
 
 According to former national level tennis player S Seetharam, the attraction which tennis had two decades ago, diminished significantly in the city. "During 1980s and early 1990s, Trichy had a huge reputation for tennis. Due to lack of local tournaments, it has waned over the years. But if state and national level tournaments are held here regularly, it would bring more youngsters to this sport," the current tennis coach at Bishop Heber College said.
 
 On the other hand, Gnanaiah Daniel Vimal Davidson, who had come from Madurai to participate in the tournament, hoped that more tennis coaching centres in the region would be opened after this tournament.
