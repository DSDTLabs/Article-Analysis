NEW DELHI: The   ( ) on Saturday asked people to take “due precautions” while sharing their personal information such as   number on the internet for availing any service. 

 
 “People share their personal information, including Aadhaar on internet, to some or other service provider or vendor to get the services and when they put their details on internet they should take due precautions as required in digital activities,” UIDAI said in a statement.
 
 On reports of Aadhaar pdf being allegedly available through   search query of ‘Mera Aadhaar, Meri Pehchan’, the agency said the issue had “nothing to do with the security of Aadhaar and its database”.
 
 Asserting the robustness of the Aadhaar identity system, the nodal body, which issues the 12-digit biometric identifier, said “publication or posting of Aadhaar cards by some unscrupulous people have absolutely no bearing on UIDAI and not the least on Aadhaar security”.
 
 “These (reports) are far from the reality and have got nothing to do with the security of Aadhaar and its database. As none of the Aadhaar cards shown are taken from UIDAI database,” the statement said.
 
 Emphasising that just like any other identity document, Aadhaar too is not a confidential document, UIDAI argued that mere knowledge about someone's Aadhaar card is not sufficient to impersonate that person as biometric authentication is needed to establish one’s identity. “If anybody unauthorisedly publishes someone’s personal information such as Aadhaar card, mobile number, bank account, photograph etc., he can be sued for civil damages by the person whose privacy right is infringed,” the statement said.
 
 However, it said, such publication does not threaten security of Aadhaar and its database which remains safe.
