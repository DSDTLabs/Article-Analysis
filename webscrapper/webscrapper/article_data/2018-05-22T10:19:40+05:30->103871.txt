NASHIK: The special inspector general of police ( )   has directed to extend the drive against those possessing illegal weapons till May 26.

 The fortnight-long drive had started from May 3. The decision to extend the drive, which has been successful so far, was taken as people are coming forward to inform the police about presence of such firearms and weapons.
 
 Choubey took a review meeting of the status of the crimes in the districts of Nashik rural, Jalgaon, Dhule, Nandurbar and   couple of days ago with the SPs of these districts.
 
 “People are coming forward and sharing information about the presence of illegal weapons in their districts. So we have decided to extend this operation till May 26,” a police officer said.
 
 So far, the police have seized over 148 illegal weapons, including several firearms, and arrested several people.
