KOLKATA: The state health department is framing rules that aim to bring ambulance services under the ambit of the state  , a senior health department official indicated on Thursday.

 Director of health services Ajay Chakraborty said, “The discussions are at a preliminary stage. The state is keen to bring ambulances under some regulatory framework, including the Clinical Establishment Act to ensure all ambulances adhere to certain rules.”
  
  
 According to sources, even private ambulance operators, who provide emergency services, could be brought under the rules. They said the rules will mandate qualified paramedics’ and doctors’ presence on ambulances and will ensure that basic life-support system is present on the vehicles.
 
 The development comes on the heels of the police informing Swasthya Bhavan how unscrupulous elements are using the system to take patients across the city and districts for a ride. The report was prepared by investigators probing the death of Madhyamik examinee Arijit Das in March this year.
 
 The authorities are trying to make all heath care units ‘referring’ cases to other hospitals and nursing homes accountable. In the absence of any rule or guideline, any vehicle with a commercial licence can be used as an ambulance. “In the long run, we want a dual certification whereby the health department can have a say on roadworthy ambulances,” a source said.
 
 Cops said many ambulances from Burdwan, Birbhum and   to Kolkata would be facilitated by touts who charged a high amount for arranging doctors besides a separate fare for the ambulance.
 
 “The probe shows that the accused would claim that the ambulance was fitted with the best equipment. But when the patient party demanded they be used, the “doctor” inside the ambulance would tell them that there was no need for the same,” a police source said.
