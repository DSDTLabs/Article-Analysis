KOLKATA: For this 23-year-old woman and her 48-year-old mother, the journey from Gariahat to their residence near   at   was supposed to be uneventful. “When we spotted the bus, we thankful our Puja marketing had not derailed our dinner timings,” said the young woman who is a trained dancer.

 And yet, when the two finally returned home around midnight — dropped off by a Tollygunge police vehicle — the reality was still to sink in. “After all, we were travelling in perhaps the busiest stretch of south Kolkata. There were thousands out there thronging the Gariahat Market and the stretch between Gariahat and Kaliaghat hosts the biggest Pujas of the city,” they reasoned.
 
 It was the young woman who convinced her mother to lodge the complaint. “Initially, both of us stood up as we could not bear to see one man being attacked by so many. We saw passengers complaining us and that bolstered our confidence. Yet, when the bus reached  , one by one, all the male passengers except the journalist used the emergency exit to flee.”
 
 “My mother reminded me we were a family of three and with little social support. We were initially trapped in the middle of the bus and tried to stop the altercation so that we could alight. Initially, another young woman present inside the bus helped me but she left before the cops arrived,” said the 23-year-old.
 
 The mother’s concerns are genuine. She has to travel to Dhulagarh in Howrah on school days and rarely has time to accompany her daughter to dance shows. “My father runs a shop and he could not even reach Tollygunge PS on time. I wonder if this is the same Kolkata where I grew up. The audacity of the teenagers was unnerving. They kept saying they couldn’t be touched even when all the passengers had ganged up against them. I hope the law of the land will prove them wrong,” said the young braveheart.
