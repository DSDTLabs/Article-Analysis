ROHTAK: Days after announcing his decision to not contest 2019 parliamentary polls, incumbent Bhiwani   MP Dharambir Singh on Thursday said he would contest the next election from the Tosham assembly segment in the district.

 Presently, the Congress Legislature Party leader and prominent Jat leader from late Bansi Lal family, Kiran Choudhry is MLA from Tosham. Choudhry won the election against INLD’s Kamla Rani and Dharambir’s brother Rajbir Singh Lala.
 
 Interestingly, four-time MLA Dharambir had won the 2014 parliamentary election from the Bhiwani-Mahendergarh constituency, by defeating Kiran Choudhry’s daughter Shruti Choudhry. 
 
 Addressing media in Bhiwani, Dharambir said since he could not get the listed development works done in the last three years of his tenure ship as the MP, he would not contest next parliamentary election.
 
 Dharambir, a seasoned politician known for his political maneuvering skills, said he would contest the next election as a BJP candidate for the Tosham assembly seat.
 
 Counting potential candidates for the Bhiwani-Mahendergarh Lok Sabha seat, he listed the names of education minister  , agriculture minister   and minister Narbir Singh.
 
 Defending his decision to not contest for a parliamentary seat, he said since the area under a Lok Sabha constituency was large and diverse; there was an immense public pressure. He said he found himself unfit for the task and only a person with a diverse experience, and profound knowledge not only of the state but also of national issues, could do justice to the position.
 
 Responding to a query about switching loyalties, BJP MP Dharambir Singh said the question of contesting election for any other party did not arise and he was only interesting in the Tosham seat on a BJP ticket.
