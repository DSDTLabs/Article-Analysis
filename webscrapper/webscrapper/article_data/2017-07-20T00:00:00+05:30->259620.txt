Idukki and   fame Lijomol aren’t done with each other's company. 

 The actress, who won the hearts of viewers through her roles in the national award winning film and also  , is playing a character from the eighties, who too hails from Idukki, in her next film Anuragam.
 Director Jayan Vannery says, “Lijo's character Katrina comes in a segment in the movie that shows a love story decades ago. Katrina was the 
 first love interest of the character played by actor Vijayaraghavan, Fr Dominic. She is from Thopramkudy and is quite bold for her own good.” 
 
 Kammattipaadam fame Shalu, who played Dulquer Salmaan’s younger days, would act as Lijo’s character's love interest. The director clarifies that though the story happens in the eighties, the film doesn't desperately strive to squeeze in all things vintage into it and has kept it balanced, looks-wise and even dialogues-wise.
 
 Lijo says, “I am settled in Mundakkayam of Kottayam district now, not Idukki (laughs). Yes, I wasn’t sure whether I should take it up when Katrina came my way but decided to go for it as the character has so many elements I haven't tried before. While both my previous characters were a bit paavam in nature, Katrina isn’t.” She is also happy that the movie’s crew is pleased with her performance. 
 
 The actress has also just finished the shoot of Honey Bee 2.5, in which she is the leading lady for actor Asif Ali’s brother Askar Ali. “I play a naughty girl in the film. I am someone who is the personal touch-up girl for Bhavana's character on the sets of Honey Bee 2 and my name in the film is Kanmani. It was fun working on that movie,” says Lijo, who is currently preparing for NET exam after completing post graduation in Library Science. 
 
 What more is in her kitty? “Well, I am also part of the Mammootty film named Streetlights, directed by Shamdat. I can’t say much about my role in it, but I am paired with Soubin Shahir in the movie,” Lijo adds.
