KOZHIKODE: In a major embarrassment to the IUML,   general secretary K   has issued a strongly-worded statement against that   for publishing an article in his name without his consent and knowledge. 

 Alikutty Musaliar said he never wrote such an article or entrusted anyone to write an article on his behalf. He asked the Chandrika management to ensure that such things do not happen in the future.
 
 Chandrika had carried an article in the name of Musaliar to coincide with the rally organized against the state sponsored terrorism and harassment of Muslim preachers on Friday. The meeting had expressed solidarity with Islamic preachers including M M Akbar, the managing director of Peace International School.
 
 In a related development, senior leaders of the feeder organization of the Samastha wanted know how an article that was against the declared stance of Samastha appeared in the name of its general secretary. In a statement issued here on Monday, they said the article whitewashed the Salafis and condoned terrorism. 
 
 The Sunni leaders said the article tried to whitewash the 21 youths who left the country saying the Muslims living in India would not go to a heaven. It also tried to give acceptance to M M Akbar who had despised Sunni ideals. The article also tried to project the Peace School as the exemplary institution that combined both religious and secular education. Sunni leaders said that the article created an impression that Samastha general secretary indirectly supported the Salafi extremists.
 
 The signatories include Bahaudeen Nadvi, Umer Faizy Mukkam, Abdul Hameed Faizy, Sattar Panthaloor, Pinangode Aboobacker, Nazer Faizy Koodathayi and Abdu Samad Pookkoottor.
