VISAKHAPATNAM: The first phase of the underground cabling project in   city is likely to begin in the second quarter of the next fiscal 2017-18.

 The first phase, which will come up at   and its surroundings areas including Lawson’s Bay Beach, will have 6 sub-stations, and will come up at a cost of Rs 230 crore. 
 
 Seven firms across the country have evinced interest in the first phase of the underground cabling project by taking part in the technical bid and investing a security deposit of Rs 4.5 crore. The seven firms include Vijay Electricals Ltd Hyderabad, GVPR Engineers Ltd Hyderabad, L&T India Chennai, BMC Electroplast Kolkata, KEI Industries New Delhi, Gupta Power Infra Ltd Odisha and Vindhya Power Pvt Ltd Hyderabad.
 
 Sources said the project monitoring unit (PMU) at Hyderabad will now pick eligible firms for the subsequent financial bid round.
 
 “It will take nearly two weeks of time from now as each firm sent reports about 1,000 pages. We are analysing the applications,” a source told TOI
 
 Later, the name of the successful bidder will be sent to the   team. If none of the firms qualify, the PMU will have to issue a fresh tender notification again. However, that is unlikely to happen as all these firms are experienced in handling at least 10km long underground power cabling project.
 
 PMU sources said the financial bidding process would be taken up in April and formalities including the decisions of the World Bank, the chief minister and the union ministry’s clearances would be completed by the end of May or June.
 
 “Once all formalities are completed, the successful bidder will have to complete the construction work within 18 months of date of announcement of its name,” said a PMU official.
