BENGALURU:  , who turns 100 on Tuesday, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is behaving like a “dictator” which has resulted in a   in the country. He, however, did not qualify his remarks about the PM.

 Arguing that the impending assembly election in the state would be a battle between “Karnataka and Modi”, he called upon non-BJP parties to join hands in defeating the saffron party. 
 
 Speaking after a felicitation ceremony marking his 100th birthday at Central College here, Doreswamy said he recently met former prime minister HD Deve Gowda and urged him not to support the BJP. 
 
 “Despite Union ministers speaking against the Constitution and democracy, BJP national president Amit Shah has remained silent, and has not taken any action against them,” Doreswamy said, adding that while Modi is maintaining a non-controversial image, he is inciting “hidden agendas” through cabinet ministers.
 
 He said this referring to the recent controversial statement by Union minister Anantkumar Hegde. He also pointed out to an earlier statement (December 2017) by Hedge, where the minister of state for skill development had said that his party was in power to change the Constitution.
