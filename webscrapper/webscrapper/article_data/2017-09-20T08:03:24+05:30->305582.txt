KOCHI: The   on Tuesday held that it was arbitrary on part of the   to direct   at   at Kaloor to vacate their premises for a month to conduct the FIFA Underworld-17 World Cup.

 Through an interim order, a single bench of the court said the directive that deprives the livelihood of the shop owners should have been issued after giving adequate notice, especially since the event was the result of twoand-a-half years of planning.Government had argued that the directive was for safety reasons and in public interest.
 
 Pointing out that there is no clause in the lease agreement between the shop owners and Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA) for closing down the shops during a sporting event, the court also termed the district collector's order for handing over vacated premises, issued under disaster management provisions, a knee-jerk reaction to filing of the petition by the shop owners.
 
 The court ordered GCDA to deposit Rs 25 lakh with the district collector within a week and directed that a committee be formed to ascertain the compensation for losses that would be sustained by shop owners due to the onemonth forced closure.
 
 The committee should consist of member secretary , Kerala State Legal Services Authority , director of Alternate Disputes Resolution Centre of the high court, and the district collector. State go vernment should compensate 75% of the loss computed by the committee, the court directed.
 
 In the interim order, the court said it is not striking down the directive to close down the shops even though it is arbitrary, for the reason that an international event is proposed to be held. “The action of the respondents (government authorities) having been held to be arbitrary , the logical measure is to strike down the action. But this court cannot close its eyes to the fame and renown the successful holding of an event of this magnitude would bring to the state and the country in the international arena and also the funds it would generate, which would be shared by the state, the GCDA, and the football associations, which it can be reasonably hoped, would be put to public good and the promotion of sports and games within the state,“ the court said in the order.
