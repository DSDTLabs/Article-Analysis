LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, explaining the terse tone of his speech in the House last week which led to a boycott by the Opposition, said here on Thursday that seers always talk bluntly. Speaking on the last day of the budget session, however, he again went on to attack the Opposition for its penchant for finding fault in all good steps his government was taking. 

 "  is not liking the government's work culture," he said and went on to add " Choron ko chandni raat pasand nahin aati (thieves don't like moon-lit night)." They didn't like anti-Romeo squad and had objection to the closure of illegal slaughterhouse and also to the arrest of the main accused in   hooch tragedy, Yogi said. 
 
 Hitting out at previous governments, the CM said that 450 riots took place during   government while none had been reported during the   government. In the previous government, every appointment became controversial, Yogi said and added that the BJP government was going to appoint 30,000 constables this year.
