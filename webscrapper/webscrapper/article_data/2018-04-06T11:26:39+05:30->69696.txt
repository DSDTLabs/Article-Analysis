CHENNAI: Nine-year-old Urigam and seven-and-a-half-years-old Javalagiri– two   in the   which showed signs of   in the last couple of weeks, will say goodbye to their current home and head to   in the   Tiger Reserve in Pollachi and   Tiger Reserve in the   in a day or two.

 Zoo director S Yuvaraj said Urigam was abandoned by its herd in 2009 in Urigam forest range in the Krishnagiri division. Urigam was under the care of Krishnagiri forest officials, who attempted to reunite the calf with his mother but failed. Later, when Urigam turned one, he was shifted to the Vandalur zoo from Krishnagiri.
 
 Javalagiri’s case was different as he was abandoned when he was just three months old. The officials of Javalagiri range in Krishnagiri forest division decided not to take any chances with the calf and he landed in the zoo when he was six months old, the director said.
 
 Zoo deputy director Sudha Ramen said that generally, male   come of age between 11 and 14 years. In some cases the maturity will be early. “Since we saw starting signs of musth, we decided to not take a chance and shift them to the camps,” she said.
 
 In Aanamalai, the camp is in Varagaliyar, the core area inside the tiger reserve in Topslip. As it is in the core area, the captive animals will get a chance to feed naturally like their cousins in the wild, said a wildlife official. In Theppakadu, the camp is located in the tourism zone, where tourists can see the elephants feeding every day.
 
 A wildlife veterinarian said, in well-grown adult tuskers in musth, the secretions on an average will be last for three months. In the case of sub-adults, it will stay only for a short period with the animals showing no signs of aggression, he said.
