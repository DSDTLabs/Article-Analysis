KOLHAPUR: The   ( ) has rejected the proposal for reducing fare of the  : Shivneri. 

 The Kolhapur division of the MSRTC had sought fare cut as the service was getting poor response owing to expensive tickets as compared to the private operators.
 
 The   premium bus service was resumed on December 23, 2016 after a gap of two years. Since the first day, it has been getting meagre response from passengers. Therefore, the divisional controller had put forward a proposal to reduce the fare on par with private operators.
 
 However, the proposal was rejected by MSRTC's central office in Mumbai. Official sources in Mumbai said, "We run air-conditioned bus services on many routes like Dadar, Thane, Aurangabad and Nashik. Hence, it is not appropriate to reduce fares on one specific route. It cannot be justified. Passengers on other routes are paying fares as per the standards laid down by the MSRTC. Therefore, it was not possible to reduce the fare on this route."
 
 When contacted, divisional controller of Kolhapur division   said, "We had proposed fare cut for the air-conditioned service last month. The ticket rates are much high than private operators in similar category. The current fare is around Rs 680 and there is huge difference between ticket rates of semi-luxury and premium bus services."
 
 He added, "The passengers can bear a difference of Rs 100 to 150. But the gap between tickets is around Rs 300. Therefore, we had demanded that tickets should be brought down to Rs 500. I have not received any rejection letter from the central office."
 
 Another MSRTC official said, "This service is a loss-making business for MSRTC. The seats are not being booked as per expectation. Even the timing is not convenient for passengers. Private operators charge around Rs 400 for similar services. It was necessary to bring down the tickets rates."
