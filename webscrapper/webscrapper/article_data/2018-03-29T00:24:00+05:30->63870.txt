Madurai: Seeking action against Union health secretary Preethi Sudan for failing to finalise a site for the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Tamil Nadu, a contempt petition has been filed at the Madurai bench of the Madras high court.  One R K Basker has filed the petition. He said that he had filed a writ petition last year seeking direction to the Union health secretary to establish the AIIMS in Madurai as the district is a central place and people living in and around Madurai lack proper medical facilities.  If AIIMS comes to Madurai, it will be helpful for people in 15 districts. The court, after hearing arguments from state and central governments directed the Union health ministry to finalise the site for AIIMS in Tamil Nadu before December 31, 2017. But, the ministry is yet to obey the court order, for which the health secretary has to be punished, the petitioner said.  It is expected that the plea would come up for hearing soon. TNN
