National Award-winning filmmaker   is all set to head the jury of the 64th National Film Awards. This will be the first time he’s part of the National Awards jury.

 “It’s definitely an honour and a huge responsibility. I have close to 36 years of experience and have done 91 films, so I am hoping to put that to good use,” says Priyadarshan, who had recently directed Mohanlal in Oppam.
 
 The director reveals that close to 380 films are being considered for this year’s National Awards. “I have only been sent the list of the movies that are being assessed. I will have a clear idea of the composition of the panel and other details only after I reach Delhi,” says Priyadarshan, adding that the process will begin on March 16 and will go on for a month.
 
 Priyadarshan’s film   had won the National Award for the Best Film in 2007 and in 1996, his Kaalapani brought Kerala three National Awards. His movie   had made it to the final round for selection for nomination, for this year's Golden Globe Awards. The director had previously chaired the jury for the 2011 International Film Festival of Kerala.
