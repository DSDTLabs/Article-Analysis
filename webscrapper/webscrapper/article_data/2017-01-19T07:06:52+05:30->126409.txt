PUNE: The Pune-based investigation wing of the income tax (IT) department raided 64 outlets of 54   in the state on Wednesday after receiving ‘credible information’ about sudden spike in sales in the days preceding  .

 The department suspects that these jewellers pre-dated the bills on November 8 and 9 to help customers get rid of demonetised currency notes. In Pune alone, 13 outlets were raided.
 
 The quantum of sales as well as price at which the jewellery was sold will be known only after search is complete, an I-T official said. 
 
 The department had scrutinised many account books in the past few days. The officials then compared the sales in October and November 2016 with the same months of 2014 and 2015. 
 
 “During the process, it was found that transactions more than doubled in case of many jewellers,” the official added.
