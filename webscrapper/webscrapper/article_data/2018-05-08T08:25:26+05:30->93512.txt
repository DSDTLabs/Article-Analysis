BENGALURU:   from T Dasarahalli has secured 621 out of 625 in  . She has scored 100 in four subjects — Sanskrit, Kannada, science and social science — but is still not satisfied. “I wanted to get 625 out of 625. My parents wanted me to top the state and even I shared the dream,” said Sathvika, whose father is a factory worker and mother a tailor.

 
 “My father’s salary is around Rs 15,000 a month, while my mother’s earnings vary. I want to become a doctor and have my family’s backing. But they can’t afford to send me to a good college in Bengaluru, so I want to go to   for PU. Having scored well in SSLC, I will be able to get free accommodation in some hostels,” said Sathvika, a student of St Mary’s High School.
 
 As many as 23,836 students have scored 100 in one or more subjects this time. A whopping 9,224 students bagged centums in first language (mostly medium of instruction), 7,592 in third language and 3,522 in second language. However, the trend is not the same when it comes to mathematics and science. Last year, 9,757 students got a perfect score in maths, but the number has dipped to 608 this time. Even for science, the number has dropped — from 1,458 to 273.
 
 Reverand Fr. Joshi K X, principal of St Claret School in Jalahalli, said: “Till last year, science and maths questions weren’t application based like this year. Many students whom we spoke to after the exams said they found the questions to be tough. Most of us (schools) stick to basics so that all students can pass with flying colours.”
 
 Hitha M, student of Poorna Prajna Education Centre in Yelahanka, who scored 99.04% and centums in four subjects — Sanskrit, Kannada, science and social science. “I didn’t attend tuitions, thanks to my school teachers. Though maths was a worry, I’m thrilled to have secured 95,” she told TOI.
 
 Ratnakar Shetty, professor at a government college, also expected his younger daughter Shifali R S, to top. “But the Kannada question papers were distributed 15 minutes late, which is why she lost time. My other daughter Navya topped the state in 2012 with 623 marks,” he said.
