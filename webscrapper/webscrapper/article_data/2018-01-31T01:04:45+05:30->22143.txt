NEW DELHI: An employee of a Mumbai-based film production company, who got hooked to liquor   and became one of the key bootleggers in south Delhi, was arrested along with three others from southeast Delhi’s Okhla on Tuesday.

 The kingpin, Abbas Khan (34), was arrested with Totaram (56), his son Praveen (27), and Gabbar (26). As many as 35 cartons comprising 1,750 quarters of illicit   from Haryana have been seized. The arrested men include the supplier, receiver and distributors.
 
 “Three cars — an Esteem, Punto and an A-Star — were used for storing and supplying the liquor. The kingpin of this   stored the liquor crates in one of the cars that they used as a moving godown so they could remain untraced,” DCP (southeast) Chinmoy Biswal said.
 
 Police officers from Okhla police station spotted three cars parked near a factory in Okhla Phase-III while they were patrolling the area.
 
  The beat staff waited there for some time and saw people shifting boxes from one car to another.
 
 He informed his senior after which a team led by SHO Mukesh Walia went to the spot. 
 
 The accused managed to flee after spotting police but were overpowered after a chase.
 
 “During interrogation, Khan disclosed that he had lived in Mumbai and was involved in film productions. He returned after incurring losses and started supplying illicit liquor from Faridabad to Delhi,” Biswal added.
 
 The gang sold liquor at hiked prices in parts of Okhla. As it is an industrial area, a large number of daily wage labourers live and work there. To avoid being noticed, the gang smuggled liquor only on Sundays and holidays since most of the factories remained closed. Also, they believed that the demand and sale of illicit liquor would go up during weekends.
