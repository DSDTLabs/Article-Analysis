GUWAHATI: Students from the state will join their mates from other parts of the country in protesting against   (ABVP)'s attack on   (DU) students in the national capital this Friday. 

 The youngsters, belonging to the Students' Federation of India (SFI), will also raise concern over attacks on students from the northeast studying in other cities.
 
 The SFI, up in arms against ABVP over the recent ruckus at DU's Ramjas College, said the safety of northeastern students studying in institutions in Delhi would also be discussed at the protest in Jantar Mantar.
 
 "We will focus on the consistent attack on education, democracy and social justice. We will place our demand for a people-oriented education policy by taking part in the Delhi Chalo movement where students from across the country will take part in large numbers," said Nirangkush Nath, secretary of the state committee of SFI.
 
 More than 100 activists will start moving to Delhi from Wednesday itself.
 
 The students' body said, under the BJP-led government in Assam, the education scenario had turned scary. "Almost two months after the commencement of the academic year, school students have not got their textbooks. No step has been taken by the government to reform the semester system in colleges," Nath added.
 
 The SFI also condemned the 'hooliganism' of a section of Delhi University (DU) students and teachers. "The attack on DU students was an attack on our democratic voice. Students of higher education institutions should enjoy the right to express their opinion on crucial issues," said SFI's state committee president Kashyap Choudhury.
