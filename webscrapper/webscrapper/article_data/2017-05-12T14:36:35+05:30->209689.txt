NEW DELHI: World-renowned sand artist   created the worldâ€™s longest sand sculpture of the Buddha in   earlier this week. 

  
  
 
 He created the sculpture of Buddha on the occasion of the 14th International Vesak Day Celebrations in Colombo. Vesak Day is also called Budhha Day or Buddha Purnima.
 
  
  
 
 The artist had earlier said he was "attempting" to make the longest sand Buddha. 
 
  
  
 
 Pattnaik arrived in Sri Lanka last week.
 
  
  
 
 He spoke about the beauty of the island.
 
  
  
 
 Before that, on May 6, he created a sculpture of   on his birth anniversary. This work was created in Puri in Odisha.
 
 In February, Pattnaik added yet another feature to his cap by storming into   for having created the world's tallest sand castle on Puri beach. 
 
 State tourism director Nitin Bhanudas Jawale, who was present on the occasion, said the previous Guinness record was reserved in the name of American artist Ted Siebert, who had built a 13.97 metre high (45 ft) sand castle at Miami beach in 2015. 
 
 "It is a proud moment for the country as Sudarsan broke the previous record by building a 14.84 metre high (48.8 ft) castle in the backdrop of the Bay of Bengal in Puri. We will exhibit the art on the beach for two more days to attract tourists," Jawale said.
