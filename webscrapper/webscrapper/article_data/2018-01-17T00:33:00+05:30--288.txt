Kolkata: Going against her family, a 14-year-old girl on Tuesday walked into a police station with her brother, urging the cops to stop her marriage scheduled on January 25.

 The girl, a Kanyashree beneficiary, said she is a minor and wanted to study further so that she can join the IPS cadre.
 
 Hailing from a poor family, the teenager got her 21-year-old elder brother’s support. However, he is her only supporter in the family comprising her parents and eight other siblings. Her father is a factory labourer and her mother a tailor.
 
 “The girl told us her problem and we shall provide necessary support. We have asked her parents to reach the police station so that we may take help from counsellors to help them understand,” a senior officer said.
 
 The girl told TOI that she was indecisive in the beginning, but her brother’s support helped her seek police support. “I wish to study now. I dream of joining the IPS cadre. But my father has been insisting that I marry. He even told me that the family’s prestige was at stake. I then told my brother about my predicament. He consulted some of his friends in the neighbourhood and they all helped me in taking a stand,” she said.
 
 According to the police, a rights worker had been working extensively in Tangra. He managed to convince the girl’s brother, and the girl, to back out of the marriage.
 
 “I am here to seek help for my sister. My parents want to her to get married. I understand their reasons. But my sister has certain aspirations. I am ready to take care of her so that she can pursue her dreams. I am worried that for all this, I will need support from society,” the girl’s brother said.
 
 According to police, the girl said she followed her teacher’s words about child marriage being a crime. She wants to complete her education. As per law, the marriage of a boy below the age of 21 years and that of a girl under 18 years is a crime.
