Preeti was taken back by the zoo authorities around two years back.Two months ago, that the leopard began developing a mammary tumour, said sources. Officials said that the leopard may have developed it earlier and that they only detected it recently. The surgery to remove a 200 gram mammary tumour lasted for over two hours.
 
 “On noticing the fast growing tumour, we consulted a panel of senior veterinary doctors. It was immediately operated upon. The tumour was removed successfully. We ha ve sent the sample to check whether it is malignant or benign. Such tumours are generally malignant,“ said Dr. M  , veterinary assistant director at the zoo. The surgery was performed under the supervision of Dr Hakeem with the help of Dr  , assistant director animal husbandry, Dr Navin Kumar veterinary consultant at the zoo park and Dr Anil, from the animal husbandry department. Preeti will remain under observation for seven days. Doctors say that the leopard is out of danger. The leopard was experimented with `artificial insemination' at CCMB's  , said officials.
 
 Animals are often taken to research centres for experiments, but animal rights activists are against such experiments and often protest in case of any adverse incident.
 
 In this particular case, zoo authorities said there is no proof to suggest that anything went wrong during Preeti's experiment programme.
