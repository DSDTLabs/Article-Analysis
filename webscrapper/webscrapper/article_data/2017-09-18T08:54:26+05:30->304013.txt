BATHINDA: Bathinda-based RTI activist Harmilap Singh Grewal has demanded quashing of   MLA Baljinder Kaur’s candidature from   assembly constituency on allegations of an unlawful irregularity.

 Grewal on Sunday told media persons that he had relevant documents from the election commission where she was shown as adopted by one Amarjit Singh of village   in 1997 (who has passed away) but while filing nomination papers in 2014 election at Talwandi Sabo she mentioned her father’s name as  , which she could not do as per law.
 
 Grewal has made a written request to the election commission of India, Punjab chief electoral officer, the Bathinda district electoral officer and the speaker of the state legislative assembly to conduct thorough inquiry into the ‘serious irregularity’.
 
 Meanwhile, AAP MLA Baljinder Kaur, refuting the charges against her, said she only had one vote. The matter had already been investigated by the election commission and no discrepancy was found. “False allegations are being levelled against me to defame me,” she said, adding that the matter was raised twice during the 2014 and 2017 assembly elections by her opponents and on both occasions the returning offices investigated the accusations and found no merit in them. “My party also investigated and then nominated me to contest,” she said.
 
 Levelling allegations against the Talwandi Sabo MLA, Grewal said Baljinder Kaur got a fresh vote prepared in 2011 where the name of her biological father Darshan Singh appears whereas in a vote prepared in 2002 she had named her father as Amarjit Singh (adopted father). He further alleged that she had signed an affidavit in 2007 claiming to be the adopted daughter of Amarjit Singh to claim his property and other assets.
 
 However, when contacted, Baljinder denied those allegations as well.
