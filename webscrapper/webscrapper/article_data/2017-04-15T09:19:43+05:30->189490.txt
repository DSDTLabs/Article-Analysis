 Vivek Upadhyay, director of e-Governance with Gujarat Informatics Ltd (GIL), the agency responsible for maintaining government websites, said they are concerned with web hosting and not the content. “We put up content provided to us by the respective department,” he said.
 
 Manoj Agrawal, secretary (home), was not available for comment.

In fact, the vocation section doesn’t have any implication on the basic purpose, to register on the website,” said a senior police official.
