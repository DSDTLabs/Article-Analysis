GURUGRAM:   has mopped up Rs 6.97 crore as enhanced compensation from plot owners in the city in the first three days of the launch of a one-time settlement scheme.

 Huda sources said approximately 5,000 plot owners cleared their dues between May 15 and May 18 to avail a 40% rebate under the scheme that was announced by chief minister chief minister   earlier this month.
 
 Another 15,000 allottees are yet to pay the enhanced compensation to be paid to farmers who had given their land for development of various Huda sectors in the city. Huda officials are hopeful to receive more payments in the coming days as the 40% discount will be available till July 15.
 
 Understandably, Gurugram has recorded the highest collections under the scheme so far, followed by   (Rs 79 lakh) and   (Rs 56 lakh).
 
 On May 4, after a meeting with representatives of RWAs from across the state, the chief minister had promised a rebate to plot owners who would pay   charge within the next two months.
 
 Following the announcement, Huda officials held a series of camps between May 10 and May 14 to reach out to plot owners, encouraging them to avail the benefit. Awareness camps were organized in sectors 27, 28, 31, 32 42, 43, 51, 52, 31, 32a, 39, 40, 45, 46 and 57.
 
 Meanwhile, a section of plot owners, who paid the enhanced compensation even before the government announced the discount, have demanded refunds. They said despite making the on-time payments in time, they didn’t get any benefit.
 
 “We have received representation from people who have paid full amount before the one-time settlement scheme was announced. We have sent their request to the chief administrator, Huda higher-ups. The final decision will be taken by the state authorities,” said Dr  , administrator, Huda, Gurugram.
