Ranveer Singh, who turned 32 on Thursday, couldn’t have asked for a better birthday present. On Wednesday, a spanking new  , which he had booked months ago, was delivered to him. The actor who arrived in his Mercedes at an Andheri studio by noon with his driver behind the wheel, exited around 9 pm in the evening in his new ride, waving happily at the paparazzi.

  
  
 His driver took the Mercedes back to his   residence, where his parents Jagjit Singh and Anju Bhavnani, and sister Ritika stay. Ranveer had moved out of the family home in 2015 after buying an apartment on Film City Road in Goregaon to stay closer to the then under production 'Bajirao Mastani' set. While he still juggles between the two addresses, he’s been staying more often in the new apartment for the on-going schedule of his period-romance 'Padmavati', which reunites him with Sanjay Leela Bhansali and actress-girlfriend  .
 
 "While everyone assumed that Ranveer was going home, he drove to   and waited patiently for girlfriend Deepika Padukone to arrive at her pad. The two then headed to his Bandra residence for a small get-together to ring in his birthday at midnight. His grandparents turned up with a cake. But before that, the actor took his ladylove for a quick spin in his new car. The duo also stopped by a Bandra five-star for a quick meal," a photographer revealed to Mirror.
 
 Around noon on Thursday, Shah Rukh, Salman and Aamir Khan, Ranveer stepped out of his building to cut birthday cakes with gathered fans and media amidst greetings and selfie requests. The actor, known for his sweet tooth, also binged on chocolates. The informal celebration was followed by another ride in his new car.
 
 According to a source, Ranveer was really keen on spending his birthday with Deepika. Interestingly, when Deepika, who shares her beau’s passion for cars, had acquired an Audi Q7 last year, Ranveer was the first one to be taken out for a spin.
