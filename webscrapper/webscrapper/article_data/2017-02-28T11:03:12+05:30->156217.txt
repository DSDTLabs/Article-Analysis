HYDERABAD: The   has directed the   to pay 50% wages to administrative assistants and several other temporary workers which the corporation hired and fired them after availing their services for 84 days.

 The apex court also directed the corporation to absorb all ex-employees who still have the age to render services. This practice of hiring temporary workers has been there in the LIC from 1985 onwards.
 
 Following a three deca de old prolonged legal battle by All India National   Employees Federation and also the Tamil Nadu terminated full time temporary LIC employees association, the apex court has now ruled unequivocally in the favour of the terminated employees.
 
 The Supreme Court found fault with LIC's ways of filling posts on temporary basis when there is a continuous need to have them. According to the Natio nal Federation's general secretary Rajesh Nimbalkar, the SC order would help more than 8,000 employees of both class 3 and class 4 categories. A huge chunk of them are from AP and Telangana.
 
 While the judgement was given by a bench headed by Justice Gopala Gowda, the review filed against it and the curative petition by LIC management seeking reversal of this order was dismissed by Supreme Court's three judge bench headed by Chief Justice J S Khehar.
