NEW DELHI: AIIMS director   is going to retire within a week on January 31, but the government is yet to finalise his replacement.

 Sources said the selection-cum-search committee entrusted with the job held its third meeting on Tuesday and shortlisted five names. The list of names includes HOD paediatrics Dr V K Paul, HOD of pulmonary medicine and sleep disorder Dr Randeep Guleria, HOD of ENT Dr S C Sharma, cardiology professor Dr Balram Bhargava and director of National Brain Research Centre (NBRC), Manesar Dr Subrata Sinha.
 
 “The shortlisted names will now be placed before the institute body of AIIMS on January 28. It will select one name and send it to the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) headed by the Prime Minister for final approval,” said a senior health ministry official.
 
 In its last meeting, the selection committee had shortlisted seven names, including HOD cardiology Dr V K Bahl and pathology professor Dr Chitra Sarkar. In all, 53 eminent doctors, including 35 from outside AIIMS, had applied for the post.
 
 Apart from Union health secretary C K Mishra, the chairperson, the committee comprised the PM’s principal scientific adviser  , secretary in department of health research Soumya Swaminathan, director general of health services Jagdish Prasad and vice-chancellor of Delhi University Yogesh Tyagi.
 
 Last month, AIIMS had recommended a search-cum-selection committee headed by Union health minister J P Nadda, which was rejected by department of personnel and training.
