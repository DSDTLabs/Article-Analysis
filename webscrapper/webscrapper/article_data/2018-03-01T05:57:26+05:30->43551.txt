AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) dispatched hall tickets of students - who will take class X and class XII board exams - to the   (DEO). 

 Schools across the state will be able to collect the hall tickets from DEO between 11am and 4pm from Thursday. 
 
 However, the process might not be as smooth as expected as the   (SMA) has instructed schools not to collect hall tickets. The SMA issued the instruction alleging that the government was putting school managements in a fix over fee regulation.
 
 SMA officials have proposed that DEO directly distribute hall tickets to students. Class X and class XII board exams are set to begin on March 12. In the past, cases of certain schools, including those affiliated to the  , refusing to issue hall tickets to students have come to the fore. In fact, a complaint had been registered with state education minister  .
 
 Thereafter, the minister issued instructions to schools stating they had no right to stop hall ticket distribution. Even the CBSE issued an advisory asking schools not to take such steps. 
 
 Self-financed   president, Deepak Rajyaguru, issued a statement saying, "Some 15,000 schools across the state provide education to thousands of students along with employment to 1.5 lakh teachers. The government is painting a wrong picture about the school managements in the public domain, due to which friction is created between parents and school managements."
