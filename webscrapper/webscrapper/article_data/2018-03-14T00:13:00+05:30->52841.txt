Tiruvarur: The district court in Tiruvarur on Tuesday acquitted the coordinator of the anti-methane movement, T Jayaraman, and seven villagers in a case filed by the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) against their protests seeking winding up of exploration activities in the delta region.

 Jayaraman, 64, a retired professor, has been waging a war against ONGC and its extraction process across the delta districts. He was arrested by Tiruvarur taluk police on March 14 last year on charges of protesting against ONGCâ€™s plans to dig a second well at Keelapadugai village in the district by mobilising farmers and the general public. 
 
 Based on a complaint lodged by ONGC authorities, Tiruvarur police had arrested seven more protesters supporting the anti-methane movement the same day. Subsequently, the police filed a case against all of them at the district judicial magistrate court in Tiruvarur. The court proceedings had been going on for the last one year. Meanwhile, a few more cases in connection with the protest against ONGC are pending against T Jayaraman, police sources said.
