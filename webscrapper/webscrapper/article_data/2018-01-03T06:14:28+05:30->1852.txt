LUDHIANA: A   resident, Poonam (wife of  ) delivered a baby outside the labour room in  , as after consulting their doctor, they were first asked to get an   worker along.

 Poonam, accompanied by her husband, reached the hospital in extreme pain around 6pm for her delivery, but allegedly, the staff nurse on duty asked her to get an Asha worker first. But before she could do that, she delivered a baby outside the labour room itself, even as the staff nurse came to check what was happening when other patients and their relatives sitting around her started screaming.
 
 Dinesh said: “My wife was in extreme pain, and the doctor checked us. Doctors and the staff nurse would have known she was about to deliver, and so they should have kept her inside, but instead, we were told by the staff nurse to call an Asha worker, so I went back home for the same. Meanwhile, my wife delivered a female baby. We are uneducated and should have been told where to wait or what to do. Her health should have been considered a priority.” 
 
 Senior medical officer of Mother and Child Hospital,  , said: “They were first checked by doctors, and we then asked them to get an Asha worker, so their file could be made and documents completed. Meanwhile, she delivered outside the labour room itself. But now, both mother and daughter are fine.”
