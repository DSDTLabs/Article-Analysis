CHENNAI: I-League team  's Ngasepam   is set to move to   champion  .

 
 The 23-year old left-back will make the shift on a "free transfer" when the summer transfer window officially opens in June, a press release said here.
 
 Singh, who has played in 17 of the 18 league matches for Neroca this season, would ink a two-year contract with CFC.
 
 This would be his first stint outside Manipur and Imphal specifically, having played for NEROCA's youth teams aged 11. He made his debut for the senior team in the Manipur State League five years later.
 
 "I'm feeling really good on signing for Chennaiyin FC. I'm looking forward to learning and becoming a better player under the coach (John Gregory). I'm very grateful for this huge opportunity," an elated Singh said on agreeing terms with the   champions.
 
 Head coach Gregory hailed Singh's signing as a step in the right direction and said it further strengthened the Chennaiyin backline that was key to its last season's success.
 
 "I've always believed in healthy competition for places in the eleven and Tondonba is a welcome addition in that regard. I have been told he is a solid defender with a very gifted left foot and great ability to overlap," he added.
