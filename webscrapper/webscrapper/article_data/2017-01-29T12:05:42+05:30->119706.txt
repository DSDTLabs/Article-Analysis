Bollywood's King of Hearts Shah Rukh Khan has vehemently condemned the Bengaluru mass molestation. The actor, who was present at a charity event, where he walked as a showstopper, lent his star power to urge parents to teach their sons how to respect women. 

 SRK joined the growing list of stars like Akshay Kumar, Aamir Khan, Anushka Sharma, Virat Kohli, Hrithik Roshan, and many more, who have voiced their disgust and anger towards theses incidences that sparked a nationwide outrage. 
 
 Speaking at the event, Shah Rukh said, 'The feeling is exactly the same as other celebrities have said. I think it's completely wrong. We all, mothers and fathers, have to treat our sons in a way that they learn to respect women from an early age.'
 
 The 51-year-old actor said women should be treated with utmost respect, whether they are working professionals or housewives.
 
 "I think women are close to my heart, my daughter is close to my heart, her mother is close to my heart, all girls are close to my heart. I think it is high time we realise that and make sure they are the most respected people on the planet. If they were not there, we wouldn't be here. Working women, housewives, every woman who is there in the world should be respected," the actor said.
