NEW DELHI: Failure of government to provide facilities is leading to delays in trial of   relating to sexual offences against children.

 A batch of petitions including one filed by Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA) on Tuesday informed the Delhi high court that delays have resulted in cases where accused have either got bail or are yet to face trial. HC then asked the government to inform it of steps taken to improve facilities for prosecutors appointed to prosecute accused under   Act. HC made it clear the court expects a detailed report on status of prosecutor facilities as per its last order.
 
 Earlier, the court had wondered how city prosecutors can measure against legal luminaries in a criminal trial when they don’t even have “the benefit of bare essentials.”
 
 “Even though extremely difficult, sensitive and complicated criminal cases, including cases under POCSO Act, are being prosecuted by the prosecutors, they are only assigned common space in court complexes. It needs no elaboration that these cases require confidentiality where they may be required to meet investigating officers, examine records, and prepare cases. These prosecutors appear in these cases against the top criminal minds and legal luminaries without having the benefit of bare essentials which are needed for effective preparation and legal representation,” a bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice Anu Malhotra had observed.
 
 It had then ordered the Delhi government’s chief secretary to submit a report on conditions of prosecutors and status of appointments, while stressing that “serious lawyering necessarily entails an office, i.e. a designated private area for meeting clients, taking instructions, reading files and law, legal drafting, preparing arguments, attending to phone calls — a place of privacy and respite. It is only a newcomer to the Bar who may operate from common space shared by many lawyers.”
