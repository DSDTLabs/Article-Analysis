NAGPUR: When   are entitled to  , why is it not being used and who has stopped them? said   Sanjay Pawar after being honoured with Ketan Pimplapure Memorial Ambedkari Pratibha Gaurav Puraskar at Mor Hindi Bhavan on Monday. 

 Playwrights Premanand Gajvi, painter Pramod Ramteke, advocate Vimalsurya Chimankar and Ketki Ketan Pimplapure were present at the function.
 
 Pawar further said, “A lot of hue and cry is raised over suppression of voice. Banning a movie, drama or a book does not mean that the freedom of expression is under threat. The new-rich   community has stopped expressing itself.” 
 
 “The   which led various social cultural and political movement is not responding to raising issues like GST, farmer suicides, demonetization, abuse of women, no leave on the first day of the menstrual cycle, cow slaughter and singing Vande Mataram. Today’s Buddhists and the erstwhile Mahar community has gone on silent mode,” he said. 
 
 Pawar said, “When someone says the constitution of India will be changed, the Dalit community wakes up for some time, and then goes into a deep slumber again.”
 
 Speaking on the occasion, Gajvi demanded that the history of India should be re-written. “The history is not 5000 years but 8,000 years old. Hindu culture was established by the Nagas,” he said.
