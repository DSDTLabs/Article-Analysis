LUCKNOW: Three days after his spat with  , a  , the   Dr   Das Agrawal met chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi and maintained his stance on the episode. The MLA handed over a 54-point memorandum on behalf of various groups, each demanding removal of   from their respective locality. 

 Talking to TOI, Dr Agrawal said, “I met the   and apprised him about the incident and my side of the story.” Agrawal said the chief minister gave him patient hearing, though none of the demands was met so far. 
 
 “I did not demand action against the circle officer,” the MLA said, adding that his only two demands were closure of the liquor shop at Kohilwa village and release of residents who were taken into custody by the police for staging protest. 
 
 “Since the chief minister is also the Gorakhpur MP, he has information about every development there beforehand,” said Agarwal. 
 
 Hitting out at media, the MLA said it the issue was blown out of proportion and it was wrong to report that he was summoned by the CM. “As a matter of fact, I had sought appointment with the CM”, said Agrawal, adding that since the CM was out of Lucknow for three days, he came to Lucknow to meet him on Thursday. Agarwal said the CM discussed with him development issues related to Gorakhpur.
