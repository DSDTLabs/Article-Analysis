PANCHKULA:   adores dogs. So much so that she has adopted seven strays. But that's not where her love ends. The Sector 2 resident takes care of them herself and pampers them with special dog feed, milk, paneer and even home-cooked chicken, spending almost Rs 15,000 on their food. 

 Sharma, a private builder, says she has a soft corner for stray animals. She also tends to cows and cats that she comes across during her morning and evening walks. "I always stop whenever I find a needy stray animal on the road. I have been like this since childhood," she says.
 
 At her house, the dogs stay in her garage. She has also got them vaccinated and sterilised the male dogs. The dogs are like a family for Archana, whose husband is a doctor and lives in the US. "I treat the stray dogs like my sons. I wish everyone helps needy animals as we encroached upon their space by constructing buildings everywhere. They also need care and love," she says. Her dogs sure get plenty of that.
 
 From packed good quality dog food to eggs, paneer, milk and fruits daily, the dogs also get a treat of home-cooked chicken once a week.
 
 Archana says she has helped the   in sterilising more than 15 stray dogs in   recently.
