JAMMU: Deepika S Rajawat, who is fighting victim's case, says that she has been facing threats from fellow lawyers in  . Rajawat (38) is chairperson and founder of Voice for Rights, an NGO which works among underprivileged women and children. 

 
 On Thursday, she accused Jammu Bar Association president BS Slathia of threatening her. “I am not a member of the Jammu Bar Association. But on Wednesday, Slathia asked me to stay away from the case while I was going to the court. I am not answerable to him, I am only answerable to my client,” she told TV channels. “I am not scared, but I am not feeling safe either. Protestors (lawyers) are trying to put pressure on me so that I don’t fight for justice. But I will continue to fight victim's case. I have full faith in the police investigation,” Rajawat said. She said she had written to the Chief Justice of Jammu HC seeking security. 
 
 At a press conference in Jammu, Slathia, however, denied the allegations and said, “I have due regards for my fellow colleague. I don’t want to comment in this matter as the objective of the stir will get deviated.” Slathia was elected as president of the Bar Association on April 13 last year for the second time. 
 
 The Jammu Bar Association has been protesting against the police, accusing them of bias and conspiracy against Hindus of   district. The lawyers have been demanding a   probe into the victim's rape and murder case. Several of them tried to prevent the police to submit chargesheet against the seven accused, who are Hindus, in the chief judicial magistrate’s court in Kathua. 
 
 Despite repeated attempts, TOI couldn’t contact Rajawat.
