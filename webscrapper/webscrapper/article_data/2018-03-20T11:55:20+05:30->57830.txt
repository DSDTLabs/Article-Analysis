THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister   said that he had written to Union finance minister   on February 20 against the Centre’s decision to sell off the shares and privatise   (HLL) and   (HNL).

 Replying to a calling attention motion by   D  , the chief minister said that the government had promised all support to the Centre if both the institutions are retained as public sector undertakings. “The government has promised the Centre that it will make available government land, provide tax relief and offer bank guarantee for raising working capital from the banks, but no favourable reply has been received from the Centre,” he said. He said that there are moves to sell off the shares of some other PSUs functioning in the state too, but the state government is trying its best to retain those in the public sector itself.
 
 He said he had written to Prime Minister   on June 16 last year, requesting him to drop the move to privatise the Central PSUs but the Centre is going ahead with the plan. HLL, that commenced operations as Hindustan Latex Ltd in 1966, has been granted 19 acres by the state government for launching its various facilities. The company has been categorised as a Mini-Ratna at present.
