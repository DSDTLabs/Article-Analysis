BENGALURU: Sixty-one members of an undivided family exercised their franchise on Saturday at a polling booth in   near Thubarahalli, Marathahalli-Varthur Road. 

  The voters' contingent from the  , as the undivided family is called in the area, was led by the materfamilias, 95-year-old Byramma M. At the tail-end were four first-time voters - Nayana V, Mohith J, Harshith V and   - who said they felt 'proud and responsible' after getting their fingers inked. The family members came in batches to the polling station, given their engagements . 
 
  Speaking to TOI , SH Krishnappa, 78, who is the head of the family with 80-odd members, said their elders always advise the youngsters on the importance of voting. "When I was young, voting was a privilege. But, somehow, we feel that the present generation is not serious about elections. We cannot blame them. The waning trust in politicians and their unhealthy attitude may be uninspiring for these youngsters," he said. 
 
  Further, Krishnappa said he and his brothers often discuss the options with family members, especially youngsters. "It is our duty to educate them about the candidates, their history and other issues. Who to vote is left to them," he said. "Corruption is something that has to be removed from our system. But how soon will this be done? We have no idea," an elderly woman from the family said. 
 
  Settled in Siddapura-Thubarahalli for over a century now, the Chikkagowdara Kutumba's main occupation is agriculture. "Our ancestors were known for their farming abilities. During pre-Independence period, we had hundreds of acres of cultivable land between Bengaluru and Hoskote. Gradually, many from the family became professionals like doctors, engineers and government employees. We are now left with more than 50 acres of cultivable land," Krishnappa said.
