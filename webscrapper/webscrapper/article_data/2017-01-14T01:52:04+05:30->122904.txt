NOIDA: Former Union minister and four-time MP from Khurja-Noida seat, Ashok Pradhan, rejoined BJP on Friday after a three-year stint with the ruling   in Uttar Pradash. Three other SP functionaries from Noida also joined the BJP along with Pradhan.

 According to a source, BJP is likely to reward Pradhan for his defection. Since the former MP from the region still holds considerable influence in Noida, his wife, Vimla Pradhan, is likely to get the BJP ticket for the Khurja assembly segment in the forthcoming election, the source said.
 
 Asked about his change of heart towards SP in the state, Pradhan said the tussle in the SP clearly showed that the ruling party in Uttar Pradesh was totally confused at the moment. “People are upset with the party (SP). I hope there will be a change in UP,” he said.
 
  “I was always a BJP man,” he added.
 
 Yogendra Chowdhary, a former city president of BJP who had joined SP in 2014, too returned to BJP on Friday. Two other SP functionaries, Mahesh Awana and  , also joined BJP.
 
 Touted as a Dalit face of the BJP in the initial days, Pradhan first became an MP from Khurja-Noida parliamentary constituency, renamed as Gautam Budh Nagar, for the first time in 1996 when the seat was reserved for the SC/ST category. He won from the same seat again in 1998, 1999, and in the re-election in 1999-2000. He served as a minister of state in Atal Behari Vajpayee’s cabinet handling portfolios like food and civil supplies, labour, HRD, telecommunication and information technology.
 
 However, days ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Pradhan joined SP, alleging that there was a “trade” of Lok Sabha tickets in BJP. He had also said at that time that senior BJP leaders L K Advani,   and others were being sidelined and there was resentment in the party.
