Madurai: Among the posters put up by   and workers, Tuticorin District Mechanised Trawl Boat Workers Association has put up a flex urging   to move barge operation to New Port. The association levels charges against barge operators stating that they tend to overload boulders at times and dump them in sea when they are not able to sail further. Such dumping of huge boulders endangers natural coral reef growth vital for fish growth. Further, these boulders dumped in sea endanger fishermenâ€™s lives because the trawl boats collide against them and propellers get broken during low tides, the association observed. 

 According to fishermen sources, two   which sunk near the old harbour should have been salvaged. As the operator failed to turn up, they were still lying under the sea with full load of boulders. The port authorities should take up salvaging works, the fishermen appealed. 
 
 Meanwhile, another association named Coromandel Welfare Association from Tuticorin stated that Old Port was situated inside the city. There were a lot of accidents and traffic congestion when huge boulders were transported through trucks to old port. If the barge operations were moved to New Port situated on the outskirts, it would be a great relief to pedestrians and motorists in the city. 
 
 Thoni operators say that Old Port tariff has been fixed comparatively less with the intension of promoting traditional thoni transport. The berthing, wharfage charges, are 200 % lesser when compared to new port tariff. The barges operating from Old Port enjoy these benefits meant for thonis and cause loss to government, they charged.
