Fans of popular Hollywood's Ocean's trilogy are keenly awaiting the release of its forthcoming spin-off 'Ocean's 8' featuring leading actresses Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett and Anne Hathaway.Similarly, in India, Bollywood is also coming up with one-of-a-kind female driven movie 'Veere Di Wedding', which, according to trade pundits, is expected to witness humungous footfalls at the box office.

  
 Starring   Khan, newly-married  ,   and   in the lead, 'Veere Di Wedding' is all set to hit screens across India on June 1, one week before the release of 'Ocean's 8' on June 8.
 "All eyes are on 'Veere Di Wedding' as not only it is the film showing tremendous potential, but is also a game changer in more than one ways. While Hollywood has films like 'Sex & the City' and recently 'Ocean's 8', Indian cinema is finally waking up to the power of our female superstars," said a trade source.
 "'Veere Di Wedding' brings together two heavyweights - Sonam Kapoor Ahuja and Kareena Kapoor Khan. Swara Bhaskar and Shikha Talsania too have proved their mettle as powerhouse performers and the casting is relatable and just right for the script.
 "The makers have infused a modern sensibility where the women are the protagonists and not just the hero's love interests," the source added.
 With huge success of female oriented films like 'Pink', 'Queen', 'English Vinglish', 'Mom', 'Mardaani', 'Lipstick Under My Burkha', 'Dear Zindagi', 'Neerja', 'Piku' and 'Mary Kom' at the Indian box office in past few years, expectations from 'Veere Di Wedding' are high.
 The film has been backed by Ekta Kapoor and directed by Shashanka Ghosh.
 While 'Ocean's 8', is an all-female led spinoff re-visioning the series as an all-female job, 'Veere Di Wedding' too is an unapologetic story of four women from different walks of life.
