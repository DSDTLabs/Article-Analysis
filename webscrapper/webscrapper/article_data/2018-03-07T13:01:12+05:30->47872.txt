VIJAYAWADA: A   in the Krishna district collectorate attempted to commit suicide by reportedly consuming phenyle at his home on Tuesday. 

 BVN Prasad, working in the B-section of the office, was rushed to a private hospital in the city and his condition is reportedly stated to be stable after treatment.
 
 The reason behind his suicide bid could not be ascertained as the man gave two different versions to police and reporters. Prasad who was absent in office on Monday told police that he tried to kill himself due to some personal problems. While speaking to the mediapersons, however, he changed his version, saying that too much work pressure compelled him to think of ending his life.
 
 Sources said Prasad had received a show-cause notice from the district revenue officer recently because of his delay in clearing a file. Though he replied to the notice, he was worried that he would be suspended. However, the collectorate employeesâ€™ association is planning to hold a protest after the reason behind his suicidal attempt is established. Police said they are probing into the matter.
