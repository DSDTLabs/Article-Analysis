GHAZIABAD: A 54-year-old trader was seriously injured after being shot at during a petty quarrel in Ghaziabad on Saturday. The victim, Parvez, owns a paper and coir foam godown in   where the shooting took place at around 2.30 pm.

 An employee of Parvez, identified by police as Salim (52), had a narrow escape after a bullet grazed his forehead. The two were attacked by three men – Afzal, Atif and Afnan – who own a separate godown of scrap materials, adjacent to the one owned by Parvez. Afzal and Atif, who are brothers, live in Islam Nagar of Ghaziabad. 
 
 According to police, Afzal whipped out his licenced revolver during the quarrel on Saturday and fired six rounds on Parvez and Salim. The fight had started between the two parties on Friday afternoon. Parvez’s younger brother   told TOI that around 3 pm on Friday, one of the three accused had allegedly knocked down a plastic bucket, which Parvez had filled with water and placed it for stray dogs outside his own godown, while reversing a car.
 
 “The bucket got damaged when a   being driven by one of the three men was reversing. A quarrel had ensued but it was settled soon thereafter. However, both parties began a fight again on Saturday. We have recovered six empty and three live cartridges from the spot,” said local police outpost in-charge Rajendra Khoda.
 
 Parvez was not present in the godown when the fighting took place on Friday.
 
  “Workers in Parvez’s godown had picked up a fight with Afzal and Atif who in turn had called up police control room. Police and locals had pacified both parties. But the fight began again when Parvez reached the godown on Saturday. Parvez raised his voice against Afzal who opened fire at him and Salim,” said Raees Ahmed.
 
 A crowd that gathered at the spot soon after the incident damaged the Hyundai Creta by pelting stones on it. Parvez and Salim were rushed to Yashoda Hospital in Nehru Nagar.
