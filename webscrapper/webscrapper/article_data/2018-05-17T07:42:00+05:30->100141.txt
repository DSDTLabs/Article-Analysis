GURUGRAM: A man, in his 30s, first molested a minor and then attempted to   a woman in a village of   area (Sector 50) in the early hours of Wednesday.

 
 Later, the man allegedly also tried to steal mobile phones and cash from a jhuggi just outside the village but escaped when residents raised an alarm.
 
 Police said the 5-foot-6inch-tall man with fair complexion was caught on CCTV cameras installed in the area. 
 
 “He was wearing a black t-shirt and black shorts. A search operation was conducted in the area on Wednesday morning but no one has been arrested so far,” said Yoginder Singh, a local resident.
 
 A case has been registered against an unknown man under sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) and 506(criminal intimidation) of the IPC at Sector 50 police station.
 
 According to the residents, the man, apparently in an inebriated state, first pounced on a seven-year-old girl who was sleeping outside her house and dragged her to an adjoining house around 3am. 
 
 There, he undressed her and allegedly attempted to rape her.
 
  But the girl managed to escape from his clutches. The girl ran back to her house and informed her parents.
 
 In the meantime, the girl’s father heard a woman screaming for help from an adjacent house. He rushed to her help. Some local people also woke up after hearing the woman’s cry and gathered at the spot.
 
 “The woman told us a man, about 30 years old, barged into her house and asked her to undress. When she resisted, he took out a knife. She then started shouting and the man fled the scene,” said a senior officer from Sector 50 police station.
