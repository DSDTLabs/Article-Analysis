TRICHY: DMDK president   has blamed both the DMK and AIADMK for allowing ONGC to execute the exploration process in the delta districts. He was speaking after visiting   village in Thanjavur district where residents have been protesting for the last two months against the ongoing oil and gas exploration process.

 He said it was the DMK government which first gave clearance for the project but the AIADMK also did not oppose it at that time. He condemned the police action against the villagers in Kathiramangalam and arrest of nine villagers. Hundreds of traders downed shutters on Saturday too and observed a day-long strike.
 
 The villagers want ONGC to exit from the village as they claimed that the exploration process had led to water scarcity and depletion of ground water table. In recent days, they alleged that they had been receiving drinking water with oil floating on it. 
 
 While addressing protesters in front of Ayyanar temple where the villagers have been protesting,   appreciated the people for their peaceful way of protest. “The exploration process which is being opposed by you was approved and cleared by the regime when   and DMK were in power at the Centre. You handed over your fertile lands believing that you would be offered job. But instead, they have spoiled your livelihood", he said. He reminded them that Kathiramangalam had people’s representatives both from DMK (MLA) and AIADMK (MP) who were “still betraying them”.
