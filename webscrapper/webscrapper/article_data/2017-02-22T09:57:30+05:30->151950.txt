AHMEDABAD: The 125-year-old iconic   has four alternative ways of staying alive amidst us as per a suggestions made by experts engaged by the   (AMC). Though preliminary work is yet to begin on the suggestions of restoration made by the expert body, civic body officials said that a structural stability analysis will be conducted to ascertain the extent of damage that has occurred to the bridge’s deck. 

 The restoration work will be assigned to a department, either to the heritage or the roads and bridges department, said a source. “The experts engaged by the civic body has already submitted a plan,” a senior AMC official added.
 
 One suggestion was to conduct reinforcement of the piers and the deck to make the bridge pliable for the BRTS, the other was to convert it into pedestrian pathway and a museum after restoration, the third was to retain the essential parts of the bridge and then replace the worn out structures with new concrete material. The fourth was to retain the arches of the bridge, which later is grafted.
 
 “The report has suggested structural supports. We will be using restoration techniques used while restoring the   bridge,” says a senior AMC official. Interestingly, the consultant engaged by the AMC now for restoration had on February 13, 2012, suggested to the AMC a completely new bridge be built in place of Ellisbridge.
 
 Since 1973, Ellisbridge has defied death at least eight times. Each time the civic body makes an attempt to pull it down gritty   have opposed such move. Citizens’ support was so overwhelming that in 1987, AMC decided to preserve Ellisbridge and built two bridges alongside it which is called the Vivekanand bridge.
