Director   broke the news of his next film with   with his tongue, firmly in cheek, taking a potshot at Akhil’s dad  ! “Hey @iamnagarjuna I want to be honest, even if u will beat me with a cycle chain. I really think @AkhilAkkineni8 has a better voice, better style, better demeanour and many other few things better than what u had when u were doing #Shiva (sic),” he posted.
Not stopping at that, he went on to add, “Hey @iamnagarjuna, inspite of all the positives I am hoping to take care of @AkhilAkkineni8‘s few deficiencies as a director and much more than that I am really hoping that u will take care of my directorial deficiencies as a producer the way u so took care of me in #Shiva (sic).”
 Apparently, it’s going to be an intense action drama. “The film am making is a very highly intense and extremely realistic action film and not at all a young cute love story...it’s a very hard love story at its core but emotionally packaged with a very high degree of sensitive violence mixed with tremendous love (sic),” he added. 
 Referring to the coincidence of working with Akhil after he joined hands with Nag, 25-years after making his directorial debut with Shiva, RGV remarked, “Just love the circle of life.” And we couldn’t help but be reminded about what he had to say about Naga
 Chaitanya around the time his production,   was releasing. “Nagarjuna had acted in around 15 films before he acted in Shiva. Relatively, I think  , who has done just a handful of films till date, is much more matured as an actor than Nag was at the time he did Shiva. I think he is a better actor than his dad. I just hope Nagarjuna doesn’t come after me with a cycle chain!”
 Well, looks like RGV just can’t get over the cycle chain episode that he conceived in Shiva. And considering the fact that Bejawada sank without a trace, may we add, Akhil must be a very brave boy indeed to be teaming up with RGV again even though it’s been a very long time since he made a film that was spoken about.
