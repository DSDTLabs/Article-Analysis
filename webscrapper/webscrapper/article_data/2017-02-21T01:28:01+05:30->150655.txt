GURUGRAM: Even as app-based   aggregators claimed the indefinite strike by drivers had been called off and there was no dearth of cabs on the platforms, some drivers told TOI the stir was not yet completely over, raising fears of disruptions. 

 Though no incidents of violence were reported from across the city on Monday, some cabbies were spotted causing disturbance near  , which was slowing down the traffic at the busy junction.
 
 In fact, around 30 to 40 people were spotted stopping yellow number plate cars near Shankar Chowk and asking the drivers to give in their devices or produce proof that they were not driving for either   or  . 
 
 The protesters, however, disappeared before the cops arrived. “We had information that there were a few people stopping cars at Shankar Chowk, but by the time our personnel reached there, most of them had left the spot” said Arjun Dev, SHO of   police station.
 
 “Though most of the cabbies have resumed their duties, however the strike is not officially over,” said one of the drivers working for Ola. Union members could not be reached for a comment, but according to their posts on social media, the strike continues.
 
 When contacted, Ola officials said there were enough cabs available on the platform and the prices have been restored.
 
 Uber, on the other hand, maintained its statement which it had issued earlier. “The Delhi high court’s order has reaffirmed that no one can engage in violence or prevent drivers who wish to drive using Apps like Uber from doing so. We’re dismayed that violence and intimidation of drivers has continued, despite a court order,” said an Uber spokesperson.
 
 Last week, a bunch of drivers had been involved in forcefully stopping the cabs which were plying and making the passengers alight in the middle of the rides. A young woman and and her baby had suffered minor injuries due to the nuisance caused by some cabbies in Gurgaon.
