CUTTACK: Police on Sunday registered a case against the 12-year-old boy who accidentally fired at his classmate while playing with his father's licensed pistol on Saturday.

 A case has been registered at Badambadi police station under Section 38 (criminal act) of the Indian Penal Code and 25 and 27 (punishment for using gun) of Arms Act, on the basis of a written complaint submitted by the injured child   Mohanty's father, P Mohanty. 
 
 On Saturday, Anubhav, a student of Class VI, had gone to his friend's house. His friend's father, a   constable, owned a licensed pistol (of 7.65 mm caliber) which the kids stumbled upon and began playing with. Anubhav's friend had then accidentally shot at him. "We have started our probe into the case," said inspector-in-charge of Badambadi police station, Biranchi Narayan Pati.
 
 Police have also examined documents of the licenced gun that belonged to the boy's father and found them valid. "We have questioned the boy and his father in connection with the incident. It is a clear case of accident. Still, our probe is on," said Pati. 
 
 Police have also clarified that there was no negligence on the part of the accused boy's father as he had kept his gun safely at the bottom of his bag. "So far, we have not found any fault of the boy's father in the entire episode. Such guns do not even have locking systems," said Pati.
 
 Meanwhile, Anubhav's condition is stable now. On Saturday night, he underwent surgery at a private hospital here and is under observation, said an official of the private hospital where he had been admitted.
