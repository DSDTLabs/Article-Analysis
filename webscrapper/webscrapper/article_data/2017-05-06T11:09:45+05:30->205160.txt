BAREILLY: As the   on Friday upheld the death sentence for four men convicted of raping and killing a 23-year-old   in Delhi in 2012, there was a palpable sense of gloom in   village of Bareilly, where the fifth convict, a   during the crime, grew up. People wanted a similar punishment for him too. Said to be the most brutal of all, the “fifth convict“ was just a few months away from turning 18 at the time of the brutal crime, which stirred the conscience of the nation.

 People of the village, mostly women, said that they were not happy that the boy got away with “far too little“ while other accused will now have to face the death sentence.
 
 The juvenile walked free in December 2015 after serving a three-year term at a reform home. He never returned home or contacted his family and five younger siblings since, they said.
 
 Former village pradhan Laltesh Yadav told TOI, “The four other convicts paid the price for committing the crime, but the boy got away with very little punishment. He too deserved the death penalty like the others.“
 
 However, the juvenile's family still awaits his return. “My son was punished for whatever wrong he did. However, I want him to come back home and take care of his poor family. His two teen sisters, 15 and 16, work as labourers and he should take responsibility for their marriage,“ said his mother.
