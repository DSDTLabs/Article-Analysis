ALWAR: A four-year-old girl in Alwar on Monday was   while she was profusely bleeding from her private parts. The cops nabbed the 20-year-old accused later in the evening as he was trying to flee from the city.

 “At 4 pm on Monday, the minor was found alongside a road in Alwar by some persons. She was rushed to a local hospital, the doctors of the hospital informed the   about the suspected case of a rape,” the police official said.
 
 Tehala Police station arrived at the hospital and launched a massive manhunt to nab the accused.
 
 At around 5 pm, the police teams managed to establish the identity of the suspect as one Manish Koli. “Based on the circumstantial evidence and intelligence inputs, we nabbed arrested Manish Koli from a nearby house,” the police official told TOI.
 
 The primary investigation suggests that Koli was lived next to minor’s house and on Monday afternoon he abducted the child from her house when she was alone. Koli took the child to a secluded place away from their area and allegedly raped her. 
 
 “When the child began to scream in pain, the accused got worried about being exposed. Hence, he left the girl writhing in pain and fled from the spot. He couldn’t go to his house and therefore went to another village to evade arrest,” the police official said. 
 
 The girl was later moved to a special treatment facility in Alwar for treatment after doctors found her condition beginning to deteriorate. Alwar SP Rahul Prakash said that Koli is being interrogated and he is been booked under relevant sections of IPC and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO). The police said that Koli lived next to the minor’s house and was entered the house when the child was alone as her parents were out of house.
