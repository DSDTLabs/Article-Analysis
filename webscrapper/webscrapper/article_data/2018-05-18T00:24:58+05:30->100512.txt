Vijayawada: The war words between Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams ( )   Dr Ramana Deeskshitulu and state government continued on Thursday with TDP leaders questioning the motives of the priest. 

 TDP national spokesperson, Kambhamapti Rammohan Rao, said Deeskshitulu’s allegations of corruption by TTD administrators have raised many doubts. “Making such allegations, despite being the chief priest, has spoiled the sanctity of the temple,” Rao said. He blamed the BJP and the YSRCP for stoking the controversy.
 
 Deputy chief minister, and revenue and endowment minister, KE Krishnamurthy, said: “It seems Deekshitulu has left his traditional job, and entered into politics. He behaved irresponsibly, and in a manner that tarnished the reputation of the temple.”
 
 Krishnamurthy said, “The government will take a serious note of this issue.” He directed TTD officials to take strict action against the chief priest. 
 
 He criticised Deekshitulu for his allegations against TTD board members, and said the priest has forgotten about the position he holds, and is not being a role model to other priests. “It is against the rules of the temple for a chief priest to hold a press conference and talk politics,” he said. 
 
 The deputy CM said that the Mirasi system was abolished in 1996, Deekshitulu was a Mirasi at that time. The Supreme Court had then upheld the nullification of the centuries-old trusteeship rights of the TTD’s hereditary Mirasi priests.
 
 Krishnamurthy said all the ornaments of Lord Venkateswara are safe and secure.
 
 He said officials do physical verification of the ornaments every year. He reminded that two committees, one headed by Justice Sri Jagannadha Rao and the other by Justice Wadhwa, had verified and examined the usage and security of the ornaments, and had reported their satisfaction over the arrangements.
