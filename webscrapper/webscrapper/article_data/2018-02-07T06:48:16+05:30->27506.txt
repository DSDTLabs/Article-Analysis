Chennai: A week after the   censured self-styled   Nithyananda and warned him of arrest for contempt of court, he expressed his regret on Tuesday saying he would take back the statement claiming to be the 293rd   of the Madurai Aadheenam Mutt.

 On January 29, Justice R Mahadevan had warned Nithyananda of an arrest warrant against him if he failed to rectify the misleading statements made to the court.
 
 Nithyananda filed the affidavit withdrawing the statement in which he called himself the 293rd Guru Mahasannidhanam while the 292nd pontiff Srila Sri Arunagirinatha Sri Gnanasambanda Desikan Paramacharya Swamigal was still holding the position of madadipathi of the Madurai Adheenam Mutt. “I sincerely regret and apologise for the statement”, he added.
 
 Justice Mahadevan was hearing a plea moved by M Jagathalapradhapan of Madurai for a direction to the government to take suitable action against Nithyananda and protect the Madurai Aadheenam. He also wanted the court to permanently prevent Nithyananda from interfering with the affairs of the Aadheenam.
 
 When the plea came up for hearing on Tuesday, Nithyananda filed an affidavit to take back his statement claiming to be the legally appointed pontiff of the mutt. Recording the submission, the judge posted plea to February 26 for further hearing. 
 
 This apart, the judge also made it clear that during the next date of hearing, the godman must make his stance clear whether he could give an undertaking that he would not enter Madurai Adheenam Mutt till the disposal of the civil suit pending before the competent civil court.
