AHMEDABAD:  , 72, a  , Hatkeshwar in Amraiwadi area, was found by neighbours on Thursday morning. Patel was hit on the head and her earrings were missing.   said that there was some money in the home but the assailants did not touch it.

 According to the investigators, Patel, a divorcee, was living with her son but her son had died about three years ago after which she was living alone. When she did not come out of home as per her routine on Thursday, her neighbours got worried and a few ventured into her home as the door was ajar.
 
 “She was lying on her bed with blood oozing out of left side of her forehead. Her two ears were also bleeding. She had already died. It is possible that she was attacked when asleep as the earrings were snatched from the ears rather than opening it. We are awaiting post-mortem report to ascertain time of death,” said an official. Investigators said that the last rites of the victim would be performed by the family of her former husband at her native village. 
 
 It is yet another case of assault on senior citizens living alone in the city. In the recent past, police have managed to crack two murder cases in the western city parts where those close to the victims were found to be involved in the incident.
