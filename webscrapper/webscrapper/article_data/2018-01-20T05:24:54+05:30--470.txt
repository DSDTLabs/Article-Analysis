KOLKATA: Considering the vulnerability and sensitivity of   sub-division,   is mulling additional forces for   constituency where bypolls will be held on January 29. 

 
  has already held talks with the Centre but the home ministry is expected to give the final nod after considering the deployment during Republic Day, which is very close to the election date.
 
 “At present, 30 companies of central forces have been sanctioned for Uluberia and five for   assembly polls. This has been sent 10 days before the election for area domination and preparing a report which will be sent to EC before January 23. In normal situations this is adequate, but in recent times there have been some problems in the area. So, we have asked for additional forces but the Centre is yet to give a final nod,” a senior EC official said.
 
 EC sources said the Centre is taking time because it is examining the force position and logistics as deployment during Republic Day is huge. “The election date is just three days after Republic Day. Naturally, they will have to keep the force ready so that it can reach the constituency by January 27. Else, it will be impossible for the administration to frame the security design,” a source said.
