Thanjavur: The government had hurriedly unveiled former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s portrait in the state assembly as it was uncertain of its tenure, R K Nagar MLA T T V   alleged on Monday. He said that the occasion was observed like a party function instead of being celebrated in a grand manner. 

 Since the verdict on the disqualification of 18 MLAs would be pronounced soon, the   camp had made arrangements for the function hastily, he told reporters here. The sidelined   leader said that the event was held as if it was a felicitation of a former mayor. “Eminent personalities and national leaders should have been invited for the occasion”, Dhinakaran opined. “Wherever I go, people ask me to speak about the state ministers. They have come to the conclusion that they (ministers) are comedians to be laughed at,” he added.
 
 “The present government was running as a commission mandi (market). This is not the government which the people of Tamil Nadu wished to have", he said and claimed that many MLAs had called him to offer their support. Many MLAs with the ruling government themselves want the government to be dissolved and fresh election held to bring back the 'Amma' government,” he said.
