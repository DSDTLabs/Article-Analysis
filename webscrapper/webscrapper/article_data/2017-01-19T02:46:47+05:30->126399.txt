NEW DELHI: The suspense over who will head   continues. The committee tasked with shortlisting three names out of a list of 53 applicants held its second meeting on Wednesday. Sources said the committee, which will meet again on January 24, had zeroed in on 10  .

 “The final list will be handed over to AIIMS’ Institute Body for further deliberation,” a source said. Dr M C Misra, current  , retires on January 31. Dr Randeep Guleria, head of pulmonary medicine; Dr V K Paul, head of paediatrics; cardiologists Dr V K Behl and Dr Balram Bhargav; and Dr S C Sharma, head of ENT; are among the key contenders. All of them are from AIIMS. Senior officials said 35 outsiders had also applied and a surprise selection could not be ruled out. A few doctors based abroad have also applied.
 
 Apart from Union health secretary C K Mishra, who is the chairperson, the committee comprises the PM’s principal scientific adviser, R Chidambaram; the secretary in the health research department, Soumya Swaminathan; director-general of health services Jagdish Prasad; and DU vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi. 
 
 After the personnel and training department in December rejected AIIMS’ proposal to set up a search-cum-selection committee under Union health minister  , the PMO ordered reconstitution of the panel following the department’s guidelines.
