NEW DELHI: In every Budget since 2013, the government has allocated Rs 1,000 crore towards the   — for schemes to ensure the  . But like every year since 2013, the allocation in 2015-16 remained unspent.

 The fund was created by the UPA government in 2013 in the memory of Nirbhaya, a Delhi paramedic who was assaulted and brutalised in December 2012 in a moving bus in the national capital. She later died of her injuries. The fund was launched with the objective of supporting schemes for the protection of women.
 
 However, in the last two Budgets, while continuing with UPA’s tradition of allocating Rs 1,000 crore towards this fund, the NDA government failed to come up with any scheme entailing expenditure. The scope of the fund included supporting non-governmental organisations working for the safety of women, but none could be shortlisted in the last three years to utilise the money.
 
 According to the approved Union finance account for 2015-16, tabled in Parliament in December, the government had devised two schemes — a Rs 653 crore scheme for “safety of women on public road transport” under the ministry of road transport and highways and the   worth Rs 79.6 crore under the home ministry. Neither of these schemes could take off, resulting in complete savings of the proposed allocation.
 
 Many other projects, with allocation made in 2015-16, remained on the drawing board with 100% savings. The government had allocated Rs 461 crore for employment and rehabilitation of manual scavengers. Again, this project could never take off. There was also a special programme devised for development of road connectivity in Naxal-affected areas, where women and children are often the worst sufferers, with an allocation of Rs 920 crore. This again had complete savings at the end of the year for the road transport ministry’s failure to implement it.
