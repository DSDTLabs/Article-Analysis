 Maneka Gandhi is known to have strong opinions about prevalent issues in the country and to voice out her views unabashedly. 

 Addressing the rising issue of crime against women in India during   on Friday, Maneka said, "We have very important reason why men believe they can get away or they indulge in violence against women and that is films. If you look at films, which is a way to communicate messages, you will find romance almost always starts with eve-teasing. The man and friends will surround a woman, be mean to her trip her up, show her down, abuse her, touch her inappropriately and slowly she falls in love with him."
 
 She emphasized on the fact that the film fraternity represents women in an indecent manner, which results in the crime against them. She even urged the   industry to portray women in a better light.

 Now this is something that should be analysed carefully as Bollywood movies last year was all about  . From movies like, ‘Neerja’, ‘Pink’, ‘Dangal’ to ‘Sarbjit’, ‘Kahaani 2’, women were shown in an extremely positive light. Their characters were so strong that each one left an indelible mark in our memories.
 
 However, some movies still practise the same old technique of ‘
 ’ approach, which needs to be stopped NOW!
