LUCKNOW: Ten days after Indian Institute of Management (Lucknow) student, Shubhodeep Das, went missing from the college campus, city police are yet to find any clues about the 26-year-old's disappearance. 

 Das, who was a second year student of the postgraduate programme (PGP), left IIM-L premises on July 18 after signing the institute's register. In the register, he wrote that he was going back to his hometown Kolkata in West Bengal. However, he never reached there.
