BENGALURU: Auto driver   S, 55, enjoys bandh days. Not because it offers him a chance to stay off work or make a little more money by fleecing stranded passengers, but because it gives him an opportunity to do something which he likes doing —  . Pregnant women and persons with disabilities tops his list.

 On bandh days, Mahadeva, from Shivanagar, west Bengaluru, fills up the tank of his auto and waits for a patient. “Every day I work for money,” he said. “But on bandh days, I go and wait for patients near government hospitals. These are days when others charge more. Poor people going to government hospitals cannot afford it.” He spends between Rs 500 and Rs 700 on fuel on a bandh day.
 
 By 4pm on Thursday, Mahadeva had already helped six patients. He dropped a physically challenged woman from Rajajinagar ESI hospital to her house in Shivanagar. He transported a pregnant lady from   to Basaveshwar where she had an appointment for a checkup. He then ferried a man with renal disorder from   to his house in Nadini Palya.
 
 Mahadeva also helped Kamaraj R, 48, from Jeevanahalli, east Bengaluru, who had visited the   in the Victoria Hospital complex. “I somehow managed to get to the hospital at 8.30am, but I was worried about getting back,” Kamaraj told TOI. “Then I saw Mahadeva and his auto with a board that said he helps patients and I approached him. He dropped me free of cost to my doorstep. Other auto drivers had wanted double the fare.”
 
 Mahadeva, who has been driving an auto for the last 28 years, says he began his ‘service’ after the riots over Cauvery water. “The worst affected during a bandh are poor patients,” he said. “I display my number on my auto. Anybody in need can call me.”
 
 Inspired by dad, his son, a cab driver also ferries preganant women free of charge.
