It’s probably not a good thing to annoy  , especially when the Rocky star is “alive and…still punching”. On Monday, the 71-year-old took to   to dispel the rumours of his death that were making rounds on social media since Sunday. “Please ignore this stupidity… Alive and well and happy and healthy… Still punching (sic)!” he posted. He followed this up with a video in which he’s seen playing with his daughters and humorously captioned it, “Locking my daughters outside during a slight hail storm. It’s so great to be back from the Dead (sic),” he posted.
A post on   had gone viral on Sunday saying that the Rocky star had died of prostate cancer. It was accompanied by a couple of pictures in which Stallone was looking weak and losing hair. Soon social media was flooded with RIP messages from fans and well-wishers alike. 
 On Monday, Stallone’s brother Frank  , who was not amused by the rumours, clarified that the pictures were from the sets of Stallone’s 2015 film Creed. “This picture was posted of my brother by the low life who said he was dead. This photo is from the make-up trailer on the set of Creed. Who raised these cretans anyway that they would find humor in someone’s passing? This person@rockybalboa should be thrown off social media and locked up! (sic),” posted   on Instagram. 
 He also took to twitter to express his anguish. “I’m very protective of my older brother and I don’t find any humor in this fake post today on my brothers demise. It upset my 96 yr old mother so I’m doubly upset. I just can’t understand what makes these sick minded people tick? (sic),” said Frank.
 However, this is not the first time that such a rumour has made news as a similar hoax in 2016 was dismissed bythe Demolition Man star by 
 posting a picture of himself on social media.
