NAGPUR: Many more serious errors have come to fore in the voters list prepared by   ( ) for the elections slated on February 21. There is huge difference in number of voters in the 38 wards. For example, while 99.27% of the population in ward no. 29 is eligible to vote, the figure is only 57% in ward no. 4.

 NMC has finalized the voters list as per the new 38 wards a couple of days ago. A close look into the voters revealed many puzzling figures.
 
 Ward no. 38 is the smallest among all wards as far as area and population are concerned. So, this ward will have three corporators while there will be four in remaining 37 wards. The population of ward no. 38 is 47,216, and 37,346 of them are eligible to vote. Thus, voters comprise 79.09% of the population. 
 
 However, as per the voters list, ward no. 4 has less voters than ward no. 38. Population in this ward is 60,949 while there are 34,802 voters, that is 57% of population.
 
 The city’s population considered for preparing voters list is 24,47,494, of which 20,93,391 are voters, that is 85.53% of the population. So, 57% voters in ward no. 4 is questionable.
 
 Similarly, seven other wards (9, 10, 12, 14, 26, 28 and 35) have lesser population than ward no. 4. However, there are many more voters in all these seven wards as compared to ward no. 4.
 
 Ward no. 29 has population of 62,343 with 61,870 voters, that is 99.27% of the population. Only those above 18 can be registered as voters. So, does the age group of 0-18 years only comprise 0.73% of the population in this ward?
 
 The city’s population has been considered as per the 2011 census. The population should have increased in the six years after that, and so also voters. However, that cannot explain the percentage of voters in these two wards.
 
 There other errors too. Number of female voters in four wards is more than male voters. As per population census 2011, overall sex ratio of the city was 951 females per 1,000 males. Child sex ratio was 931 females per 1,000 males. The average national sex ratio too is 940 females per 1,000 males. Therefore, female voters being more than males too raises questions.
 
  Krishna Khopde, a   leader, told TOI there are several errors in the voters list, which require thorough investigation before elections. “It was a common practice to conduct door-to-door intensive voters drive before municipal elections, but that has been stopped since last few years. I had asked the district administration about this a few months ago, but nothing happened. It is not possible that all residents of a ward are voters. Average number of voters should be 70-75% of population, with minor deviations,” he said.
 
 Congress city president   said it was unfortunate that voters list was full of errors in every election. “Voters list is prepared as per assembly constituency. NMC had to first prepare boundaries of new wards and then break up the voters. This system leaves chance for many errors. Voting percentage was only 52% in last NMC elections. Such errors only dampen spirit of voters,” he said.
