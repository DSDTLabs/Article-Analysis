INDORE: The cultural community of Indore gathered once again on Tuesday to raise their voice against re-development of   and Fine Arts College and government schools made in its vicinity. 

 Members of The Nature Volunteers started a signature campaign on Tuesday accusing civic body of destroying a heritage building. The community members will be collecting more signatures in the coming days and will be sending a letter in this regard to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Member of Parliament  , mayor, district collector, divisional commissioner,   commissioner etc. 
 
 “IMC plans to open a commercial complex at the location. The land over which they are planning this was given by   for educational purposes and has three government schools, a Marathi middle school and Fine Arts College which has been shifted to another location,” Bhalu Mondhe, president of The Nature Volunteers NGO said. 
 
 They have requested that the land may be conserved and Fine Arts College must be shifted back on the premises, instead of constructing a commercial complex over the land. The Fine Art College was established in 1926. 
 
 According to IMC, proposed plan for land includes developing of a ‘Cultural Center’ which will have an art gallery, school building, playground, an open theatre and auditorium. 
 
 “The present condition of the entire complex is quite dilapidated and structure needs refitting. Also, we do not plan to change the purpose for which the land has been demarcated as new complex will have a school building too with a large play ground,” Anoop Goyal executive engineer (planning) said. 
 
 Previously the cultural community had gathered to register their protest against the acquisition of land in the   premises near Regal Square for the expansion of high court.
