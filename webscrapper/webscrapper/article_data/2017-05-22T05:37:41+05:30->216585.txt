HYDERABAD:  , one of the most   in the country, has been chosen by the BJP for its first serious thrust into Telangana as it seeks to emerge as the   to the ruling  

 Coming in handy for the Telangana BJP to put the TRS on the mat is the fact that 48 of the 59 mandals of the old Nalgonda district suffer from acute fluorosis. Also, farming along the Musi in the district is impacted by the severe pollution carried by the river from Hyderabad. 
 
 “The district is an example of how three years after formation of Telangana, nothing has been done to address these two major problems. Nalgonda, in that way, is symptomatic of the ineffective governance by the TRS,” state BJP president K Laxman said on Sunday. 
 
 During his visit to the state from May 22 to 24, BJP national president   will be briefed about the woes of the people in the district. The visit is a prelude to the BJP preparing a roadmap for Telangana’s development. “What the BJP promises is a democratic socialist government. Right now, democracy is missing in Telangana and only some sections of the society are reaping the benefits under the TRS rule,” Laxman told the media.
 
 The BJP, he said, sees a future in Telangana and other states where it wants to improve its presence and wants the states to send more of its party members to Parliament. Asked about the Congress’ plan to host Rahul Gandhi soon in the state, Laxman said the more the Congress brings leaders like Rahul and Sonia Gandhi, the better it will be for the BJP.
