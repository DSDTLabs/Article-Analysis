AHMEDABAD: Pandit Jasraj — the most commanding   — tuned his surmandal (the Indian harp) to Darbari in the green room, on Sunday. When rasikas received Panditji like a guru who guarantees redemption, the plush Darbari was abandoned and he began re-tuning the harp to  . The raga sounds like a confession of a devotee confident of obtaining forgiveness. And Panditji proved that the most affecting music is beauty enamelled with bhakti. “Guruji senses notes in the air,” said Ankita Joshi, Panditji’s disciple. Ankita herself sang with such rapture that one feels Panditji has sensed genius in her.

  “Mata Kalika”, the Raga Adana tour de force presented on Sunday, is a plaintive incantation. Audiences expect Panditji to sing it because he always manages to place the rendition on the intersection of his perfect art and his desire to rise higher. The verse is the work of Panditji’s guru,   of the Sanand royalty.
