RANCHI: Jharkhand police have detained eight persons, including four students, in connection with the CBSE Class X mathematics paper leak. While six persons from Chatra district were detained on Thursday night, two were brought from Patna by road on Friday for questioning, police said, adding that inter-state links to the leak were suspected. 

 Those detained include co-owners of Chatra-based coaching institute Study Vision, Pankaj Singh and Satish Pandey. Police swung into action after Dawesh  , principal of   (JNV) in Chatra, a centre for CBSE board examinations, filed an FIR.
 
 Narayan told TOI: "Students of DAV Chatra and   had their centre for their Class X board examinations on March 28 at JNV. The invigilators found chits with exact solutions of the questions in the paper. This raised our doubts." 
 
  He added that the suspicion was confirmed after an examinee was caught trying to check messages on his mobile phone which was kept in his bag outside the exam hall. "It turned out that the student's WhatsApp gallery had pictures of both the question paper and the answers to them," Narayan said. 
 
 Chatra SP   said Narayan filed the FIR under Section 420 of IPC (forgery) and 66B of the IT Act (dishonestly receiving stolen computer resource).
