AHMEDABAD: With just a few days left for schools to reopen, a crucial notification issued by the   in December 2016 regarding boards put up outside gates of private and self-financed schools run by trusts, to properly inform parents and students, seems to have been ignored with impunity by most institutions.

 
 
 The circular mandated that this information board mention the name of the school trust and its address, the registered name of the school, the trust registration number, the standards offered and the language of instruction.
 
 The information was to be put up on a 4ft by 3ft board outside the school gate. The notification was issued on December 29, 2016 and was to be implemented by January 4, 2017. A recent   application filed by Kalupur resident Pankaj Bhatt with the education department has revealed that most schools within the city and across the state are yet to follow the notification.
 
 “The purpose of putting up such a board was to inform parents of the school affiliations, which was different for different sections in certain schools. One and half years ago, the education department had unearthed a scam,” said Bhatt.
 
 The notification was issued after the education department, between December 9 and December 24, 2016, caught over 100 schools across the state faking CBSE affiliation. Ten were based in Rajkot, with the expose leading to police arrests, and six in Ahmedabad.
 
 State board schools in Bharuch and Dahod were also caught misrepresenting their affiliations. Sources said that these schools were affiliated with the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) but taught in accordance with CBSE guidelines. 
 
 Of the total 802 schools in the state which were put under the scanner, 314 have bona fide CBSE affiliation, 17 schools are associated with ICSE board, six schools have been approved by   IGCSE and two are affiliated with IB.
