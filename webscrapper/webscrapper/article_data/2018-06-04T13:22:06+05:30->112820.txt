HYDERABAD: Muslims should realise that neither the Owaisi led-Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) nor the K Chandrasekhar Rao-led TRS can defeat the   led-BJP govt at the Centre, only   has the potential to defeat   and thus Muslims should vote for Congress, said Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president N Uttam Kumar Reddy. He called upon the party leaders and cadre to work with the aim of "defeating the  " in 2019 polls in   and elsewhere in the state. 

 
 "Go to the people particularly Muslims and tell them that MIM has a tacit understanding with the BJP and is contesting elections in various parts of the country to help BJP win the elections by dividing the secular vote. Both the MIM and BJP are communal parties and it is time to bring back Congress to power at the Centre and in the state for safety and security of Muslims and other sections of people," Uttam said while addressing a large gathering at Gandhi Bhavan here on the occasion of former MP Anjan Kumar Yadav assuming charge as the president of Greater Hyderabad Congress Committee on Sunday.
 
 "CM KCR is doing chamchagiri of Prime Minister Modi. KCR has tarnished the image of Hyderabad. Today telangana is a revenue surplus state because of revenues from Hyderabad, the credit for which should go to the successive Congress governments," he said. 
 
 The   chief also appealed to the people from Andhra and Rayalaseema who have settled down in Greater Hyderabad to vote for Congress which will give them a fair deal in 2019 elections. "I am sure the people from Andhra and Rayalaseema who have made Hyderabad their home have not forgotten the threats, insult and humiliation inflicted on them by KCR and TRS leaders during Telangana agitation. I appeal to them to support Congress in 2019 polls as the party had provided safety and security to them for decades in undivided Andhra Pradesh," he said.
