CHENNAI: Starting Friday, outsiders will not be allowed entry to the   unless they pay a monthly fee of Rs 350 and submit identity proof. However, no one is aware of how this money will be accounted.

 This is because the   ( ), which is more than three decades old, has not been registered under the   or   till date. Unlike other associations, SRSA’s letterhead has no registration number. Sources said that there has been no external audit of its accounts, meaning standard accounting procedures are not followed strictly. 
 
 This issue has been regularly discussed at the annual meetings of the   (RSPB) which has directed affiliated units like SRSA to register itself. This has also been listed as an agenda item in the meeting of presidents and secretaries of zonal railway sports associations with RSPB in New Delhi on June 5. A few SRSA officials confirmed to TOI of the non-registration of the association. But they declined to come on record because they were not aware if they were still office-bearers of SRSA. The association is in a state of flux after the general manager ordered transfer of officials.
 
 A Janakiraman of   (DREU) said that SRSA was collecting Rs 500 per application from prospective employees before trials. “There has been no recruitment for four years. So where has this money gone? No receipt is given by SRSA. Grants from Railway Board are being spent on accommodation for railway officers during events. There is no accountability,” Janakiraman said. 
 
 Opposing the levy of Rs 350 and the lack of transparency, DREU has planned to file RTI applications everyday to unearth details, he added.
