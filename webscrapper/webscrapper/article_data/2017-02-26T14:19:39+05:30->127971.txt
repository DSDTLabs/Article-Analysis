 might have done a few stunt sequences in his earlier films, but the toughest one so far, he admits, has been the ones he is doing in  . 'I haven't explored action in a big way in my earlier films. But in this, I got to do three major fight sequences. Also, I got to work with fight master  , who has done stunts for mass heroes. The ones we will be doing in this film are quite risky yet realistic. We shot one in the   terrace parking lot, with over 40 fighters. I had rehearsed for the scenes much in advance as they can't be performed in one take. The kicks required a lot of practise and there were stunts that I had to perform with ropes. We were particular about rehearsals as I wanted to do them without a dupe. I am happy with the way the scenes have turned out,' says Santhanam. The film is almost complete. 'We will be wrapping up the talkie portions by February and will head abroad for song sequences,' Santhanam adds. The film also has Vivekh and actress   in the lead.
