NAGPUR: “Today, India is facing corruption at its worst. If we want to eliminate it, we should induce patriotism in citizens,” said Sarjerao Galpat who portrayed himself as Subhas Chandra Bose at a lecture session on Tuesday. The lecture was organized by Jyeshtha Nagarik Mandal (South) on ‘Mi Subhash Chandra Bose Boltoy’ at Samaj Bhavan, Sneh Nagar. 

 Galpat, who had attired himself as Bose and spoke in first person, traced the life and struggle of the great revolutionary for freeing India from the clutches of the British rule. The journey of Bose, from his childhood to death, was presented. “Since my childhood, I used to read stories and draw portraits of freedom fighters which initiated patriotism in my heart,” said Galpat.
 
 “Bose was punished for working against the interests of Britishers,” he said. Bose was an active member of the Congress party and was elected national president too. His appointment ceremony was one of the best, he added. But the views of Mahatma Gandhi and Bose over achieving freedom differed. Therefore, Bose left the Congress and started gathering people to raise an army against the British. In his endeavour, he travelled to Japan, Germany and many other countries to seek military and financial help for Indian independence. 
 
 When Bose visited Germany, he met Hitler. During their discussion, even the dictator praised the fierce patriotism of Bose and promised him help for his war against the British in India, Galpat added. Many wars were fought by Azad Hind Fauj in eastern India. Bose coined slogans like ‘Tum mujhe khoon do main tumhe azadi dunga’ that created a wave of patriotism all over India. As the armed struggle was picking up, the Indian hero died in a plane crash. “However, we can still make India of his dreams,” said Galpat. 
 
 Madhukar Waghmare, Arun Radke and Ravi Karmarkar were present at the programme.
