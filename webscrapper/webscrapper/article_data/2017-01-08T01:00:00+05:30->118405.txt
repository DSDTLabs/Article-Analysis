 Rishabh was playing another tournament in Mumbai when he heard the good news. "I’m feeling very proud right now. I’m enjoying the moment. Maine perform kiya tha past mein, toh thodi expectations toh thi ki selection ho jayega."
 
 Rishabh, who’s currently pursuing his BA from  , says, "I should have been in my second year now, but meri back ho gayi thi.
