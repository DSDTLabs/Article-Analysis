CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and   high court on Wednesday issued a notice to the Haryana government on a plea seeking directions to book Dera Sacha Sauda chief   and his family members in a case of attempt to help him escape from police custody after his conviction in rape cases in August last year.

 The dera head has also been asked to file his reply on the issue. Petitioner in the case argued that it was not possible that he was not party to the conspiracy to escape and to have illegal weapons inside his vehicle. A full bench headed by Justice Surya Kant issued the notice after taking cognizance of a plea filed by Sukhvinder Singh, a resident of Patiala district, and others. Counsel for the petitioners,  , argued that dera chief was not named as an accused in the case even though weapons were seized from his jammer car. 
 
 Joshi alleged that the dera chief and his family members had jointly provoked followers and miscreants for creating terror after his conviction in the rape cases. The matter came up for hearing before the HC on Wednesday during the hearing of the on-going petition related to dera violence. During the hearing of the case, Haryana ADGP P  , who is heading the special team probing the cases related to dera violence, informed the HC that the state police had approached the CBI for retrieving the data from the hard discs seized from the dera headquarters in Sirsa. He also informed the court that 240 cases were registered in Haryana with regard to the August 25, 2017, violence.
 
 The HC, however, expressed displeasure over the failure of the state police to arrest Dr  , one of the chief architects of the violence.
