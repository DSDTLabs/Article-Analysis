As his second directorial, Rangbirangi, produced by SK Talkies, hits theatres today, director   is cool as a cucumber. There are no nerves that his film, which stars a bunch of newcomers, is in competition with a big-ticket release this week. “Rangbirangi belongs to a different genre and will have its own set of audience,” says the filmmaker. Mallikarjun, whose debut film   was appreciated, is hoping that the freshness of Rangbirangi’s subject will appeal to audiences.“There have been thousands of onscreen love stories, but my attempt with   is to portray a fresh, new concept with twists in the narrative that will have people guessing about the outcome. It is a complete family entertainer. Manikanth Kadri’s music and background score have elevated the film and even though the film stars newcomers — Srijith KN, Panchakshri Panchi (Panchu), Charan Subbaiah,   Chinga and Tanvi Rao — their performances come across as those from seasoned actors,” says the director.
