JAIPUR: The builders in the state will face   if they fail to deliver   projects on time as per the Rajasthan   (Regulation and Development) Rules, 2017, notified by the state government on Monday. 

 The   and housing (UDH) department notified the rules of the much-anticipated Centre Real Estate Act, which came into force on Monday.
 
 These rules have become effective after the department published the same in the official gazette.
 
 Apart from all the future housing projects, the 'ongoing' ones will also come under the purview of the rules. The state government has decided to consider all projects which are yet to get completion certificates as 'ongoing' projects.
 
 Providing relief for home buyers hit by delayed projects, the new rules have made it mandatory for builders to compensate buyers for late deliveries.
