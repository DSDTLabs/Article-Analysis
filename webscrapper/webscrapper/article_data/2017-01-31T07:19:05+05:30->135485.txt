KOCHI: After taking efforts to replace   with paper and cloth bags, now   plans to make carry bags out of saris.

 The district unit has already started giving training to   (CDS) members from each panchayat in Ernakulam.
 
 The trained CDS members will further give training to in terested neighbour group members in making carry bags.
 
 The project is implemented with the support of St Tere sa's College and district panchayat.
 
 The trained people will collect saris from residents and will return the carry bags to them. One should pay Rs 18 as stitching charge for each sari to Kudumbashree worker who collects it. The new bags can be folded into small ball size or purse type after using it.
 
 “Around four carry bags can be made from a sari. While ball size carry bas can contain things weighing upto 5kg, purse type can be made in any size. I have already given training to two members from each CDS in 85 panchayats in Ernakulam. Since many people won't use bags made of used saris, one can buy new sari and give to Kudumbashree workers,“ said Thasneem Azad, a trainer.
 
 Kudumbashree and St Teresa's College is implementing the project in rural areas and in the city limits, respectively.
 
 The college has already started distributing carry bags made out of sari and other cloth materials.
 
 “Kudumbashree workers have been stitching carry bags out of cloths collected from nearby tailoring shops in Convent Junction. Students in our college are using those bags.The new carry bags will be placed for sale in Cochin Shipyard and a private supermarket within 10 days. Besides, I have approached Kochi corporation to implement the project in the city limit," said Nirmala Padmanabhan, head of economics department in the college.
