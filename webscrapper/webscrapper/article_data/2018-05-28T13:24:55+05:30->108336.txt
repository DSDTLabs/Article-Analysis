Whoever said actresses cannot be friends, needs to know about the bond shared by Surbhi Chandna and  .

 
 Fans were in for a pleasant surprise when both Surbhi and Shivangi did a live chat the other day (27th May, 2018) and interacted with their fans. The two of them were shooting for a special sequence.
 
 While interacting with the fans, Surbhi was asked about Shivangi and the actress simply couldn't stop praising her.
 
 "We haven't met a lot of times but have hit it off so well. I feel Shivangi is like my little sister because I guide her sometimes and she very obediently listens to me. She's like a little baby actually but also very sensible at such a young age and that's commendable."
 
 Surbhi further said, "I have realised that Shivangi is an extremely hard-working girl and I am awestruck by the fact. I have seen her hard work and she's fabulous."
 
 Shivangi too said how Surbhi was extremely sweet, affectionate and sexy too. "Surbhi is extremely loving, cute and sexy, she looks even sexier without makeup," said Shivangi.
 
 Both the actresses might be rivals on the professional front but they are nothing less than soul sisters on the personal front. Both hail from a non-filmy background and had begun from scratch in the industry.
 
 While Surbhi is seen as   in the hit show  , Shivangi is loved as   in the celebrated show Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai.
