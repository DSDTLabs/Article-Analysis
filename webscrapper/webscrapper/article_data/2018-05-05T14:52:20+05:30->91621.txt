Currently seen in ‘Tuza Maza Breakup’ as Sameer,   Kamat is an ardent film lover. The young lad shared this when we caught up with the actor recently. “Whenever I return home from the  , I prefer to watch a film be it Hindi or Marathi. After a tiring day at work, films help me rewind and relieve me from my stress. In fact, even when I get three-four hours of break in the middle of the shoot, I watch only movies,” says he adding, “Recently I went to watch Ravi Jadhav’s Nude in the theatre and I was absolutely impressed. What a magic is created with such storyline! I loved the work of Naseer sir.” 

  Hailing from Goa, Sainkeet was last seen in a Marathi horror show, ‘Ratris Khel Chale’.
