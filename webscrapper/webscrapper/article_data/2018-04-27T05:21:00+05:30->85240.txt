MUMBAI: The Bombay high   on Thursday extended the stay on trial in a Pune court in the murder case of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar till July 4 on a plea by the CBI.

 In a fresh plea, the CBI sought that the stay that that had existed since May 2016 to January 2018 should be continued since the agency is continuing the probe to gather fresh evidence in the case. 
 
 Additional advocate general Anil Singh, appearing for CBI, said the agency has a right to file a supplementary chargesheet. Defence counsel Sanjeev Punalekar and V S Ichalkaranjikar, however, opposed any further stay as the rights of accused would be affected. Punalekar said, “Speedy trial is the right of an accused. The trial cannot be stayed for the asking.’’
 
 Justice Nitin Sambre observed that a division bench, which is monitoring the case is scheduled to hear the matter on June 28. The trial court was set to hear the matter next month. The trial has yet to start. Punalekar said since the trial court is hearing the matter, the CBI is seeking to delay the process
 
 The killings of rationalists Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare were “well planned” and the perpetrators had organisational back-up, the Bombay high court had said earlier while asking investigators to look beyond their current line of probe to apprehend the culprits.
 
 Dabholkar was shot dead on August 20, 2013, in Pune while he was on a morning walk. Pansare was shot at on February 16, 2015 in Kolhapur and succumbed to his injuries on February 20 that year.
