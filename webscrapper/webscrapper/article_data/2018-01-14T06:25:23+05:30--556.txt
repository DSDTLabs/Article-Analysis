HYDERABAD: The   (CID) is yet to arrest 19 of the absconding 2016   scam accused. The CID, which had gone ahead and arrested 67 accused in the Eamcet-2 question paper leakage, is also yet to file a chargesheet in the case and give an advisory to the government on avoiding such lapses in the future. 

 A top CID official told   that investigation teams are on the lookout for the 19 absconding accused and that the chargesheet will be filed only after getting the   report. 
 
 The CID issued notices to JNTU-Kukatpally and Delhi-based Gowar   and Publishers in November through questionnaires and is now analysing their responses. 
 
 "We are comparing the answers of both   and the printing press and working out the discrepancies. We won't name any of the JNTU officials as accused. If there are any procedural lapses, we will write to the government on the same. We are also working on recommendations as advisory to the departments concerned to avoid paper leakages in the future. One of the lapses is giving the task of question paper printing to the same Delhi-based press consecutively for five years," said a CID official.
 
 The EAMCET medical entrance exam was held on July 9, 2016 and after leakage, CID booked a criminal case on July 25, 2016. "We have arrested several key accused, including the prime accused Shiv Bahadur   alias SB Singh and his assistant   of UP. The 19 absconding are mostly mediators between the two prime accused and parents. We have made students and parents witnesses. We are delaying filing the chargesheet as there will be little focus on nabbing those absconding after it is filed," said a CID official.
