Madurai: Around 500 cyclists participated in the Cyclothon, which was organised as part of Saksham 2017, oil and gas conservation mass awareness campaign in Madurai on Sunday.

The cyclists went from the rifle club via the shooting sports complex, Race course road, Anna Salai, Kamarajar Salai and reached Teppakulam.
 
 The major objective of this cyclothon is to propagate the importance of fuel conservation and to encourage healthy modes of transport.
