Ghaziabad: The district administration held a meeting with officials from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) over the relocation of 12 religious structures and statues along NH-24 for the Delhi-Meerut expressway (DME) project. The NHAI wants the structures to be removed as they are obstructing construction work.

 “We have a list of religious structures along NH-24 coming in the way of the DME project, and the NHAI has requested us to remove these structures,” sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Prem Ranjan Singh told TOI. “We have already removed three of them after talking to the stakeholders involved. Efforts are on to remove the rest,” Singh said.
 
 Three police outposts are also coming in the way of the project. “Three police outposts are located along NH-24 in Vijay Nagar, Khoda and Dasna. We are in the process of shifting them and the land for these posts has already been allocated,” the SDM added.
 
 NHAI officials said the DME is 8% complete. “Apart from the religious structures, a water pipeline in Vijay Nagar passing through   is also proving to be an impediment,” said RP Singh, project director, NHAI. “We are in talks with the UP Jal Nigam and the Noida Authority. NHAI will shortly sign an MoU with the departments concerned to facilitate the relocation of the water pipeline,” he said. The relocation is estimated to cost around Rs 200 crore.
 
 The entire Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut Expressway project has been divided into three parts and is expected to be completed by 2020.
