DUBAI: Age prevailed in the Dubai Duty Free tennis championships on Thursday. The early quarterfinal clashes were drawn on the lines of youth versus experience and power against poise. First Spaniard  , seeded three, outsmarted ATP’s next gen star   7-6 (4), 6-4. Crowd-favourite Malek Jaziri then followed it up with an emotionally-charged 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 win against the 19-yearold Stefanos Tsitsipas.

 
 Jaziri - who’ll play his first 500-Series semifinals against Agut on Friday - came through in a little over two-hours against the Greek, 6 ft 4’, all arms and legs and an unruly crown, in the battle of wildcards. Jaziri, who called the trainer on court a couple of times to attend to his hip, said, “It was a big fight today, was not that easy at all. I finished very late on Wednesday. I have less than 17 hours to prepare for today’s match. During the match I was up and down little bit.”
 
 Jaziri, who fought his way through the draw here, pieced and pushed his way past the top-seeded Grigor Dimitrov in his tournament opener. He struck on his first opportunity on Thursday before the Greek teen could find his footing, breaking with a forehand winner that took Tsitispas by surprise in the third game.
 
 Meanwhile, doubles wildcards, Leander Paes and American Jamie Cerretani shocked fourth-seeds South African Raven Klassen and Kiwi Michael Venus 2-6, 6-4, 10-7 to move into the semifinals. They will play Bosnia’s Damir Dzumhur and Serbia’s Filip Krajinovic.
 
 
 
 ACAPULCO: Third-seeded Austrian Dominic Thiem powered into the quarterfinals of the Mexican Open in Acapulco on Wednesday with a 6-2, 6-3 triumph over rising Canadian star Denis Shapovalov. He set up a last-eight clash with former US Open champion Juan Martin del Potro. Del Potro, the sixth seed, needed three sets to get past Spain’s   6-4, 4-6, 6-3.
