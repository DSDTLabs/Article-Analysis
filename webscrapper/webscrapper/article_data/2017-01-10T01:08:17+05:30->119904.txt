CHENNAI: Besides child rights violations, the government and society need to address the ghettoisation of youngsters who live in resettled areas on the city's peripheries, experts say. " The mass displacements are the root cause of all problems," says  , policy researcher, Information and Resource Centre for the Deprived Urban Communities. 

 "Poverty and stigmatisation has made the displaced children fall prey to anti-social elements or the police,"   said.
 
 "Children should not be taken into a station which has an intimidating environment and police wearing uniforms cannot interact with children," says member of   in Chennai, Girija Kumar Babu. 
 
 There are a lot of ways to rehabilitate juvenile criminals, which police never follow, says ex-special public prosecutor for   V Kannadasan.
