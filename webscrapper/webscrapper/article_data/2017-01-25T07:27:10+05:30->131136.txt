NEW DELHI: Every day a staggering 177 lives are snuffed out by speeding vehicles in India, clocking the highest death toll on the roads for any country in the world.

 Even as government statistics show 48% of all road crashes and 42% of all road deaths happen due to speeding, public attention is only drawn when a luxury car is involved, like the   crash which killed an Uber driver Sunday night.
 
 While India is not finding it easy to raise fines for speeding by a minimum 2.5 times, neighbouring   has gone ahead and raised penalties for speeding and six other offences a 100 fold -from Rs 250 to Rs 25,000. To enforce strict discipline, the fine has been kept steep even for offences like overtaking from the wrong side.
 
 In India, the Motor Vehicles Amendment   presently pending in   has proposed increase in penalties for speeding from the present Rs 400 to at least Rs 1,000 or up to Rs 2,000. The fines are double for drivers of medium and heavy vehicles. Repeat offences will attract higher fines and offenders' driving licences can also be impounded and suspended.
 
 Sources said most of the members of the standing committee looking into the amendments have supported stiffer penalties. “We have written to all political parties to pass the Motor Vehicles Amendment Bill during the budget session, which has deterrent provisions against speeding, overloading and other traffic offences,“ said K K Kapila of International Road Federation.
