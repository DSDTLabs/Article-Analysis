CHANDIGARH:   excise and taxation department on Monday imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh each on   for not issuing invoice on sale of liquor and selling expired beer.

 A team of   under UT additional excise and taxation commissioner Rakesh Kumar Popli conducted raid on a total of 40 vends of which five were found selling expired beer and six not issuing invoice.
 
 The excise and taxation department in the excise policy, which came into force from April 1, had made issuance of bill on sale of liquor mandatory.
 
 The department had incorporated this clause in the policy after Punjab and Haryana high court on March 8 had issued directions for making bills mandatory for sale of liquor in Punjab and Haryana. Court had issued the direction of public interest litigation (PIL) filed by city-based road-safety activist Harman Sidhu. The move was aimed at regulating the sale of liquor.
 
 Talking to TOI, Popli said they will continue to conduct surprise checks on the vends to ensure that all the laid-down norms are being followed.
 
 In Chandigarh, there are a total of 89 vends in different parts of the city and none of them is issuing bills to customers. Over the years, the excise and taxation department has failed to put a check on liquor traders selling liquor.
 
 Till now, out of total 93 units, the department has allotted total 89 vends and the total revenue fetched by the department in shape of bid amount/licence fee is Rs 309.37 crore against the total reserve price of Rs 240.09 crores, showing an increase of 27% over the reserved price.
 
 To ensure that traders abide by minimum retail sale price, the department has introduced a penalty. For first violation, a trader will be fined Rs 1 lakh and Rs 2 lakh for subsequent violations. In Chandigarh, the malpractice of traders selling liquor below the minimum retail sale price is rampant.
