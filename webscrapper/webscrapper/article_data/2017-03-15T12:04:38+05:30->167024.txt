Bhavana-Asif Ali starrer Honey Bee was a fun movie, and now, its sequel is going to be one helluva ride all again. Just as the song Nummada Kochi had gone on to receive a warm reception among netizens, the second video song titled Jillam Jillala was out recently. 

 The song looks as grand as it can be, as there is a celebratory atmosphere, and everyone including Asif Ali, Bhavana, Lal and many other are showing off their dancing skills. Adding to the pompous affair is the peppy tone of the song. 
 
 Composed by Deepak Dev, singers Afsal, Rimi Tomy and Anwar have lent their voice to the song Jillam Jillala.
