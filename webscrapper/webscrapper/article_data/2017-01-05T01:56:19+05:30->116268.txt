MUMBAI: The   (RTO) on Wednesday began conducting learner’s licence tests. Until now, those residing between   and Dahisar had to go all the way to the Andheri RTO for the tests. 

 “Now, applicants can select MH-47 ( ) while applying and they will get appointments for tests to be conducted on our premises,” said   regional transport officer  .
 
 The first batch of 70 candidates took the test around 10am. “We use a special software that ensures no candidate gets the same questions so that they do not copy or cheat,” said an official. The questions on road safety and traffic rules were provided on the computer screens in Hindi, English and Marathi, depending on the candidate’s language of choice. Wednesday’s tests went without any glitch.
 
 The Wadala RTO on Wednesday upgraded its online learner’s licence process. Now, candidates can upload documents and pay fee online.
