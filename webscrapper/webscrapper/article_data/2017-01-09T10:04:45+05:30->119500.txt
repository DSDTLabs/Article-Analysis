JAIPUR: The Pink City will become the first in the country and South Asia to monitor and operate smart city infrastructure using a single network.

 For this, the government has developed a network operating centre (NOC) at the   (JDA) headquarters. The facility will be inaugurated by chief minister   in the presence of John Chambers, executive chairman of Cisco, on Monday.
 
 The NOC will integrate all the recently developed digital infrastructure such as intelligent kiosks, wireless broadband, sensor-based dust bins, smart streetlights, parking and app, among others. “Our city will be among the most tech-savvy one in the country. All the smart projects will be integrated under the NOC. This would help JDA to manage the city with greater efficiency and effectiveness,” said a senior JDA official.
 
 After coming third in the smart city mission, Jaipur became the Cisco Lighthouse City in 2016, a first in South Asia. This status is assigned to select cities from all over the world.
 
 A day before the inaugurating the NOC, John Chambers, Cisco’s executive chairman, along with former JDC, Shikhar Agarwal, visited Albert Hall to inspect the intelligent kiosk. He also went to Prince Road and Sindhi Camp to inspect the smart streetlights and bus depot.
 
 “The chairman feels that Jaipur can take the lead as the digital hub of the country. More MoUs will be signed between Cisco and the state government on Monday,” said a senior official source.
