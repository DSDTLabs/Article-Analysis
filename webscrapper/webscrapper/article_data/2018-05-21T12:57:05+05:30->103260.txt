NASHIK: The economic offences wing of the Nashik rural police on Sunday arrested the director of an investment company from Mumbai in connection with alleged financial fraud.

 
 A resident of Mumbai, the suspect   was arrested from Lower Parel. A court has remanded him to 10 days of police custody. Police said Goenka allegedly took deposits worth Rs 4,500 crore from over 18 lakh investors under different schemes but was not giving the promised returns.
 
 The duped investors are from different parts of the state like Nashik, Mumbai and Pune and also   and Goa. Police said Goenka had started companies like Citrus Check Inns and Royal Tinker Star Club and took money from investors after promising attractive returns. Initially, he gave the promised returns to the early birds who deposited money in his financial schemes. Later, he started assuring the investors even more returns on deposits without giving them proper receipts. Many of the investors got lured to the schemes and started depositing huge amounts.
 
 In February, a Nashik investor had lodged a complaint against him in February with the   police under various sections of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors Act and also under sections of the IPC against the firm for allegedly cheating him of Rs 1.84 crore.
