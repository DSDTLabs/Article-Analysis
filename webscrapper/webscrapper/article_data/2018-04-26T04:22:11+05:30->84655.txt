JODHPUR: First he was lured with crores and then repeatedly intimidated, yet nothing could shake Poonam Chand Solanki’s firm commitment to the case of the minor girl who was raped by the  .

 
 Solanki, the counsel for the girl’s family, also remained unshakably determined despite the presence of legal stalwarts, including   and Subramanian Swamy. On Thursday, Solanki was an elated man who left the court in his 2004 model Alto car after happily sharing his feelings with a battery of TV journalists.
 
 “When we have to fight the corrupt and criminally inclined godman, we need to show ourselves sound and committed within a legal framework. I am thankful to so many seniors who inculcated the right values in me while I started practising,” Solanki said while talking to TOI after the judgment.
 
 After Solanki was roped in as lawyer, he made it a point that since the girl’s family was poor he won’t charge a penny to fight the case. “We were fighting for truth and not doing this for money. It was a different scenario where the defence had lawyers charged lakhs for each hearing,” he added.
 
 “I got innumerable threats and people even offered me in crores of rupees.
 
 But what was pleasing and gratifying was the smile and hope on the faces of the girl and her father,” he said. Proudly recounting his face off with Jethmalani, he said, “Like any lawyer, I was also excited to see him when he had come to argue the bail application in the Rajasthan HC.
 
 But I argued without fear and spoke on facts. It was a memorable moment for me.” “The smile on my 84-year-old father   ji is now worth crores,” he added.
