NEW DELHI: Across the 198 wards in the city where   has declared candidates, the party has begun intensive  . Each day, candidates are visiting homes of several hundred voters in their constituencies and discussing the issues plaguing their areas.

 The party’s third list is scheduled to be announced on Friday though it is unlikely that candidates for all remaining 74 seats will be announced at one go.
 
 Promila Gupta, who is contesting from Timarpur, sets out each morning for campaigning and is managing about 400-500 homes each day. There are four other teams meeting voters in her constituency simultaneously, managing about 2,000 homes every day. “We are handing out a pamphlet with CM Arvind Kejriwal’s message to the people of Delhi which not just highlights the works done by the AAP government but also the corruption prevalent in the municipal corporations,” said Gupta.
 
 Party sources said that the door to door campaigning, initiated by AAP in the 2013 elections, has been its most intensive method of campaigning and is extremely effective in not just introducing the candidate to the voters but also ensuring direct delivery of Kejriwal’s message to people.
 
 “Delhi has 46 lakh houses and we intend visiting each house at least once before the elections in April. The candidates are accompanying the teams formed in each ward and we hope to complete one round in the 198 wards where candidates have been announced by the end of this month,” said a senior party member.
