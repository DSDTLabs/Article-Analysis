HYDERABAD: On   on Friday, the city's   was in an absolute mess. With the sanitation workers' strike entering its second day, washrooms at the state-run facility were overflowing even as discarded material was found strewn all over the premises. 

 Nearly 250 contract workers launched the   on Thursday protesting non-payment of salaries. 
 
 "I came to visit my aunt who is admitted in the general ward. Since I was here since morning, I wanted to use the ladies washroom for visitors. But the stench was so strong even from a distance. I did not dare venture anywhere near it after that," complained Shafina Bibi.
 
 Even as security guards and ward boys helped out the 150 permanent sanitation workers -- the only ones on duty -- to   up, it was clearly not enough as the garbage piles were spotted outside all wards. 
 
 While two rounds of talks between the agitating workers, hospital authorities and the Director of Medical Education (DME) were held, the issue remained unresolved through the day. "Though authorities are citing their own problems and urging us to work, they are asking us to do so at the previous salary of 4,300. We are unwilling to do so. Our salary was hiked to 9,300, but then rolled back. It must be restored before we can get back to work. The talks have failed so far," said M Narasimha, president, Gandhi Hospital Contract Workers' Union. 
 
 Hospital authorities, reasoned that the issue was currently being heard in a court and that there was no way that they could be any increase in the salaries just yet. They said that that were trying to convince the workers to return to duty, on the promise of hiking their salary at a later stage.
