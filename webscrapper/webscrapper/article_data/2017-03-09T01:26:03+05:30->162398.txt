MUMBAI: Terming the state government’s   for rape and   victims as “insulting, shameful and inhuman”, the   on Wednesday asked the state to take a fresh look at it. A division bench headed by Chief Justice Manjula Chellur pointed to neighbouring Goa’s scheme that provides Rs 10 lakh compensation to victims and reminded the state of its credentials as a progressive and welfare state.

 The court was hearing a petition filed by a 14-year-old rape victim, seeking Rs 3 lakh as compensation. The state said it would pay only Rs 2 lakh. 
 
 The court said Rs 2 lakh for child victims was too little and asked the state to not make victims’ lives so miserable.
 
 The court noted that as per the scheme if acid attack victims suffer injuries on her face, she is given Rs 3 lakh, but if it is on any other part of the body, Rs 50,000 is granted. The judges termed the scheme as an “empty formality” and “complete non-application of mind”. If the girl is unable to use her hands or walk, will the meagre compensation be enough, asked the judges.
