KANNUR: Days after CPM’s Kerala secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan’s remarks praising China raked up a controversy, chief minister   echoed the sentiments on Saturday when he praised China as an emerging superpower and hit out at the Centre for supporting US and Israel.

 “Globally, there is an effort to isolate China and RSS wants an axis comprising US, Israel and India, which is against our earlier foreign policy that was based on anti-imperialism,” Vijayan said at a party function in Kannur.
 
 Observing that China has made strides in economic development while capitalist countries are facing deep economic crises, he said socialist countries are boldly taking up the challenges of the new age.
 
 In the backdrop of the recent tussle between CPM general secretary   and his predecessor  , Vijayan reiterated support to the latter’s line saying, “Our stand is that we have to bring together all secular forces on one platform to defeat BJP, but that should not be by making any electoral alliance or understanding with Congress.”
 
 The UDF has collapsed in the state and Kerala Congress(M) and JD(U) have already left the front, he said.
 
 “Resisting BJP is of utmost importance but that will be possible with a proper alternative force that has been formulated on the basis of clear policies. But just tying up an alliance is of no use,” he said, adding that such a platform should take up people’s issues and stick to a secular standpoint.
