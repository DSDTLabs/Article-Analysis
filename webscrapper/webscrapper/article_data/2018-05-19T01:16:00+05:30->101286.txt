Salem: A town planning supervisor and his aide were caught red-handed accepting bribe from a 53-year-old weaver, who approached him seeking approval for his plot, here on Friday.

 According to sleuths attached to the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC), they set the trap for P Chinnadurai, 48, supervisor with the local town planning authority, and his aide Sathish Kumar, 38, based on a complaint lodged by K Jeevanandham, of Kalarampatty.
 
 “Jeevanantham approached Chinnadurai to get approval for his plot as it was an unapproved one,” a DVAC sleuth said.
 
 However, Chinnadurai demanded Rs 5, 000 from Jeevanantham and settled for Rs 4,000 after negotiation.
 
 Jeevanandham, meanwhile, approached the DVAC officials, who gave him chemical coated currency notes and asked him to hand over the same to the town planning supervisor.
 
 On Friday afternoon, Jeevanandham met Chinnadurai, who directed him to give the money to Sathish Kumar.
 
 “Sathish Kumar accepted the cash from the weaver and handed it over to Chinnadurai. Subsequently, we arrested the duo,” the DVAC sleuth said.
 
 The two were produced before the judicial magistrate of Salem district court who remanded them in judicial custody. They were later lodged at the Salem Central Prison.
