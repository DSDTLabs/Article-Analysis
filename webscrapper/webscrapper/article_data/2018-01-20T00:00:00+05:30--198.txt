Best known for serials like Miley Jab Hum Tum and  , actor   was in Lucknow sometime back to promote her show  . Rati, who has always shied away from doing an epic show, seemed quite excited to be a part of one such show. "It is my first experience of an epic show. I always used to be very sceptical of doing a show like Porus. In fact, in my previous interviews I had mentioned that I will not be doing an epic show. The reason why I used to stay away from such shows is because I hate wearing heavy   and costumes. In this serial also, when it started off, I was supposed to wear kilos of jewellery and I would take forever to get ready. But the moment the maker of the show,   narrated to me me my character, I couldnâ€™t say no to it. It was too powerful a role. I fell in love with my character and my look. I have never looked so beautiful on screen," she shares.
Playing mother to Porus, we wonder if Rati feared getting slotted into the mother's role at this point in her career. "I don't mind playing a mother on screen now. However, when I was signing this show, I was in two minds on how can I play a mother to a grown up at this stage in my career but then I surrendered to the character sketch, which is quite powerful. I will play a mother in a serial only if that character is a lead. I will not play a regular mother who has nothing much to do in the show," she avers.
