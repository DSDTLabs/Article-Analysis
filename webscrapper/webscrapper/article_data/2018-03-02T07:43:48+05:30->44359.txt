 working president M K  , who celebrated his 65th birthday on Thursday, urged party functionaries and workers to reach out to households across the state and also conduct street corner meetings to highlight Dravidian ideals among the public and strengthen the DMK at the grassroots. He asked them to drum up support against the “communal”   government and to bring an end to the “ineffective rule” of the   government in TN.

 “Ushering in social reforms has been a key achievement of the Dravidian movement. Social reforms are, however, under threat now because of the present government at the Centre and an ineffective state government that is functioning as its slave. Hence, it is our utmost priority to rededicate ourselves to the cause of social reforms,” Stalin said, in a letter to partymen. “Only by reaching out to households directly we will be able to strengthen Dravidian ideals and by this strengthen support for DMK. A dominant DMK will be in a position to drive out the anti-people governments, both at the Centre and the state," he said.
 
 He also recalled his earlier request to workers to shun presents of garlands and shawls and instead offer books, when they come to greet him. “The books received in the past have been sent to district level libraries set up by the party across TN. This year, I request partymen to establish libraries and reading rooms even in panchayats. I am already itching to travel and inspect how our cadres take forward this request of mine,” Stalin said.
