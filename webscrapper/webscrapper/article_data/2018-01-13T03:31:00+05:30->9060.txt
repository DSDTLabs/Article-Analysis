Vijayawada: Teachers’ unions are protesting against the Contributory Pension System (CPS), stating that  , introduced in 2004, takes away many benefits, to which they had been entitled under the old system.

 About 120 organisations, including teachers’ unions like Federation of AP Teachers’ Organisation (FAPTO) and AP Teachers’ Federation (APTF) formed Pension Sadhana Samiti (PSS) to fight against CPS. 
 
 The unions want the state to come out of Pension Fund Regulatory Authority (PFRA). According to the bill, states are left with the option whether they would like to join the new pension system or not. Currently, there are about 1, 84,000 government employees coming under the CPS.
 
 G Hrudaya Raju, general secretary of FAPTO said that as per the new system, employees have to save 10 per cent of their salaries and the government will rope in a company to invest the amount through various funds in the share market. After retirement, the employees will get 60 per cent of the existing amount, while the rest 40 per cent will be invested again in the share market. Losses in the share market will reduce the pension, he added. After the death of an employee under the CPS, his or her family will not get any pension and the new system also excludes the provision of gratuity given to employees on retirement, according to Raju. He said that the government has issued an order recently to include gratuity in the new system, which also does not have the benefits like Dearness Allowance (DA), commutation, and GPF loan, unlike the old system. On November 3, teachers’ unions had staged protests at 175 MLA constituencies against CPS, and on November 15, they held ‘Chalo Assembly’ programme.
 
 Finance minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said he would form a committee to resolve the issue. Pension Sadhana Samithi is planning to hold protests at all district headquarters on February 10.
