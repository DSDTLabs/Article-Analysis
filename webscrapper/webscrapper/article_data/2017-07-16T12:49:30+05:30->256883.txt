NAGPUR: An alert shop owner helped Pachpaoli police arrest a woman customer who tried to make payment with a counterfeit note of Rs 2000 denomination on Friday. Women cops later recovered three more fake notes of Rs 2000 from the woman.

 An offence was registered against the woman, identified as Padma   (40), resident of Teka Naka, on the basis of complaint lodged by Bhaurao Meshram, owner of Sushant Steel Centre in Siddharth Nagar. Chavre was produced before court which remanded her to police custody for three days. 
 
 Chavre bought material worth Rs 300 from Meshram’s shop. When she handed over a note of Rs 2000 to Meshram, he found it to be fake. “He engaged the woman in discussion and informed police,” said cops and added all the four recovered notes had the same serial number and did not have watermark.
 
 Zone III DCP   told TOI, “The forged notes are easy to identify though they are of the same size and colour as the original. They can be identified due to their plastic type texture.” 
 
 Chavre told cops that she stays with her second husband, a truck driver, in a temple. Chavre, who appeared like a beggar, also said that she had taken the money from the shirt of her husband. Cops said Chavre’s husband is in Bhopal to deliver a consignment.
 
    said the cops would interrogate Chavre’s husband to find out from where he brought the forged currency.
