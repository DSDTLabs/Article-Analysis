LUCKNOW: The humiliating defeat of BSP cast its shadow on the 83rd birth anniversary of party founder   scheduled on Wednesday. Instead of resorting to a show of strength with a rally or a public meeting on the day, BSP chief Mayawati will restrict the programme to a quiet visit to the Kanshi Ram Smarak along with some zonal coordinators of the party. She will meet party functionaries, including the 19 elected MLAs, at the party office later in the day.

 Sources said the decision not to organise a rally or public meeting on   was because of the low morale of party workers, especially since after demonetization, BSP had told candidates to bear the cost of bringing in supporters to Mayawati’s rallies. “The candidates are in no position to visit the constituencies and bring in party supporters,” a senior party functionary told TOI on the condition of anonymity.
 
 “The party will have to devise a more suitable strategy to resurrect itself,” said another senior BSP leader. 
 
 Political experts said a diminished BSP strength in UP assembly, despite vote share of over 22%, was bound to create apprehension in the mind of its core Dalit vote bank. “Dalit and Most Backward Caste (MBC) have deserted BSP in significant numbers to vote for BJP,” said political analyst J P Shukla.
 
 Last year, Mayawati held a rally in Nawanshahr, Punjab, 50km from Kanshi Ram’s birthplace Pirthipur Bunga village in Ropar district, while the state unit organised a public meeting here, attended by supporters from districts in and around Lucknow. Mayawati later addressed a rally in Lucknow on Kanshi Ram’s death anniversary on October 9.
