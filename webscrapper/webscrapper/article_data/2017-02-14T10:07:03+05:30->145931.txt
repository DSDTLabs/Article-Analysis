AMRITSAR: Eyeing the ensuing municipal corporation of Delhi (MCD) elections scheduled to be held in April,   (AAP) despite not contesting the   (DSGMC) election, has made some of its members camp in Delhi to support Panthic Sewa Dal, led by its convener Avtar Singh Kalka, which is contesting 42 seats for the gurdwara body polls. Kalka is AAP's MLA from Kalkaji.

 Core committee member of Panthic Talmel Sangathan, a conglomerate of various Sikh re ligious and missionary bodies, Jaswinder Singh Advocate told TOI on Monday that he was in Delhi to support candidates with “clean and Panthic“ image. Jaswinder, who is also president of   and former   member, had in the recent past joined AAP .
 
 Sources, however, informed TOI that majority of AAP's Sikh faces from Punjab were also helping candidates fielded by Congress-backed Paramjit Singh Sarna's SAD (Delhi). Seeking anonymity , they further said that AAP was contemplating their active role and support during the MCD polls. “We had sent some of our prominent Sikh faces from Punjab to Delhi immediately after assembly polls in Punjab,“ they maintained.
 
 However, AAP's national organization building incharge   said AAP was not in the race for DSGMC elections. When asked about Kalka, he said, “Let me inquire.“
 
 Meanwhile, Kalka didn't pick the phone despite repeated calls.
 
 On the other hand, SADbacked DSGMC president Manjit Singh GK said, “The double face of AAP has been exposed. Its leaders are interfering in the religious affairs of Sikhs by proxy.“
