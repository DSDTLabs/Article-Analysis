AMRITSAR: The   — supreme temporal seat of Sikhs — and the   Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) don’t have any objection to Haryanvi men turning Sikhs to get jobs in the Army despite registration of FIRs against them. However,   Gurdwara Management Committee (DSMGC) has some reservations on the issue.

 Talking to TOI on Friday, Akal Takht jathedar Giani   said, “If becoming a Sikh got the Haryanvi men a source of income, then they should be thankful to Waheguru. And it becomes their moral responsibility to adopt the Sikh way of life by heart.”
 
 SGPC president Kirpal Singh Badungar said Sikhism didn’t believe in forcible conversions, but those who willingly embrace the religion were welcome in its fold.
 
 TOI has reported registration of 51 FIRs against Haryanvi youths in the past two years for trying to get into Army’s Sikh regiment posing as Sikhs. A few of them had also taken ‘amrit’.
 
 When asked whether it was right to pose as Sikhs to get jobs in the Army, Gurbachan Singh replied the young men could still learn the tenets of Sikhi, Gurbani, Sikh way of life and maryada. “If they can recite Waheguru Waheguru, no one can stop them from embracing Sikhism,” he said. About registration of FIRs, he said those couldn’t be proved in court of law as they could say they adopted Sikhism and were gradually learning tenets of the religion.
 
 On the other hand, DSGMC president Manjit Singh GK is of view that it was unethical to pose as Sikhs for getting jobs. “How can anyone be a Sikh if he doesn’t know anything about the Sikh gurus, principals, teachings, way of life and code of conduct. It is not acceptable if one comes into Sikh fold only to make money,” he said.
 
 Justifying the registration of FIRs against such persons, GK said no one could be allowed to use Sikh religion as a medium to get a particular job when the person neither knew anything about Sikhism nor had faith in it.
