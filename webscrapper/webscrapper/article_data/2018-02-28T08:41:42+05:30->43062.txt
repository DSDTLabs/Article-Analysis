NEW DELHI: In a departure from the usual for state-run television channel  , a 24-minute feature on ideologue and political thinker   was aired on Monday, with a repeat telecast on Tuesday. What makes the programme unique is that it is perhaps the first time that a “right-wing” icon and proponent of “Hindutva” was featured on RSTV.

 The feature came on   TV’s ‘flagship’ programme, ‘Vishesh’. The programme has been a staple of RSTV for several years now, and is a current affairs programme. It has also done features on “personalities”, like the one on Mahatma Gandhi that was aired on January 29. Others who have previously been featured on ‘Vishesh’ include Jawaharlal Nehru, Bhagat Singh, Sardar Patel.
 
 It’s the first time however, that writer and nationalist Veer Savarkar has been featured on the state channel. “The idea was to take a look at the core values and philosophy of Veer Savarkar, about whom there are many misconceptions. It is not a political statement on the individual but a holistic look at his philosophy. For instance, the programme focussed on his strong objection to cow worship, caste discrimination, superstitions as well as the Partition,” an official said. The programme also highlighted Savarkar’sbook, “The Indian War of Independence”, an account of the 1857 mutiny which Savarkar had called the first war for independence by India.
 
 Rajya Sabha TV is managed by a team under the chairmanship of Vice-President. The current chairman is Venkaiah Naidu. The idea for the feature was discussed a week before, and agreed upon unanimously, said the official. “The programme got a positive response,” he added.
