INDORE: The   has prepared a list of   structures erected on railways property to remove them by its own. It has also asked the railways to make adequate arrangements related with movement of trains during the removal drive. 

 The Indore bench of high court had earlier allowed IMC to remove hoardings installed by railways on its land near Shastri Bridge and  . More than 100 hoardings were erected earlier by advertisers on permission of the railways. Though, the advertisements were removed by the advertisers after the railways ended their contracts in September, 2017, the base structures of the hoarding are still there. 
 
 The railways had also made it clear of not renewing or issuing any new contracts. Following this, all small size hoardings and their base structures were removed, but big ones are still there. 
 
 Railways officials said that the structures were to be removed with help of private agency, owing to which it was delayed. Now, IMC has decided to remove the structures by its own since they are affecting the cleanest image of the city. 
 
 Civic body officials said that after the court’s permission they had written to the railways to remove its hoardings. “We have written to railway officials for coordination as it will be risky for us to dismantle big size hoarding, especially which are located near railway tracks and overhead supply lines,” said IMC deputy commissioner  .
 
 He said that they are going to form a joint team of railways and IMC employees for removal of the hoarding structures. “Since we are not aware of their supply lines and tracks, we have asked them coordinate with us particularly for stopping train movement and power block during the removals work,” he added.
