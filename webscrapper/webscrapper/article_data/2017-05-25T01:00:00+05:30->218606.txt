Dev D actor the dimpled   will be making his debut in Tamil soon. The actor has been roped in for a cameo in Rathindran Prasad’s fantasy adventure   (IVSK), which has   and   in the lead. This will be Abhay’s first regional language film, informs the director, who has been in communication with the Raanjhanaa actor for the past four to five years.

 “We were supposed to work together on a British film. He was supposed to star alongside British wrestler and stunt choreographer Greg Burridge, who appears in IVSK. When he came to know of Greg doing this film, he jokingly texted me asking, ‘So, where am I in your film?’” recalls Rathindran.
 
 Interestingly, the film had a strong character that needed a cameo by a star. “We were looking to cast some well-known Tamil actor for this role, but I wanted this cameo to feel fresh. So, I went to Mumbai and pitched it to Abhay. He was not sure initially and so, he watched the film and became convinced,” he reveals. Abhay will be shooting his scenes from May 29 in Hyderabad and will be speaking his lines (in Tamil) himself as the film is being shot using sync sound. “Abhay wanted to speak his lines and not get them dubbed. He is, in fact, currently getting trained in Tamil in Manali, where he is currently staying,” informs Rathindran.
