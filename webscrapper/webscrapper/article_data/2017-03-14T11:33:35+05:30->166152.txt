PANAJI: The Goa government is scheduled to meet Goa Governor   at 1:30pm on Tuesday at her residence to discuss the Congress's claim to form the state government.

 The BJP, which won 13 seats in the recently concluded state assembly elections, has already staked it's claim to form the government with the support of MGP and Goa Forward Party. 
 
 The Supreme Court is hearing a writ petition filed by the Congress seeking a stay on today's swearing-in ceremony.
 
 Earlier, Rajya Sabha MP Shantaram Naik said former defence minister   had murdered democracy and the provisions of the constitution by playing a treacherous game to position himself as Chief Minister of Goa despite the mandate being against the BJP.
 
 The Congress argues that as the single largest party, the Congress should have been invited to form the government.
