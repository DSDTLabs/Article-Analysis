When it comes to couple goals like mixing work and pleasure,   and   seem to be hitting the right notes. They recently spent a cosy holiday in  . Richa joined Ali, who was in the land of romance for a script mentoring workshop. After their brief vacation, she returned to Mumbai for professional commitments, while Ali stayed back to rub shoulders with international film names like director Stephen Frears ('Victoria & Abdul'), Guillermo Arriaga, writer of 'Babel' and Academy Award-winning actor  . 

 A friend close to Ali revealed, “He is participating in a workshop held in the Swiss Alps where he and other established filmmakers and artistes will speak to aspiring film writers. As a part of the workshop, writers from across the globe come to pitch and get their scripts mentored. A few significant international films are also screened at the programme.” Looks like Ali and Richa have struck a balance between their profession and passion. The two also made heads turn earlier this year, during the pre-Oscars bash in Los Angeles.
