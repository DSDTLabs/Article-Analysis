LUCKNOW: Offspinner   flattened India Blue as   coasted home by 163 runs to lift the Duleep Trophy on Thursday. Varying his pace and length, he created a web around the Blue batsmen to add six wickets to his tally of five in the first innings. 

 It was a memorable outing for the   offspinner who used his height to good effect to spin out the Blues for 229 after the Reds managed 208 in their second outing to provide the opposition a target of 393 runs. His match figures of 11 for 181 made it the best by a debutant, bettering the previous record of 10 for 111runs by Pandurang Salgaonkar way back in 1972-73. He was named the Man of the Match. 
 
 Once Washington snared the important wickets of   and Manoj Tiwary in consecutive overs it was just a matter of time before the Reds could taste the glee of success. Both Raina and Tiwary were trapped in front of the wicket.
 
 Apart from Washington, left-armer Vijay Gohil claimed three wickets to take his tally to eight in the match. Considering the turn in the wicket, Red skipper   only used his slow bowlers in the fourth innings of the match with medium-pacers Basil Thampi, Siddharth Kaul and Ashok Dinda doing duty in the outfield. Karthik praised the effort of Washington and hailed him as an emerging allrounder of Indian cricket. “The way he batted and bowled speaks volumes about his talent.”
