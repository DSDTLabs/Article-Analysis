NOIDA: The food and drug department has sealed a Patanjali mega store running without a   in  .

 Two samples of coconut oil and an energy bar being sold at the store have also been seized for testing and will be sent to the Rajkiya Khadya Evam Aushadhi Vishleshak Progshala in Lucknow.
 
 The progshala is a state-level laboratory for sample testing. Sources said reports of such samples usually took months to be prepared. “The store was running without a licence. A case will be filed against the store owner and it will be pursued in the court of the chief judicial magistrate. A fine of Rs 1 lakh can be imposed on the store owner and he is liable for a punishment of up to one year,” said Sanjay Sharma, the designated officer of   food safety and drug administration (FSDA) department.
 
 Sources said the store had been running in the main market of Sector 110 for the past two months. 
 
 The officials said they would probe how it got a Patanjali franchise without getting a licence from the food and drug department.
 
 According to Sharma, the manufacturer could face action if the samples collected from the store were found contaminated. “If the samples fail the test and are found to be below standard, both the manufacturer and the store owner are liable for action,” he said.
 
 Store supervisor Pankaj Kumar told TOI: “We had applied for a licence on Saturday itself. We have submitted the required amount too.”
