CHENNAI: Keeping an eye on route rationalisation and revenue and service optimisation, the   department is all set to introduce smart cards in a few months with the aim to offer commuters a common facility — a one-stop solution for payment to transport corporations,   and retail services. The open-loop smart cards will help commuters to opt for cashless payments just by tapping on the electronic ticketing machines. The department has brought on board National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), an umbrella organisation for operating retail payments and settlements, an initiative of RBI and Indian Banks’ Association.

  A team of senior officials from  ,   and Pallavan Transport Consultancy Services, visited Ahmedabad BRTS,   and Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation last week to study the aspects of   functionalities and technologies to suit the needs of state transport undertakings. 
 
 The need to go digital also comes in the backdrop of the recent fare hike amid protests from the opposition, and transport corporations incurring loss of Rs 4 crore a day. 
 
 The department held discussions in the past few days with NPCI for assistance, besides Chennai Metro Rail Limited to roll out the programme. The smart card based ticketing limits payments for transportation services and cannot be used at terminals outside the transit network. Transport secretary PWC Davidar said the state preferred open loop since it could be used for transit and non-transit payments too. “In that case, we feel all banks come on board because it is ultimately a simple payment solution,” the official said. 
 
 NPCI is expected to send another team of experts in business and technology shortly to assist the state on rolling out common mobility cards. For instance, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation implements common city payment system to pay different services such as buses, BRTS, toll fee, parking, recreational services, municipal payments and retail.
