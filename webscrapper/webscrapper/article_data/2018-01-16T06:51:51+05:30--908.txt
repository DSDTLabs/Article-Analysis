KOLKATA:   (JU) students on Monday started a sit-in demonstration outside  , demanding withdrawal of a government notification issued on June 7, even as an executive council meeting continued inside. Till 10pm, vice chancellor  , including other authorities were stuck inside the campus. 

 The students also demanded an immediate date to hold the students union election. Among other demands made by the students were to keep the Union and not replace it by the students' council.
 
 In the notification, the higher education department had amended the rules regulating the constitution, functions and procedure of election, and tried to set up an apolitical students' union in the state-run institutes.
 
 The agitating students claimed the state was deliberately attempting to stifle the voices of dissent on the campus and claimed that even the university teachers have opposed the government's diktat.
 
 "We will not change our decision to replace the students' union with students' council. Students should immediately lift the gherao," said education minister Partha Chatterjee.
