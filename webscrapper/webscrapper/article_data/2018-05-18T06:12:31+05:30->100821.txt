CHENNAI: A 55-year-old woman died and her husband and two daughters suffered injuries when a sunshade collapsed on the family sitting in the balcony of their Mogappair home on Thursday. 

 An eight-year-old granddaughter who was sitting on the victim's lap, escaped unhurt. The deceased was identified as Lakshmi. Her daughters Tamilselvi, Suganya and her husband   are undergoing treatment at Kilpauk Medical College Hospital.
 
 Lakshmi was trapped in the debris along with the baby, while the daughters and her husband escaped with minor injuries.
