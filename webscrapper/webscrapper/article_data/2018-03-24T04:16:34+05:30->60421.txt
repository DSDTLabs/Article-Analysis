NEW DELHI:   is set to move a no-confidence motion against the   government when the House resumes next week, in what would be another opposition bid to convey the impression that the “strong government” is losing its clout. Over the last couple of days, the lead opposition party came under pressure from “likeminded parties” that it move the motion against the Centre after the ones brought by Andhra outfits—Telugu Desam Party and YSR Congress. 

 
 According to sources, Congress chief   was faced with a strong demand for no-confidence motion when he entered the Lok Sabha on Friday. While he did not respond immediately, he is learnt to have held discussions with Congress’s leadership in Parliament before giving his nod. Sources said Congress leader in Lok Sabha Mallikarjuna Kharge would move the notice on Tuesday. Either the opposition parties will unitedly back the Congress notice or move separate motions. 
 
 While the numbers game is firmly in favour of the ruling BJP combine, the rivals want to ride the negative headlines against the saffron camp to stress that the political cycle is turning after the prolonged post-2014 slump for the opposition. 
 
 The objective, according to them, is to mount pressure on BJP over blockade of Parliament during the budget session. The opposition alleges that the government has orchestrated protests by allies   and TRS to deflect pressure on holding a discussion on PNB scam of Nirav Modi on its watch.
 
 Political observers believe it is rare favourable timing for the opposition to force the issue. While questions are being raised about “dip” in economy and lack of jobs, BJP’s defeat in   and Phulpur LS seats, vacated by its UP CM Yogi Adityanath and his deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya, is being read as a sign of dipping saffron fortunes. Besides, the recent Congress plenary with strong attack by Rahul on PM Modi and BJP has also raised the spirits in the otherwise demoralised opposition camp.
