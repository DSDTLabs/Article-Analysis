CHANDIGARH: The police have registered an FIR against unidentified persons for allegedly stealing 33 answer sheets of maths of Class X CBSE board exams from Government Model Senior Secondary School, Sector 19. On May 10, police had registered a DDR (daily diary report) in the case.

 Satish Kumar, DSP (east), said the FIR was registered on the complaint of school principal Sanjay Walia under Section 380 (theft) of the IPC.
 
 The answer sheets were found missing from the school recently.
