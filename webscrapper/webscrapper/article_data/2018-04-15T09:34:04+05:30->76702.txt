HYDERABAD: Students and teachers at the   (UoH) sat on a day-long relay hunger strike on Saturday against  's ( ) recent notification declaring fresh reservation roster for faculty recruitments, considering the department as a unit instead of the university/college. 

 The hunger strike was staged at the university's main gate and drew participation from members of the   of UoH and other student bodies. The protesters demanded that the UGC notification dated March 5 be rolled back. 
 
 As per the former policy, a university was considered as a single unit for calculating faculty posts under reserved categories. For instance, while filling up teaching posts, vacancies across departments were clubbed together to decide the reservation quota. With the new policy, each department in a varsity will be treated separately to calculate the reserved positions.
 
 "The new roster system may adversely affect the recruitment of teachers under the reserved category, especially in departments where there are fewer vacancies. We demand that the university, and not a department, be considered as a unit to ensure that reserved category candidates are equally represented in higher educational institutions," said  , research scholar from the Hindi department, who was one among the many students who participated in Saturday's strike. 
 
 The relay hunger strike comes a week after students and members of teaching and non-teaching staff held a rally on campus condemning the UGC notification. "The proposed system defeats the purpose of reservation in faculty positions by reducing the chances of SC/ST candidates," read a statement issued by the   of teaching, non-teaching and students of SC/ST/OBC at UoH. 
 
 As per the ministry of human resource development figures, there are 16,600 sanctioned posts for teachers in central universities in India. Of these, 5,928 posts are vacant.
