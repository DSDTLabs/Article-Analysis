LUCKNOW: Day after TOI highlighted  's failure to nail students involved in clashes leading to indiscipline on campus, university administration expelled three students on Wednesday. The expulsion took place following a drama where members of proctorial board first sealed a room in   (AND) hostel and later opened it under pressure mounted by students. Protesting hostellers also kept the administration away from Mehmoodabad hostel, where seven more rooms were supposed to be sealed.

 Students who were expelled include BCom-II students Rashtra Gaurav and   of Mehmoodabad hostel. Anoop Kumar Singh of BA III of room number 15 of AND hostel was also expelled.Singh's room was sealed in the morning and was opened later, on the directions of vice-chancellor S P Singh. “For the first time in LU, a room was sealed in the morning and opened in the evening just because students staged protest. In the past, either a room was not sealed and if it had been sealed, it was not opened in such a short time," said a source.
 
 Singh was expelled for assaulting the mess owner on February 4, while Gaurav and Yadav were expelled for creating ruckus after consuming alcohol and bringing outsiders in the hostel on February 1 night.The duo is also accused of breaking the door of room number 22, allotted to Gaurav. The action against Gaurav and Yadav, said a proctorial board member was on complaint lodged by the hostel provost. “All students expelled will be served a notice on Thursday and will have to vacate the hostel by Sunday," said LU spokesperson N K Pandey.
 
 Pandey said once a student is expelled, heshe will not be allowed to take admission in any of its affiliated colleges. University is in the process of releasing a list of such students. “The university has identified credentials of   (accused in assaulting a boy on February 4) and is writing to the concerned to cancel his admission," said Pandey.
