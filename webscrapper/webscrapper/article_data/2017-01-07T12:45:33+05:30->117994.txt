NEW DELHI: The   has asked Cabinet secretary Pradeep Kumar   to spell out the government's stand on the Opposition parties' demand that presentation of   2017-18 be 
  . The EC missive to Sinha seeks the government's reply latest by January 10, according to sources in EC.

 A senior EC official told TOI that this is the normal course of action that the poll body takes on any petition challenging a government decision or move on the ground that it violates or may violate the model code of conduct.
 
 The model code of conduct is currently in force across the five assembly poll-bound states of UP, Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand and Manipur.
 
 
 
  
 
 Sinha, as part of the government's reply to EC, is expected to detail the reasons why Union Budget presentation was brought forward this year. The government maintains that it had informally shared with the Commission its plans to advance the budget, much before it announced the polls on January 4.
 
 The EC will decide the opposition's plea seeking deferring of Budget presentation after carefully examining the arguments put forward by the opposition parties and the government.
 
 Though Union Budget is a national financial policy document, the opposition had earlier this week approached EC seeking postponement of Budget presentation scheduled for February 1, just three days before first phase of polling. The opposition parties' argument is that the announcement of any populist sops in the Budget may disturb the level-playing field in the poll-bound states by giving BJP, the ruling party at the Centre, an unfair advantage.
