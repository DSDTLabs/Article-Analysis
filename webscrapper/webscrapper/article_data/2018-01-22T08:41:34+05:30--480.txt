The forest guards and rangers have also been given a detailed brochure for the process, which also includes pictorial representations of the pugmarks and feces of some of the most common wild animals such as barking deer, tiger, leopard, jackal, bear etc.
 
 “At present the collection only has feces of animals such as blue bull, barking deer (bhediki), jackal and black buck, apart from pugmarks of the tiger who had escaped from Dewas forests last month and pugmarks of leopard,” Ranger Khurshid Khan informed.
 
 Not only those collected by the forest department officials, but pugmarks or feces by other organizations can also be sent to the centre for addition in the collection. The center will be inaugurated in the months following the tiger census. It is currently used to train newly recruited forests guards and staff.
