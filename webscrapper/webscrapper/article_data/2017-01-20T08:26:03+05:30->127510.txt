NEW DELHI: It was the second time in a year that the three-year-old was witness to a family tragedy. Her father died in front of her eyes after a motor accident last year, and on Wednesday, she saw her aunt being being stabbed by two men, one of them her stalker. 

 The victim, who is in hospital, teaches in the same school that the three-year-old studies in. Laid low by typhoid, the woman hadn’t been going to work and was at home on Wednesday afternoon, when Amit and his cousin entered the house and started attacking her. 
 
 The eyewitness, who was playing in a corner of the room, told TOI that she had instantly recognised Amit, who was a regular visitor to their house. “One man held mausi by the waist and covered her mouth, while the other continuously stabbed her,” said the tot. “She tried to free herself from the man’s clutches. I wanted to go towards her, but mausi looked at me, as if asking for help, so I ran outside and screamed that Amit bhaiya was attacking mausi.” 
 
 The girl said the two men wielded big knives. “I had never seen those knives at home,” she added, confirming the police information that the duo had come armed with knives purchased from the market in Najafgarh.
 
 The girl’s mother said her daughter had never forgotten the sight of her father dying in front of her eyes. “She often asks me why her father died and why we weren’t able to do anything to save him,” she said. “Today, I feel proud that she saved her aunt’s life by being alert.” 
 
 The victim’s father said that she had asked Amit not to come to the house, but the stalker managed to convince her brother that he meant no harm to the family.
