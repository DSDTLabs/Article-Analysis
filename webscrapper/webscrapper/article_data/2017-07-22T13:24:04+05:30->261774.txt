AGARTALA: On a day   (TMC) chief   called for a ' ' movement at a mega rally in Kolkata, the saffron party got a huge fillip in Tripura. All six TMC MLAs in the northeastern state on Friday said they would join BJP very soon. 

 At a prolonged meeting here, the legislators - all of who voted for NDA nominee Ram Nath Kovind in the July 17 Presidential election - said they would make the big switch with more than a lakh of their supporters in tow. The MLAs - Sudip Roy Barman, Diba Chandra Hrangkhawl, Asish Saha, Biswabandhu Sen, Pranjit Singha Roy and Dillip Sarkar - are yet to be officially expelled from TMC. However, the party's general secretary Partha Chatterjee said TMC would have no ties with the legislators.
 
 Roy Barman, a senior MLA, said they had held preliminary talks with BJP leaders around two weeks ago and had consequently decided to vote for Kovind. "In the next couple of days, we shall meet Amit Shah in New Delhi to formally join BJP," he said on Friday.
 
 The six MLAs had joined TMC from   last year after the Grand Old Party decided to tie up with CPM in the West Bengal assembly election. "We left Congress because it joined hands with CPM. Unfortunately, in the Presidential polls, we saw Mamata Banerjee doing the same with both Congress and CPM. So we walked out," Roy Barman said.
 
 Almost all members of TMC's district committee, state committee, and booth committee were present in Friday's meeting and everyone, Roy Barman said, was keen to join BJP. "The saffron party is the only power in Tripura that can unseat the Left. Being an opposition MLA for the past 20 years, I appeal to all my friends in the opposition to come together before the assembly election," he added.
 
 Once all six TMC MLAs join BJP, the saffron party's strength in the 60-member Tripura assembly will go up from zero to six. The CPM has 51 MLAs and the Congress has three.
