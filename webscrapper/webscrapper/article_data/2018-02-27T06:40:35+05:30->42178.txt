MUMBAI: The   on Monday frowned upon the  , asking how it has been registering new transport vehicles on the basis of manufacturers’ certificate and without testing the prototype for fitness.

 “It is a serious issue. You are harming the interests of several people,” said a bench of Justice Abhay   and Justice  . It also told the State “accept you are wrong and correct it”.
 
 
 
  
 The bench is reviewing the state’s compliance with directions issued in its February 2016 verdict on a PIL by   on irregularities in regional transport offices where fitness certificate are issued/renewed without mandatory tests. At a previous hearing, Karve said new transport vehicles, including buses, are not tested for fitness and are registered only on the basis on manufacturers’ certificates. In view of manufacturers’ certificate, the state’s advocate said it is not necessary to conduct fitness tests on new vehicles. “Before delivery, fitness tests are conducted by manufacturer,’’ he said. The judges said the state’s stand was “so brazen”.
 
 The judges said fitness certificates are required for vehicle registration. They pointed out that vehicles will be treated as unregistered if the fitness certificates are not issued in accordance with the Central Motor Vehicle Rules by the prescribed authority. The bench also questioned if the vehicle manufacturer is the inspecting authority under the Rules. “An insurance company will take the defence that the vehicle is deemed to be unregistered,” said Justice Oka.
 
 In their order, the judges said, “It appears that the stand taken by the state is contrary” to the November 2016 final verdict and earlier orders. “It appears that even if registration is done in this fashion without fitness certification, the vehicle shall not be deemed to be validly registered,’’ it added.
