Salem: A 42-year-old Salem Municipal Corporation (SMC) employee committed suicide by hanging in his office at Swarnapuri here on Wednesday early morning, allegedly over a family dispute.

 The deceased was identified as K Velumani, 42, of Johnsonpet Colony area near Hasthampatty. He was part of SMC’s malaria protection wing.
 
 On Tuesday morning, Velumani as usual reported for duty at the Swarnapuri office. He stayed back in the office after working hours and his subordinates assumed that he had some work to finish.
 
 When his colleagues came to the office on Wednesday morning, they found that the main door was locked from inside. When there was no response from inside after repeated knocks at the door, they peeped through the window and found Velumani hanging from the ceiling.
 
 They immediately alerted their higher officials, who rushed the spot with the Alagapuram police. The police broke open the door and retrieved the body from the ceiling and sent it to Salem Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College hospital for post-mortem.
 
 Preliminary investigations revealed that there was a family dispute between Velumani and his wife for the past one week. “He might have taken the extreme step because of the family problem,” the police said.
