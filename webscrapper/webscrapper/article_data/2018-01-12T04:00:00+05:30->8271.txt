Rajkot: A young married couple was kidnapped near Nanavati Chowk on 150 feet Ring Road on Thursday evening.  Dhaval Vaghela and his wife Urvashi were forcibly taken away by five to seven persons who came in a Maruti Eeco car when the couple was passing from there. The area witnesses heavy traffic throughout the day.  Sources said that Urvashi’s father has been admitted to a private hospital near Nanavati Chowk.  The couple had possibly come to see him. When they were passing Shantiniketan Park, located right behind the hospital, some persons came in a car and stopped it in front of the bike. They thrashed Dhaval first and then pushed both of them into the car and fled towards Rameshwar Park. Dhaval’s father has, however, accused Urvashi’s father alleging that he had plotted the kidnapping as he was not happy with their marriage. He has lodged a complaint with the Gandhigram-2 police station. Dhaval and Urvashi were married about 18 months ago against the wishes of her father, police said.  Urvashi is a native of Porbandar while Dhaval lives in Bajrangwadi area of Rajkot. Gandhigram-2 police inspector G B Bambhania said, “Preliminary investigation suggests that Urvashi’s father was against her marriage with Dhaval as he was from a different caste.” Dhaval works with a private firm in Rajkot.  The city crime branch has also joined the investigation. Nanavati Chowk is a posh area of Rajkot city. Police have taken statements of some eyewitnesses who said that the couple was kidnapped at around 4pm. Police are also checking CCTV footages of the area and nearby areas to get clues about the kidnappers.
