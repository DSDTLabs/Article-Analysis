NEW DELHI: After Ram Jethmalani returned the brief amid acrimony last year, another senior lawyer defending chief minister Arvind   in the defamation suit filed by Union finance minister   quit on Thursday citing "embarassment" in court due to "inadequate briefing". 

  In a letter sent to Kejriwal's filing counsel, senior lawyer Anoop George Chaudhari said he won't be appearing any further in the case being heard by Delhi high court. "This is to inform you that I shall no longer be able to appear for defendant No. 1   and am withdrawing from the case due to inadequate briefing which resulted in an embarrassing situation before Justice Endlaw on February 12," states Chaudhari's letter to briefing counsel  .
