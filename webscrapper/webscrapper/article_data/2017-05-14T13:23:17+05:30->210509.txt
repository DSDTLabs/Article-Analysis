 Indrajith, who will play the lead in Jiyen’s upcoming film, confirms the news. “Yes, we are working on another project. We wanted to begin work on the film this year but Murali will need some time to script Lucifer. The plan is to start shooting our film in 2018, once Lucifer is done.”
  
 On its plot, the actor says, “It’s got an interesting storyline and genre, but it’s too early to talk about it. The film will be extensively shot in Trivandrum.” The trio had earlier also worked together in Kaanchi.
  
 Meanwhile, Indrajith is also one of the leads in Karthick Naren’s upcoming Tamil-Telugu bilingual titled Naragasooran, which also has Arvind Swami.
  
 In Malayalam, Indrajith’s next project will be the film titled Mohanlal, directed by Sajid Yahiya. He plays the husband of Manju Warrier’s character, who is a die-hard Mohanlal fan.
