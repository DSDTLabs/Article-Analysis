NEW DELHI: In an attempt to keep a record of out-of-school children and track those who drop out of school and move to other locations, the Centre is looking at ensuring   IDs for all such children.
 
  The recommendation to use the 12-digit unique biometric ID to track children’s education came from a   ( ) sub-committee at a meeting held on Monday, ET has learnt.
  
  CABE is the apex advisory body on education in the country. All state education departments and union ministries of women & child development, social justice & empowerment and minority affairs are a part of it.
  
  The Central government has so far only focused on linking Aadhaar to mid-day meals served in schools to check pilferage and increase the scheme’s efficacy.
  
  While Arunachal Pradesh,   and Manipur have reported nearly 2,00,000 ghost students in the   scheme, some other states such as West Bengal are lagging behind in linking Aadhaar to the scheme.
  
  The CABE sub-committee has now recommended extending Aadhaar to mapping children not attending schoolsor dropping out early on.
  
  The CABE recommendations, made to all states, says the exercise has to done at the district level and information about the age and education of the children should be linked with their Aadhaar.
  
  While state education department will be responsible for getting Aadhaar IDs for children in government schools, district collectors will have to ensure that children not in school are allotted Aadhaar too. This will have to be done in collaboration with panchayats and local administrative units.
  
  Other recommendations made by the CABE sub-committee include introducing pre-primary education in all government schools and giving incentives to parents from marginalised communities as being done in Haryana.
