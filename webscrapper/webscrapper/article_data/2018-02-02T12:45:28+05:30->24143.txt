Starring   and   in lead roles, Venky Kudumula's ' ' released amidst high expectations today. The promotional material for the film, which charts the story of a village that plays host to enmity between the Telugu and Tamil populace residing on either side a fence, was received well. When Hari (Naga Shaurya) is forced to move to a village called Tiruppuram due to his aggressive nature, he falls in love with Karthika (Rashmika). 

 
 The first half of the film features   as Kesava, head of the Telugu clan and Mime Gopi as  , head of the Tamil clan. Naga Shaurya plays a character who loves getting into fights for the sake of it and Naresh plays his frustrated father who keeps getting effected due to it. Rashmika is the geeky, bubbly girl who also has an aggressive side to her. 
 
 
 So far 'Chalo' has been an enjoyable and humorous ride with the director making good use of both the love track and the enmity to take the story forward. However, the best part of the film so far is its refusal to take itself too seriously. Just when things seem like they're getting serious, a one-liner or two pop up to lighten things up. The interval bang is spot on and it remains to be seen if the second half will live up to the expectations.
