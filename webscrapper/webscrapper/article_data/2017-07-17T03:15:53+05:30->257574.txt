GHAZIABAD: Two workers died after falling unconscious inside a 10-feet-deep tank of a   in   on Sunday. The workers were trying to clean an effluent treatment plant when they inhaled   and fell unconscious, sources said.

 The incident took place in Arya Nagar, Loni Industrial Estate, at around 6pm. The men have been identified as Arvind (30) and Bijender (48).
 
 The workers at the unit said Arvind had entered the tank with the help of a ladder and was filling the bucket lowered by Bijender with dirty water. Bijender was emptying the pails of water outside the tank. The two fell unconscious and were taken out from the tank by another labourer Shivam (18) who entered the tank after covering his face with a stole.
 
 Shivam said, “They had almost cleaned the tank and only an ankle-deep watery sludge was left. Arvind suddenly fell unconscious and Bijender descended inside to check on him. They must have inhaled toxic gas. We first pulled out Bijender and then Arvind. I too felt extremely nauseating breathing the air inside the tank.”
 
 Another worker, Zakir (30), who was involved in the rescue operation also felt nauseous and was rushed to the GTB Hospital in Delhi along with Arvind, Bijender and Shivam. The four men were taken to the hospital in a vehicle belonging to the factory owner, Ramesh Chand, a resident of Bhajanpura in Delhi.
 
 While Zakir and Shivam were discharged after treatment, Arvind and Bijender were declared brought dead.“I was not there in the factory during the incident and rushed there on getting the information. The unit has a valid consent from the pollution control board,” Ramesh Chand told TOI.
 
 “A detailed inquiry will be conducted to find out if all safety norms were being followed,” Loni Border SHO Tarun Kumar told TOI.
