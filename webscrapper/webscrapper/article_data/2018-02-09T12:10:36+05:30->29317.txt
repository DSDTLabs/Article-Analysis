Reality TV star   says she was really scared about having her stretch marks removed after she gave birth to her first daughter   as she feared the procedure would be painful.

 "After breastfeeding North, I wasn't happy with the stretch marks on my b**bs, so I had the area Coolbeam lasered... It made such a difference. The Coolbeam lasers are the best for removing scars, stretch marks and skin imperfections. They treat stretch marks by resurfacing the top layer of skin, which increases collagen regeneration," Kim wrote on her official app, reports an entertainment website.
 
  
 "The best part is that there's very little pain and downtime! I was really scared that it would hurt, but it wasn't bad at all. Afterward, I was so excited to see the effects on my skin," she added.
 
 Kim is now a mother of three. She welcomed her third baby via a surrogate last month.
