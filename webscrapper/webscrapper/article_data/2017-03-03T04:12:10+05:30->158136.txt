GANDHINAGAR: Former chief minister of Gujarat   has denied that she has been asked to take charge as the governor of Tamil Nadu.

 Talking to the TOI, she said, “All such messages on the social media about my appointment as Tamil Nadu governor are baseless. Earlier also such messages as my appointment as   were on the social media. I have not been informed by the government of India or the party about any such proposal.”
