BHOPAL: The magnificent structures of   now have a stinky, smoke-spewing neighbour - an illegally built crematorium that virtually shares a wall with the heritage compound.

 Orchha is one of the big tourist attractions in MP with its 16th Century Chhatris and fort and picturesque location on the banks of the Betwa. Of all the types of heritage encroachment sadly seen in India, this one would be the most bizarre - a crematorium built by the Tikamgarh Nagar Palika. The crematorium is cheek by jowl with the heritage complex - certainly less than the 100m no-construction zone.
 
 Conservationists are seeing red, wondering why the administration didn't bother about what the smoke would do to the 600-year-old structures, let alone how tourists would react to see a crematorium next to the exquisite Chhatris. "The crematorium has been built along the walls of the protected structure. It will a disaster for the monuments and tourism activity," said Sanjay Rathore, a businessman at Orchha. P 4
