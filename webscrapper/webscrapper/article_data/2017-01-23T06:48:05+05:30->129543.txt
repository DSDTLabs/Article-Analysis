JAIPUR: Congress leader   called for teaching Indian epics ‘Mahabharat’ and ‘Ramayan’ in schools for making the younger generation more aware of the past.

 Speaking at the session, ‘Remembering the Raj,’ at   on Sunday, he said Indian texts should be made part of the education system. “Shakespeare is being taught in schools and colleges in India, but there has not been enough emphasis on teaching Kalidasa,” he said.
 
 Tharoor also took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and alleged that he was only paying ‘lip-service’ to Mahatma Gandhi.
 
 Arguing for the inclusion of Indian epics in educational curriculum, he said they should be taught like Greek epics ‘Iliad’ and ‘Odyssey’.
 
 “These issues should not be reduced to sectarian politics under secularism,” he said, while emphasizing that he was not in favour of injecting any political ideology into education.
 
 Taking potshots at Modi, he said the ruling party's intellectuals have a “deep rooted hatred” for the Father of the Nation. “But they are now hailing him as a hero!”
 
 “BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj, who called for making a statue of Nathuram Godse, is an example. This was said even as the government tries to co-opt Gandhi as a symbol in most spheres of political and social life,” said Thraoor.
 
 On the Raj, writer-turned-politician said that when the British came here, India was the richest country. But in 200 years of their rule, the country was reduced to one of the poorest. On the legacy of British rules, he said they were framed not to benefit the natives but to serve British interests.
 
 On the current relations with UK, he said both the countries were both equal and sovereign with matching economies. However, on a cautionary note he said that if it was important not to forget what the country went through, it was equally important to forgive.
