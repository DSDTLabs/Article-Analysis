CHANDIGARH: If an Abohar girl dumped her groom-to-be at the mandap over dowry earlier this week, another from Karnal further upped the ante against the practice and dragged her in-laws from the   for demanding a four-wheeler from her family. Her 24-year-old groom from   ended up spending the night in police custody on Thursday. 

 Punjab Singh had come to take his bride from Bassi village in Karnal district on Thursday when he surprised her family by demanding a car immediately after the rituals were solemnised. Although taken aback, her family offered him a cheque of Rs 4 lakh, saying it was not possible for them to arrange the car for him right away. But Punjab took it as a personal affront and tore up the cheque before flinging it at the bride’s brother. 
 
 Upset over that, the bride walked out of the wedding pandal and called up police. “Soon after receiving the call, a police party rushed to the spot. Punjab Singh was taken into custody. He has been booked in a case of harassment for dowry and is in custody for one day. We are examining the role of his mother, sister and brother-in-law,” said inspector Jitender Singh, the investigating officer in the case.
