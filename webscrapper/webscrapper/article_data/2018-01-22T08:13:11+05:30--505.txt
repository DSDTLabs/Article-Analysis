PUNE: The   ( ) has launched an internal inquiry into the allegation of molestation levelled by three Army Public School ( ) girls against a non-commissioned officer ( ).

 In a complaint, the girls said the non-commissioned officer had touched them inappropriately while leading them to the Habibullah hall during the screening of a movie on the NDA campus on December 24. The girls were part of a group from the school on a guided tour of the academy. 
 
 An NDA officer told TOI, “The academy has launched an internal inquiry to investigate the matter in detail. A lieutenant colonel rank officer, along with a lady officer, is heading the inquiry panel.”
 
 He said, “The statements of the girls, parents and the principal have been recorded by the inquiry panel. Based on its findings and recommendations, further course of action will be decided by the higher-ups.”
 
 The NDA authorities insisted that the academy has zero tolerance of such acts and is in contact with the girls’ parents. An officer said, “The girls’ parents didn’t want to lodge an FIR. We have assured them of a fair inquiry.” 
 
 The academy allows educational institutions/organised groups to visit its campus on Sundays only. The aim is to motivate school children and appraise them about training given at the academy so that they get inspired to pursue career in the armed forces in the future.
