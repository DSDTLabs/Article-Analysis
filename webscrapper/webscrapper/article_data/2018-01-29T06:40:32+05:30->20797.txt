CHENNAI: Though the only study on monitoring of air quality in Chennai is two years old, it still holds good. It offers important pointers about factors that affect pollution levels like ventilation coefficient readings (the product of maximum pollution mixing depth and average wind speed) and the number of air quality monitors required in the city.

 Conducted by a team from the civil engineering department of   (IIT-M), mobile monitoring data from TNPCB was used for the study. Chennai, with a population of around 85 lakh requires 26 stations for optimum air quality monitoring, said associate professor of IIT-M S M  , who was part of the team. As TNPCB follows the US model, the recommended number of stations is 10. “But now there are only seven function in various parts of the city,” said Nagendra.
 
 The study, which was conducted from March to November in 2016, showed that it was important to track the ventilation coefficient which is inversely proportional to pollution levels. “Ventilation coefficiency depends on wind speed and height. It is a very important factor in pollution levels,” he said. For instance, in winter when the wind speed is low, the ventilation coefficiency is also less, and dispersal of dust particles is not fast. This pushes up the pollution levels. “Winter is the critical period because the pollutant dispersion is slow, which in turn results in smog and poor visibility,” he said As part of the study one of the students, R S  , mapped the ventilation coefficiency levels in various parts of the city. “It showed that the IITM campus had a lower pollution level as the ventilation co-efficiency was 680sqm/sec,” said Nagendra. In areas like   and Chetpet, the ventilation coefficiency levels were as low as 310sqm/sec, indicating very high pollution levels.
