Ludhiana: The election campaign of BJP and Congress candidates in ward number 15 turned ugly on Wednesday as supporters of both the parties attacked each other with stones. One man was injured in the clash.

 It all started when Congress accused BJP supporters of distributing blankets in the area. While BJP leaders denied the claims, police officials said blankets were recovered from the spot. However, it is yet to be ascertained as to who had brought them.
 
 ADCP-IV Rajvir Singh Bhoparai said, “A clash broke out between Congress and BJP workers. Statements of both sides are being recorded and case will be registered accordingly. Some blankets were recovered from the spot and this has been brought to the knowledge of the election observers.”
 
 Police said it all started when supporters of Congress candidate from ward number 15 Kanchan Malhotra and BJP candidate Pooja Rai entered into a spat over blanket distribution claims.
 
 Police said the supporters of parties attacked each other with stones and bricks. While several supporters were hit, police said one person was injured.
 
 “These are totally false allegations and it is a conspiracy hatched by the Congress to malign my image. We have found out that the Congress workers purchased blankets from my factory on Tuesday and hid the blankets with my posters in some homes. When I reached the area for campaigning, they started alleging that I have distributed the same. Everything was planned in advance as within five minutes, they started posting fake information on Facebook and other social networking sites,” BJP candidate Pooja Rai said.
