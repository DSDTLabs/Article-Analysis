Panaji: The state-run Kadamba Transport Corporation Limited (KTCL) on Tuesday took down posters of a contraceptive advertisement from many of its school buses that serve as Balraths.

 “Taking into consideration the request of the women’s commission and headmasters of various schools in Goa, we have taken the contraceptive advertisement off school buses on Tuesday,” said KTCL general manager Sanjay Ghate. A total of 350 KTCL buses had featured this ad, of which 20 are used as Balraths. 
 
 The corporation also started removing the advertisements from the back panel of the rest of its buses. The side panels, however, will continue displaying the advertisement, Ghate said.
 
 A delegation of women supported by Ranaragini, a right-wing women’s group of Hindu Jagruti Samiti had met with the women’s commission last week demanding the removal of these posters. The advertisement features actress Sunny Leone promoting a condom brand. Taking offence, the women’s group had stated that the picture “is an insult to women’s dignity”.
 
 KTCL authorities have questioned the logic behind removal of an advertisement which is Centre-approved and even condemned the women’s commission for not following protocol before demanding the removal. 
 
 “There has been no ban or orders to recall this ad from the high court or Supreme Court. This is not a conspiratorial advertisement. There should have been an inquiry, followed by a report submitted to the government. The women’s commission did not follow protocol, instead directly demanded the removal of the ads,” Ghate said. 
 
 Women’s commission chairperson Vidya Arjun Shet Tanavade had said, “Condoms are used by men so why should a woman be in the picture? It is not good to show women like this.”
