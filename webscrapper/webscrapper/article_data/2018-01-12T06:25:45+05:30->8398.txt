CHENNAI: Over the next two days, flying to Colombo, Kuala Lumpur or Bangkok may be cheaper than travelling to Madurai, Tuticorin or Trichy, as airfares to these cities have touched 10,000- 19,000-levels due to Pongal rush. The government's announcement to close schools and colleges on Friday and the bus strike that has crippled commuters over the last eight days seem to have spurred the demand. 

 While one-way airfare has touched the 9,000- 17,000 price band on the  , a   to Tuticorin was 19,000 for travelling on Friday and Saturday. Tickets to Trichy is hovering around 20,000-mark. There is only one seat available at 19,854 on the night flight to Trichy on Friday. The spike in fare, however, is against the Director   rules which warn airlines against unusually jacking up ticket fares. 
 
  In contrast, the one-way fare to Kuala Lumpur is 11,900 to 16,199 on Friday and 7,800- 11,000 on Saturday. On the Chennai-Colombo route, one-way fare is in the range of 7,900 to 13,000 for travel on Saturday. 
 
 The demand for seats is high on the Chennai-Madurai, Chennai-Trichy and Chennai-Tuticorin routes as large number of people have booked the tickets in advance for the Pongal festival, says a travel agent. 
 
 
 
 
 Considerable population from these regions live and work in Chennai, and the fares usually spike during Diwali and Pongal every year. An airport official said that thefareswere high because majority of the seats had been booked in advance. “The fare will go up by the minute as there are only one or two seats left in the price band of ₹9,700 to ₹10,000. This also shows high demand, inspiteof an increase in fare,” he added.
 
 He also said that international fares was not as high as the domestic fare to southern towns, because the number of people who might travel on short foreign getaways might be low during Pongal, when compared to Christmas and New Year weekends. Basheer Ahmed of Metro Travelssaidthat international air fareswere high becauseof the holiday season. “A large number of people will be travelling to meet friends and relatives,” he added.
