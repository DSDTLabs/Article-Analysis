KOLKATA: The two surviving victims of the accident in   on Sunday continued to remain critical on Monday, according to doctors at a private hospital off EM Bypass.

 Madhumita  , 52, who had suffered brain haemorrhages along with multiple fractures, underwent a surgery to remove the clots and has been put on ventilator. “She is yet to regain consciousness and the doctors have asked for 48 hours before they can make any assessment of her condition,” a relative said.
 
 On the other hand, her daughter Nabanita, 30, who has multiple fractures and head wounds, has regained consciousness, but remained dazed. “The doctors said she might need a surgery later,” said the relative.
 
 The family is still trying to come to terms with the accident which killed Nabanita’s husband Pritam, 35, and their four-year-old son   on NH-6. “The deceased were cremated late on Sunday,” another relative said, adding: “We don’t know how to broach the topic with Nabanita when she is in a state of trauma.”
 
 Pritam was the son-in-law of ward 7 councillor and the chairperson of Kolkata Municipal Corporation’s accounts committee Bapi Ghosh.
