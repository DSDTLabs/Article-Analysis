GURUGRAM: The Indian   — a voluntary humanitarian organisation —will train drivers and attendants of school buses in the district to ensure improved security for school children. The training will include sessions on first aid so that they can respond to an emergency. 

 The workshops are part of   norms which also require the bus staff to be trained in first aid and home nursing.
 
 The district administration will organise special camps where the drivers and bus attendants will be trained by Red Cross’s ambulance wing. All schools in the district have been instructed on Saturday to ensure that their bus drivers and attendants are trained within the fortnight. 
 
 Over a dozen schools have already registered for the same and those who have not been registered yet, have time till Friday to give their names to the Red Cross.
 
 Vinay Pratap Singh, deputy commissioner, Gurgaon said that the training will be organised at Red Cross’s office in Sector 15, as well as in the schools. It is mandatory for all bus drivers and attendants to be trained, including women, employed at all schools in Gurgaon.
 
 The training will include a dummy for understanding the injuries on the human body and a practical test. District training officer Anju Kashyap is conducting the workshop in the   office, while, first aid lecturers Rajkumar and Vikram will organise the dummy training at the schools. 
 
 Red Cross will submit a list of all those who will be trained to the district administration by Friday. 
 
 The officials are planning to train school teachers and other non-teaching staff in the next round. A medical examination of bus drivers and conductors will be facilitated at the camps which will help them in getting their licences faster.
