NEW DELHI: The   on Tuesday expressed   over the   of   being   in insolvency proceedings against real estate companies and slammed Interim Resolution Professional (IRP) in the case against   group for harassing flat buyers and demanding rest of the money due to the builder. 

 A bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Amitava Roy said that homebuyers’ stake could not be compromised to protect the interests of creditor banks in insolvency proceedings and charged IRP with taking side of Amrapali group and neglecting the grievances of flat-buyers.
 
 As the investment made by homebuyers has been put at the bottom in the priority list in insolvency proceedings, they could be refunded only after banks recovered their dues after selling the assets of the company, making the position of buyers vulnerable in such proceedings. The buyers are left with no option but to approach court to protect their interests.
 
 The IRP has taken over the affairs of Amrapali after National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) admitted the insolvency proceedings initiated by Bank of Baroda against the firm on September 4 last year. 
 
 With the homebuyers in Amrapali projects complaining to the bench that they are being forced to make payment of the remaining amount by IPR without giving assurance of handing over of their booked flats, the court restrained IPR from demanding from buyers.
 
 Senior advocate Gaurab Banerji, appearing for IRP, said around Rs 21 crore was needed for installing the fire safety equipment in the flats already handed over to buyers in the Silicon City project of the Amrapali group. 
 
 He said the developer has only Rs 1.5 crore in its bank account due to which it was not possible to manage the affairs.
 
 “You are worried about liquidating all assets of the company but our worry is about homebuyers,” the bench said and directed the company to install fire safety equipment within a month.
