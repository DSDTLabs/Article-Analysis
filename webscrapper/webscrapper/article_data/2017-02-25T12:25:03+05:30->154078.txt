THANE: The 2017 Thane election has revealed the clout and popularity of few candidates in their respective domains as they managed to silence their opponents with a massive margin. While few managed to win with a very high margins of 10,000 votes, there have been instances this time where a seat was saved by a very frail margin of 13 votes. 

 NCP candidate from Kalwa and Manisha Nagar, Pramila Keni has left behind her competitor by 10,742 votes shoring up nearly 67% of the volume. 
 
 “Keni has had a connect with voters in her area and is always at a calls away to help residents,” justified a local activist.
 
 Not far off, three Shiv Sena women corporators including Vijaya Lhase from panel 9C in Kalwa left her competitor Samrudhi Patil of NCP by a neat margin of 9,221 votes while another party colleague Jaishri Phatak who won from the Padwal Nagar and Kisan Nagar belt left behind her nearest rival by nearly 9,023 votes. Ekta Bhoir from the neighbouring ward also kept her rival from BJP, a sitting corporator, trailing by a massive 8,000 plus votes. 
 
 Former standing commitee chairman and Sena leader Naresh Mhaske has also had a easy win by over 7,500 votes leaving behind BJP candidate J K Khetle in the race for the 19D seat in Anand Nagar. 
 
 Meanwhile, the phrase that every   counts can explained by no one else than Sanjay Pande who has had a close shave with losing an election with a wafer thin margin. The Shiv Sena corporator from Gladys Alwares road won by a narrow margin of just 13 votes from his rival Sherbahadur singh from BJP.
