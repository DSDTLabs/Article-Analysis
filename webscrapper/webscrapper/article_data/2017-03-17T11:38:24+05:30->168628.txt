NASHIK: The Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation ( ) has decided to act tough against the use of industrial plots for commercial purposes and take stern action against people if found guilty of doing so.

 The MIDC has already served notices to eight industries in   and   industrial estates, asking them to stop commercial use of the industrial plots.
 
 Speaking to TOI, an official from the MIDC said, “We noticed some industries have been using industrial plots for commercial purposes. Actually they are not allowed to use industrial plots for commercial purpose. Hence, we have decided to take action against them.”
 
 An official added, “During a survey, we identified eight industries using industrial plots for commercial purposes. We served them notices asking them to stop commercial use of the plots.”
 
 The official said defaulters are expected to stop commercial use of the plot within 15 days after the receipt of the notices. “We will take action against them if they did not respond to notices. Out of eight industrialists, six are from Ambad industrial estate, while two are from Satpur industrial estate of the MIDC,” he said.
 
 The MIDC has three industrial estates across Nashik district. The Satpur and Ambad industrial estates are located in the jurisdiction of the Nashik Municipal Corporation ( ), while Sinnar MIDC is located around 30 km away from the city.
 
 The MIDC has already started a survey in its industrial estates to find out how many industries are operational and how many are sick. Moreover, some industries have constructed buildings and also obtained Building Completion Certificates (BCC), but they have not started operations. The authority has already conducted 30% survey in Satpur and Ambad.
 
 MG Kulkarni, president of Laghu Udyog Bharti (North Maharashtra) said, “This is a good move that the MIDC is taking against those using industrial plots for commercial purposes.”
