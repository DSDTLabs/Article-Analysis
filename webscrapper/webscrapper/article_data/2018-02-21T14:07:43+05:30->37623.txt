PATNA: Several students were injured after a group of agitating youths pelted stones on a market complex at Naya Tola under the   police station area in the city on Tuesday.

 Pirbahore police station   Ghulam Sarvar said around 30 to 40 youths tried to forcibly close the market as they were protesting against the central government for not removing technical diploma as criterion for group D jobs in railways.
 
 “It was originally a protest march taken out by the youths without any permission,” the SHO said, adding an FIR was lodged in this connection.

 “Several students from the neighbourhood also gathered in support of the students. Police reached the spot and controlled the situation,” the SHO said, adding several students were injured but no one lodged a complaint in this connection.
 
 City SP (Central) D   said no one was arrested and police were trying to identify those who indulged in vandalism.
