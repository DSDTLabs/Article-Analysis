JAIPUR: The Rajasthan High Court’s latest decision on   would affect the state government’s   (regularization camps) scheme which had begun this month.

 The state government had planned to announce the regularisation of illegal colonies and shops in residential areas during its third anniversary celebrations to be held on January 22.
 
 It was to organise special camps to regularise colonies developed on agricultural land before June 17, 1999. However, this would now become difficult for the government following the judgment passed by the high court’s Jodhpur bench on Thursday.
 
 “After examining the court’s order, we will seek directions from the government in this regard. Right now, it’s difficult to say if the camps will go ahead as planned,” said a senior official,   (JDA).
 
 With the new order, the wait of residents living in non-regularised colonies is likely to get longer. A recent survey, conducted by the JDA, revealed that around 1,200 colonies developed by housing cooperative societies in the city cannot be regularised.
 
 There are nearly 210-225 colonies that fall in the ecological zone as per the city’s Master Plan-2025. Majority of these colonies are situated on the   road. In the latest city master plan, the ecological zone was increased in comparison with the previous plan. This would now become a major hurdle for the JDA while regularizing these colonies.
 
 After the high court order it has become nearly impossible for the civic body to regularise these colonies. “If the camps are delayed, the regularisation process of all colonies may not happen. Also, the department will have to conduct a scrutiny of the colonies again,” said a JDA official.
 
 The urban development and housing (UDH) department had also proposed to regularise shops constructed illegally in residential areas as well as those situated on 40-feet wide roads. Following the court order, this is likely to be put on the backburner.
