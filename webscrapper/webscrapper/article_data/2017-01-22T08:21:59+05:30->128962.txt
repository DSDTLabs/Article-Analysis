KOLKATA: For England opener  , returning to   is both special and painful. England played the ICC World T20 final against the West Indies here on April 3 last year but lost the match narrowly to leave Roy and his mates heartbroken. The hard-hitting opener, however, is happy to be back here and wants to leave a mark at this iconic venue.

 After suffering back-to-back defeats at the hands of  's men in the three-match One-day International series, Roy is keen to end finish it on a high.
 
 “As a squad we have a lot of experience and some good wins under our belt. This series has been disappointing from England's point of view but we obviously want to finish on a high. Every game from now on will be a stepping stone for us, leading up to the Champions Trophy,” Roy told reporters.
 
 Both Pune and Cuttack ODIs have been high-scoring matches and Roy feels that England can take a lot of positives from them. “We've been undone by some incredible individual performances, yet we have put in some seriously good performances. We scored 350 in the first game and 366 in the second,” he said.
 
 “There's nothing wrong with the team. We're training very hard and having a good time. Whatever we come up against, we're pretty confident. So we'll be all right.”
 
 However, Roy feels the one aspect where the team needs to improve is fielding. “The team is in good spirit and high on confidence. But we have to work on our fielding. I think we've been below standard,” Roy said.
 
 The swashbuckling opener blames himself for not being able to convert his good starts into big hundreds.
