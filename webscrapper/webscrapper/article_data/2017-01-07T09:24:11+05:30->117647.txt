NAVI MUMBAI: Residents of Navi Mumbai, particularly  , have alleged that   are being taken away from their localities by unknown people over the past few weeks. Some activists believe the dogs are killed for their meat and alleged that an   has started in Navi Mumbai.

 Rachna Wagle, a resident of Airoli who regularly feeds strays in her locality, said she spotted two bikers trying to take a puppy from a road on Thursday night. “When I questioned them, they claimed they were picking up their lost pet. But I knew they were lying since I have been feeding that puppy for weeks. When I questioned them further they sped away,” she said.
 
 Shanmukh Vijay, another resident of Airoli, said he has heard locals talking about boys picking up dogs. “Although we don't know the reason, many presume it is for the meat. Often we don't have much to go by, so it is difficult to have police action taken,” he added.
 
 “A van comes around 5am to pick up strays, but no one has been able to trace these people,” said Kanthana Poojari, a Kamothe resident. “Most feel the dogs are being killed for meat. But we haven’ t been able to make a case due to lack of proof,” she said.
