Popular talk show host   feels singer John   should feature in " ". 

 The 39-year-old musician appeared on "The Ellen   Show" to discuss his upcoming EP but all the two could talk about was the reality dating contest, reported Billboard.
 
 Talking about how Mayer missed making plans and going out together with someone in a relationship, he said, "A man can drive to Big Sur alone, but how lonely is that?" 
 
  
 To this DeGeneres chipped, "It's lonely. You should be The Bachelor." 
 
 Intrigued by her suggestion, Mayer said, "I don't think that I would find love there unless they would change this sort of vetting process for who would be the contestants. I think it would be one of the lowest rated shows." 
 
 However, he added, he would star in a condensed version of the show, if the opportunity presented itself. 
 "Just get me the helicopters, get me the girls crying, girls crying on helicopters... If you get tears in flight on 'The Bachelor', that is prime stuff," Mayer said.
