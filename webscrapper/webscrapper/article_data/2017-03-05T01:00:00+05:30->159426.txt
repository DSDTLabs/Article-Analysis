 doesn’t regret her decisions — be it quitting her show ' ' or splitting from  , her beau of five years. 
About leaving the show, she says, “I was too excited about playing a next-door-girl as it allowed me to break away from my image in 'Qubool Hai'. However, I wasn’t happy with the way my role was shaping up. What was promised wasn’t executed and hence, the decision. My character didn’t get justice. The time leap reaffirmed my decision, as we weren’t even aware of it. I feel that the story was taken ahead by several years too soon. I had no issues with the new antagonist ( ) being roped in, as my character remained in focus. The new track was something I wasn’t in tandem with. Instead of being a piece of furniture on the show, I thought it was better to quit. I shot my last episode on February 14.”
 Additi was also in the news because of her break-up last month. It was reported that the actress moved on immediately post the split with Rizwan and started dating  , her co-actor in 'Pardes Mein Hai Mera Dil'. She says, “The reason I broke up with Rizwan is personal and I don’t want to talk about it. I don’t want people to make assumptions and judge either of us. I never confirmed I was dating him, then why should I talk about my break-up? I hang out with Arjun (her co-actor   in the same show), too. Nobody linked me with him. Is it because he is married and Laksh isn’t? I may be single, but that doesn’t mean I am available. Am I not allowed to be single?”
