IMPHAL: Following a recommendation made by the Asian Human Rights Commission ( ),   has provided two personal security guards to Thounoujam   Singh, the suspended police head constable who shocked the nation in 2016 by revealing that he had been witness to many fake encounters in the state between 2003 and 2009. 

 Two armed policemen - a head constable and a constable - will be on hand to ensure Herojit's safety, official sources said. 
 
 Herojit, in an affidavit submitted to the   earlier this month, informed that there had been an attempt on his life last year after he had confessed that he had killed a former militant, Chungkham Sanjit, in broad daylight at the behest of a senior officer in 2009. A pregnant woman,  , had also died in the incident on the crowded Bir Tikendrajit Road in the capital city. The two deaths had brought forth a widespread protest across the state against police excess.
 
 Following the affidavit, the AHRC had sent a letter to Manipur director general of police LM Khaute, saying Herojit should be provided protection in view of the crucial revelations made by him against the police apparatus in a state where AFSPA continues to be a contentious issue. 
 
 Calling Herojit a "vulnerable whistleblower," Human Rights Alert (HRA) executive director   Loitongbam appreciated the state police for their timely act. "Herojit has become vulnerable and he may face attempts on his life from many angles. We appreciate the state police for providing him personal security guards in time," Babloo told TOI on Sunday. 
 
 Currently, the apex court is handling a   (PIL) jointly filed by the Imphal-based Extra Judicial Execution Victims' Families Manipur and the HRA, seeking a probe into the alleged 1,528 extra-judicial killings in the state from 2000 to 2012 by police and security forces.
