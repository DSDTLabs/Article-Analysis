CHANDIGARH: The UT administration may be short of money but its Society for the Promotion of IT in Chandigarh ( ) is buying expensive mobile phones and gadgets.

 Assigned to implement the plans to promote the information technology industry, the society has bought   iPads, iPhones, iMac computers, and new tablets worth about Rs 14 lakh in three years, besides two luxury cars — a   and a Toyota Camry — for about Rs 40 lakh.
 
 Record secured under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, suggests that between November 19 and December 9, 2015, the society bought two Sony   mobile phones for Rs 50,500 each and an iPhone 5s for Rs 52,000. On April 21, 2016, Spic purchased 27-inch-screen Apple iMac desktop computer for about Rs 1.36 lakh, while on July 15 the same year, it blew up more than Rs 1.85 lakh on two ultra-light 13-inch Apple notebooks.
 
 Similarly, Rs 59,500 was spent on buying Apple iPhone 6s on August 23, 2016. On September 14, 2016 iPhone 6s Gold was purchased for Rs 72,500 while on September 19, 13-inch iMac was bought for Rs 1,24,100, while another iMac was bought for Rs 1,40,710 on October 18, 2016.

 When contacted, UT director information technology Arjun   said the phone and gadgets were purchased for officials, which were used only for official purposes. “The purchases were done in a transparent manner and proper records have been maintained,” said Sharma.
 
 Questioning the motive of spending such huge sum on phone and gadgets, city-based social activist  , who has also lodged a complaint against the functioning of the society, said, “Can’t the official work be done on gadgets which are equally efficient but available at much lower cost? This is wastage of public money.”
 
 The functioning of the society is currently under scanner with alleged glaring irregularities coming to fore. The UT administration is probing the matter and is working to make the functioning of the society more transparent. Excess expenditure, undue favours, wrong policies and unjustified payments running into crores were some of the irregularities pointed out in the annual audit report of the department of information technology (IT). Discrepancies pointed out in the audit were reported by TOI in November last year.

 UT hand-to-mouth
 
 For the ongoing financial year, the Union government allocated less than required budget to the UT administration, hindering development works. This fact has been acknowledged by the parliamentary standing committee on ministry of home affairs. For the 2018-19 fiscal, the city received Rs 4,511.91 crore against a demand for Rs 5,908.22 crore. The committee termed low allocation of funds to this city as a “matter of concern”, and stated that it will “adversely affect” the development activity.
