MUMBAI: The hailstorm that ravaged standing crops in   and   in February has damaged crops worth Rs 313 crore across an area of over 3 lakh hectares or 7.5 acres. An earlier estimate of losses was around Rs 200 crore, but the amount has risen after inspections were completed. 

 The state government will send a memorandum to the Centre, seeking relief worth Rs 313 crore under National Disaster Relief Fund. The proposal has been finalised and will be sent in a few days. 
 
 The state is mulling a detailed analysis of this weather phenomenon from an expert panel. Since 2014, parts of the state, especially Marathwada and Vidarbha, have been experiencing hailstorms in February and March, causing massive Rabi crop losses as crops are in full bloom this time of the year. 
 
 This year, hailstorms struck Marathwada and Vidarbha between February 11 and 14, leading to massive crop damage. Summer oranges on trees that were to hit the markets soon suffered damage besides fruits in the flowering stage. Traders said fruit prices are likely to rise.
 
 "The Indian institute of   may be approached for weather condition analysis. Warnings can be given to farmers and preventive steps taken," said a senior official.
