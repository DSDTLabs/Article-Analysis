AHMEDABAD:  , an accused in the  , during   post the   in July 2016, has alleged that some   had threatened him to keep mum about atrocities, when he was lodged in Amreli jail. Parmar is one of the accused in the murder of Pankaj Amreliya, who was injured when a protest by dalits, on July 19, turned violent in Amreli. The constable later died from the injuries. 

 A lawyer by profession, Parmar had opposed torture and humiliation of lower caste prisoners by upper caste prisoners in presence of jail staff. He made a written complaint in September resulting in an order for a judicial inquiry on October 15. The inquiry is still going on. Parmar alleged upper caste prisoners began threatening him after the inquiry began.
 
 "While being taken to court for a hearing on December 20, an upper caste prisoner, who was also with me in the prison van, threatened me in the presence of about 11 policemen," said Parmar. "I have lodged a complaint with the police and also written to the additional DGP, prisons," Parmar said.
 
 Parmar was released on bail on December 28. 
 
 "As the inquiry could land them in trouble and jail transfers, I was threatened and told to keep quiet about the atrocities," said Parmar.
 
 Parmar said that many lower caste prisoners in the jail were made to wash toilets, wash clothes of upper caste prisoners, and in some cases even made to drink water from toilets.
 
 The lawyer alleged that upper caste prisoners often beat lower caste prisoners mercilessly but jail authorities did not even get medico-legal cases registered.
 
 Jail authorities said the inquiry is in progress and they have recorded statements of several Amreli Jail inmates with regard to Parmar's allegations.
