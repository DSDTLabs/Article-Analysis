MUMBAI:   on Friday expressed displeasure over the airline’s decision to issue a general circular about   instead of first probing who took away food from the buffet table of a   to be eaten later. 

 On February 6, an AI assistant general manager (AGM) issued a circular to all crew members titled, ‘A buffet is not a take away’. A hotel in London where AI crew stay during stopovers had complained about some crew members regularly packing food from breakfast presumably to eat later. The AGM warned the offenders of serious disciplinary action. 
 
 Taking offence over the circular, AI crew members sent an email to the AGM. “Based on a mere three line email from a hotel staff, you (AGM) issued a circular hurting sentiments of majority of crew members. Have you even questioned them (the hotel) on the credibility of such email or even asked for any specific information pertaining to this matter/incident? Obviously if you had, you won't be publishing a general circular to us but would taking action against such crew members, or maybe you are aware of such ‘handful’ of crew but your department is not able take any action against them due to some constraints or limitations,” the letter said.
 
 It added: “How many times have you or your department even gone through the flights reports when we mention how crew meals were offered to passengers, how we gave our best even after being on minimum crew complement with single crew member working at two positions. How many times you or your department issued an appreciation letter to such team or even come out with a circular stating the efforts put in by us?”
