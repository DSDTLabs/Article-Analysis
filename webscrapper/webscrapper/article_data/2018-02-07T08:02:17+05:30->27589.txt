KANPUR: Raking a fresh controversy over  , two top   leaders on Tuesday blamed Hindu youths for the   and killing of a youth. While senior SP leader and   member   claimed that the victim Chandan Gupta had been killed by a Hindu, party’s Muslim face Azam Khan said jobless Hindu youths were instigating violence.

 Speaking in Ghiror, Mainpuri, on Tuesday after attending a function, Ram Gopal Yadav said, “Chandan was shot by Hindu youths, but Muslims are being accused of killing him. You all have seen the video of violence that went viral recently...Musalmano ke do sthaan, kabristaan ya phir Pakistan. Now tell me, who is going to tolerate this,” he said.
 
 “Mobs entered houses of Muslims and attacked the inmates soon after Chandan was killed by members of his own community. Arrests of Muslim youths are being made on false charges. Their property is being destroyed, set on fire,” said Yadav. “I will not hide the truth just because it may hurt people of the other community. Whether it be a Hindu or a Muslim, I won’t tolerate injustice with anyone,” he said.
 
 Speaking in Rampur on Monday, Azam said, “Government should give jobs to unemployed youths from the majority community so that they don’t have the time to roam localities with flags and instigate violence”.
