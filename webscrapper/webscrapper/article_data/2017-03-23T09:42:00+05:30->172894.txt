We offer flowers and prayers and try and spend the day here at the Bibi ka Mela,” said  , a city-based legal advisor to corporates, who visited the dargah along with her mother. After the azaan is sung around 5 pm, women move out of the inner shrine of the dargah and men can enter after that. Till then, men are not allowed to enter the premises. Many women came all the way from remote parts of Saurashtra to offer their prayers.
 
 Fatimabano Hussain, who came from Junagadh, said, “It is a different feeling and feels as if we are closer to God. I wish I could do this regularly, but as we are allowed only for a day, we make it a point to visit every year.”
