behind this show. So, I knew I had to do it.”
 Talking about 'Bepannah', he says, “It’s an intense and passionate love story, where the cosmos connects two diametrically opposite people in an inseparable bond. They go through their own individual miseries and the universe brings them together to fight, rise and heal each other. It’s a show about hope and destiny.
