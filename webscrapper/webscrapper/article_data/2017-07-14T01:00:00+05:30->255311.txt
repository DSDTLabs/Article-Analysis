 Looking for a light-hearted stage comedy, which you can laugh out loud to? Then, perhaps Suketu Shah’s latest play 'Last Over' is a show you should catch. This breezy situational comedy tells the story of a young married couple and the relationship they share with their respective fathers. Since the boy is Indian and the girl Pakistani, there are plenty of cultural references that make the plot interesting and keeps the audiences hooked. What’s more, the play is set against the backdrop of the   World Cup, so when the characters aren’t talking all things India-Pakistan, they’re discussing cricket! Both being the favourite talking points of desi audiences, there are rarely instances when you get bored during this comedy.
 
 Apart from having two powerhouse performers — Rakesh Bedi and Ananth Mahadevan — the play has to its credit, a well-written script by Abhishek Pattnaik, that has some wit-laden dialogues. Bedi, who plays the loud Punjabi father easily has the best one-liners, which he delivers to a tee. You can see how he encapsulates his acting experience of almost four decades across mediums — films, TV and stage — in this character, which is boisterous but still endearing. To give him takkar is Mahadevan, who plays the more subdued Pakistani counterpart. What he lacks in punchlines, he more than makes up for with his adaayein and style. Together, the two of them are a delight to watch. 
 Though the story has references of cricket, sports buffs will feel that it’s still low on the cricket quotient and you wish there was a lot more cricket-related trivia that made its way into the script. Luckily for 'Last Over', what makes this a fun watch are the electrifying performances by the two veterans and the dialogues.
