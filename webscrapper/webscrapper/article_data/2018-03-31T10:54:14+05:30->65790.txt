NASHIK: The recently launched free Wi-Fi service at the   railway station has come as a boon not only for commuters but also some residents of the city. 

 People crossing over from the Nashik side to the   side can get access the Wi-Fi at the two open-ended foot over-bridges (FOBs). Wi-Fi can be used for a maximum of 30 minutes on one SIM at the station, after which only websites related to railway information are accessible. 
 
 "Now, I can access the internet and use any of the three numbers for surfing and downloading data. Thirty minutes is enough for me to download a movie of small size or even songs,"  , a resident of Nashik Road, who has three mobiles. 
 
 Since platform 4 also has unrestricted entry, people also get into the station from the Sinnar-side and use the service. "We have been using the Wi-Fi at the station since Wednesday," said  . 
 
 "This is a good move and should have started earlier. Many smaller stations have got it and we are getting it now," Manisha Khot, a resident of Kalyan and regular traveller to Nashik, said. 
 
 Wi-Fi is particularly useful for a commuter waiting for a train. "While travelling, it is important to stay in touch with relatives and friends and also access information. Now, we have an assured connectivity at the Nashik road station," said Khot. 
 
 Kripal Narayan, another commuter, said the services at the station are improving but the Railways should also ensure timely schedule of trains.
