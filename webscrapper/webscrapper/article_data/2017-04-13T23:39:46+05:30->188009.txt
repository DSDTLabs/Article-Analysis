Gandhinagar: Gujarat governor O P Kohli on Thursday gave his approval to the ‘Gujarat Animal Preservation (amendment) Bill-2017' passed by the state assembly on March 31. With this, Gujarat now has the harshest law against cow slaughter in the country. Both murder and cow slaughter are now punishable by life imprisonment in Gujarat.

 Minister of state (home) Pradipsinh Jadeja said that the governor had given his consent to the bill. “The state government will begin enforcing the new law within a few days,” Jadeja said. “Procedures for framing the rules are being worked out.’’
 
 The state government had made several amendments in the Gujarat Animal Protection (Amendment) Act-2011 to come up with the new law. The key amendments include increasing the punishment for cow slaughter from 7 years in jail to imprisonment for life (or at least 7 years). The amount of fine has been raised from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. Further, the offences covered by the new law are cognizable and non-bailable.
 
 “We have made killing of a cow or its progeny equivalent to the murder of a human being,” Jadeja said, in justification of life sentence for cow slaughter.
 
 It is interesting that the draft bill submitted in the state assembly provided for a maximum 10-year jail term for cow slaughter. However, the punishment was increased to life imprisonment through a supplementary provision introduced in the house by minister of state (home) hours before the bill was tabled in the House on March 31.
 
 The act also allows police to confiscate vehicles seized for illegal ferrying of cattle. Earlier, the police had to release the vehicles six months after filing the FIR. The transport of cows at night has also been banned under the new law.
