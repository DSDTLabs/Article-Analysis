GURGAON: A 27-year-old truck driver was   on Wednesday for impersonating his brother to clear a driving license test. The accused was produced in a city court on Thursday and sent to judicial custody. 

 According to police, the accused, Jabid, reached the test drive centre near Rajiv Chowk carrying the learner’s licence of his younger brother, Jahid, along with other documents required to acquire a permanent driving licence. During verification of the documents, district inspector of police Jai Singh found that the photograph was not of Jabid. On questioning, Jabid revealed he was a truck driver and had come to take the test on behalf of his younger brother.
 
 The district inspector informed the police, who arrested Jabid from the test centre. An FIR was registered against Jabid under sections 419 (cheating by impersonation), 420 (cheating), 205 (false personation) of the IPC at the City police station. 
 
 “We found that Jahid was innocent, as Jabid hadn’t informed him about his act and had brought the documents from their house at   without his knowledge,” said ASI Rupesh Kumar.
