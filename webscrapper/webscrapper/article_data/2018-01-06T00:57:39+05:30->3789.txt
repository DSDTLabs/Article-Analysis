GURUGRAM: A 13-year-old boy was allegedly sodomised by three men after one of them kidnapped him in an auto-rickshaw from near his house in Surat Nagar. 

 The boy managed to call his father and when the family members reached the home of the main accused, all of them fled. An FIR has been registered, but no one is arrested yet.
 
 Police said Friday the boy, a student of class VII, was kidnapped by the main accused on Wednesday afternoon when he was playing on a ground outside their rented accommodation in Surat Nagar colony. The main accused is known to the boy’s family members who are from Uttarakhand, cops said.
 
 In his complaint, the boy’s father has identified the main accused as 28-year-old Dheeraj, a resident of Kherki Majra village.
 
 “Around 1.30 pm when my son was playing on the ground, Dheeraj met him and took his mobile phone on the pretext of listening to songs. He told my son that he will return the mobile phone after two hours and asked to go with him. My son flatly refused, but Dheeraj hired an auto-rickshaw and then forcibly pulled him inside. Dheeraj then took my son to his village home where he and his two friends had unnatural sex with the boy,” his father said.
 
 “My son somehow got hold of his mobile phone and called me and narrated his ordeal. When we reached the house of the accused, he and his friends fled. I want strict action against the accused,” added the father, who is a shopkeeper.
 
 Based on the complaint, an FIR has been registered against Dheeraj and his two friends under sections 365 (kidnap) and 377 (unnatural sex) of IPC and Section 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act at Rajendra Park police station.
 
 “We are investigating the case. All the accused will be arrested soon,” said ASI Balraj, the investigating officer.
