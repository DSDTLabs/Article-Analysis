PATNA: The 1,000-seat BPO centre of IT behemoth   (TCS) opening in Patna on Thursday will create 3,000 jobs in Bihar capital.
 
  Being opened under the India BPO Promotion Scheme (IBPS), the largest BPO set-up in eastern India will work 24X7 in three shifts, according to Software Technology Parks of India DG Omkar Rai.
  
  Rai said on Wednesday the BPO facility would change the IT scenario in Bihar. It will also create several managerial jobs besides opening avenues for hundreds of allied IT-related job opportunities in the state.
  
  Union minister of electronics and information technology Ravi Shankar Prasad will inaugurate the BPO centre in the presence of Bihar education and information technology minister Ashok Choudhary, local MP and Union minister Ram Kripal Yadav and TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan.
  
  Rai said Bihar has been allocated 4,600 seats under the IBPS, out of which 1,910 have been allotted to successful companies for setting up BPO and ITES (IT-enabled services) operations. These 4,600 seats have the potential of creating around 15,000 IT/ ITES jobs in the state, he said.
  
  The 1,000 seats of TCS apart, nine other companies have been allocated 910 seats for opening BPO/ ITES set-ups at Patna, Muzaffarpur and Dalsinghsarai, a sub-divisional town in Samastipur district. A 100-seat BPO will soon come up at Dalsinghsarai, Rai said.
  
  Coinciding with the launch of the TCSâ€™s BPO facility, the STPI will organise a seminar on IT/ITES entrepreneurship and start-ups in Patna on Thursday. Union Minister Prasad will address start-up entrepreneurs at the seminar.
