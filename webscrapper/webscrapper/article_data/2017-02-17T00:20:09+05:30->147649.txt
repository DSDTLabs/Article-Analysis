DTC driver Kuldeep Singh lost his eyesight in a blast in his bus at Govindpuri, leading to his biggest regret in life: "I have never seen the face of my son." Singh’s wife was eight months pregnant at the time, and when the son was born, he had permanently lost his eyesight, a part of his right hand and hearing capacity. 

 Singh, a contractual employee with the Delhi Transport Corporation, was near the Kalkaji Depot when a passenger started shouting that there was a bomb in the bus. "I remember it was 5:56pm because I had just seen the time on a giant clock moments earlier," says Singh. Realising the consequences of stopping the bus in the crowded area, Singh careened ahead trying to find a less populated place. Panicked but in control of his senses, he stopped a short distance away. "I was afraid, of course, but jumping out of the bus was not an option because the bus had eight full CNG cylinders," he says. He then opened the bag that held the device fitted with a ticking digital clock and red-blue-green wires. Singh and the bus conductor rushed the bag outside, but as he moved a few steps backwards, the bomb exploded. Singh, 45 today, has never seen or heard clearly since that moment. What pains him perhaps is that none of the passengers whose lives he saved ever came to meet him after the incident.
 
 At his home in DTC Colony in Shadipur, Singh recalls being able to initially see a bit of light out of his injured eyes. But an infection set in and cost him his sight. He, however, was given a vehicle examiner’s job at DTC and a Rs-2 lakh compensation, though he himself bore the cost of his treatment.
 
 "VVIPs like LK Advani and Sonia Gandhi came to reassure me then, but time passes and everyone forgets you," Singh sighs. His wife has to ferry him to and from his office, but he has moved on. Deepak, his son, is 12 now and in Class VI. Gratifyingly, he knows about his father’s heroic deed.
