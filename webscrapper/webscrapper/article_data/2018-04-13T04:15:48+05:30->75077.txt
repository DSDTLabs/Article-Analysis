The   bench of the Bombay high court recently directed the government to hold state wakf board elections within three months for the posts that fell vacant on April 4. 

 The court also directed the Maharashtra State Board of Wakf not to take any policy decision until the new panel's constitution.  , a member in the outgoing wakf board, had approached the HC seeking extension of their terms, which had ended on April 4. 
 
 The lawyer representing Ahmed pointed out to the court that Section 14(4) of the Wakf Act mandates that at all times the elected members shall be more than nominated members. Government pleader A B Girase opposed the continuation of these members.
