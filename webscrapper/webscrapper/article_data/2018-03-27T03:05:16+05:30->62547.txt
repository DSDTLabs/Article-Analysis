NEW DELHI: A 12-year-old boy was   by an iron   when two heavy plastic bags fell on him from a truck when he was trying to jump over the railing of a park. The incident took place in northeast Delhi’s Usmanpur on Sunday evening.

 Passersby made a PCR call around 6pm informing cops that a boy had been injured and was lying in a pool of blood. A police team rushed to the spot and took the boy to a private hospital, where he was admitted in a critical condition.

As he was doing so, a truck, carrying heavy bags, suddenly braked. The plastic bags fell on Rohit’s head and due to their weight his face hit the railing. The rod pierced through his chin and came out from his cheek.
 
 Seeing the boy bleeding, the truck occupants tried to flee but the crowd managed to catch hold of them.
