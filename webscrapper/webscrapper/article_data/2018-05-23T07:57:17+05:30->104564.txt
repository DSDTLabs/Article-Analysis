HYDERABAD: With the threat of   (NiV) looming large, Telangana has decided to set up special wards in major hospitals to deal with a possible outbreak. The deadly virus, which has a high mortality rate, can spread through contaminated toddy and fruits such as mangoes and bananas. NiV has claimed 10 lives so far in Kerala and given the high floating population between Kerala and Telangana, experts have called for a high level of surveillance. 

  
  
 
 The city-based   ( ) has been made the nodal agency to deal with NiV cases. Health minister C   reviewed the situation with senior officials and said there was no cause for concern. The state is also coordinating with the   (NIV) in Pune. 
 
 The mortality rate of NiV is as high as 70%. According to researchers, toddy contaminated with the saliva, urine and faecal droppings of the fruit bat or flying fox (Pteropus giganteus) is known to transmit the virus. Toddy obtained from the sap of palm tree (Borassus) is a popular drink in Telangana, with hundreds of outlets dotting Hyderabad and its suburbs. 
 
 Experts suggest that toddy samples should be tested at toddy outlets in the city and elsewhere for the presence of virus. Fruits particularly mangoes and bananas, on which the fruit bat feeds, should be thoroughly washed before eating. Currently, it is a mango season in Telangana.
 
 Virology expert   said that though the fruit bat is known to carry NiV, it cannot transmit it directly to human beings. While person-to-person transmission of NiV is reported, the virus can spread to human beings through contaminated food, particularly toddy.
 
 Nipah virus was first detected in India in West Bengal in 2001. It again was reported in West Bengal in 2007. The virus has now resurfaced after a gap of 111 years. Several cases of NiV transmission through contaminated toddy were reported in Bangladesh, the only country that has been constantly reporting NiV infections in the last two decades.
