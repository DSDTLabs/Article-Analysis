AHMEDABAD: In a written protest to Union external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, around 45 civil society leaders, academics and professionals have criticized the   of former Swiss diplomat, Kurt Vogele, from  , on January 22, this year.

 The letter alleged, “He was denied entry to India due to his friendship with colleagues at  , a Dalit rights   in Ahmedabad.”
 
 The letter to the minister stated that Vogele was deported despite the fact that he has a valid visa issued by the Indian consulate in Geneva. Worse, he was blacklisted and told he had “no right” to enter India, without giving any reason. The civil society members have demanded the blacklisting be revoked and have sought an explanation as to how he was ‘blacklisted’ without any prior intimation.
 
 Vogele’s passport was confiscated and returned to him only on his return to Geneva. “You can imagine the shock, apprehension and anxiety of a 75-year-old man (Vogele) at being so undeservedly isolated and stripped of his right of entry”, the letter reads.
 
 Vogele has spent 13 years in India, in the main serving as country director of   (SDC), an arm of the Swiss Foreign Ministry. During his last spell he was its country director (counsellor) in the   in Delhi from 2000 to 2005. He was instrumental providing major assistance during the devastating 2001 earthquake in Kutch.
