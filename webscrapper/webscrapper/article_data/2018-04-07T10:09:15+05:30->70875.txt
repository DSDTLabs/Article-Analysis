 Investigators said   alias Nasir Kitli, 42, a resident of Fatewadi, owned a tea stall on Fatewadi Canal Road. Nasir had an altercation with Shiva Mahalingam alias Aftab about three days ago. It is believed he had come to Nasir’s stall to settle the matter. 
 
 At about 8.15pm, Shiva and his accomplice Shakir Ali Shaikh alias Babu Patli, came to Nasir’s stall and after a heated exchange shot him him twice from close range. The bullets hit Nasir in the chest and he collapsed. The duo then fled on a motorcycle. He was taken to VS Hospital where he was declared brought dead.

 Sources said Shiva, who was convicted for the 2012 Nirma farmhouse armed robbery case, converted to Islam a while ago. He jumped parole and was hiding in the Amraiwadi area. Teams have been formed to track him down. Sources added that tea stalls in Vejalpur, Sarkhej and Fatewadi areas have become unpleasant sites and are avoided by the general public.
