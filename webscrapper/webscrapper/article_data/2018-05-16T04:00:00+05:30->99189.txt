Mumbai: The   breached the 68 level against the US   for the first time since January 2017 due to the political uncertainty following the Karnataka state elections. The domestic currency, which had closed at 67.52 on Monday, weakened to 67.75 in early trade and gained to 67.56. However, news of a fractured poll verdict led to the currency weakening to 68.11 at close.

 According to   Direct senior VP and treasury head M Hariprasad, the currency has weakened during the peak season for international travel. Also, those pursuing overseas education make their   purchases in mid-June and would end up paying more for the same amount of dollars. 
 
 While the RBI has been consistently intervening in the market by selling dollars, dealers said that the central bank did not appear to be trying to reverse the direction of the domestic currency and the intervention was more aimed at curbing volatility. The rupee has been the worst performer in Asia in 2018.
 
 Even without the elections, the rupee has been under pressure because of rising crude oil prices. As a result, the April trade deficit has widened to $13.7 billion — up from $13.3 billion in April last year. Despite a slowdown in gold imports, the nearly 42% increase in the oil import bill to $10.4 billion has pushed up the trade deficit.
 
 Given the dependence on oil imports, the weakening rupee will have an inflationary impact. According to DBS economist Radhika Rao, the lagged impact of the run-up in the global oil prices and a depreciating rupee are likely to be felt over the next three to six months. “We expect FY19 inflation to average 4.7% YoY from 3.6% in FY18, with risks of the annual average to rise to 5% if oil prices remain above $70 per barrel in the year,” she said. According to her, this paves the way for a rate hike by the RBI in August.
 
 In the equity markets, a weaker rupee is seen to be hurting overall sentiment but will provide a boost to information technology shares.
