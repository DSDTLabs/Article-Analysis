BHOPAL: A court in Shivpuri district of Madhya Pradesh has summoned   authorities in connection with a multiple   case. AIIMS Delhi had given a cheque of Rs 15000 to a farmer in Shivpuri district as refund against a cancelled surgery. However, the cheque got dishonoured. When the farmer approached AIIMS through his advocate, he was given another cheque. The second one also bounced, forcing the farmer to approach court under sections of Non Negotiable Instruments Act. 

 Rajendra Prasad Verma, a resident of Dhoria, had moved a petition against the AIIMS authorities, alleging that cheques given by the institute bounced twice. His daughter was suffering from spinal problem and was to be operated at the hospital. However, the surgery got cancelled due to some reason and the hospital was to return a deposit of Rs 15000 made in the patient account.
 
 In the first attempt, the cheque was rejected by the bank, citing a mismatch in the signature. He approached the hospital authorities once again and got another cheque issued. However, this one also got bounced. This action comes at a time when Centre is mulling changes in law to make for harsher punishment for cheque bounce cases in view of demonetisation and the drive to promote cashless transactions. Noteworthy that Central government has notified the Negotiable Instruments Amendment Act, which allows the complainant to file a complaint in the city, where he is based or where the cheque has been deposited.
