JODHPUR: Continuing his attack on the state government, former chief minister   said here on Thursday that there is   and the government, surprisingly, is not bothered about it.

 He said that there is no control of home minister Gulab Chand Kataria over the police and as a result, small issues have been emerging as a huge threat to the peace in the state.
 
 “It is a pity that the home minister is acting as a dummy and has no control over the transfer of just a constable,” said Gehlot adding that everything is under control of chief minister  .
 
 He further said that he had introduced the police commissionerate system in the state in Jaipur and Jodhpur for the improved policing and better control on the crime considering the geograpshical borders of these two districts.
 
 “But it is unfortunate that this did not come out as a successful model because of the apathy of the state government,” said Gehlot admitting that this system has failed to bring the desired results and keep a check on the crime rate as well as maintaining the law and order.
 
 Taking a dig at the state government, Gehlot said that MLAs are no being heard by the ministers, ministers are no being heard by the chief minister and the chief minister is not being heard by the Prime Minster.
 
 “Entire power centre of the state now resides with the chief minister and she is not concerned about the issues of the state,” Gehlot alleged.
 
 Gehlot also condemned the government and the police for unleashing lathicharge on the party leaders and workers in Jodhpur on Wednesday during the youth congress rally in support of the farmers.
 
 He said that the government is acting in unbridled and autocratic manner and want to eliminate him after embroiling his confidants Jugal Kabra, former MLA, who died last month, and Rajendra Singh Solanki, former JDA Chairman in two separate cases.
