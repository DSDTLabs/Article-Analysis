MUMBAI: Despite flaws in the virtual classroom and tablet-for-student projects,   continues to pump in funds for digitizati-on by allocating Rs 1.5 crore from the   budget to equip 1,200 schools with LCD projectors, android phones and intern-et connections. While Rs 21.84 cr-ore has been earmarked for virtual classrooms and giving access to educational content through smartphones, Rs 7.83 crore will be spent on providing tablets to class VIII entrants.

 BMC allotted Rs 2,311 crore for education in 2017-18 budget —an Rs 82 crore drop compared to last fiscal—with focus on the requirements of the Pragat Shaikshanik Maharashtra programme that aims to improve quality of education. All civic schools will be graded on a scale of A to D based on 25 competencies listed under the programme. 
 
 “We have planned a focused approach on how to improve school education system by emphasizing on quality, infrastructure and enhancing the supervisory role. Students will be given tutorials in school after class,” said IS Kundan, additional municipal commissioner. 
 
 While attendance allowance for girls will continue and schools will have sanitary napkin vending machines and incinerators, students with special needs and their parents will get Rs 10 each as attendance allowance. But civic schoolteachers are not impressed. “Many issues, including safety of students and quality of midday meals, require both attention and funds. BMC should solve these first,” said a civic school headmistress. tnn
