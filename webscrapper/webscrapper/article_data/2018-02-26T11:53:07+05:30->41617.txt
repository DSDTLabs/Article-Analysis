BHOPAL:   has sought details about controversy over PhD entrance test after students red-flagged a sudden change in minimum qualifying marks. 

 TOI had carried a story on February 20 this year mentioning that   (BU) had changed minimum marks to qualify entrance test for PhD and MPhil in law subject a day after result, raising students’ hackles.
 
 Sources said students expressed their anger over the issue from different platforms. Angry over this change of mind after results— raising minimum marks from 40 to 50— students also approached the court against the university after the authorities refused to address the issue.
 
 The exam was conducted in October 2017 and result was announced on February 16 this year. A candidate alleged change in minimum marks notification was announced on February 17, 2018, a day after results.
 
 Entrance exam for admission in PhD course became mandatory after the University Grants Commission (UGC) 2009 rule came into existence. The PhD degree would not be recognised in case rule is not followed. 
 
 Sources said the issue of two results of around 70 students in the physics department is under scanner. Students alleged that the entrance exam is questionable. How they prepared two results, stated a student. Students also raised other issues related to PhD entrance test.
