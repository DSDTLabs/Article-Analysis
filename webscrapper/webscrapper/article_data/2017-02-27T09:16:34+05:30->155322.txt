PUNE: Two people, including a senior citizen, succumbed to   at different hospitals in the city last week, taking the number of   casualties to four this year, so far. Besides, condition of two more patients is currently critical and they have been put on ventilator.

 Kirme developed influenza-like illness from February 18. He had cough and fever but later developed breathlessness too. Initially, he consulted a doctor at a local hospital, which in turn referred him to a hospital in Baramati for better management.
 
 Kirme was admitted to Jagannath hospital in Baramati on February 21 where he was put on non-invasive ventilator support. However, he was shifted to   in Pune on February 22 after his condition worsened. He developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and was put on ventilator. His condition, however, did not improve and he succumbed to swine flu-induced pneumonitis with septic shock around 9pm on February 22.
 
 Patil developed influenza-like illness from February 11. He had cough, fever and progressive breathlessness. He initially consulted a neighbourhood doctor. However when his condition did not improve, he was admitted to Kranti hospital in Sangali where he was put on ventilator. Later his condition deteriorated and he was moved to Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital in Pune on February 18. However, he didnâ€™t respond to medication and died of swine flu-induced pneumonitis with ARDS and multi-organ failure around 4.30pm on February 21.
 
 Experts said people should continue to take precautions in terms of basic sanitation practices like frequent hand washing, good diet and healthy habits as the virus is still infecting people.
