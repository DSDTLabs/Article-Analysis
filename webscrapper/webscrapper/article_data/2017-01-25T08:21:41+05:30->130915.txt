HYDERABAD: A   who has got stuck at the violence-hit Saudi-Yemen border has appealed to be rescued. The place where he is staying is being bombed every day.

 The Consul-General of India, Jeddah, who has responded to the pleas of Vijay, is coordinating efforts to rescue him. As Vijay is unable to speak any language other than Telugu, CGI communicated with the hapless man in the language on twitter to find out his whereabouts. Vijay is at Al Tiwala, a place which is some 60 km away from Jizan in Saudi Arabia.
 
 Vijay who is from Tanuku, West Godavari in Andhra Pradesh, also sent a voice message to this reporter saying that he is living in dangerous conditions. “This place is being bombed every day. I want to be rescued from here,” Vijay said in the voice message.
 
 A social worker and BJP leader from Telangana, T R S Srinivas, who is in Jeddah has also responded to Vijay’s plea for help and is in touch with the embassy officials on the issue. Another IT professional from Hyderabad, Mohd Taher, who works in Saudi Arabia, has also got in touch with Vijay to help him out.
 
 Vijay was sent to Saudi Arabia by an agent from Palakollu in West Godavari to work in a hospital. “For the last three months I have been barely managing to survive as I have been deserted by the people who brought me here. There are bombings in this area and I am living in constant fear and danger,” Vijay told TOI in his voice message.
 
 Though Vijay was taken to work in a hospital, he was not given work. He had to work in different places to be able to survive. In a latest incident, the owners of a shop beat him up when he asked for his salary and have tried to frame him in a theft case. 
 
 “I have no food. And I am caught in a war zone. I want to come back to India,” Vijay said. The problem, however, is that his employer has taken his passport. The CGI is reaching out to him to solve his problem.
