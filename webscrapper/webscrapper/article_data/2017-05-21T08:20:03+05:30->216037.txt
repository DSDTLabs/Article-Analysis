PUNE: The   has started inspecting the residential societies in the city from this week to check if   facilities like vermiculture and garbage   were functioning properly on their premises.

 The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has checked over 3,400 societies so far. Notices have been issued to about 1,148 societies because officials found their pits were not functioning properly. The PMC’s sanitary inspectors are conducting the inspections.
 
 A source in the administration said the drive was initiated after repeated updates were received about non-functioning of waste processing pits and vermicompost facilities at some residential societies. The drive is expected to get over in a month.
 
 As per estimates, there are over 20,000 societies with pits.
 
 An official of the PMC’s solid waste department said, “The administration gives up to 10% rebate in property tax if societies process the garbage properly. Large numbers of societies avail this rebate.”
 
 The societies are expected to respond to the notice within 10 days and explain why the vermicompost facility is not functioning. If they fail to reply, the administration will issue notice to the societies concerned again. The solid waste department would approach the administration recommending suspension of tax rebate if any society fails to respond to repeated notices, the official said.
 
 Suresh Jagtap, the head of PMC’s solid waste department, said, “The objective of the drive is to push the societies to process maximum garbage.”
