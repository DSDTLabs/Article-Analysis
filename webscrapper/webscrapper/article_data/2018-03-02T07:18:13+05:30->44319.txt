HYDERABAD: In a termination notice issued to Nalgonda district   officer, K Ganesh, Telangana government has officially admitted that his "negligence was one of the main reasons for the death of children" in the state-run   in Nalgonda. 

 The district collector has issued notices stating that Ganesh failed to take care of the abandoned infants that resulted in 15 deaths. So far, the government has been denying any negligence in the issue.
 
 In the termination notice, the administration said, "In the recent episode of the death of babies of Shishugruha, Ganesh's negligence is one of the main reasons for the death of children. He failed to take proper care as per the instructions issued from time to time and also failed to report the existing situations in Shishugruha. He hasn't submitted observations to district women and child welfare officer. Even after visiting Shishugruha several times, he didn't give any guidance to the managers and staff." 
 
 It was also alleged that Ganesh was on contract and that he helped people to adopt children illegally without following due process. He was also suspected of misappropriating ICPS funds and claiming travel allowances without going for field visits.
 
 Interestingly, officials claimed so far the death of 15 infants in four months in Shishugruha in Nalgonda was due to "health complications due to low immunity and underweight". Earlier, TOI had revealed that many of the infants were healthy and within the average weight range of 2.5 kg and 2.9 kg. It was also found that the weight dropped at the time they were admitted to local private hospitals in Nalgonda. 
 
 Girl children are either abandoned or voluntarily admitted to Shishugruha by their parents.
 
 It was also found that despite recommendations of doctors that kids be given lactogen-free milk as many were intolerant to the spray-dried formula, it was found   staff either fed lactogen or gave ' ' milk, which only suits babies over six months of age.
