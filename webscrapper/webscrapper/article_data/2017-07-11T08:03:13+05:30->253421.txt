CHENNAI: The   in the   (TNTET) remain terrible. Barely 4.64% of the lakhs who appeared for the exam this year, held after a three year hiatus after being caught in a legal tangle, were able to scrape through. Of the 7.53 lakh (paper I - 2,41,555 & paper II - 5,12,260) who took the exam, only 34,979 passed. The Teacher Recruitment Board (TRB) conducted the test to fill teacher vacancies in elementary (Classes I to V) and   (Classes VI to VIII).

 This year’s performance is only a negligible improvement from the last exam (2013) when the average pass rate in paper I (secondary grade teachers) and paper II (graduate teachers) was about 4.55%. While 6.61% of candidates passed paper I, only 3.66% cleared paper II. The exam tested candidates in topics like child development & pedagogy, Tamil, English, mathematics and science, environmental studies and social science. Experts believe the trend of a majority of candidates failing the exam is a reflection of the quality. 
 
 Subjects like mathematics and science, in particular, had very low pass rates (2.72%), while the situation in social sciences was slightly better (4.68%).
 
 An education department official, who wished to be anonymous, said most candidates looked at TET as a means to an end, and often did no go through a thorough formal education process before appearing for it. “Many who have been appearing for the TNTET have done their degrees through correspondence/distance education,” the official said. A diploma was the only eligibility level for paper 1 and a candidate who secured it through non-classroom mode could also qualify. “A candidate aspiring to become a teacher must first have a grounding in classroom dynamics and the formal education system.”
