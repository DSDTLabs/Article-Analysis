Television actress  , popular for her role in the sitcom  , was expelled from the Cine And TV Artistes’ Association (CINTAA) at its Annual General Meeting (AGM) on Monday. Interestingly, she had contested in the association’s annual polls a few weeks ago and was elected as one of the members of the Executive Committee. However, at the AGM, the members of CINTAA collectively took a decision to expel her.
Informs a source, “Now that she has been expelled, she won’t be allowed to avail any facilities that CINTAA provides its members with.”
 Actor  , general secretary and spokesperson, CINTAA, confirms, “After the general body was apprised of the whole case and Shilpa was given a fair chance to present her side, the majority voted in favour of her expulsion. She did not adhere to the rules and regulations of CINTAA and constantly engaged in defamatory activities against the association and its executive committee members. She is 
 free to work wherever she wants to, but the association is not willing to take her responsibility. ” 
 Shilpa says, “After being selected in the committee, I was expelled overnight. So, who is afraid of whom? Having said that, I am very happy that I am no longer a part of CINTAA. They never stand by an artiste or their rights. No membership means less mess.”
 It seems like Shilpa has become controversy’s favourite child. After her unceremonious exit from 'Bhabiji Ghar Par Hain' in February 2016, she had filed a case against producer  , accusing him of sexual harassment. Sanjay and his wife Binaifer then filed a criminal defamation against Shilpa a few days later.
