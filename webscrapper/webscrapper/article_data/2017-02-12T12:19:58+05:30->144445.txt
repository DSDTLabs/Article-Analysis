BHOPAL: “No one has the right to measure another person’s patriotism– not even me,” said   in Bhopal on Saturday morning. “Jo apne ko is desh ka karta-dharta samjhe, usse bhi yeh adhikaar nahi (A person, who thinks he is very important for this country, even he does not have this right). No one can measure or assess another person’s patriotism,” he said.

 At a book launch function on Saturday, Bhagwat defined patriotism. Citing the example of   and the explorer’s total conviction that he would discover India, the RSS chief described ‘deshbhakti’ (patriotism) as faith without bounds, an ocean without shore. “We say we love our country. Nationalism is a word that has become like an over-used coin. What is patriotism? How far can this love go?”
 
 He mentioned Columbus on his journey to find India was facing difficulties. “He set out to discover a new land, which was nowhere in sight and there was one crisis after another on his ship. That is when he sang a song telling the ocean that even the mighty seas have shores on either side to contain waters, but our hopes have no bounds,” the RSS chief said. “Only good intention for the country is not enough. Total faith and dedication towards India is essential.”
 
 He said the education system and perception of our country was changed by the British. “But this is the same education system from which Swami Vivekananda, Mahatma Gandhi and all great men evolved. Yogi Aurobindo’s parents sent him to England at a very young age to teach him British culture. But when he came back, the mere touch of Indian soil washed away British culture from him forever. Bharat bhakti (devotion to India) is the only answer,” he explained. “Go to Shaurya Smarak (state war memorial here) and read the poems. You will become a patriot if you read it with your heart,” he said.
