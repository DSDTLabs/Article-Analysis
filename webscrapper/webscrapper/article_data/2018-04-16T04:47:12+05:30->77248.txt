MUMBAI: Yet another time, Balabharti-the state's textbook bureau-is facing flak for "faults" in the newly published geography class X books. Members of the   in the city have raised concerns over some "erroneous" maps and graphs. 

 Retired professor and member of the Mumbai Geography Teachers Association Vidyadhar Amrute pointed out that several maps are not scaled to size. "On page 24, there is a digital elevated model map of the country which is stretched horizontally. This is not the shape of India." A note on the same page states that the image has been drawn with the help of a software and hence not symmetrical. "If a software isn't going to show the right shape of the country, why use it. Even small mistakes can depict inaccurate scenario," he said. 
 
 He has also pointed out discrepancies in charts which show rainfall of the country. "In graphs that show the rainfall in four metro cities in India, the Y axis scale is not same for all graphs. Though Delhi received much lower rain than Mumbai, in the graphs it looks as if it was almost the same," he said. The rainfall patterns for Brazil, the country of comparison in the textbook too has been marked wrong, he pointed out. 
 
 Another discrepancy was pointed out in the maps showing population. "The maps use dot technique; each dot equals 2 lakh people. While, the northern part of UP and Bihar is densely populated, that isn't depicted.  's population seems evenly distributed according to the map," said Amrute. State officials said they were open to suggestions from experts.
