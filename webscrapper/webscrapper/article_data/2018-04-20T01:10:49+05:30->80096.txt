THANE: Around 15 children were evacuated from a ground-plus-two storied kindergarten after a short-circuit took place in the split air-condition at 11am on Thursday near  . 

 An   first saw the flames coming out of the air-contion unit that was place outside the classroom. She immediately took the fire extinguisher that was in the kindergarten premises. She then evacuated the kids and managed to douse the flames.
 
 “The teacher was busy teaching the kids when she suddenly saw smoke coming out from the AC unit outside the window. Without panicking, she extinguished the flames and alerted the other staff and security guards. It is fortunate that the teacher was trained in fire safety; else the situation would have been worse. The institute will be operational on Friday,” said an official from the institute.

For the safety of the students and staff, the officials ensured that everyone from the building was evacuated— which included 60 students, five parents, teachers and other staff.
