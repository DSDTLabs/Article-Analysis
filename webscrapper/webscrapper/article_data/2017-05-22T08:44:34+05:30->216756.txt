LUCKNOW: Ever since the   session began last Monday, the lobby of the   building has turned into a meeting venue for mafia don-turned-MLA  , lodged in the Agra jail for 12 years now, and his   

  Mukhtar has been granted permission by court to leave jail to attend the ongoing session. He, however, has been asked to not leave the assembly building complex. 
 
 Mukhtar, prime accused in the murder case of Krishanand Rai in Mahmudabad in 2005, has been transferred from one jail to another ever since his arrest. But despite being behind bars, Mukhtar contested and won assembly elections from Mau constituency in 2007, 2012 and 2017. 
 
 Sibghatullah, a former MLA who lost the assembly election this year, now takes care of his brother's constituency, acting as a bridge between the imprisoned Mukhtar and the district administration and the government for development works to be done in Mau and to redress grievances of his voters.
 
 " Main to yahi dua karta hoon ki mera bhai jaldi se chhoot jaye (I pray that my brother gets released soon)," said Sibghatullah (67). 
 
  "The first question I asked him when we met at the Assembly was about his health," said Sibghatullah, who used to travel over 300km from his native district Ghazipur to the jail in Agra jail.
