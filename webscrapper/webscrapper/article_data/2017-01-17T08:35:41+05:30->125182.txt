VASCO: Once again,   is in the news for the wrong reasons. Passengers and airline staff had a narrow escape after a sizable portion of the false ceiling came crashing in the wee hours of Monday morning.
 
  Nobody was reported hurt in this incident,   officials said. At about 12.30am of Monday, a portion of false ceiling came down in front of the domestic airlines check-in counters on the ground floor.   airport director B C H Negi said, “The plaster of paris work which was done some months ago has given way. It appears that the agency has not done a good job.”
  
  Given that this is the third time that the false ceiling has collapsed in the three-year-old terminal,   has taken serious note of the issue and launched an internal inquiry. The possibility of action against the contractor has not been ruled out. Airport officials said, “The ceiling work was done after a similar incident was reported in June last year. Airport officials are investigating what went wrong again.”
  
  Repairs to the ceiling started late Monday afternoon. Sources added, “If the agency is found at fault then action will be taken against them as per rules.”
