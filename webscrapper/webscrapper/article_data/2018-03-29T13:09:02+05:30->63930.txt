NEW DELHI: A copy of the leaked   that was scheduled for Wednesday was delivered to the office of the   on Tuesday evening, raising questions whether the board should have acted to scrap the paper before the examination got under way.

 
 The incident is seen as either a “catch-me-if-you-can” dare on part of gang suspected to be behind the paper leak or an anonymous act by someone in possession of the leaked Maths paper. Senior sources in the ministry of human resource development wondered whether   should have acted with more alacrity and spared students a re-test.
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 The ministry has ordered an extensive inquiry and officials said that responsibility will be fixed at all levels. As the government scrambled to gather facts, the initial investigation has indicated that the leak may be the handiwork of a gang working in cahoots with individuals at a particular paper bank and a few schools.
 
 The damage, however, was done as the leaked paper sparked widespread outrage over the board’s inability to ensure the sanctity of the exam process. Faced with demands for action, the government is looking to tighten the paper distribution process through encryption where schools will be given a key to print papers a short while ahead of exams. The feasibility of such a system, however, is being examined.
 
 Union human resource development minister   is expected to hold a press conference on Thursday to address various aspects of the exam leak.
 
 The   has asked the board to ensure that students are protected from any further leaks and re-tests are held and evaluated in a manner that honest examinees do not suffer.
