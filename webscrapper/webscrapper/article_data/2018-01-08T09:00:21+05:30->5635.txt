KOLKATA: A new coach and six changes in the starting XI didn’t bring about a significant change in Mohun Bagan’s play, in the   clash against   at the   on Sunday. But they were able to create more openings and won 2-0 in Shankar lal Chakraborty’s first match in full charge of the team.

 After a goalless first half, Bagan were extremely lucky to take the lead in the 54rd minute when Aizawl defender   turned a cross into his own net. Dipanda Dicka then scored his fifth goal of the campaign in 75th minute to help the green and maroons win after four matches. Bagan, with 13 points from eight matches, moved up to fourth, while defending champions Aizawl stayed on 10 points.
 
 Besides returning to winning ways after almost a month, what pleased the Bagan fans was Cameron Watson’s performance. The Australian, making his debut in a green-and-maroon shirt, controlled the midfield admirably — holding the ball, distributing well and making the right moves off the ball.
 
 Bagan did well to avoid the long balls. However, the wingers were not able to spread the game and Aizawl — playing in a 4-2-3-1 formation — kept things tight. Chakraborty brought in Sheikh Faiaz for Dipendu Dowary at the half hour mark. Aizawl got into the game gradually and defender Kareem Omolaja Nurain surprised Bagan with a powerful drive from 35 yards.
