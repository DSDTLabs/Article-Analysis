Visakhapatnam: The passenger   from   to Rayagada via Visakhapatnam is likely to be upgraded into an express train this April.

 Several passengers took to Twitter once the railways decided to stop reservations from April.
 
 A passenger tweeted: “57271/72 BZA-RGDA passenger is being upgraded to express. People who are travelling daily by this train will have to face a lot of issues as the train will skip many small stations and this will be a big blow to poor people.”
 
 Another twitterati said: “First the train should not be upgraded to express which will be against poor passengers who travel to capital from north coastal districts like Srikakulam, Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram and vice-versa. Withdraw any proposal to upgrade from passenger to express. If still goes ahead, introduce another passenger train.”
 
 “I think All Railway Officials r playing Musical Chairs Game. No one is responding. Everybody is throwing the issue to others. It is your duty to respond...” tweeted Dr J Babu@Vizag_Railzone to which Waltair DRM MS Mathur replied: “Date of introduction will be intimated at the earliest possible time when we get communication from Railway Board/Headquarters in this regard.”
 
 The train leaves Vijayawada daily at 9pm at reaches Vizag at 8am the next day. It covers all satellite and small railway stations in   and Odisha. However, officials from Waltair division are yet to receive an official communication over the latest status of the train.
 
 When contacted, a senior railway official told TOI that they did not receive any kind of communication regarding the train, but the proposal of upgrading the passenger train is true.
