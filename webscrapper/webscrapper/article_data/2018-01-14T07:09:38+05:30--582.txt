A day after Andhra Pradesh issued orders to open the   reservoir to release 3.33tmcft (thousand million cubic feet) of water from the Krishna river to Tamil Nadu's Poondi reservoir, Karnataka rejected Tamil Nadu's demand for 15tmcft of Cauvery water on Saturday. 

 Chief minister   on Saturday wrote a letter to his Karnataka counterpart asking him to release 7tmcft of Cauvery water immediately and the balance within a fortnight. 
 
 As per the 2007 order of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal, Tamil Nadu is entitled to receive 192tmcft of Cauvery water every year. However, as on January 9, the state has received only 111.647tmcft at Biligundulu (zero point) against the due of 179.871tmcft, leaving a deficit of 68.224 tmcft, the letter pointed out. Speaking to reporters on the TN's request in New Delhi, Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah said, "We don't have water. It's not possible to release water to TN. "
 
 Meanwhile, Metrowater officials pointed out that though the combined water level in Poondi, Cholavaram, Red Hills and Chembarambakkam reservoirs was better compared to last year, the storage level is only 43% of their total capacity. Hence, any decision on increasing the water supply in the city - which is now 650 MLD - will be taken once the levels stabilise.
