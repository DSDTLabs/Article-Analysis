Actor   shares his   secrets.

 
 
 One place I can relax, reinvent and where I can think progressively. 
 
 
 
 It has to be my balcony – at Level 15. I can see the skyline and it’s gorgeous – my go-to place whenever I am stressed. 
 
 
 I recently changed my wall highlights and flooring. I wanted a new vibe and feel to my home. 
 
 
 Unfortunately, it doesn’t have a back story but is the ultimate in comfort. I am talking about my reclining sofa where I can watch movies without a pain in the neck.
 
 
 I would prefer natural lighting and green spaces. If you have them, you have everything. Natural lighting is heavenly.
 
 
 I am an obsessive gardener. You will find all sorts of flowers, plants and miniatures in my balcony garden. It gives me a lot of peace to be able to spend time with my plants. In fact, I make it a point to dedicate at least 30 minutes every day to my greens. 
 
 
 I leave it to the design experts but I do have some likes and dislikes that I share with them. Because at the end of the day, I want my home to be completely me. It should, after all, reflect my personality.
