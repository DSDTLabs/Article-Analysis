MUMBAI: Maharashtra’s chief minister   and his helicopter woes seem to have no end. On Thursday, he was to take off for Mumbai from a helipad in  , but was forced to make the journey by road after the pilot warned of cable wires that would have obstructed takeoff.

 The chief minister boarded an MD 900, a light, twin engine helicopter, from a temporary helipad on Mumbai Port Trust land around 11:45am on Thursday. Along with him were Union minister   and three others.

 Cable wires between buildings came to the pilot’s notice, who changed course, landing the helicopter safely,” said Capt Sanjay Karve, director, civil aviation,  . The landing was on a temporary helipad, an open ground attached to the  , which belongs to BJP MLA Narendra Mehta. Sources say that prima facie it appears that basic flight safety norms like keeping the aircraft approach path obstruction-free weren’t followed; Fadnavis took the district administration to task over the issue.
 
 Cable lines and high tension power supply lines have been the cause of quite a few air crashes in India involving flying club or charter aircraft. These deadly obstructions are encountered during low-level flying and depending on the position of the sun can at times not be visible to the pilot, till it’s too late for course-correction.
