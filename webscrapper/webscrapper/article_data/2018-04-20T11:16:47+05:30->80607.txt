 is not just a writer of romance, she is a charmer with heart-warming characters. In 
 , the third instalment to the 
  trilogy, Moyes offers a rewarding conclusion as we trace the emotional development of the quirky heroine   and indulge in yet another one of her adventures.

  Often called the literary cousin to Bridget Jones, Lousia Clarke is happy, humble and oddly vivacious. In 
 , our British heroine leaves London to find herself in New York City as she struggles to keep her job and maintain her relationship with Sam the paramedic across the Atlantic. Working for the utterly posh family of Agnes and Leonard Gopnik, Lou spends her days assisting Agnes and by providing her an assuring companionship amidst the disdains of New York's scathing elites. Lou and Sam observe strains in their long-distance relationship and Louisa awkwardly flounders between her professional and private fronts. But things soon turn out in her favour as Lou figures out how to take charge of her own life.
 
  A delightful read, 
  introduces some wonderful characters that make the reader's journey through the book quite breezy. Moyes' language is simple yet illustrative, painting a colourful canvas before our eyes that matches Louisa's life and landscape.
