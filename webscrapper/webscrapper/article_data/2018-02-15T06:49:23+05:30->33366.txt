Bengaluru: The city will start getting 12 MLD (million litre a day) water from the   reservoir in eight months. The foundation stone for the natural biological system (NBS), the 11.49-crore project that will make this possible, was laid by city development minister   and senior   leader M   on Wednesday in  , north Bengaluru. The last time water was pumped from TG Halli to the city was in 2012. 

  NBS is a wastewater treatment system, which uses aquatic plants to purify and enhance the quality of water by removing heavy metals, oils, detergents and other pollutants. 
 
 The system will be installed at the confluence of the   with the Arkavathy River Valley, downstream of Dombarahalli, and is designed to treat the Madivara Nallah flow of 12 MLD during the dry season. 
 
  
 
 
  The foundation for the underground sewage network to be set up in and around Hesaraghatta village was also laid. 
 
  According to BWSSB, lack of the network in and around Hesaraghatta village was causing sewage to be diverted into stormwater drains. This sewage then entered   and finally emptied into TG Halli reservoir. Hoping to prevent this contamination, the board will construct an underground sewage network in the area at Rs 23.45 crore. The work is expected to be completed in two years.
