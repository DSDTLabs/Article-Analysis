NEW DELHI: Cricketer-turned-politician   met   vice president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday, but that has not stopped speculation in Congress circles over whether he would join the party.

 As   passed without Sidhu formally entering Congress, members have been discussing whether the announcement would come on Saturday, on the occasion of Makar Sankranti.
 
 Without Sidhu, Congress has also not announced the party candidate for Amritsar east, which his wife Navjot Kaur won in 2012 on a BJP ticket.
 
 It has also not announced the candidate for Jalandhar cantonment, which is held by Sidhu’s friend and hockey star Pargat Singh, who has quit Akali Dal and joined Congress.
 
 Congress is rife with theories that Sidhu is still driving a hard bargain for his joining the party. Amid the raging speculation, Navjot Kaur said her husband would join Congress in a “day or two”, and Rahul Gandhi had assured him of a “significant” role in Punjab if Congress formed the government in the state. “Sidhu will join Congress in a day or two. He has a big responsibility as he will canvass for the party across the state as a star campaigner,” she said.
 
 On Friday, Congress announced the name of senior party member Gurjit Singh Aujla for the by-election to the Amritsar   seat, which has fallen vacant after the resignation of Amarinder Singh over the Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal issue.
 
 Earlier, there was talk that Sidhu could contest the Amritsar Lok Sabha bypoll.
