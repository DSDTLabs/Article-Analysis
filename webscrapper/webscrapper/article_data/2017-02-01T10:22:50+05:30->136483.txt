PANAJI: In the event of Congress coming to power following the upcoming February 4 assembly elections, alternative sources of revenue for the state will have to be identified once all floating casinos are permanently closed in keeping with the party’s poll manifesto, Congress leader   said on Tuesday.

 “Experts will be required to identify an alternate source of revenue. One thing we have decided is that we will do away with the casinos,” he said.
 
 When asked whether the party, as   president   has claimed, will do away with all casinos, including those on land, Naik said, “We will constitute a committee which will find out what’s ideal. The committee will decide if they want to remove all casinos or some of them,” he said. 
 
 He also hit out ex-chief minister   and CM Laxmikant Parsekar for committing breach of privilege of the Goa assembly by going back on the contents of the resolution unanimously passed, recommending special status to Goa. “Both of them are duty-bound to disclose the reason behind betraying Goa over the special status issue,” Naik said, adding that the reply Parrikar received from Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the matter was kept under wraps.
 
 Naik also criticized the central government for not fulfilling their promise of setting up an All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Goa, saying there is no proposal from the government for land to set up the institute. “The construction of the South Goa district hospital hasn’t been completed either,” he added. 
 
 He also criticized the functioning of the office of the chief electoral officer saying it has no powers and acts as a mere postman, sending complaints immediately to Delhi.
