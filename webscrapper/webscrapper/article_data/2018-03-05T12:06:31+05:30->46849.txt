We have been keeping a strict watch over vehicles which are moving from Hyderabad, however, still the number of over speeding cases are high,” said deputy commissioner of police (traffic) in Rachakonda, K Ramesh Naidu. Last year, police had booked 44,060 overspeeding cases on the ORR till December. This year, the DCP said cases have touched the 4,000-mark.
 
 “On an average, 200 cases are booked daily for overspeeding. Overspeeding, as well as drunk driving cases have been identified as the main reasons for road mishaps on ORR. To check speed, we have only four laser speed guns,” Naidu said.
