Kolkata: In accordance with a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) drawn out in Kolkata between India and Bangladesh during the Vijay Diwas celebrations of 2017, a batch of 10 children, including six girls, from various Army schools in Bangladesh are now touring Fort William. In January, 10 students from the Army Public School, Kolkata, had visited military bases in Bangladesh. The Bangladeshi delegation to Kolkata is led by Lt Col Md Jubayer Rahman Akhand.

 During Vijay Diwas, Lt Gen Abhay Krishna, general officer commanding-in-chief, Eastern Command, had expressed concern over the fact that India’s contribution towards the creation of Bangladesh in 1971 may not be remembered by the younger generation. He had insisted greater participation of youth and children from the two countries in such events.
 
 “It is very important that children learn how the two armies are performing the national task of enhancing bilateral relations. They need to develop a good understanding of these aspects that will help them tomorrow when they grow up to become leaders,” Lt Gen Krishna said while interacting with the children on Wednesday. They later visited Senapati Bhavan, the residence of the Eastern Army Commander. During their visit, they were taken to various important locations in Kolkata. 
 
 “We are happy that they learnt a lot during this tour and would carry back fond memories to Bangladesh,” Lt Col Jubayer said.
