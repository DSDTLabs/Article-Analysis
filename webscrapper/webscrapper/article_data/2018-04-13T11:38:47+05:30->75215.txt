 Jagwinder said that, “I had approached Gurdhir and his wife on November 19, 2017. After getting Rs 3.60 lakh from me they had assured to get me a tourist visa for Turkey. They also assured me that I would be taken to Europe after spending some time in Turkey. The couple provided me a visa and air tickets, which were later found to be fake. I approached them to return the money and they gave a cheque on January 15, which got dishonoured. When I approached them again, they started making excuses. They neither returned my money nor the passport. After that I approached the police on January 24 for the registeration of a case against them.”
