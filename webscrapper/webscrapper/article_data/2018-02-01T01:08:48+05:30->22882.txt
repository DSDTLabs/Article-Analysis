NEW DELHI: The special cell has filed a chargesheet against three shooters of   arrested three months ago. The cell has claimed that the shooters had been tasked to eliminate the directors of the movie Coffee with D, apart from the writer Tarek Fatah and a former Bajrang Dal functionary.

 The shooters were also tasked to gather information about jailed gangster Chhota Rajan’s visit to hospital in and outside Tihar Jail, police said.
 
 While   has been on the radar for his controversial remarks, the former Bajrang Dal functionary has been on D Company’s radar since a decade after he burnt a holy book.
 
 Makers of the Sunil Grover-starrer Coffee With D had filed a complaint in January 2017 alleging that they had been getting threat calls from underworld gangster Chhota Shakeel's aides. The makers said they were told to delete the portions of the movie that made fun of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim or not release it at all. Writer-director Vishal Mishra had submitted recordings of calls received by him and his team.
 
 Last November, northeast Delhi cops had arrested a D Company shooter named Naseem. He had a reward of Rs 50,000 on him. Before that, one   Choudhary and his aide had been arrested. They had disclosed the plan to target the movie director.
 
 This module comprising Junaid has been arrested twice since 2016 for accepting contracts from Chhota Shakeel.
 
 Cops have said that Naseem also had a contract to eliminate a celebrity in Hyderabad. He was to meet an associate of a UP-based gangster   in Gurgaon for that. He was to be paid Rs 1.5 crore and Rs 45 lakh for the two contracts.
 
 Naseem had told police that he had recced Film City in Noida’s Sector 16A where Fateh was apparently supposed to go for a TV show.
