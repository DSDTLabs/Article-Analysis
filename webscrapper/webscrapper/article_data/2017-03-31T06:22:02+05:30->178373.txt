AHMEDABAD: Muslim   from the city of Ahmedabad are set to stretch out to yoga in their quest for fitness. An NGO will run the yoga classes and about 32   from across the city have enrolled so far. The classes are expected to start from next week on private premises in Khanpur. Interestingly, Congress councillor Azra Kadri from Khanpur is among those who have enrolled.

 “Yoga is associated with Indian culture and has nothing to do with religion,” said Kadri. “I don’t mind performing the   as it is not a prayer but a collage of 12 asans.” Farhat Jahan Syed of the NGO said that yoga would make Muslim women more health-conscious.
 
 “More importantly, we want Muslim women to break social barriers,” she said. “Yoga is a science and has nothing do with religion.” There was an uproar last year when some Muslim clerics showed resistance to yoga, especially the surya namaskar, which they said was un-Islamic. Syed said classes would be conducted by Tasneem Kanchwala. “Tasneem runs a yoga class attended by 35 women, mostly Muslim,” Syed said.
