Pune: A thirty-five weeks pregnant   from Wanowrie was forced to undergo a caesarean section surgery after she was hit by a speeding tempo last month. The mishap took place on December 21 in Pune Camp when the thirty-one-year-old woman was walking on the road along with her five-year-old son. They were rushed to Ruby Hall Clinic in Wanowrie.

 “The woman was bleeding profusely which could have been because of the placenta detaching from the uterine wall due to the trauma. Her extremely low blood pressure, high heart rate and confused state suggested grade three shock,” said Sujay Patil, the hospital’s critical care expert .
 
  Doctors immediately resuscitated her and put her on IV fluids and started with blood transfusion. However, the biggest concern was her and her unborn baby’s safety.
 
 “The high foetal heart rate indicated that the baby was in distress,” Patil said. The hospital’s gynaecologist suggested a caesarean section.
 
 “A few hours later, a premature baby was born and recovered satisfactorily in the hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit. The woman was discharged on December 25. Her five-year-old escaped with a fractured leg and a few bruises,” Patil said.
