Kolkata: The   government is considering denotifying stretches of state   that run through municipalities and corporations. The possible denotification, however, will not touch state highway stretches passing through panchayat areas.

 The government on Monday started exploring this option to save as many   outlets as possible from the ambit of the Supreme Court ban, officials said. The apex court has ordered a complete shutdown of liquor vends — both off shops and bars — within 500m of highways; the “ban” zone is 220m for highways that run through municipalities with a population of less than 20,000.
 
 This has put the Bengal government in a spot; liquor outlets along highways earn the state an annual revenue of Rs 1,000 crore (the total annual revenue from liquor sales is Rs 4,000 crore).
 
 Bengal has 2,140 liquor vends along   and state highways, out of which around 1,500 are located close to state highways. Denotification of state highway stretches passing through municipalities and corporations will straightaway bring some 700-800 outlets out of the purview of the SC mandate.
