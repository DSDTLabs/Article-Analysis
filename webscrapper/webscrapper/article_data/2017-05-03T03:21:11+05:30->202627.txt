GURUGRAM: Five employees of a Gurgaon-based IT firm — Ameriprise India Private Limited — were injured when the car they were travelling in met with an   on Gurgaon-Faridabad road late on Monday. 

 The injured have been identified as cab driver Bijender Sharma (32), security guard Abhimanyu (30) and three techies — Sunil (25), Riya (23) and Urvashi (21). The cab, an Innova, was heading towards Faridabad from Sector 18, where the company is located, to drop the employees home. 
 
 According to Sharma, the accident happened around 11.30pm, just ahead of the toll plaza on Gurgaon-Faridabad road. A speeding truck coming from the opposite side rammed into the Innova head-on. 
 
 The collision was so severe that all five in the cab got trapped inside. Hearing the loud bang, passersby rushed to help the injured, while the truck driver fled, leaving the truck on the spot. 
 
 A PCR call was immediately made. After cops reached the spot, they took the injured to a nearby private hospital. Two of them were discharged after first aid, while three others were admitted for treatment. Doctors confirmed they are now out of danger. 
 
 Based on Sharma’s statement, an FIR was registered against the accused, under sections 279 (rash driving), 337 (causing hurt), 427 (causing damage) of the IPC at DLF 1 police station. 
 
 “The truck was being driven on the wrong side of the road, and hit the cab head-on. We have taken the truck in custody and are trying to identify the accused,” said ASI Amit Kumar, the investigating officer.
