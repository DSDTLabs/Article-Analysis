MADURAI: Five girl students of a private matriculation school at   in Madurai tried to commit suicide by consuming orange juice laced with rat poison on Wednesday afternoon. They were rushed to a nearby government hospital, where they are undergoing treatment. Doctors said that the students were stable and responding well to treatment.

  collector   who visited the hospital as well as the school said that the students had consumed poison for silly reasons. While one of the girls said she did it to “avoid questions from the teachers”, another girl said that she had issues with her mother as she did not allow her to watch TV. Another girl said she was scolded by the school teacher, he said. During investigation, one of the girls told the police that a few months ago a girl from the school had consumed poison and was treated in a hospital. However, ever since she came back, she has been enjoying “special privileges”. While the teachers used to reprimand others for not doing well in studies and were strict when it came to ensuring all of them did their homework regularly, this particular girl was not questioned.
 
 Police said the teachers came to know about the incident after one of the girls was found weak on Wednesday afternoon. The girls told the teachers that they had consumed orange juice laced with rat poison, which one of them had brought from her house. However, the girl who brought it had not consumed it. Immediately, the parents were alerted and the girls given first aid. The students were rushed to Tirumangalam GH after the parents arrived at the school, a police source said. 
 
 District collector K Veera Raghava Rao said, “The quantity of the poison was very minimal and it took time to show the symptoms, which caused the delay in rushing the students to the hospital. I have conducted an inquiry with the schools teachers.”
