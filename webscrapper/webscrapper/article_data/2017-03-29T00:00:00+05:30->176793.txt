Wild Seve, a documentary on an initiative by conservation biologist   by city-based filmmakers   (director) and   (DOP) has been selected for the   (IWFF), which is one of the longest running wildlife film festivals in the world. The documentary has been selected in the ‘conservation’ category and will be screened at the fest that will be held in Montana’s Missoula, USA, on April 19.

 An elated Prakash, whose film will be screened alongside the likes of Planet Earth 2, The Hunt, Rob Sullivan’s Jungle Animal Hospital, Light On Earth and many more, says, “I’ve been a filmmaker for four years and it feels amazing to have reached such a platform. This is the first film that we sent to any festival. We premiered   at the Student Conference on Conservation Science at IISc in September 2016 to a crowd of 400-500 people, and IWFF is the first major film festival where it has been selected.”
 
 Wild Seve is Krithi’s initiative, which deals with securing compensation from the government for farmers whose crops are destroyed by wild animals, usually elephants. “The documentary addresses the human-wildlife conflict in   and Nagarhole national parks. The main idea of Wild Seve is to build people’s tolerance towards wildlife, and this is done by getting involved in the process of securing compensation that villagers otherwise don’t get too quickly,” Prakash explains.
