NEW DELHI: In a first, New   (NDMC) has decided to regulate the collection and transportation of construction and demolition (C&D) waste by installing   at 11 points in its area. Each of these bins have a capacity of holding 5-10 tonnes of construction waste.

 NDMC chairman Naresh Kumar said that the C&D waste will subsequently be sent to the plants at Burari and   for treatment. “Apart from the usual dustbins for dry, wet and recyclable waste, we have installed 11 red-coloured bins to collect C&D waste. This will help curb dust pollution. Moreover, it won’t get mixed with garbage and help in proper disposal of  ,” he said.
 
 The 11 C&D bins have been installed at Chanakyapuri, INA, Shivaji Stadium, Pandara Park, Jor Bagh, Bapa Nagar, Tilak Lane, Kaka Nagar and Ravinder Nagar. 
 
 The council plans to install 30 more such bins in the next few months. “Out of the 30 bins, 20 will have a capacity to hold 5 tonnes and 10 will be able to accommodate 10 tonnes of C&D waste,” said an official.
 
 Senior officials said that soon a user fee will be introduced for disposing such waste. “A user fee of Rs 1,500 per tonne will be charged on those who generate construction waste, especially builders. This is in line with our proposed user charge for garbage,” said a senior NDMC official.
 
 Environmentalists have lauded NDMC’s step to regulate the disposal of construction waste.  , programme manager for environmental governance, Centre for Science and Environment, said, “Earlier, C&D waste was a part of municipal solid waste and used to go to the landfill sites. Construction waste should not be mixed with garbage and processed at waste-to-energy plants, like the one at Okhla. This is a great step as after treatment such waste can be re-used as building material.”
