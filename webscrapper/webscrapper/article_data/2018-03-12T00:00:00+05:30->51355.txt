Director   says that his film   wouldn’t be the visual treat that he promises it to be if they had not captured three key scenes, with the lit up   as the background. As luck would have it,   was around the corner when it was time to can these shots, and after having searched for the perfect location to shoot the scene when the lead pair — played by   and Megha Sri — Sukesh was sure that there could be no better setting for the scenes than the beautifully lit-up   Palace during  .
“We scouted several locations to shoot the scene when the heroine realizes that she’s in love. During Dasara, the Mysuru Palace is lit up between 7 pm and 9 pm on weekends. But shooting during the festive season in public places is not permitted, so we looked around the city for three days, until we found a terrace from which you can see the Palace in the distance. When it was time to shoot, the cast and crew drove down to Mysuru from Bengaluru, waited the entire day, and at 6.30 pm we set up the camera so that we could can the scenes during the short duration that the Palace was completely lit up,” says Sukesh.
 When the Palace is lit, the team canned the shots of Megha falling in love. Then, there is also a conversation between a father and his daughter. The last bit to be shot there was Megha crying after a heart break. “One sees the emotional journey through the Palace lights. When Megha’s character falls in love, the Palace is lit up. When she suffers a heart break, the Palace lights go off. We shot all this over two days, for two hours each day,” adds Sukesh, signing off.
