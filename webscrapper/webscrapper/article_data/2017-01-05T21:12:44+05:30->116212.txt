CHENNAI: Summer may be three months away, but residents in the suburbs are already complaining of water shortage. People in Pallavaram, Tambaram, Alandur, Nanganallur, Palavanthangal and Chromepet are forced to call for water tankers as supply has dwindled drastically and   are unable to meet the demand.

 In Chromepet, where residents get water from Palar river after it is pumped from a station in Pazhayaseevaram near Wallajahbad, water supply is often once a week. "The monsoon has failed miserably. We now get Palar water only once a week or once in 10 days. Had a check been built across Palar, the situation would have been better," said  , social activist from Chromepet. 
 
 With no supply, Chromepet and Pallavaram residents spend close to Rs 5,000 per tanker of 12,000 litres of water. 
 
 A section of officials, however, is hopeful. "There is enough water in Palar from which we draw 45 lakh litres every day. Metrowater supplies us 15 lakh liters per day and locally we source 20 lakh litres. This year the shortage is manageable. All borewells have been repaired and the groundwater level is good," said special officer of the Pallavaram municipality K Sivakumar.
 
 But M Chandra Kesavan, councillor of   municipality, which also comprise Pallavaram and Chromepet, said once summer begins water supply will be affected. "The neglect of water bodies will take a toll," he said. Kesavan cited the example of Moovarsampet lake from which water is supplied to 15 wards. "This water can only be used for washing. It is not for consumption," he said.
