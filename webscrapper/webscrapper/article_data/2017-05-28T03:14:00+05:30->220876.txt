Vasco: The allegations against Chicalim ex-sarpanch Neelam Naik, and ex-deputy sarpanch Kamla Prasad Yadav, were rejected by Mormugao mamlatdar Satish Prabhu, on Saturday.  Prabhu declined all complaints against four candidates seeking to contest elections to the Chicalim village panchayat, after he found that the complainants could not prove any of their claims.  On Friday, one Arjun Naik had complained that Neelam had filed her nomination from ward No. 7, reserved for OBC candidates, although she belonged to the creamy layer.  On the other hand, one Sangeeta Bhosle alleged that Kamla Prasad and his wife, Savita Devi, hold two elector’s photo identity cards (EPIC) each; one registered in Uttar Pradesh and the other in Goa. The couple had filed their nominations from ward numbers 4 and 6 respectively.  Prabhu said that as per a Supreme Court judgment, no person can be debarred from contesting an election on account of him/her holding two voter’s ID cards.
