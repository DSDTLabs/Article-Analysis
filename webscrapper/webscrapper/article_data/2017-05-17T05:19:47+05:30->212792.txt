KOLKATA: A day after state election commissioner   came under fire of the opposition for his “failure to conduct free and fair election in three municipalities”, the repolling in six booths — three in Pujali, two in Domkal and one in   — was peaceful with nearly 80% turnout. All opposition parties stayed away from the polling process, not even putting up poll agents, giving Trinamool a walkover. 

 Sources in the commission said while three booths in Pujali recorded 81.34% polling, two booths in Domkal saw a turnout of 80.5% and the single booth in Raigunj had a turnout of 78.9%. “As there was huge police posting, people came out to exercise their franchise without fear. The election started at 7am and most of the election was over before 11am,” an SEC official said.
 
 Though the opposition demanded fresh elections in all the three municipalities in the plains, the SEC ordered repolling in six booths. “We have acted according to the reports sent by the district magistrates. In Pujali, people couldn’t vote because the EVMs were broken and there was violence in the booths in Domkal and Raigunj and so we ordered the  ,” the official said.
 
 The opposition dubbed the explanation of the commission farcical and demanded fresh polls in all the three municipalities. The Left and   boycotted the all-party meeting convened by the Speaker on Tuesday. “Everybody has seen what has happened and there is no scope for anything other than fresh election,”   leader   said.
