Kolkata: Four persons were seriously injured after   members attacked workers at an under-construction building in Entally on Friday night. One of the workers, a 14-year-old who was thrown off the first floor, is battling for his life in a nursing home. Two persons named in the FIR have been arrested.

 A gang of local criminals led by history-sheeter Dipak Das alias Neto allegedly fired shots in the air at Malipara area around 11.30pm on Friday. The workers on the first floor, who were woken by the noise, were taken by surprise when Neto and his men barged in and started beating them up with iron wards.
 
  One of the workers, a boy named Yusuf, tried to ask why they were being targeted. Enraged at being talked back to, two of the gang members grabbed him by his limbs and threw him out the window. Yusuf got stuck in the scaffolding and broke his leg before he dropped to the ground on his head.
 
 “We were sleeping when we heard gun shots somewhere quite near. When I came out, I saw some bikes parked near my house and loud noise coming from the building,” said Atanu Sinha, owner of the plot on which a residential unit is being developed. 
 
 When Sinha reached the first floor, the gang asked him to leave. On refusing, the 51-year-old was pushed out of the premises. 
 
 According to sources, Neto had been demanding money from Sinha ever since he gave the property to local developer Ainul Abedin. Abedin had even agreed to procure construction material from Neto despite the history-sheeter selling it at a premium. “I don’t know what has gone wrong between them. I have lodged an FIR with the police against Neto and his aides on Friday night,” Sinha said.
 
 Police on Saturday said Neto has been accused in more than 18 cases, including extortion, bombing and firing.
