AHMEDABAD: Of the 104 satellites launched, there were two indigenous   or CubeSAT by  , christened INS-1A and INS-1B. These weighed barely 8.4 kg and 9.7 kg respectively and were about 304x670x510mm in dimension, but are an important milestone in miniaturisation and use of high technology in India’s space programme.

 Space Applications Centre director   says these nano satellites were especially given   to help them to position themselves. “Nano satellites are part of a growing technology that is transforming space exploration. Today’s nano satellites at built at very low costs and have the potential to conduct important space science investigations like testing a material or electronics in space or simply seeing how certain bacteria or soil sample transform when exposed to space environments. That’s the potential of nano satellites,” said Misra. 
 
 He adds that the nano satellites also open doors for engineering colleges across the country to a new array of space science. 
 
 “Aboard these two satellites were a camera on INS-1A which measures target illumination properties at different sun illumination angles. The other was the origami camera in INS-1B, which folds light beams multiple times between two surfaces, thereby achieving a large focal length in a smaller space,” says Misra.
