TIRUPUR: The district administration has placed a panchayat secretary under suspension at   taluk for taking bribe from residents to provide them potable water connections.

 With a population of 10,000, Kanakkampalayam panchayat is the most populous area in the Udumalpet panchayat union. People there often used to complain about corruption by the government officials in providing water connections, said a revenue officer.
 
 During the initial stages of the inquiry, the district administration found the Kanakkampalayam panchayat secretary K   was at fault and transferred him to   panchayat. Now that the preliminary inquiry has been completed, collector’s personal assistant   has placed Rajkumar under suspension.
 
 “They are convinced that Rajkumar is involved in the corruption. Further inquiry will reveal more details,” said Udumalpet block development officer Shanmugavathi.
 
 There are also complaints against Kanakkampalayam panchayat for failing to remove encroachment in poramboke lands and regarding tax assessment, the revenue official said.tnn
