CHANDIGARH:   chief minister   said on Sunday that farmers will not forgive those who dumped their vegetables and milk on the roads. He said those misguiding farmers are their biggest enemies.

 Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the “Rozgar Prapt Yuvaon se Samvad” event held in   in  , he said those who tried to mislead farmers would not be spared.
 
 The chief minister said vegetables, fruits and milk are the result of tremendous hard work by farmers and self-proclaimed leaders are destroying their produce. He said the Haryana government has implemented the Prime Minister's crop insurance scheme, irrigation schemes and electricity connection schemes. They have also paid farmers the highest compensation for crops damaged due to natural calamities or disasters, he said.
 
 On the protest, he said throwing crops and milk on the roads won’t help. “Those who stop farmers from bringing the produce to the market and force them to throw it on the roads will be sternly dealt with”, he said. 
 
 Relief for employees
 
 In a major relief for employees who have lost jobs, Khattar said the state government would file an appeal in   against the verdict of the Punjab and Haryana High Court quashing regularisation of employees by the previous government. He said the state government strongly pleaded the case of the regularization policy in high court but the court cancelled it due to shortcomings in the policy under which the employees were regularized.
