LUCKNOW: Former state minister and BSP candidate from Phephna constituency in Ballia, Ambika Chaudhary’s son Anand was arrested on charges of attacking the residence of SP candidate   during polling on Saturday. 

 The district witnessed 58% turnout. 
 
 The seven seats in Ballia had a triangular fight with SP and BSP facing a strong resistance from the BJP. While Chaudhary had joined BSP after Akhilesh Yadav dropped him from the SP list, another SP rebel Narad Rai has also been fielded by the BSP from Ballia. Akhilesh Yadav loyalist Ram Govind Choudhary is vying from Bansdih where BJP rebel Ketaki Singh might cause an upset for Bharatiya Samaj Party president Om Prakash Rajbhar’s son.
 
 With decisive presence of non-Yadav OBC like Rajbhar, nonia, Kori, Kurmi in eastern UP, BJP has fielded several candidates from these castes, while SP and BSP are again relying on their core voters. While Dalits and Yadavs remain loyal to BSP and SP respectively, the two parties have aggressively tried to woo the Muslim vote bank.
