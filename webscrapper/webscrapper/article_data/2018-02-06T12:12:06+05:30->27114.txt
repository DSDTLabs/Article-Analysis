Stand-up comic   has announced that she and actor   have parted ways after three years of dating. 

  
  
 The 47-year-old comedian took to Twitter to reveal that the couple had called it quits last Christmas. Silverman said the long distance was the undoing of their relationship and they took the decision mutually. "The great @michaelsheen and I consciously uncoupled over Christmas. I mean, not 'over Christmas' - like that wasn't the fight that ended it."
 
 "No fight. We just live in different countries and it got hard. Felt we should just tell y'all so you stop askin, 'How's Michael/How's Sarah? (sic)" she wrote. 
 
  
  
 "The Wreck-It Ralph"   had opened up about their long-distance relationship to her ex, Jimmy Kimmel on his show, calling Sheen her "on-again, off-again lover". 'The Passengers' actor had moved from Los Angeles to the U K around the time his daughter Lily was accepted to college.
