Ginger and basil leaves can be used to treat cold and nasal congestion, turmerics can be used as antiseptics, toothpaste can be applied on light burns, honey and warm water can give relief to dry cough and a series of other symptoms of common ailments and their remedies. Children from villages around Indian Institute of Technology-Gandhinagar (IIT-Gn) learnt things like these while visiting the institute during the weekend. They went to IIT-Gn’s medical camp and awareness mela for neighbouring villages, called “Sanjeevani”, which started on Saturday. The two-day event offers various health services including general health check-up, optical, dental, ENT, orthopaedic examinations and free medicines for villages near to IIT-Gn.
