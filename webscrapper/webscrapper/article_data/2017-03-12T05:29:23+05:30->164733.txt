VADODARA: The greed of earning commission by exchanging   with invalidated notes cost a restaurant owner Rs 22.50 lakh.

 Surendrasinh Chauhan, who owns a restaurant in Subhanpura, had new currency notes worth Rs 22.50 lakh. The police said that he came in contact with Zakir Abdul Nathuji, a resident of Tandalja; Khalid Vaghela, a resident of Gorwa, and one Javed via several of his contacts. Chauhan learnt that the trio have invalidated notes worth Rs 30 lakh.
 
 Police said that Chauhan agreed to take Rs 30 lakh in the form of invalidated notes from the trio and in exchange he will give them Rs 22.50 lakh in new currency. After the terms were decided, they decided to exchange the currency notes in a lane near Pashabhai Park on   on December 26. The police said that they exchanged notes as decided and went home.
 
 When Chauhan reached home, he saw that the accused had given him Rs 1,000 notes of Children’s Bank of India. He went back to the place where the exchange took place but he did not find anyone. “Chauhan did not know the accused, in fact he did not even know their addresses. However, he tried to reach them through his contacts but there was no success,” said a police official.
 
 Finally, when nothing helped, Chauhan registered a complaint with Gotri police station on Friday. 
 
 The police said that they went to the accused’s houses to arrest them but, they are absconding.
