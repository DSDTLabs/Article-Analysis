MANGALURU: It is their gift to Mangalore University that has shaped their lives in its own way. Coming together in this task of giving the 37-year-old university its anthem are music director Guru Kiran, litterateur  , singer   Bhat, lyricist Santhosh Naik, mixer Darryl – all university products. It is their combined efforts that will see the university officially launch its anthem at the University Foundation Day later this month.

 Describing the week long work on university anthem as his way of saying thanks to the university, Guru Kiran told TOI that the effort was spurred by the core line Jnaneve Belaku that writer Amruth Someshwar gave. “Santosh Naik from  , worked on rest of lyrics based on this core line,” Guru Kiran said adding he and Anuradha have given their voice. Local talent Darryl has done the mixing with musicians from Bengaluru and Chennai chipping in.
 
 Noting that he made his foray in to music at the college level and went on to earn his degree from Mangalore University, Guru Kiran said the anthem that runs around 200 seconds is more in to education theme. “We have sent the initial scratch of the anthem to the vice-chancellor K   and a few changes suggested by him incorporated in the final track,” he said adding it is an honour to repay the university with this small musical tribute on an important occasion.
 
 K Byrappa said not many state universities in Karnataka have their own anthem. “Panjab University and Pondicherry University have their anthems. For Panjab, A R Rahman has composed the music and Sukhwinder Singh lent his voice to that effort,” Byrappa said adding the university’s anthem will be released in the presence of R K Sharma, project director, Defence Research Development Organization, either on September 26 or 27, Byrappa said.
