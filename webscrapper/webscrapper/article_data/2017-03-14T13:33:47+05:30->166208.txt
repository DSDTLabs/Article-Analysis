AGARTALA: The state BJP unit on Monday threatened it will launch a vigorous movement against the Leftists in the state for "attacking" its supporters and warned policemen against foregoing neutrality while discharging their duties. 

 BJP state president Biplab Kumar Deb said CPM cadres are assaulting and threatening   in South Tripura and a few places in West Tripura following the party's steady growth. He added that BJP had staged a road blockade at Udaipur in protest against the attack on two of its supporters by CPM cadres at Chhataria village on March 11 when they were celebrating the saffron party's victories in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. 
 
 Hundreds of BJP supporters had taken out a protest rally at Udaipur and blocked the national highway demanding the arrest of the accused. The demonstrators alleged that despite lodging complaints, police did not take any action. Deb accused CPM cadres of killing BJP's tribal front leader Chanmohan Tripura in Gandacherra, raping a tribal woman and assaulting more than 100 workers of the saffron party. 
 
 "More than one lakh voters have supported BJP in the past six months in different parts of the state. The party is all set to install a government in the state in 2018 and after coming in power in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Goa, the people have become desperate," Deb alleged.
 
 He also accused CPM of winning the previous election in the state by manipulating the entire election process with the help of a section of officers in the administration.
