The   was recently witness to the 10-day-long  , and the entire atmosphere was filled with celebration hoopla. The festival, which marks the visit of the Pandavas to   during their period of exile or vanavasa, is celebrated in the Malayalam month of Meenam, which falls in March-April. Towering effigies of the legendary Pandavas, clad in long red robes, are placed at the temple’s eastern entrance. The idols made of wood and fibre glass, provide a visual treat to the onlookers, and it is believed that these colossal figurines are set up in order to please Indra, the Rain God. Right at the front, the eldest brother Yudhishthira, seen in a sitting posture with his right leg on his left thigh, greets the devotees. Bhima and Arjuna follow, the tallest of all, while Sahadeva is the shortest.

 The rituals of the festival also include a folk art form, known as Velakali, which is performed by 101 male artistes dressed in war costumes, who move around in between the huge statues of Pandavas. Rajasenan, a street vendor near the eastern entrance of the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple, tells us, “The classical folk art is believed to enact the war of the cousins. The 101 Velakali players signify 101 Kauravas, and symbolise the battle between Kauravas and Pandavas. The customary practice was stopped in 1941, but revived in 2011.”
 
 With red headgear, garlands made of cloth, and beaded chains around their necks, the artistes performed war-like steps to the beats of Panchavadyam performers. A huge crowd including foreigners witnessed the annual ceremonial event, showcasing skilful swordplay. Angelina McCarthy, a tourist from the US, who was seen taking a selfie with Yudhishthira’s effigy, shares her excitement, “I find these figures great and appreciate the craftsmanship behind them. I learnt that these are historic characters from the people here.”
