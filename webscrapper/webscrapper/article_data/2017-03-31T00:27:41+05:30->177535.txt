Chittoor: The Chittoor police are poised to move a petition seeking the custody of  , companion of   smuggler Lakshmanan, and key to running the gang’s illegal operations in his absence. DSP S A Razzak said Sangeeta’s police custody will help uncover more facts about the international racket spread across six states and countries like China and Japan.

 From an aspiring model to a red sanders smuggler and an arms dealer, Sangeeta’s rise to notoriety has taken the entire nation by surprise. The 27-year-old was earlier married to a pilot, but she separated from him and entered into a relationship with the Chennai-based Lakshmanan. She quit her job as an airhostess and started a career in modelling by working in local TV commercials.
 
 Lakshmanan, who started his career as a full-time mechanic, ventured into red sanders smuggling and amassed wealth over Rs 100 crore. He was arrested by the Kadapa police in 2013 and it was when he was out on bail that he met Sangeeta. When love blossomed, they started living together in Kolkata. They reportedly even got married during their time in Kolkata.
 
 Police claim that Lakshmanan taught Sangeeta the tricks of the trade as he knew he was going to get caught and did not want his empire to collapse. He introduced some of his close aides to her so that they could assist her in his absence. As expected, Lakshmanan was arrested again in February 2016. He later confessed to Sangeeta being a partner in his smuggling activities.
 
 Sangeeta proved to be a capable heir and expanded Lakshmanan’s network further. She allegedly utilised her connections in the airlines industry to smuggle contraband, including illegal arms.
