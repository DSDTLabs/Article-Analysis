NEW DELHI: Two senior bureaucrats — registrar of cooperative societies (RCS) JB Singh and former RCS Shurbir Singh — who had been asked to appear for questioning in the Delhi bank   case by the question and reference committee of Delhi assembly remained absent from a meeting held on Thursday. Chief secretary Anshu Prakash, who had also been summoned, got relief from the Delhi high court from attending the meeting.

 The committee has decided to submit the report of its findings in the upcoming budget session of the assembly where discussions may take place on the issue. “Action will be proposed against the officials who didn’t cooperate in the examination process,” said Saurabh Bharadwaj, a member of the committee, without naming the officials.
 
 The members expressed displeasure over the absence of the two bureaucrats from the meeting, which was kept open for the media. “The officials didn’t even bother to send their subordinates on their behalf even after getting a two-day advance notice,” said Akhilesh Pati Tripathi, another member. “Shortly before the meeting, we got to know that the two officials were on leave,” Bharadwaj said.
 
 After Tripathi raised the alleged   fraud in the assembly, the matter was referred to the question and reference committee for a thorough examination.
 
 The alleged fraud involves sanction of loans of around Rs 100 crore from different branches of Delhi Nagrik Sahkari Bank on the basis of fake documents since 2010. A committee member said that the fraud was detected in audit reports of the bank and also by Reserve Bank of India in 2013.
 
 During the 15 meetings held by the committee, the officials couldn’t give a satisfactory explanation as to why FIRs were not lodged or senior officials informed when the frauds came to light. “The officials didn’t submit any reports sought by the committee during the examination. It seems they don’t want action against those involved in it,” Bhardwaj said.
