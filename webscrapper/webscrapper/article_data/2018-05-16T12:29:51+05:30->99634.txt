KOLKATA: The dates for trials of the electrical systems of the   rakes manufactured by China’s CRRC Dalian have been finalized and technical staff from Kolkata will leave for   in the last week of June.

 The simulated tests are being conducted at a facility in Japan as the electrical systems for the new rakes were supplied by Toshiba. Once the trials are completed, the first rake will start from China for Kolkata by sea.
 
  
 “We expect the rake to start from China in July. Before that, all trials will have to be completed as it would not be possible to send back the coaches if we aren’t satisfied with their performance. Keeping in mind the sensitive nature of these rakes and their advanced components, Japanese technicians have already visited the carshed at Noapara and Kavi Subhash to ascertain the kind of equipment required for the next two years when they will oversee maintenance,” Metro Railway CPRO Indrani Banerjee said.
 
 Metro has 27 rakes at present of which 14 are air-conditioned. With several non-AC rakes showing signs of ageing, Metro is desperately on the lookout for new rakes. Though two rakes did arrive from ICF, Chennai, over six months ago, their trials are yet to be completed. It may take a few more months for these two rakes to be introduced for commercial services.
 
 “At the moment, we require 20 rakes to run 300 services daily. We may start running services on some routes in 2019. For that, we need will be requiring more rakes and are awaiting the arrival of the 14 from Dalian,” another official said.
