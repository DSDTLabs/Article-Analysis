CHANDIGARH: The   on Thursday condemned the   government for increasing electricity duty by 15% with the latest increase of 2% approved by the cabinet in its meeting on March 13. 

 Former minister and SAD spokesperson   also condemned the clandestine manner in which the increase had been brought about, saying this would put an additional Rs 150 crore burden on power consumers. 
 
 "Instead of imposing new taxes, a new tax has been introduced through the backdoor without any announcement," he added.
 
 He said his party would take up this issue in the forthcoming budget session starting from March 20 and also ask why action should not be taken against finance minister   for this arbitrary increase. "New taxes can be imposed only after due discussion in the state budget," he said.
 
 Grewal said the   government had increased electricity duty besides making a 10 to 12% increase in power tariff with retrospective effect from April 2017 earlier as well.
 
  "Domestic consumers are now also being levied fixed charges for electricity consumption whether they consume power or not. This was never done earlier and has added to the burden on the people who are already reeling under spate of unfulfilled promises of the Congress government," he added.
 
 The SAD leader also said the Congress government had withdrawn the 200 unit free supply to backward class community. "The Scheduled caste consumers are also being harassed and forced to pay astronomical bills ever since the Congress government took over the reins of the state". 
 
 The SAD has also expressed their displeasure over the government's project to meter tubewells in the state.
