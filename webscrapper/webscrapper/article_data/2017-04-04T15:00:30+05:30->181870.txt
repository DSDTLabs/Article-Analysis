MUMBAI: The   president   has convened a meeting of all ministers and elected representatives of his party in Mumbai on Thursday.

 When asked about the likely agenda of the meeting, a party leader today said," "Besides (discussing) reshuffle of the Sena ministers in the state Cabinet, Sena president Uddhav Thackeray may discuss rejigging the party organisation and the party's strained ties with its estranged ruling ally the BJP.
 
 "Other major topic of discussion could be about the possibility of the BJP going for mid-term polls in state along with Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh, later this year."
 
 He said that at a recent meeting, many legislators and office-bearers had heated arguments with senior Sena ministers who they blamed for the delay in sanctioning of the approvals for various developmental works.
 
 After that meeting, a delegation of Sena ministers called on Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, demanding speedier clearances to development projects in their constituencies and allocation of funds, the source said.
 
 He said Thackeray is unhappy with the performance of senior Sena ministers like Subhash Desai, Dr Deepak Sawant, Ramdas Kadam and some others.
 
 In recent   elections, the Sena lost all seats in the Assembly segments of these Sena ministers, he added.
