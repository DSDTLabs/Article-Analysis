NAGPUR: Various passenger organizations on Tuesday expressed happiness over union railway minister Suresh Prabhu announcing 20 projects to improve infrastructure and demanded that the initiative should be fast-tracked. 

 Brijbhushan Shukla, chief of   said, though the mechanized laundry project was inaugurated on Tuesday, its fast implementation alone would help passengers. He also said proper implementation of new projects depended on regular allocation of funds. Shukla said the passengers’ bodies submitted to Prabhu a memorandum of demands which included making Nagpur zonal railway headquarters.
 
 Sanjay Dharmadhikari, member of   (ZRUCC), welcomed the introduction of new Ajni to Pune special train. But keeping in mind the rush of passengers, it should run daily. During peak season, private bus operators literally ‘loot’ passengers by charging hefty sums on Nagpur-Pune route. If the train is run daily, the passengers will not be inconvenienced, he added. 
 
 Tejinder Singh Renu termed the introduction of train to Amritsar as great, as members of communities like Sikhs, Punjabis and Sindhis have relatives there. The train will also increase freight transport, he added. 
 
 Blaming the railways for slow pace of work, general secretary of Bharti Yatri Kendra Basant Kumar Shukla said the focus should have been on timely completion of works instead of launching 20 projects in a single stroke as the department generally takes three to four years to get started after an announcement is made. He also said plans to strengthen security at railway stations should have been introduced by the minister as there are several instances of thefts on trains.
