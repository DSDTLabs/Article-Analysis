 leader and former Rajya Sabha member   took to   to apologize for his statement to a television channel that Indians could not be racists as they lived with “black“ South Indians. The comment had sparked off a social media storm since Friday .
 In a string of tweets, Tarun clarified, “My words perhaps were not enough to convey this. Feel bad, really feel sorry , my apologies to those who feel I said different than what I meant (sic),“ followed by , “I feel the entire statement says this -we have fought racism and we have people with different colour and culture... still never had any racism.... Never said what is being interpreted (sic).“
  
  He later added: “I have Tamil, Bengali, Telugu in my family -worked with commitment for Tamil culture, without any politics, collectively with all. I can die, but how can I ridicule my own culture, my own people and my own nation? Think before you misinterpret my badly framed sentence (sic).“
  
  Social media furore apart, there were a few who came to his support, especially bringing to people's attention his years of work towards bridging the gap between upper and lower caste people, as well as spreading the legacy of Thiruvalluvar, the celebrated Tamil poet and philosopher.
