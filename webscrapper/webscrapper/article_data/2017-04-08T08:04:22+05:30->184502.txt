HYDERABAD: City's twin reservoirs,   and  , are brimming but no water is being drawn from them by the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB).

 Consequently, water that could have been used to quench the thirst of parched parts of the city is being lost to evaporation.
 
  had stopped withdrawals from these two reservoirs about nine months ago as the city's water needs were being met with Krishna-Godavari water. “We can draw 45 million gallons of water per day from these twin reservoirs up to June,“ a water board official said. As evaporation losses are higher during April, May and June, at least 10 inches of water is lost everyday. If water board were to utilise this, the water problem in at least a few areas located in the   would be resolved. As of now, a small quantity is being supplied from Himayathsagar to the  .
 
 “We can save a lot of water if we decide to draw from the two reservoirs. Because lower the water level, lesser is the amount that's wasted due to evaporation,“ a water board technical official said.
 
 Another official said: “Water levels in both reservoirs are satisfactory and it can be supplied to various areas in the city. Moreover, if we get good rainfall during monsoon, the water in the reservoirs is released to Musi. That's a terrible wastage of precious water,“ the official said.
