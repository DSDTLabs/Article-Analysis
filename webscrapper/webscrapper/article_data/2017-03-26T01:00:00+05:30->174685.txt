Best known for singing 'Laila' in 'Raees', singer  , 24, says, “It’s undoubtedly a career milestone for me. I didn’t know it’d be picturised on Sunny Leone in   when I recorded it. So I re-dubbed it keeping in mind how Sunny would emote.” The young singer, who wishes to sing a duet with   someday, feels that she is lucky to be offered varied songs like   from 'Phillauri'. Stressing on the Sa Ra Ra Ra song from 'Anaarkali of Aarah', she says, “I want to be a versatile singer. It was the biggest challenge as I had to sing the climactic song in three variations as it is divided into three parts. 

 I was asked not to pay attention to singing but just the characterisation and that’s difficult.” Pawni attributes her career to her vocal guru   as well   and  , who she has trained under. Rikku Rakesh Nath has also played an integral role in guiding her. She will leave for California in June to pursue advanced training in western music. Pawni has also sung for upcoming films 'Julie 2' and 'Guns Of Benaras'.”
