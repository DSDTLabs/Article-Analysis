 These hunting falcons are of Perigon and Lager breeds. It costs Rs 4-5 lakh to train these falcons. While trained falcons come for Rs 12 lakh each. Transmitter and antenna are fitted to them. They keep flying in search of Houbara birds. The Arabs keep moving in their Toyota vehicles according to the signals received. After hunting, the falcon waits with the dead bird and till the owners come. Thereafter the dead birds are kept in deep freezers fitted in Toyota cars. 
 
 It is said that the meat of Houbara bird is very tasty and is aphrodisiac due to which Arab royals every year reach desert areas during winter and Pakistan government is being paid crores of dollars for allowing to hunt these birds.
 
 It is to be mentioned that from 1974 to 1978, the Arab royals came to desert areas in Jaisalmer for hunting. But it met with protests from the local people. Later, the issue was raised in Parliament following which the Government of India imposed a ban on Houbara hunting.
