The shoot of director Suri’s much awaited multi-starrer   is in its final stage, as the team now gears up for the last leg of the schedule. A member from the team tells us that this schedule will involve   hunting down criminals. The shoot will happen in Bengaluru and its outskirts, the Mangaluru harbour,   and Goa. This schedule will see all the lead actors — Bhavana, Manvitha Harish, Dhananjaya and   — on the set together.
The makers have also shared this exclusive picture of Shivarajkumar, which was shot atop a high-rise in Bengaluru, which acts as a precursor to the climax.
