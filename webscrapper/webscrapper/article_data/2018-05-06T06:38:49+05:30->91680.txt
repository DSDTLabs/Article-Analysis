JAIPUR: Men’s contribution to permanent   is just 1.5% in  . To encourage men for sterilisation, the health department has decided to celebrate every third Wednesday of the month as male sterilisation day. The health workers will identify “eligible” males to encourage them for sterilisation. 

 So far only women were opting for permanent or temporary measures of family planning, while a negligible percentage of males contributed in it. In 2011-12, the number of males who opted for sterilisation was 8,140. But in 2017-18, only 1,990 males (till January) got sterilised. Since 2011-12, the number of males opting for sterilisation has continuously dipped. This is a cause of concern for health authorities. 
 
 National Health Mission (NHM) mission director (state) Navin Jain said that all chief medical health officers (CMHOs) have been directed to celebrate third Wednesday of every month as male sterilisation day. Directions have been issued to prepare action plan according to resources available with the CMHOs. 
 
 He said that training will be imparted to doctors and healthcare staff who will conduct male sterilisation. 
 
 The health department staff will start preparation 10 days before the male sterilisation day every month. The workers will spread awareness in their respective areas encouraging “eligible” males to undergo sterilisation. 
 
 This will help health department strengthen its facilities for male sterilisation and encourage males to contribute to family planning. 
 
 The health department provides Rs 3,000 for male sterilization in 14 districts which have total fertility rate (TFR) above 3. In such districts, incentive for female sterilization is Rs 2,000. Besides, in rest of the districts which have TFR less than 3, incentive for males is Rs 2,000 and Rs 1,400 for females
 
 Despite high incentives, the contribution of males in sterilisation is just 1.5%.
