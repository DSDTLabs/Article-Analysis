HYDERABAD: The city has had zero convictions in rape cases in the last two years, with nine cases still under trial in court. There were 157 rape cases recorded last year and 171 cases in 2016.

 The police say it takes nearly a year to get a conviction for a rape case. “There are nearly 20 rape cases in which medical reports are pending with the forensic science lab. It takes over four months to get the final medical report,” said D  , assistant commissioner of police, She Team, speaking about the reasons why convictions take so long.
 
 According to district child protection officer of Hyderabad, conviction rates in rape cases are very low in the city as most of the cases get compromised outside court.
 
 Further making investigation into such cases difficult, most of the victims are not aware that the first 48 hours are very crucial in rape cases. A medical examination must be done within that time period. But, many victims tend to take a bath after the rape occurs. “We lose on technical evidence due to this. There have been cases, where the victim had approached the police almost a month after the incident. In such cases, the   reports do not come in the favour of the victims," the   said.
 
 Soon, there will be a special court for child sexual abuse cases that fall under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act), however, there is no such special court for rape cases. “Trials for rape cases will go on along with other offences. So it takes six months to over a year to get a conviction in rape cases. By that time, the victim compromise outside the court,” Kavitha said.
