LUCKNOW: In a major breakthrough, city police managed to pin down the two youths who executed the killing of 61-year-old   in Saadatganj on February 1. The duo have been taken into custody and are being brought to the city. However, what evidence police have managed to collect against the two culprits was not clear by late Thursday night.

 A team of sleuths from crime branch visited the hideout of one of the assailants in NCR and was bringing the culprit back to the city by road. The two accused are natives of Siddharthnagar and Basti districts.
 
 Though the duo have been involved in some criminal incidents, they were not associated with any ganglord or mafia group in Uttar Pradesh.
 
 It was found that   Ansari’s trusted aide, who also stayed in Indiranagar and visited him frequently, was behind the conspiracy. “We relied on electronic surveillance and flagged the people who interacted with Aqeel over the cellphone in December and January,” said a source in crime branch.
 
 By the time police managed to identify the two key culprits who rode the bike and gunned Sahu down, they had fled the state.
