 The villagers in Thondur near STR were shocked after seeing the bear. “It was looking very rogue and furious,” said K Suresh Kumar, a villager. He said the bear attempted to pounce on them when they tried to chase it towards forest.
 
 The villagers alerted forest officials who with the help of veterinary doctors caught the bear. The doctors treated the bear with vitamin injections and tablets.
