Allahabad: As many as three lakh kalpwasis, including foreigners, are expected to throng the banks of Ganga for the month-long Magh Mela. The devotees, who will start pouring in from January 5, will start their month-long religious and social journey with Paush Poornima snan (January 12).

 With scores of kalpwasis expected at the mela, the administration has made adequate arrangements for their convenience. 
 
 Religious scholar, Ashutosh Varshney, said, “A devotee who undergoes the ‘kalpavas vrata’ is honoured with the title of kalpawasi. They spend their month on the mela premises by living an austere and minimalistic life.”
 
 Mela Adhkari, Ashish Mishra told TOI that arrangements for drinking water and power supply would be made for the kalpwasis, who prepare their meals once a day during their stay on the mela campus. During the kalpwas, devotees will eat 'satwik' and nutritious food as it helps them attain good health and develop immunity.
