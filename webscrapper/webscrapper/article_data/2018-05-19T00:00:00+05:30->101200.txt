Playback singer   is on cloud nine, for he is part of three songs in Rajinikanth’s  . “There is a melody called Kannamma. The duet version is sung by Pradeep Kumar and Dhee, Santhosh Narayanan’s daughter. I have sung the a capella version of this song. In the Telugu and Hindi versions (titled Chittamma and Sajna respectively), there is no a capella version, and only the duet, which I have sung along with Shwetha Mohan,” the singer begins, excitedly.

 He has also sung Urimai Meetpom along with Vijay Prakash. “This is a song that talks about the life and rights of the people. This is the climax number in the film,” he informs. 
 
 Then, there is Thanga Sela, a family song. “Shankar Mahadevan’s is the dominant vocal in the song and he has sung the lines that Rajini sir sings in the film. Pradeep and myself have sung the lines that the other characters sing. It is a galatta number,” he describes. 
 
 The singer says that just as he did with Kabali, music director Santhosh Narayanan gave him full freedom while recording the songs. “He also took the inputs that I provided. This is his greatest quality. I have to thank Santhosh for giving me three different kinds of songs in such a hugely awaited film. I am so glad that he chose me to sing the a capella. I am also grateful to   and Superstar for agreeing to have my voice in the album,” Ananthu signs off.
