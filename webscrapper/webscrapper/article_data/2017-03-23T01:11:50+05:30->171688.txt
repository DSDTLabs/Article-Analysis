NEW  :   will start campaigning for the upcoming civic polls from March 25, DPCC chief Ajay Maken said on Wednesday. 

 Called “Dilli ki baat, Dil ke saath”, the four-phase   will be launched online and offline. The party will hold 200 block meetings as well. “We will kick-start our campaign on March 25 by posting a Facebook live video. We will highlight the disputes and issues the capital is facing due to the incompetency of BJP, which has ruled the corporations for a decade,” said Maken.
 
 He further said that this time Congress will not conduct big rallies but focus on reaching to people in colonies. “The first phase of our campaign will be launched on social media. In the second phase, we are planning to hold block-wise meetings near eateries of Delhi. For instance, we will campaign in the famous Paranthe Wale Gali in Chandni Chowk or the famous chaat shop in Ashok Vihar,” added Maken.
 
 In the third phase of the campaigning, the party will hold meetings at various parks in a bid to connect with morning joggers. “We want to connect with the residents in various colonies. We will also hold meetings with the morning joggers at parks,” said Maken.
 
 In the final phase, Congress will target fruit and vegetable mandis to discuss the issues of vendors. 
 
 Maken pointed out that Congress had released a blueprint on how to make municipal corporations self-reliant. “Senior leaders such as Shashi Tharoor, P C Chacko, Jairam Ramesh, Salman Khurshid and P Chidambaram will be helping the Delhi unit in providing solutions to problems like sanitation, education, health and financial aspects of the municipalities. We will formulate a plan based on their opinions,” said Maken.
 
 The views of the senior Congress functionaries will help create a roadmap for the party if it wins the  , sources said.
 
 “We are confident of getting majority in all the three corporations. We will make cash-strapped civic bodies self-reliant,” added Maken.
