PANAJI: The   football federation (CBF) has decried Flamengo’s refusal to release star striker   Junior for the   in India.
 
  Vinicius, among the biggest attraction at the U-17 World Cup, was scheduled to arrive in Mumbai on Saturday, just days after the Copa do Brasil final. Flamengo lost the final against Cruzeiro on penalties and Flamengo decided it was better for their star man to continue in the Brazileiro – Brazilian top division -- rather than travel to India.
  
  “Yes, it is confirmed, he is not coming,” a spokesperson for the CBF told TOI late on Friday when it became clear that Vinicius had not boarded the flight to India.
  
  TOI had exclusively reported in its Saturday edition that Vinicius had given his flight a miss and was instead training with the Brazilian club.
  
  “The player had the visa to India, we were expecting him for tomorrow morning, but today, Flamengo, after losing the Copa do Brasil final, decided to not allow him to travel," the spokesperson said.
  
  Flamengo’s decision to hold on to Vinicius didn’t go down well with the CBF with technical coordinator   blaming it on lack of common sense.
  
  “I understand that it was important for him to play in the (Copa do Brasil) final, just as it would be important to play in the World Cup. It’s not a friendly one. The world wanted to see him there. Fifa has highlighted it on its website. I told the president that I did not find the decision right,” Gaspar has been quoted as saying by Brazilian news outlets.
  
  Vinicius’s absence from the team will leave Brazil with just 20 players for the U-17 World Cup. Fifa rules stipulate that players can be replaced only if they are injured.
  
  “I told this to the board of directors of Flamengo. I do not agree. I am deeply disappointed by this decision. Attributing a loss or victory for the release of a player for the national team makes me sad,” said Gaspar.
