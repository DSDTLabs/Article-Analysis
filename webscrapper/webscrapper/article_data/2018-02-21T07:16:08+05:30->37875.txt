MUMBAI: A senior American official said his country wants India to ensure that a level-playing field is offered to their companies and products.

 "It is very clear that we are looking for a level-playing field for our firms and products. We are not asking for special treatment, but we want to make sure that American companies and American products have the opportunities to succeed here," said  , US consul general in Mumbai, said here on Tuesday.
 
 The comments come within days of the US President expressing his displeasure over the government slapping high import duty on Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Trump had also threatened to hike import tariff on "thousands and thousands" of Indian motorcycles sold to the US. Trump described that New Delhi reducing the import tariff to 50% from 75% as "inadequate" and asked it to be reciprocal, as the US imposes zero tax on imported Indian motorcycles. Kagan, along with representatives of over 30 American companies, had a round-table discussion with CM   on Tuesday.
