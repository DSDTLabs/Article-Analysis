Visakhapatnam: Seasonal fruits have become the unlikely saviour for denizens during this extreme   season.

 Make-shift watermelon and sugarcane juice stalls are dotting the city. With increased demand, traders are doing good business. Most juice stalls have come up in Poorna Market, Jagadamba Junction, Siripuram Junction, Peda Waltair, Sivajipalem, Seethammadhara, Gopalapatnam, Gajuwaka and Akkayyapalem.
 
 P Sankara Rao, a watermelon trader, said, “The present price of the fruit is between Rs 10 and Rs 15 per kg. Size and quality tend to influence the rates.”
 
 Health experts too vouch for the benefits of eating seasonal fruits. “Watermelon in summer season can control flow of fluid in the body, which is lost due to sweating and dehydration. Eating watermelons in summer can control the risk of sun strokes,” said health experts.
 
 According to K Srinivasa Rao, one of the wholesale marketeers of watermelon in the city, said apple melon, yellow queen and yellow king are the new watermelon varieties which have been received well by the people.
