It was earlier announced that the   -   starrer film 'Godha' will hit screens on May 12, Friday.

 On May 6, the team announced that there is a change of plans because of the Rajamouli magnum opus 'Baahubali,' which is still ruling theaters of the State. The movie's director Basil Joseph wrote on his social media page, "Hello friends :) First of all thanks to each one of you for your support till now for our movie Godha , we know so many of you are waiting for it to hit the screens as soon as possible. We are also so excited to share our little baby with you all. Unfortunately on May 12th, we didn't get good theatres both in quality and numbers, especially screens with Dolby Atmos,due to the epic Baahubali."
 
 The director says the team is not embarrassed of it and have no complaints ,as they understand the effort of so many people and cost of such a movie. "It should get the reach it deserves and everyone should watch it too. So, we are pushing the release date of Godha to May 19th , for a better and wider release with more than 100 screens in Kerala. We once again thank you all for your patience and support and so sorry for making you all wait for another week. Hope you all understand and stand by us for the best," says the young director.
