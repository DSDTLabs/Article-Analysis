AMARAVATI: The   has resulted in a new problem for   —   for the new ministers in the secretariat at Velagapudi in Amaravati. According to highly-placed sources, five ministers cannot have chambers immediately and will have to function from home for some time. 

 Top sources in the government said that Lokesh has got a chamber while   officials are rushing to create space to accommodate the new ministers. At least three conference halls are being converted into ministers’ chambers. 
 
 The secretariat building at Velagapudi was designed with chambers for 26 ministers. But a few of them were merged after some ministers complained of lack of space. At the time, space was arranged for the 20-member cabinet. Now that the cabinet has been expanded to its full strength of 26, officials are finding it difficult to provide chambers to six ministers. Sources said it would take at least a fortnight to get the new chambers ready.
 
 “Most ministers who have chambers are occasional visitors to the Secretariat and are mostly touring their constituencies. So this will not create any problem,” said a leader close to one of the new ministers.
 
 Sources said the intelligence and security wing of the CM wants Lokesh to take one of the chambers in the CMO block. But Lokesh wants his chamber out of the CMO as he feels it could inconvenience his visitors.
