PUNE: People looking to buy a house in the city may have to shell out more in the   as Ready Reckoner (RR) rates are   here.

 In Pune district, the hike in rates will be below 10%, elected representatives who attended a meeting with chief minister   on Wednesday, told TOI. For the rural areas, rates are expected to go up by 10-11%, they added.
 
 The government will announce the new   on Friday, which will come into effect from April 1.
 
 In the meeting, the chief minister assured the elected representatives that the hike in RR rates will be moderate. “The earlier proposed hike was above 15%, but it will now remain below 10% for Pune city,” they said, adding that property registrations have come down after demonetisation and a spike in RR rates will hit the realty marker further,” an elected member who attended the meeting said.
 
 Senior revenue officials had earlier hinted that the rates will go up, but the hike will be imposed keeping the present market scenario in mind.
 
 Presently, the registration department has achieved only 80% of the target revenue collection for the state. For Pune city, it is only 65% of the target. As per the registration officials from Pune city, the total number of documents registered till March 23 stood at 2,50,401 amounting to Rs 2,787.12 crore as against the target of Rs 4,255 crore.
 
 The likely increase in these rates has failed to cut ice with the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai). They body has repeatedly pressed the authorities not to increase the rates. Its members had put forth their representation that the government should maintain a status quo. They had met the IGR officials requesting to not increase the rates.
 
 The RR rates directly affect property prices as the buyers as well as the sellers have to pay a stamp duty based on these rates.
