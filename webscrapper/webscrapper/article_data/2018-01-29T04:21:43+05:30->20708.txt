KOLKATA: City residents on Sunday hit the streets to spread awareness on the dangers of Kolkata’s declining air quality index.

 The march organised by Kolkata   (KCA) — an umbrella body for several green organizations campaigning for city’s better environment — witnessed hundreds of concerned citizens, including schoolgoers, university researchers and elderly citizens demanding proactive solutions to air quality issues. All participants wore masks and told passersby how particulate matters of size 2.5 microns are so tiny that there is no filter, available in the market, which can prevent them from entering the lungs through windpipe. “Their placards read: ‘Be part of solution, not pollution’, ‘We share a common dream of making Kolkata one of the most liveable and climate friendly cities in the world’, and ‘Don’t smoke your future,”said Gari Maitra of KCA.
 
 Ajay Mittal of Global Shaper said, “As a proud Kolkatan, I can’t accept the ‘world’s most polluted city’ tag. None of us are immune to the hazardous effects of air pollution. It is important for all of us to take immediate measures to prevent ourselves from exposure to such pollutants. All of us have to play to bring back breathable, fresh air.”
 
 Environment NGO Switch-ON’s founder,  , said, “The march will follow a sustained campaign to drive policy level actions and on-ground action, especially involving youths. We need to stop pollution at sources. At the same time, we must adopt more sustainable lifestyles on an individual level as climate change is the biggest threat to mankind today.”
 
 Kolkata’s air quality has reportedly become one of the worst in the world. It is high time that some drastic action is taken to tackle air pollution, said   of Switch-ON.   Network country director (India) Karuna Singh said, “We joined the Clean Air campaign with the conviction that it will rally people together for actions to reverse the negative air quality.”
