PUNE: The Alankar police on Tuesday night booked a police inspector, who is attached to the Satara police and stays in the city, for rash and negligent driving resulting in injuries to two elderly persons in the parking area of a housing society in Erandwane.

 The incident took place around 10.30pm on Monday when a substantial number of people had gathered in the housing society for a ‘Palkhi’ ceremony and a bhajan-kirtan programme.
 
 Senior inspector   on Tuesday said, “None of the injured persons or the organisers of the programme had come forward to lodge a complaint. We have taken a suo motu action in the incident.” 
 
  of Akkalkot, one of the organisers of the Shree Swami Samarth Palkhi Parikrama, said, “Two devotees —   and   — sustained minor injuries. We do not want to lodge a complaint with the police as it is a minor incident.” 
 
 Bhosale said there were nearly 90 devotees present on the premises of Samruddhi Apartments, a MHADA colony, at the time. “The devotees were sitting in the parking area when the inspector drove-in in his private car. His car accidentally hit two devotees who sustained leg injuries,” he added.
 
 Bhosale said, “The two injured, who were taken to a private hospital nearby, were discharged at around 11.30pm. However, there was some commotion after the mishap as the inspector instead of apologizing to the injured abused the devotees.” 
 
 The inspector went to his house after a brief argument with the devotees. When a TOI reporter tried to contact the inspector on Tuesday, he was not available for comment.
