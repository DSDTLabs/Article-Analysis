NOIDA: Over 250   of   Kingswood, a residential project in   (Greater   West) have lodged complaints with chief minister   on his public grievance redressal website, jansunwai.up.nic.in, in the past two days. 

 Buyers claimed that they lodged the complaints against the builder after construction at the site was put on hold for a considerable period.
 
 The project was launched in 2011. Kingswood is a part of Amrapali Golf Homes and was launched in three phases, with a total of 2,000 apartments in the project. The project was supposed to be delivered between 2014-2017. 
 
 “We are seeking clarity on the promises made by the builder. We want to know whether the plan is sanctioned by the GNIDA, and when the flats will be handed over to us,” said Arun Kalra, coordinator for the Kingswood Buyers’ group.
 
 Ankit Rastogi, another buyer, who has lodged a similar complaint on the CM’s portal, said his complaint has been acknowledged by the site and he is now seeking a reply from the builder on the subject. “We need to know the reasons for which the project has not taken off beyond a certain point. We are looking for a commitment from the builders on the issue,” Rastogi said.
 
 “The project has been delayed because of Patwari land acquisition issue. We are working on an execution plan for the Kingswood project by opening escrow accounts,” Shiv Priya, executive director of Amrapali Group, told TOI.
