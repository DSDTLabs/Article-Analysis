NEW DELHI: Love in the air is okay, but not rudeness say Indian flyers. A study on   by  , one of the world’s biggest online travel firms, has found that Indians are tolerant of “flirting singles” and “amorous couples”, but detest rear seat kickers, “boozers” and loud passengers.

  claims a majority of 
  to be seated in a “quiet section” as they “dread sitting next to someone who talks too much on a flight”.
 
 “According to  , when sitting next to someone they do not know, 65% of flyers often engage themselves in conversation and talk during the flight. 
 
 Sixty-two per cent of north Indians feel comfortable talking about religious or political topics and 45% of them strike up a conversation and won’t stop. In case of a ‘passenger misbehaving’, 75% of them would alert the flight attendant, suggesting that Indian flyers are among the last ones to ignore such incidents.
 
 They are also more helpful... with 69% of them helping others with their luggage and 63% of them offering seats to fellow passengers,” said  , marketing head, Expedia in India. 
 
 The pan-India survey finds “passengers are particularly considerate to the crew and generally follow regulations.”
 
 The things that annoy Indian flyers the most are: “rear seat kickers”; disruptive passengers who have had a drink too many; flyers who talk loudly or listen to music at a high volume; inattentive parents who pay no attention to their “crying, whining” children, queue jumpers who rush to deplane, neighbours who start a conversation and don’t stop, passengers who recline their seats all the way back the moment the plane gets airborne, “armrest hogs”, those who have either not used deos or used too much perfume, those who get food with strong smell on board and “undressers” who remove shoes and socks.
 
 “Single and ready to mingle” flyers and “amorous couples” drew the least frowns. Expedia conducted this study based on 1,002 interviews of Indian adults aged over 18.
