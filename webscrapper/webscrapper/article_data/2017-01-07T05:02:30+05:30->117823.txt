The   on Friday demolished a portion of Bandra’s   China restaurant which they claimed was unauthorized. Civic officials said that the restaurant had encroached upon open space. 

 Assistant municipal commissioner (H west)   said that though more than 50% of demolition was done on Friday, the work had to be stopped as the owners of the restaurant procured a stay order against the action. 
 
 Neville Vazifdar, who operates the restaurant, said, “The civic officials came and demolished the structure in a barbaric manner. We will regularize the restaurant soon.” However, the eatery’s owners said that only the portion near the gate had been demolished and the restaurant was left untouched. 
 
 Hotelier Farhan   came out in support of the restaurant. “There are so many illegal structures in   and yet, the BMC chose to demolish this only, despite a stay from the court. Many politicians are known to dine there, weren’t they aware of the illegalities?” asked Azmi on a social networking site.
