Ludhiana: Daba police have booked two men — Varun of Tibba Road, and Montu of Brota Road — for allegedly thrashing a former co-worker — Saurav (30) of Jujhar Nagar — with baseballs and iron rod on July 2 near Ishar Nagar bridge on Sidhwan Canal, under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restrain), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC on Wednesday.

 In his police complaint, Saurav said the accused were his former colleagues who had developed a rivalry with him. On July 2, while he was returning home on his scooter after office hours, the accused chased him on a bike, and stopped him near Ishar Nagar Bridge, after which they thrashed him with a baseball and iron rod. Saurav’s bag — containing Rs30,000 in cash, checkbooks, important documents, and three mobile phones — fell down, which he suspects is with both the accused. Further, Saurav also alleged that when he managed to flee from there, the accused gave him a chase, and again thrashed him near Gill village.
 
 Investigating officer from Daba police station, ASI Jageer Singh, said Saurav had given a complaint on Wednesday, and the police registered an FIR.
