Actors often go to great lengths to lend authenticity to their roles.   is no exception. The actor literally went the whole nine yards to play a sari salesman in Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari’s slice-of-life film, ' ', scripted by   (writer-director of ' '). Rajkummar, who visited sari stores in Mumbai and Lucknow to learn how to drape a sari, reveals, “There are two facets to my character in the film — one of a salesman at a sari store and the other of a writer. Besides visiting sari showrooms, I spent five days visiting several shops in Lucknow, too, and learnt the way they speak in  . The salesmen were patient while teaching me how to drape a sari. I realised that it’s quite a task that needs expertise. The way sales people conduct themselves and establish a rapport with customers is unique too. I’d observe them for hours to pick up their nuances.”

 Not shying from admitting that all this prep-work has only increased his respect for women, the actor adds, “Now I say that women should take as much time as they need to dress up, because it’s not easy. In all probability, you might not get it right the first time around, which I figured the hard way. My sister and sister-in-law do it quite fast and I actually asked them how they have been managing it for so many years.”
 
 So, how much time does he take to drape a sari now?   replies, “I’m still not as fast as the sales people working at the stores. They have years of practice. However, I can now offer my help to anyone who needs to drape a sari.”
