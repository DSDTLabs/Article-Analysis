 His father Madhukar is employed with the panchayti raj department.
 
 As per police reports, at around 3pm, Madhukar got a call from Anuj’s phone. Anuj told his father that five youths had stopped him on the way to school and bundled him in a car.
 
 “His phone call snapped suddenly and later was switched off when I tried to contact him,” said Madhukar.
 
 A worried Madhukar called his brother-in-law Munna Lal for help. Munna called the police.
