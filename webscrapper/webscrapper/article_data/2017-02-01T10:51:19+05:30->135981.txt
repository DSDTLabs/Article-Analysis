PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The   ( ) in Pimpri Chinchwad suffered yet another setback ahead of this month’s municipal elections. Anna  , former MLA from Pimpri, resigned from the party. He is likely to join either the   or the Shiv Sena. 

 Bonsade is the latest in a long list of leaders and corporators to leave the NCP. 
 
 Most had joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Over the last three days, five corporators had quit the party — Balasaheb Taras and Maya Barne on Saturday, and Rajendra Jagtap, Shatrughna Kate and Vinayak Gaikwad on Monday. All five are likely to join the BJP. 
 
 Last month, former city unit president and former mayor Azam Pansare had joined the BJP in the presence of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. In November last, independent MLA from Bhosari, Mahesh Landge, also joined the BJP along with five NCP corporators.
 
 Back in October 2014, Chinchwad MLA and former mayor Laxman Jagtap had switched allegiances just before the assembly elections. Now, as the BJP city unit president, Jagtap is calling the shots. 
 
 In the face of all these defections, NCP leader and former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar is putting on a brave front. “We will win with a brute majority, just like we did in the municipal elections in 2007 and 2012,” Pawar maintained.
 
 And it is not just the NCP, but Shiv Sena too recently lost one of its leaders to the BJP. Former Shiv Sena MP from Maval Gajanan Babar too had joined the BJP earlier this month in the presence of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Pune district guardian minister Girish Bapat.
 
 However, this has not gone well with a section of leaders within the BJP, who have claimed this to be an opportunistic move by leaders from other parties.
