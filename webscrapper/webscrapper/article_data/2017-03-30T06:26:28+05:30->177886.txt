RANCHI: As panic spreads among the city’s meat sellers over their livelihood, the   (RMC) on Wednesday said it will float two separate new licences for slaughterhouses and meat shops. While one licence will be given for culling animals the other will only permit the sale of meat.

 RMC CEO Prashant Kumar told TOI that the civic body is also preparing to operationalize a “state-of-the-art and hygienic” abattoir in Kanke to meet the city’s daily need of goat meat. “The new abattoir is being set up with Italian technology in Kanke. It will have the capacity to cull 1,000 goats a day. The abattoir will have a separate selling point for customers. All other unlicenced meat shops will be closed down,” Kumar said.
 
 The Rs 15 crore facility will become operational by the end of April, Kumar added. However, there is no clarity at this moment on whether there would be a separate facility for chicken and pig meat sellers.
 
 Meanwhile, the state government on Wednesday issued advertisements reminding meat-sellers that they are only to set up shops and slaughterhouses in specific areas identified by civic bodies under the Jharkhand Municipal Act, 2011.
 
 However, the state capital’s civic body does not have any notified area for such activities (despite being empowered under Section 310 of the Act) simply because “no one approached it”.
 
 “We have given licence to nearly 100 meat shops. However, no one approached us for a slaughterhouse and we did not feel the need to identify an area before this,” Kumar said.
