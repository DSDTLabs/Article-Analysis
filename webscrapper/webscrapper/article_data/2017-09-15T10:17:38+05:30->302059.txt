CHENNAI: A total of 33,487 schoolteachers are participating in the ongoing strike by government employees union, and their boycott of classes and absence will be treated as unauthorised, the   government informed the Madras high court on Thursday.

 “The period of absence has been declared as unauthorised absence. Disciplinary actions would be initiated as per rules... Arrangements have been made to engage trainee teachers and [mem bers] of parent-teacher associations to conduct classes,“ the government said when the case came up for hearing before Justice N  .
 
 The judge, who had on Wednesday censured teachers for boycotting classes and participating in protests, on Thursday said the court was not against legitimate protests but it cannot tolerate stirs when interest of children is affected.
 
 “Will the teachers boycott classes if their own children are studying in government schools,“ Justice N Kirubakaran asked. The judge made the observations after recording the submission of the government that it had initiated appropriate action against the protesting teachers and that they would face a pay cut for the days they boycotted work.
 
 Through a counter affidavit, the school education department also submitted that 33,487 primary school teachers had not reported for duty on Wednesday, and that six recognised unions along with other unrecognised unions were leading the protests by the teachers.
