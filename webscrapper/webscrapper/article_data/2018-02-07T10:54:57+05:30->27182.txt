PUNE: Admissions to the 25 % seats reserved for students belonging to the economically weaker sections of the society, under Right to Education ( ) Act, is set to begin across Maharashtra on February 8. The admissions will be conducted online, and this time, the state education department has developed a mobile application for parents to fill the forms.

 A two-day pilot run of the online admission system is already under way in the   district, said Shara Gosavi, the deputy director of primary education. “During the pilot run — on Tuesday and Wednesday — the income certificates would be linked to the Aadhaar cards of the applicants. This linking process and other technical aspects of the online admission system would be tested over a period of two days,” added Gosavi.
 
 Based on the feedback from Ahmednagar, online admissions would start across the state from February 8. 
 
  
 Gosavi said, “There has been a slight delay this time in making the admission forms available to the applicants because of the new system of linking the Aaadhar card with the income certificate. However, the system is now in place and we are ready to go online.”
 
 Meanwhile, there has been a considerable rise in the number of schools registering for the RTE admissions from Pune. Last year, as many as 849 schools had registered and 15,693 seats were available for beneficiaries. This year, 929 schools have registered and 16,354 seats are up for grabs. If the state figures are to be considered, as many as 8,979 schools have registered for the system and a total of 25,543 seats would be available.
