BENGALURU: The indigenous light transport aircraft (LTA)   on Wednesday completed the second of its proposed 20 test flights under Wing Commander UP Singh, Group Captain RV Panicker and Group Captain KP Bhat of the Aircraft and System Testing Establishment (ASTE). 

 The first successful test flight of the aircraft developed by the National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) was on January 24.
 
 The production model design is expected to be ready by June-July this year. CSIR director-general   said the cost of development and certification of Saras-Mk2 will be around Rs 600 crore with a time period of about 2-3 years.
 
 Union science and technology minister   said the military version will be certified initially, followed by the civil version. He said Saras will be at least 20%- 25% cheaper than any imported aircraft in the same category. The improved version will be a 19-seater aircraft, instead of 14-seater.
 
 "The unit cost of the aircraft, with more than 70% indigenous content, will be around Rs 40 crore to Rs 45 crore compared to Rs 60 crore and Rs 70 crore for the imported one, with far more benefits," he said. 
 
 The minister added that it would be ideal for regional connectivity under the Centre's Udaan scheme.
 
  (HAL) will be the production agency for the military version and civil version will be produced by the private sector. India needs 120-160 aircraft in this genre - both civil and military versions - in the next 10 years. 
 
 ASTE Commandant Air Vice Marshal   said: "IAF fully supports this programme and the design and configuration of the new version of Saras will be frozen soon."
