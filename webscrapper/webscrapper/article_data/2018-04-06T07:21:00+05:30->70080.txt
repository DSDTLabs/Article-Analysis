GHAZIABAD: Residents of   are up in arms against the opening of two   shops in a convenience complex meant for the needs of a residential society.

 Earlier, the liquor shops used to be at some distance from the residential colonies, but now two shops have been given licences to operate in the convenience complex of Mahagun Mascot society.
 
 Women in the group housing society have taken a lead in staging   in front of the two shops. The complex houses boutiques, grocery and medical stores, mostly frequented by women and children. The new liquor shops have raised security concerns for them.
 
 Mamta Dhiman, a resident of the society said, “A large number of outsiders have started frequenting the complex which caters to the needs of the residents. Liquor shops should not have been allowed here.”
 
 The residents welfare association of Mahagun Mascot has written to the district administration highlighting violation of rules in granting licences for operating the shops.
 
 Nishant Joshi, secretary, RWA of the society, said, “According to the rules, no liquor shop can be given licence in close proximity to a place of public resort, school, hospital, place of worship, factory or at the entrance of a market or residential colonys.”
 
 Excise inspector R K Singh said, “There is no violation of rules as far as liquor shops are concerned. However, keeping in mind the inconvenience being caused by them, we have asked the shop owners to shift out of the complex at the earliest on moral ground.”
