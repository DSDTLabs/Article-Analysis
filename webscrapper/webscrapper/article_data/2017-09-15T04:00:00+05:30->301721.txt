Vadodara: The attempt by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) to conduct online auction of shops in various housing schemes of the civic body has evoked no response. The civic body is now looking to conduct a public auction.

 The VMC has constructed 182 shops in different housing schemes in various areas of the city. The shops are part of the affordable housing as well as Mukhyamantri Gruh Yojana projects.
 
 A proposal in this regard states that besides being in different localities, the shops are also on roads with different width. Some such shops are located on the ground floor while in some other complexes they exist even on the first floor.
 
 The civic body also made the policy for allotting the shops and it was decided that priority should be given to those persons whose shops were razed during drives across the city. Accordingly, 10% shops were reserved for such persons. Later, it was decided to go in for an online auction of the shops.
 
 But till August 8, no bids were received online for the shops and it was decided to conduct a public auction using traditional means. The VMC administration has also sought that two standing committee members should be appointed for the process. The standing committee cleared the proposal on Thursday.
