AHMEDABAD: Mumbai jeweller Birju  , who became the first person to be put on India's no-fly list recently, on Wednesday, approached the special court trying   ( ) cases seeking temporary bail to attend his ailing wife.

 Salla submitted in his plea that his wife—Ishika Salla has been diagnosed with uterine tumour that needs to be operated soon. He has asked for bail for around 30 days to attend her. In his temporary bail plea Salla has submitted that he is the sole member of the family able to look after his ailing wife as his parents are elderly and his two kids, aged eight and four, are too young to attend their mother. “Doctors have advised to conduct the surgery at the earliest to save his wife’s life and for that the applicant (Salla) needs temporary bail,” said the plea.
 
 The court has posted the bail hearing on Thursday.
 
 Salla, facing life imprisonment, is the first person in the country to be booked under the Anti-Hijacking Act after his threat note aboard a Mumbai-Delhi flight in October 2017 sparked a hijack and bomb scare. He had allegedly placed a chit containing a threat in a dustbin in the plane’s toilet. The threat led to an emergency landing at Ahmedabad airport, following which he was booked by the authorities.
 
 Investigations by the NIA later revealed this was Salla’s desperate attempt to revive a relationship with an employee of the airline.
