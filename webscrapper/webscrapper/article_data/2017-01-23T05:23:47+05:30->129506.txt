KALYANI/BALAGAR: Fear writ large on her eyes, the 75-year-old   does not want to stay in this country even for a day more. Her worst nightmare is over, so is her will to stay back home.

 She had relocated to the US after spending six decades in  . On her return, the septuagenarian and her disabled daughter were left at the mercy of a mob.
 
 On Saturday, irate villagers from West Bengal's   assaulted the NRI, her daughter and their driver with sticks and rods suspecting them to be child-lifters. They stripped the daughter and molested her before looting valuables.
 
 “We had gone to meet a relative when the assault occurred. We pleaded with folded hands. They hit us with stones and punched on our faces,“ the woman said from her hospital after receiving nine stiches on her head.
