MUMBAI: Can Hindu Rashtra Sena chief   be charged with conspiracy to   on the basis of a hate speech he delivered five months before the lynching of a   Muslim   by a mob in 2014? The Bombay   on Thursday said it will decide the issue while admitting Desai’s petition challenging a trial court order refusing to drop charges against him. 

 “Indisputably Desai was not present when a group of 15-20 persons were discussing about killing persons from the Muslim community,” said Justice Anant Badar. “The court will have to decide whether a January 2014 speech that Desai delivered in a public meeting will amount to meeting of minds (with the co-accused and co-conspirators) after a period of five months in the offence of commission of murder and attempt to murder,” added the judge.
 
 An oral plea made by Desai’s lawyer seeking a stay on the trial or stay of proceedings against him was rejected by the court. Justice Badar allowed Desai’s lawyer to make changes in the application to seek interim relief pending the hearing of his petition.
 
 Mohsin Shaikh was beaten to death on the night of June 2, 2014, by a mob of 30 to 40 people, alleged to be HRS members in Hadapsar, Pune, when he was on his way home after offering evening namaz. The police had traced the rioters from their abandoned motorbikes, which had HRS stickers on them. The mob was reportedly protesting objectionable posts on social media against Chhatrapti Shivaji Maharaj and late Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray. Desai was booked for the murder conspiracy as he had allegedly delivered an inflammatory speech, which police claimed led to the rioting.
 
 Desai’s lawyer Sanjeev Punalekar said he was not present with the mob and the police could not use a five-month-old speech as evidence against him in the murder case.
 
 Additional public prosecutor Arfan Sait opposed the discharge application.
