New Delhi/Ranchi: The   hopes to begin implementation of   of the   worth Rs 3.10 lakh crore signed during the global investors’ summit –   – within the next two months. 

 The state’s industry secretary Sunil Kumar Barnwal said in Delhi on Sunday: “We want 172 MoUs to translate into actual investment in a year’s time and 10 projects should kick off in April and May. The pace of investment flow should pick up in the subsequent months.” 
 
 “During the next 12 months we are targeting those MoUs work on which could begin fast. So we have identified 172 investment agreements entailing an investment flow of Rs 80,000 crore. But large investment proposals over Rs 50,000 crore which are contingent upon availability of mines, huge land acquisition and forest clearance would take more than year to materialize,” Barnwal added.
