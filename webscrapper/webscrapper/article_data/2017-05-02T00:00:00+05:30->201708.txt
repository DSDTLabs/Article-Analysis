 Music In Bengaluru 
 “Bengaluru is home to one of the best crowd for live music in the country. For the past few years, there has been immense growth in the music field here. Not only are the musicians open-minded, even the people want to hear new stuff and have evolved to become more receptive. Slowly but surely, we are probably going to be the best hub in the country for music. There are a lot of positive signs,” says Gurbax.
 
 People’s Reaction To Bass
 “Bass is a blend of global and desi music. I add a tinge of  ,   and local musical influences to my brand of music, making it sound very eclectic," says MojoJojo. Gurbax adds, “When bass was first introduced in the country, people couldn’t make much of it. But they gradually started welcoming it, because after a point, it got frustrating for music lovers to listen to the same music every place they visited. Bass grew out of the desire to listen to new and different.”
 
 Risk Taking In Music
 “Whenever there is something new in store, everyone wants to experience it, which is how bass music got its fame. To be at the forefront, you should have the courage to take risks. In music, risk-taking comes in the form of making songs that are provocative. It should make people sit up and take notice,” says MojoJojo.
