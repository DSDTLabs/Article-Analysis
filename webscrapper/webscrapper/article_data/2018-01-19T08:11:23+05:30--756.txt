AHMEDABAD: The   (AMC) got another rap from the  , which wanted to know the   damaged during the last monsoon. The court asked whether there was anything “vibrant” in the AMC’s road repairs project.

 The AMC and metro rail authority promised the court that roads along the metro route would be repaired within 15 days.
 
 The high court was miffed at the civic body for not following its instructions to repair the roads along the metro rail routes. The high court dismissed the brief note presented by AMC and said, “It prima facie appears that there is no progress and/or little progress so far as motorable roads in the city are concerned. Even roads just adjacent where metro rail work is going on, though assured earlier, they are also not made motorable.”
 
 Officials of the Metro-link Express for   and Ahmedabad (MEGA) assured that court that they would make all roads adjacent to metro rail routes motorable, by resurfacing or patchwork, within 15 days.
 
 Chastising AMC for its sluggish pace of road repair, the high court asked why it cant’ find better contractors. It told the AMC to “go national” with tenders to find a proper construction company.
 
 Putting aside the AMC’s report on the status of roads, the HC directed the municipal commissioner to submit a detailed report on main roads as well as connecting roads. There should be a zone-wise report with three categories – badly damaged, damaged and not-so-damaged roads. The commissioner is asked to place the report by January 30 on whether these roads require resurfacing to make them motorable.
 
 The high court summoned the chief town planning officer to know how much time the authorities would take to sanction road construction work in villages included in AMC limits in 2007. The court also questioned why the 2007 Draft Town Planning Scheme has not been implemented in the newly-included villages. The HC inquired so because during last hearing it asked AMC to speed up road construction in such villages.
