CHENNAI: "Our fight for democracy will continue in the Supreme Court," said DMK working president M K   on Friday, after the Madras high court dismissed pleas to disqualify 11 MLAs and to order the speaker to remove a portrait of former chief minister J   from the state assembly.

 If the high court thought it could not interfere in the 11 MLAs anti-defection act case as well as having a photo of a person (J Jayalalithaa) convicted in the wealth case, it should have at the start itself dismissed the case, he said. The plea seeking the disqualification of the 11 MLAs, including O Panneerselvam, was filed by DMK whip R Sakkarapani.
 
 With regard to the plea by Triplicane legislator seeking a direction on the removal of Jayalalithaa's portrait, Stalin said. "Jayalalithaa was the first accused in the wealth case and was convicted by the Supreme Court. In this case too, the court has refused to interfere. When the court has decided not to interfere in both the cases, why were both judgments delayed for so long," said Stalin. "People ask why the court reserved the judgment for such a long period when it had decided it was not ready to interfere in the speaker's powers. Based on the queries raised by the people and also on our belief in judiciary, our fight will continue in the Supreme Court."
 
 The   has questioned the discrepancies in the verdicts on the powers of assembly speakers. While a bench headed by Chief Justice of Madras high court quashed the   assembly speaker's order on the three nominated BJP MLAs, it has preferred to dismiss the petition filed against the inaction by the Tamil Nadu speaker in the 11 MLAs case and the other that sought removal of Jayalalithaa's portrait from the state assembly. These discrepancies have raised eyebrows as the judiciary's functioning should be beyond doubts, said CPM state secretary   in a statement.
