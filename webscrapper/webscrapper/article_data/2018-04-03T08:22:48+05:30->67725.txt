AHMEDABAD: A man identifying himself as a  , has reportedly thrashed one Satish Parmar, 24 — an Amraiwadi resident — at the behest of a woman named   of the same area. The assailant, who had a revolver holster clasped to his belt, arrived with Kesar’s son Mukesh. He first thrashed Parmar and then egged Kesar on to beat him with a stick. 

 “Satish is innocent. Moreover, he has kidney problems and undergoes dialysis,” said Ashok Rathod, a local resident. When Parmar went to lodge a complaint against Aahir and the so-called cop, he was urged to work out a compromise.
 
  “Cops told us to think it over before lodging a complaint,” Rathod said. “We want to know who that man was.”
 
 While the buzz among some local residents suggests that Pamar used to tease Kesar’s daughter, Rathod said that the reason for the attack could be a quarrel between Kesar’s son Mukesh and Parmar, which had occurred about a week ago.
 
 “Somebody had broken the handle lock of an auto owned by Kesar’s son Mukesh,” Rathod said. 
 
 “Mukesh created a ruckus to which Satish had objected. Hence Kesar and Mukesh called the man who identified himself as a cop,” he added
 
 While Rathod says that they had approached Amraiwadi police station to lodge a complaint, the inspector of Amraiwadi police station, Odhar Desai, said no one had approached the police station in the matter.
