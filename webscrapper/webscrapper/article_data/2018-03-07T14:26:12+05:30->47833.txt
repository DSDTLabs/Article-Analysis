PATNA: The   on Tuesday directed the   ( ) superintendent to file a counter affidavit within two weeks, stating reasons for not installing three costly ventilators and instead keeping them in the storage unit of surgical ward for over two years.

 The court has also sought the superintendent’s explanation on why a  , used for cardiac patients, has also been lying unused at the medicine ward of PMCH for over two years.
 
 While the imported ventilators, manufactured in South Korea, cost around Rs 7 to 12 lakh each, the TMT machine comes for around Rs 2 lakh, according to activist Vikash Chandra alias Guddu Baba on whose PIL the court has sought the PMCH superintendent’s explanation.
 
 The PIL, filed on February 20, came up for hearing before the division bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice Rajeev Ranjan Prasad for the first time on Tuesday.
 
 Chandra said the three ventilators and TMT equipment had been kept unused in violation of an earlier HC ruling on January 19, 2015, that the PMCH must get all its medical equipment installed. That PIL was also filed by Chandra.
 
 The PMCH had earlier submitted a counter affidavit, saying its 276 equipment were functional, while 151 equipment were non-functional due to several reasons, including lack of spare parts or breakdown.
 
 Chandra told TOI it was a matter of investigation whether or not payments were made to the suppliers of the ventilators and TMT equipment. “The hospital administration can release funds for any equipment only after it is installed and its working certificate issued by the HoD concerned,” he said.
