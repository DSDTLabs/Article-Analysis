AGARTALA: Having vacated the CM’s residence after Left’s defeat in the   polls,   is now living — along with his wife  , a retired central government employee — in a two-room flat above the   party office here. Sarkar, who doesn’t have a home of his own, preferred not to stay at the MLAs hostel. 

 “The party office has the basic minimum amenities. This is nothing exceptional. Most of our leaders lead a simple life,” Tripura CPM secretary Bijan Dhar said. 
 
 Sarkar, who had donated his ancestral property to his sister, had lived in the party office earlier too. Sarkar’s wife owns real estate in the city but landed in a controversy after handing it to a builder. Construction of the building is yet to be completed.
 
 CM-designate   said Sarkar, as a former CM, is entitled to “good government accommodation” and other “protocol amenities”. The leader of the opposition, too, will get the status of a cabinet minister and be entitled to perks. “Other MLAs can put up in hostels.” 
 
 “We may have been elected to run the government, but I feel Sarkar and his team have a big role to play in pursuing our dream of a new Tripura. BJP never equates government with the party,” Deb said.
 
 While some ex-ministers are moving into MLAs hostels, three others are moving back to their villages.
