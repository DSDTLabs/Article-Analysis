 Shetty’s 'Golmaal Again' seems to be on a record-breaking spree ever since its release was announced last year. From breaking the record in pre-release ticket sales to becoming one of the highest grossers of 2017, the big-budget family entertainer has reportedly been on top of most lists. The fourth instalment of the successful filmmaker’s popular franchise became a sensation at the box-office and it has now gone ahead to break a record on satellite television. 

 The movie has reportedly become the biggest   premiere on television. Rohit says, “All my films, be it the 'Golmaal' series, 'Singham' and ' ' have done extremely well on television.
 
 The main reason for this is the large family audience that we cater to and the immense love they have given to all my films.”
