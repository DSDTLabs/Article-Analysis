Coimbatore: A 37-year-old woman from Ariyalur was   for questioning after she attempted to sell her 15-day-old baby boy to a couple at Velandipalayam here on Friday. The couple was also detained. 

 According to the Childline officials, the woman had an extramarital affair. She gave birth to a baby boy in Ariyalur government hospital 15 days ago. She approached many people in the hospital to sell her baby. However, none came forward. 
 
 Meanwhile, one of the patients in the hospital informed a couple at Velandipalayam about the woman’s plans to sell her baby. The couple showed interest in buying the baby for Rs 2,000.
 
 The woman with her baby boy waited for the couple in city on Friday morning. The couple contacted Childline number 1098 and enquired about adoption procedures. Growing suspicious, Childline officials traced the address of the couple with the help of anti-human trafficking unit of the city police.
 
 The officials subsequently rescued the baby boy from the couple’s house. The baby was later produced before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) which ordered to send the baby to Saranalayam, a home for children at Kinathukadavu. 
 
 The police, meanwhile, detained the mother and the couple for further investigation.
