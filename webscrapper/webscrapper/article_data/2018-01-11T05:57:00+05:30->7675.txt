Nagpur: The murder of BJP’s youth wing vice-president Atul Deharwal (31) in east Nagpur may be a fallout of an old business rivalry, his close friends have claimed.

 Deharwal was found murdered on Monday in the forest adjoining Dodiya Borgaon in Saunsar tehsil of Madhya Pradesh. He was supposed to get married on February 7 with a woman from MP.
 
 Lodikheda police of Saunsar tehsil rounded up the main suspect for questioning on Tuesday. Sources said the suspect came to the deceased’s place in Satranjipura and took him on a four-wheeler.
 
 Deharwal told his family that he would return in sometime.
 
 Deharwal close friends told TOI, “A few years ago, Atul’s younger brother Pankaj alias Golu started a hotel at Wardhaman Nagar in partnership. Later, the duo split up and the business partner started his own hotel at a different location. But the chefs, who were brought by the latter, decided to continue with Pankaj. As a result, there were major fights between them many times. That time, Atul intervened and sorted out the matter.”
 
 The prime suspect, who hails from Chhindwara, was a close friend of Atul’s partner, but joined hands with Pankaj. Since the last one year, the suspect and Atul developed good friendship, following which the deceased told him to handle financial matters. The suspect also looked after Atul’s property business.
 
 Sources said Atul’s business partner and his accomplices are absconding since the incident.
