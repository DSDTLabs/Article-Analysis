JAMSHEDPUR: Nearly 300 candidates, who had applied for the job of a home guard, marched to chief minister Raghubar Das’s camp office in Agrico on Monday here, demanding participation in the selection process which was being denied because they did not possess the   or domicile document. The demonstration held up peak-hour traffic for hours and inconvenienced travellers on the very first day of the week.

 Monday being the last day of the physical test for the home guard’s job, the candidates were left with no choice but to march to the CM’s camp office with the demand that they be given a few more days to arrange the document and to allow them to take part in the physical test in the mean time. 
 
 The intervention of the chief minister’s camp office provided relief to the demonstrating candidates, who were assured that they were eligible to take part in the recruitment process. “We were informed by DC Amit Kumar that we would have to submit the document in 10 days and that we could take part in the physical test,” said  , a candidate.
 
 The DC also assured that the district administration would work overtime to make sure the aspirants were not denied an opportunity for want of a domicile document. 
 
 When the candidates reached the camp office, deputy SP Animesh Nathani advised them to meet the DC. “It was a now-or-never situation for us as Monday was the last day of the physical test,” said Amit Kumar, an aspirant. 
 
 The DC explained that the   was not mandatory in March 2016, but following the implementation of the revised domicile police in July, the document has become compulsory. 
 
 “The candidates have been asked to give an undertaking that they will submit the required documents within 10 days,” said  , company commander, home guard division, Jamshedpur. 
 
 There are over 800 vacancies for home guards and the process of filling them up started a few months ago.
