PATNA:  , who resigned as chief minister of Grand Alliance government on Wednesday evening, staked claim to form the next government with NDA support at the stroke of midnight and the oath taking ceremony at the Raj Bhavan, which was initially planned for 5pm on Thursday in presence of PM Narendra Modi, was preponed to 10am just to thwart RJD, the single largest party in the 243-member Bihar assembly with 80 MLAs, from staking claim and avoid any rebellion in JD(U).

 Sources said the ‘hurry’ was because of discontent within JD (U) over Nitish’s decision to join hands with BJP, with Yadav, Muslim and dalit communities strongly opposing the move. They said the way Nitish resigned by putting blame on graft accused Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and then joined hands with BJP was not in the right spirit. 
 
 The anger was evident in the tone and behaviour of the MLAs from JD (U), who still have sympathies for Lalu family. “Everyone has right to raise his or her voice in a democracy and we did the same. We informed our leadership that JD (U) joining hands with BJP will harm the secular image and also give RJD an opportunity to attack the party as betrayer. No one was ready to listen to us,” said one of the “rebel” JD (U) MLAs on the condition of anonymity. 
 
 One of the MLAs, who opposed the move of Nitish till Wednesday night and pleaded not to target a young neta like Tejashwi, said majority prevails in democracy, but it does not mean that they will keep quiet. However, in public, all JD (U) netas said, “Hum neta aur patry ke nirnay ke sath hain”.
 
 Former minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav, a close aide of Nitish, however, said there was no discontent within the party over the issue. 
 
 JD (U) MLC and spokesman Sanjay Singh too claimed that there was no dissent in the party. “We handed over a signed letter of all the MLAs of the party to the governor when Nitish ji staked claim to form the government. So, where is the question of dissent? The party is united,” he said.
