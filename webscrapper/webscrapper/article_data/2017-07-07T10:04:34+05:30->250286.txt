VADODARA: Two crocodiles were rescued by animal activists and forest officials from   taluka since Wednesday.

 “One crocodile was seven-feet long and another was eight-and-half feet. They lived the pit and head towards the lake. Locals complained about the forest officials. We laid traps in the lake to catch the crocodiles,” said  , who along with Ketan Raval and forest officials caught the reptiles.
 
 “One of the crocodiles was caught on Wednesday night while another one was trapped on Thursday morning. The forest officials have released them safely in another water body,” Wadhwana said.
