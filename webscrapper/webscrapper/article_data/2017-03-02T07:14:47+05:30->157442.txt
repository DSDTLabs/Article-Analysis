KOCHI: After police failed to locate Pulsar Suni's (alias  ) phone on Wednesday, the   (SIT) has now shifted its focus to   on the route taken by the accused the night the actor was   in a moving vehicle. 

 SIT found visuals of the accused from CCTVs along the national highway. The visuals include that of the Tempo Traveller heading towards Thrissur from Ernakulam and later following the actor's car from Koratty. The visuals in Vennala were from a petrol bunk and a supermarket.
 
 "The van which rammed the actor's car is seen following her vehicle in some of the   collected from the highway," said an officer. 
 
 Sources said that police scoured buildings in Vennala for CCTV footage as the actor had given a statement that the vehicle was halted at Vennala for a while. 
 
 "The footage from Vennala showed that the accused exited the vehicle, bought a bottle of water, then jumped into the vehicle and sped away," said a senior police officer.
 
 Senior officers within the city police said they were forced to rely on cameras installed at private buildings as the 99 cameras installed by the police in collaboration with Keltron were dysfunctional. 
 
 Meanwhile, police also found a witness in Kochi who gave a statement that could save the face of SIT, which is yet to find Sunil's phone. A restaurant owner told the police that the accused had stopped by her place on February 23 before he was caught by the police. "The woman gave a statement that she remembered the accused as they had visited her restaurant. They had asked her if she know a spot in the lake that had fast currents," said a police officer. SIT believes that this statement is enough to justify why the search team failed to locate Sunil's phone. Senior police officers meanwhile said that the investigation in Coimbatore was progressing.
