HASSAN: The war of words between JD(S) and   leaders in   Hassan has virtually divided villages. Supporters of both parties are trying to stop opposition candidates from entering their villages.

 
 At Hangarahalli village in Holenarsipur taluk, villagers dug up the main road and constructed a mound to stop Congress candidate   from entering the village.
 
 It all started on Friday morning, when Manjegowda decided to campaign in the village. But JD(S) activists opposed his visit, saying their village is full of JD(S) supporters. When Congress supporters decided to continue, JD(S) workers dug up the road using JCBs.
 
 A few JD(S) activists kept the party flag on the mound and shouted slogans in favour of party candidate  . Finally, police rushed there with additional forces and ensured Manjegowda could enter the village.
