CHENNAI:   such as   under the   (PDS) has been erratic across the city, consumers say.

 People who depend on the public distribution system rice and dal, say ration shops only sell tur and urad dal in the first week of each month. When they ask   about the lack of dal, the standard reply they receive is that these pulses are in short supply, consumers say.
 
 Kolathur resident B Gnanasekar said he went to the PDS shop on Paper Mills Road, TT Thottam, where he makes purchases from, a few days ago and bought 5kg of raw rice, 5kg of boiled rice, 5kg of wheat and 1Â½kg of sugar.
 
 "We get these items only if we purchase tamarind, soap or pulses," he said. "The PDS shopkeepers force us to buy these items. According to the rules, PDS shops should sell us 10kg each of raw rice and boiled rice but they do not do that."
 
 He said PDS shopkeepers, without embarrassment, sell rice to restaurants, hotels and cafeterias for a higher price in front of their regular customers. "This has been causing shortages for the past two months," Gnanasekar said. But shopkeepers say they are not to blame for the shortages.
 
 "Officers don't know ground realities," a   said. "We face the wrath of the public. Customers abuse us when we tell them that there is no stock of pulses."
