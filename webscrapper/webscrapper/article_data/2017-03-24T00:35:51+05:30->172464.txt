New Delhi: Sir Ganga Ram Hospital has decided to keep its general and private   on Friday.

 Dr D S Rana, chairman, board of management of the hospital, said the decision has been taken following concerns of Indian Medical Association (IMA) and Delhi Medical Association (DMA) regarding the safety of doctors. “Our inpatient as well as emergency services will function normally,” he said. Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute and some other hospitals have also decided to close OPDs. However, hospitals like Fortis and Apollo said they will remain open.
 
 “We strongly condemn the act of violence against the clinicians, caregivers and the hospital staff…We are firmly committed to our patients, and our medical services remain unhampered as our clinicians continue to serve the community,” said a statement from Fortis Healthcare.
