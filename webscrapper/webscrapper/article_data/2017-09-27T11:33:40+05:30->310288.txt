LUCKNOW: The revered Durga   and Chal Chitra (backdrop) in   this year have been designed exactly the way they were at the inception of the puja here 103 years ago. 

 For every year since 1914—the year the first Durga Puja was organised at Bengali Club—the idol has been identical.
 
 During the centenary celebration of Bengali Club’s Durga Puja in 2014, however, the organising committee decided to make modifications in the structure and backdrop. That continued in 2015 and 2016 too.
 
 “The backdrop of the idol was made more elaborate with intricate design and gems and stones. Even the size was increased,” said club president Arun Banerjee.
 
 The alterations, however, were not welcomed by all members. “Many elders said practices and customs of Bengali Club shouldn’t be changed,” Banerjee said. 
 
 “We reduced the size to the original and even slight changes in design were undone. This year’s Durga idol is exactly the way it was in 1914,” said Banerjee.
 
 “The young generation may get fascinated by flashy themes but for us, customs are most essential,” said Shubhash Mitra, 67.
 
 Jyoti Basu, a retired teacher, said, “For decades, even the expressions on the goddess’s face have remained unchanged. I wasn’t happy with modifications. I am glad it’s been brought back to its original look.”
