MUMBAI: Last Sunday, winners of the annual cricket   organized in the Jawhar taluka of   district did not go home with a trophy or   money. The winning team got a  , the runner-up five roosters and those who hit fours and sixes a boiled egg for every strike. Spectators who caught the ball also landed an egg each.

 The idea was the brainchild of coach Umesh Tamore, who convinced the tournament committee that cash creates tension and leads to fights among players.
 
 “Every year   matches are held at the Rajiv Gandhi stadium in Jawhar with prize money of Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh,” Tamore told TOI.
 
 Despite the no-cash policy, 14 teams came forward to participate in the tournament. Each paid Rs 1,000 to the organizers. The tournament committee comprising six members, including Tamore, chipped in with Rs 1,000 each.
 
  While the teams played the five-over matches, the goat was kept tied at some distance. Darya Sagar Mitra Mandal that won the tournament posed with the goat. Team captain Manoj Prabhu said, “The prize was unique. We are now waiting to feast on it.”
 
 Royal Teacher 11 took home the second prize and had a tough time managing the five roosters they won. “They are not a bad deal,” said captain Anil Kangne, a teacher.
 
 While both players and the audience were served vegetable pulav for lunch, everyone shared the boiled  . “In the past we have experienced allegations of rigging and fights over prize money. This time, all willingly shared their prizes,” said Tamore.
 
  Thane Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) president Shakuntala Majumdar said while gifting an animal was not legally wrong, “ethically and morally we are against gifting animals as there is no way of knowing how they would be treated and where they have been procured from”.
