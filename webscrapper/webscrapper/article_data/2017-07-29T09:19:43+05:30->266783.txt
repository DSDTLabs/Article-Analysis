LUCKNOW: Projecting   as the central point of India's socio-cultural evolution, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Aditya Nath   on Friday said that some people hate even the name of Ram despite knowing that it would be chanted after they die. 

  "Kuch log Ram ke naam se chidhtey hain...ye jaantey hue ki mrityu ke baad Ram Naam Satya Hai hi bola jayega...," Yogi said while speaking on the last day of the   at the Vidhan Parishad. The CM said that the people who hate Ram have not only ignored Ayodhya but were also responsible for the reign of terror in the temple town for the past many years. 
 
 Taking potshots at the Samajwadi Party (SP), Yogi said that the followers of Lohia should realize that their ideologue's name too started with Ram (Ram Manohar Lohia). "It is only after the BJP government came to power that Ayodhya got basic facilities like regular power," the CM said. He said Ayodhya was a matter of "aastha" (faith) for him, irrespective of his political stature. "I cannot give up on that belief." 
 
 The CM said that the BJP government always strived for equality which can only be ensured through "rashtravaad" (nationalism).
