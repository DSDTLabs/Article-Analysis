HYDERABAD: Timely intervention by alert youngsters, who were playing on the road, landed a chain-snatcher in police net at   on Wednesday. 

 Kushaiguda police said that Ranga Lakshmi, 46, went to a grocery store near   temple in Kushaiguda. While she was purchasing groceries, a man came to the shop on the pretext of purchasing cigarettes. Suddenly, he laid his hands on Lakshmi's chain, snatched it and was fleeing from the location. 
 
 When the victim and a few others raised an alarm, a few youngsters who were playing on the road chased the culprit and pinned him down. The police said the culprit snatched a 2.5-tola   chain and tried his best to fell from the location. 
 
 "We will disclose the details of the accused on Thursday since we wanted to know whether he was involved in any previous snatching offences too,'' police personnel said. Kushaiguda police and Malkajgiri Central crime station officials were questioning him.
