KOCHI: "We describe India as a liberal and democratic society but these values will go down the drain if we do not remain vigilant. This is the lesson that India should take from   and its recent past," said former secretary to the president of India and chairman of KSIDC, Christy Fernandez. He was speaking at the launch of the book 'My Driver Tulong and Other Tall Tales from a Post Pol Pot Contemporary Cambodia' written by former civil servant M P Joseph here on Tuesday. He lauded the ability of the first-time author for his ability in recreating the minute details of life in Cambodia." Joseph's book is exceptional because it is a labour of love. The fictional element in the book is so real that it confuses the reader. It reminds one of  's autobiography 'Outsider', which the author claimed was a work of fiction," said Ambassador T P Sreenivasan IFS. The book is a fictionalized travelogue set in Cambodia where Joseph spent seven years on a UN assignment.

 Sreenivasan added that there were many instances in the book, where Joseph forgets Cambodia and delves into seemingly disconnected events in world history. Events like St. Thomas' visit to   and the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi were effortlessly woven into the book.
 
 "The people of Cambodia have lived through one of the world's worst genocides during the  .My book is but not about the killings or the genocide. It is about the new Cambodia, its young people and their vibrancy," said Joseph, while introducing the book.
 
 Bose Krishnamachari, renowned artist and curator of the  , and noted actor and ad-filmmaker Sijoy Varghese received the first copies of the book.
