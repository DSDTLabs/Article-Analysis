CHARMINAR: With an intention to generate employment for economically backward youth across the twin cities,   has come up with a new designer food cart called, “Bheema Alphahara”. The carts will serve hygienic food for the people in both cities.

 “Bheema Alphahara” (food carts) are expected to be distributed among financially weak sections from March this year. Vendors and 7th passed candidates will be preferred. They will be trained on hygiene and food preparation techniques.
 
  Mir Inayath   told TOI that the newly designed food carts were being introduced for jobless youth and they would be distributed among needy and financially weak persons. Setwin has currently planned 600 food carts, for serving hygienic and healthy food.
 
 “We are planning to create a source of income for those without jobs, and to train the present food vendors about serving hygienic food to their daily customers. First preference will be given to street food vendors," said Ali Baqri.
 
 He added that candidates would be provided dresses, caps, and gloves, as well as necessary advice and guidelines during the training period. However, Setwin is going to have separate kitchens for supplying food on these carts as well.
 
 “Setwin will give six days training to selected candidates on maintaining cleanliness and serving hygienic food on these carts. The   will be prepared somewhere else and the food will be supplied through a food van to people in the twin cities," added Ali Baqri.
