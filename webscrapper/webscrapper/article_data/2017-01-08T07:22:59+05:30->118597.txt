CHANDIGARH: All was not well after the thundery development on Friday evening as it led the city into darkness. Starting from Friday night till Saturday evening, the centralized complaint centre received nearly 2,000 complaints related to power outages. Broken branches and water seeping into underground electric wires and breaking of electric wires led to long power cuts.
 
 Nearly 750 complaints were received in the night and on Saturday morning, more than 1,000 calls were received.
 
 According to   officials, the city reeled under hours of power cuts because of technical faults that occurred due to the rain and hail.
 
 The most affected areas were sectors 2, 3, 9, 11, 15, 17, 19, 22, 23, 32, 36, 37, 38, 43, 44, 45, 46, 49, 52, 56, Burail, Manimajra, Dhanas, Maloya, Industrial Area, and  . There was no electricity in these areas for three to four hours. In some places in the city and Zirakpur, power was gone for the entire night.
 
 "Every time there is a thundery development, power cuts return. Why don't they change the wires that face technical snag every time it rains," said  , a resident of Sector 46. "The light was coming and going all through the day," said Inderjeet Kaur, a resident of Sector 47. "The power went off around 1pm and returned only after 4pm but later the voltage was low," said  , a resident of Khuda Lahora.
 
 "The problems are always temporarily fixed. The joints in cables are temporary and are not of much use," said a member of UT Powermen Union. "Also there are only three to four men at night who have to cover many areas which further leads to a delay," he added.
 
 A senior official from UT electricity department said, "The power cuts were due to technical snags caused due to the rainfall."
