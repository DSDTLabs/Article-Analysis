Visakhapatnam: CBI officials had registered a case against the assistant general manager and other staff of State Bank of Indiaâ€™s Tanuku branch in West Godavari district on December 31 for allowing private companies to withdraw over Rs 2.49 crore cash on a single day in violation of RBI guidelines. The assistant general manager was identified as KV Krishna Rao.

 Following registration of the case, cops carried out searches in the residential premises of the accused and seized several incriminating documents including Rs 2.11 lakh cash. A probe is underway into the incident.
