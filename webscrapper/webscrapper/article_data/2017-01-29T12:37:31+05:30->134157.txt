Supermodel   has revealed that she used to keep tight-lipped about her relationships as a teenager because she thought her parents would tell her off for having boyfriends.
 
  The "Keeping Up With the Kardashians" star has opened up about feeling so mortified about telling mother   and her father Caitlyn - formerly Bruce Jenner - of her relationships because she thought she would get told of.
  
  In a new post for her blog, she wrote: "My dad didn't really know I had a boyfriend! Even though my mom had an idea, I was really weird about telling them because I thought I'd get in trouble."
  
  
 
  
  However, the 21-year-old model said she is "glad my parents trusted me enough to let me have a good high school experience."
  
  The brunette beauty, who previously had an on/off relationship with One Direction's  , is reportedly seeing rapper A$AP  .
