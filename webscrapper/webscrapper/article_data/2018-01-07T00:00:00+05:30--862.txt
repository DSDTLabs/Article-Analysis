With   being declared ‘The   2018’, it’s safe to say that bold purple lips are going to be huge in the coming season. While you may have mastered the art of wearing those predictable pinks and reds, it’s time to experiment with edgy violets that happily fall in between tropical shades, and a more autumnal palette. “Purple is a versatile colour because it can be worn anytime, any season, and on any skin colour. It can be bright for spring time, vampy for the winter, neutral for all-time casual looks,” says beauty guru  . 

 The trick lies in picking the right shade. Women with a darker complexion can go with a purple lipstick with a metallic sheen finish or plum shades to complement their skin, while fair-skinned ladies can try berry lips or cool, blue-based shades. 
 
 Not just lips, use the colour in your eye make-up too like a violet liner or eye shadow. The basic rule: Highlight only one feature on your face – your eyes or lips.
