Coimbatore: The city corporation and traffic police department removed nearly 200 unauthorised advertisement hoardings from DB Road and TV Samy Road here on Sunday. But, they ignored the hoardings set up by political parties. The civic body not just failed to remove them, but also did not take any action against those erecting them. A team of corporation engineers and traffic cops had launched the drive around 8.30am. Deputy police commissioner Sujith Kumar told TOI that they have decided to remove all unauthorised hoardings in the city and have allotted one day every week for the drive. “These advertisement boards obstruct traffic and cause congestion. We had imposed one sided parking in various roads but because of these boards, we were unable to implement it,” a senior officer said. Next week, Raja Street will be cleared of the unauthorised hoardings, he said. The violators have to pay Rs 300 as fine for erecting them. Also, 30 companies involved in erecting the boards were booked under the Tamil Nadu Open Places (Prevention of Disfigurement) Act. The boards were pinned to electric posts, police parking poles and on streetlights. Meanhwhile, when TOI asked why political hoardings were not removed, police and civic body officials were silent. Activists said that a few months ago, a youngster had lost his life after hitting an arch erected by a political party. “There was a lot of hue and cry, but no action was taken against the violators. Cases were also filed but nothing has changed as the hoardings reappeared within a few days,” said RTI activist SP Thiyagarajan. Secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Cause K Kathirmathiyon said that 99% of the hoardings erected across the city are in violation of norms. “As per the rules, hoardings should be erected 10feet away from road margins and 100feet away from junctions. Unless political hoardings are removed, a strong message cannot be sent to the violators. The rules should be the same for everyone,” he said.
