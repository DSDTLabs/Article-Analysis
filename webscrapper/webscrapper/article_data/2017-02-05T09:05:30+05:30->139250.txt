BHOPAL:   is among top two states to get highest fund allocation in railway budget for 2017-18, but residents of Bhopal or those travelling to Bhopal or in Bhopal division have little reason to feel happy about. All that the capital got in the budget is handful of money or 5-year plans and sanctions for 7 foot over-bridges at stations, doubling of a railway line and camtech design pit line at   coaching depot. 

 According to passengers in division, the railway budget is more of a formality this year.
 
 "Many things could have been sanctioned to capital division in Madhya Pradesh in railway budget. But it seems that   received the lowest," said  , member,   (DRUCC), Bhopal division. He said, "Bhopal is a link between two parts of the country, North and South. It sould have been treated properly with new trains and new railway lines. Pune and Nagpur should have been directly connected from Bhopal as there is already traffic on route of Itarsi and other stations from where passengers take trains to south states." As per the budget, Madhya Pradesh got Rs 5,376 crore in railway budget. Of this, Rs 720 crore has gone to Ratlam division.
