MUMBAI: After failed talks with government officials in the past few months for action against illegal fee hikes, parents from various schools in the city plan to reach out to other parents to participate in a protest at   on May 21.

 Parents' groups from schools in Mumbai are sending bulk messages through social media to reach out to more. “Several parents are unhappy with the fee hikes and corresponding services in schools. But the government does not seem to take action against any . They have only made assurances,“ said  , president,  , an NGO fighting the hikes. The   plans to send out two lakh messages to parents urging them to join the protest.
 
 The parents are demanding government intervention to ask schools to roll back fee hikes, stop selling uniforms and stationery and conduct financial audits of schools' accounts books. Recently , the government formed a 11member committee to review the state's fee regulation act and suggest amendments. Parents' organisations, however, termed it an eyewash.
