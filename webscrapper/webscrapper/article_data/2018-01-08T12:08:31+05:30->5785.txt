 The Goa Volleyball Association will organise the Senior Division Volleyball League later this week at Ponda, despite a freeze on all volleyball activities by the  .
 
  The GVA has been locked in a battle for control of the sport with two factions – one each led by   and   – claiming they have the necessary backing. While Soares is the current president, Vaz has claimed a majority of the 11 registered clubs elected him as the president.
  
  SAG executive director   called both factions together and asked them to refrain from organising leagues of their own till accounts were submitted.
  
  However, the Soares faction announced a state volleyball league during a press conference in Ponda on Sunday.
  
  “We have   volleyball championship next month in Kerala and we need to conduct selections to finalise the squad. It is imperative that we hold the league,” Soares told TOI.
  
  The National championship will be held in Kozhikode, Kerala from February 21-28.
  
  “The SAG wanted us to keep the league on hold and submit accounts which we have already done. Only two years were remaining but that’s because the previous secretary (Santosh Bandodkar) did not submit the vouchers and bills. A letter has been submitted to the SAG. There is no restriction on conducting the league,” he added.
  
  Bandodkar is now the secretary of the Richard Vaz led faction.
  
  The GVA has partnered Hi Tech to organise the league and interested clubs have been asked to submit their entries before January 10 to Raghuvir Shinde, Louis Pires, Hugo Gonsalves, Ram Dhawaskar or Anand Gaonkar (Sattari).
  
  The league will commence on January 11 while the final has been scheduled for January 20. Matches will be played on a knockout-cum-league basis.
  
  A selection committee has been appointed to handpick probables during the championship.
