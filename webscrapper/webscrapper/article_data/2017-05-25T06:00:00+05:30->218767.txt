Captain of Indian Womenâ€™s   team,   and former Indian cricketer   were the chief guests at this afternoon soiree. Conversations about cricket and the incessant summer heat in the city ensued as mana socialites bonded with the chief guests and had a gala time clicking selfies and bonding over a lip-smacking spread. It was an 
afternoon well spent indeed.
