CHENNAI: For the second day in a row, the Madras high court censured government authorities for their insensitive approach towards freedom fighters pension scheme, saying that the valuable service rendered by such fighters could not be dealt with lightly.

 Justice R  , appalled over the manner in which applications for such pensions are dealt with by authorities, said: “Freedom fighters’ service to the nation is immeasurable. Had they not fought for freedom, we the 1.2 billion Indians could not live with liberty, rights, dignity and economical sufficiency. If any small amount is paid to them by way of freedom fighters pension either by the state government or central government, it is not a bonus or bounty to such great soul, as it shall be considered only a token of recognition for the valuable services the great personalities rendered to the nation.”

 Noting that grant of pension to political sufferers or freedom fighters, who had rendered their valuable service in getting freedom to this great nation, cannot be lightly dealt with, by anyone in this country, Justice Suresh Kumar then directed the central government to provide the 30 years of pension arrears that ought to have paid to freedom fighter K P  , (who died in 2002, without ever tasting the benefit) to his legal heirs.
 
 According to the petition, Muthiah had involved in the freedom struggle, for which, he was imprisoned for six months in   and   in 1945.
