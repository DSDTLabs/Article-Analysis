KOLKATA: The state government wants to revive airstrips of   vintage in the districts that have been lying idle for decades to increase intra-state air connectivity. There are a dozen such airstrips in the state that were used by either the   or   between 1942 and 1945.

 To begin with, the government has identified the   in Chharra, Purulia, and wants to develop a small domestic airport on the 300 acres thatâ€™s available. The proposal was discussed at a meeting chaired by chief secretary Malay De at Nabanna on Friday along with officials of transport department, PWD, land & land reforms department and finance department.
 
 The state public works department (PWD) has been asked to conduct a survey and prepare a detailed project report. The closest airport to towns in Purulia and Bankura is Ranchi located around 130km away.
 
 Purulia district magistrate Alokesh Prasad Roy, who also attended the meeting, said there was no encroachment at the site. To bring the airstrip back in operation, the landing strip needs to be strengthened into an all-weather runway and a small terminal building and ATC block needs to be set up.
 
 The government is yet to decide whether it will develop the facility in partnership with a private party or allow the latter to undertake a greenfield project like Kazi Nazrul Islam Airport at Andal.
 
 The other disused World War airfields are in Asansol, Hijli, Chakulia, Piardoba, Dhubulia, Garbeta, Guskara, Jhargram, Kanchrapara, Pandaveswar and Salboni.
