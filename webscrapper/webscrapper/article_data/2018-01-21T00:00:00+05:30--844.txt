Duniya Vijay’s son, Samrat, 12, is poised to make his big-screen debut in the actor’s upcoming outing, Kusthi. A fitness freak, who is well versed in various martial arts, Vijay has been planning a film based on such a premise for a long time. “I came up with a one-line concept for a stunt-based film during the shoot of Jhonny Jhonny Yes Papa and discussed it with director  . Later, when we zeroed in on the director —  , who has been an associate on Mr and Mrs Ramachari and Raajakumara — the three of us developed the story further. The script demanded the presence of a young boy. I asked   if he would play the role and he jumped at the offer. It was as if films were always on his mind and he was just waiting for me to ask him,” says Vijay. Samrat, we hear, also has a keen interest in martial arts and sports, and is very disciplined when it comes to fitness. “My father is with me all the time while training for the film. I’ve learnt taekwando,   and gymnastics from him,” says Samrat. So, how is it training with his disciplinarian father? “He is strict when it comes to workouts, but is extremely friendly once we’re done,” the youngster tells us. Kusthi will see Vijay bulk up like never before for his role, while Samrat is set to play a young kusthi champion.
