PUNE: A 19-year-old youth from   was arrested for allowing his 14-year-old nephew ride the family's scooter and also for having put fake number plates on the vehicle. The minor boy's father, who purchased the scooter, has also been booked. 

 
  
 
 "This is the first arrest in the city for allowing an underage child ride a scooter," said assistant commissioner of police (traffic) Prabhakar  .
 
 The police said the arrested youth and other members of the family have been using the scooter with the fake number plates for the past eight months since the vehicle was purchased. They replaced the original number plates with fake ones after failing to get a vanity (special) number from the regional transport office (RTO).
 
 Dhamale said the boy was stopped by the police at Chandni chowk on May 3 while he was on the scooter. "Sub-inspector Subrao Lad and police constables Tanaji Nangare, Avinash Gopnar and Kiran Pawar found that the boy did not have a driving licence and other documents. They arrested his uncle and booked the father for allowing him to use the scooter," he said.
 
 Dhamale said when the police checked the scooter's registration number with the RTO, they found another scooter was registered with the same number. "That scooter-owner had all the documents. The minor's parents were summoned. The Warje Malwadi police are questioning them over the fake number plates and for allowing their minor son ride the scooter," he said. 
 
 Warje Malwadi police sub-inspector A V Kadam said their investigations revealed that the boy's family wanted a number of their choice for the scooter just like they had for other vehicles that they owned. "When they did not get the number they wanted, they simply painted it on the number plates," he said.
 
 Kadam said the boy's uncle has been booked under section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Motor Vehicle Act.
