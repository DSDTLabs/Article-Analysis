Quepem: A 65-year-old woman was charred to death while attempting to douse a fire in her field at Padi village in Quepem on Thursday. Jayu Laxman Velip, a widow and resident of Subdalem, near Barcem in Quepem taluka, was working in her field on Thursday morning. Later, at around midday, she set fire to the dry grass. Seeing that the fire was going out of control, Velip attempted to douse it using a small branch. However, due to the windy conditions, her sari accidently caught fire. Later that evening, some boys who had gone to the cashew plantations nearby saw her charred body.  The boys informed the villagers who in turn brought the issue to the notice of the Cuncolim police before rushing to the spot. “Only her face was slightly recognizable,” a villager said. The police reached the accident scene and conducted the panchanama. Cuncolim PI Sudesh Naik said that Velip’s body has been sent for a postmortem, which will be conducted of Friday.
