CHENNAI: Traffic was restored to normal on Monday on   at Thousand Lights, almost 19 hours after a cave-in on Sunday on the arterial road, due to   rail tunnelling work, left behind a large crater into which an MTC bus and a car had plunged.

 The traffic police opened on the stretch, opposite  , in a gradual manner.
 
 Police officers first opened the road to autorickshaws and two-wheelers, around 9.30am, after a 2.1 metre stretch was repaired.
 
 They opened the section of road to cars and buses in the afternoon.
 
 A senior officer from the police traffic enforcement wing said, “At 2 pm, cars and MTC buses were allowed to use the stretch after the approval of   (CMRL) officials.“
 
 Metro rail officials had debris and loose soil scooped out out of the crater and poured concrete grout into it.Once the concrete set, workers fixed steel plates over it before police permitted vehicles on the stretch.
 
 A few motorists remained wary of driving over the spot where the road caved in.Some of them hesitated to drive over the steel sheets and stuck to the narrow strip of tarmac near the median.“A few people got off their motorbikes and pushed them past the spot,“ a traffic inspector said.
 
 K Sathish, a motorist, said, “I didn't think the repairs would be completed so soon. I started from home a little early to avoid getting caught in traffic caused by vehicle diversions.“
 
 Police sources said the traffic flow had reduced in the morning hours on Anna Salai toward Saidapet and Guindy as many believed that the road was closed to vehicles.
