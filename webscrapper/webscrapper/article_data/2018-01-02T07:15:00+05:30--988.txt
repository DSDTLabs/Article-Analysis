Ludhiana: Three city residents and their family members came together to celebrate New Year in a noble way. The residents — Arun Kahsyap, Daleep Kumar, and Raman Kumar — organised a   camp in association with Rehras Sewa Society at a city private hospital. The family members donated blood on New Year, which is also the birthday of their kids. 

 Arun Kashyap said, “This was the best way to start New Year. We couldn’t have done it in a better way. We wanted to do charity on New Year. It was also the birthday of our kids. So, we wanted to make it memorable and special.” 
 
 According to Daleep Kumar, they have donated blood many times in the past. However, this time, he said it was a completely different feeling. “We have enjoyed celebrating the birthday and New Year like this for the first time,” he said. 
 
 Sukhwinder Karo from Rehras Sewa Society said, “We helped the family to organise this blood donation camp. New Year and special events in life should be celebrated in this way.” 
 
 Four-year-old Arpit, whose birthday coincides with New Year, was on cloud nine. “I felt really happy to celebrate my birthday in such a special way. I have promised myself that I would celebrate all my birthdays in this way.” 
 
 Vanshika (10) and 13-year-old Anushka, too, sounded excited. “We always wanted to donate blood. It is a noble cause,” they said.
