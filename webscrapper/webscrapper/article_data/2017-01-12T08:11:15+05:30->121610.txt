NEW DELHI: An   running in the garb of a   in a community market at   in east Delhi was   on Tuesday. The gamblers had connected six gaming consoles to a server that gave them access to an online portal for placing bets.

 The six accused include the owner, Shailesh Jaiswal, and his employees, Amit, Sachin Kumar, Sachin Jain, Rajkumar and Chander Dev. Three of the accused own garment shops in the area.
 
 The casino was being run at the shop in Ansal Plaza near Lal Quarter market for the past few years. “A raid was conducted by a team from Krishna Nagar   station and the five employees were arrested. Jaiswal managed to escape and a search is on to nab him,” said DCP (Shahdara) Nupur Prasad.
 
 Amit told the police that he was the caretaker of the casino and he would announce deals at the beginning of every game and offer a return of 36 times the money invested. The deals were decided by Jaiswal who monitored the operation remotely from a server computer. Police have seized Rs 24,700 used for the transactions.
 
 The gamblers had to give the reference of an existing member to get access to the parlour. On Tuesday, a decoy customer was sent to the casino who introduced himself as someone known to the owner. He was then allowed access to the portals. When the raid was conducted, the accused men tried to destroy the machines and flee but were caught.
 
 A search revealed that the casino software was installed in one main computer at the parlour.
