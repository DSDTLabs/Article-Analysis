GURUGRAM: The urban local bodies department on Monday announced   of   on payment of   dues by  . But, the announcement came only three days ahead of the deadline, leaving a very small window for property owners to avail the benefit.

 “Property owners who submit their pending taxes by May 31 will get interest waiver on the arrears till 2016-2017,” MCG commissioner   said in an official release.
 
 The commissioner further said property owners wishing to avail the benefit would have to pay the entire due amount, along with the property tax for the financial year 2018-19, at once.
 
 This apart, to promote online transactions, a 1% discount has already been announced on cashless payments of taxes. Also, MCG recently declared a 10% rebate for those paying taxes for the current financial year before July 31.
 
 But, those failing to pay their property taxes before the due date would have to pay interests at the rate of 1.5% per month.
 
 Officials said MCG roped in   Space Application Research Centre (HARSAC) for managing the online property tax display and payment system earlier this year, replacing the previous agency. HARSAC revamped the entire payment system, which took around two months. Sources said as a result, no payment was received in the past couple of months.
 
 Property tax details for the current financial year were uploaded on the MCG website recently. MCG officials said details of the property taxes could now be found online and payments could be made through the MCG website or at the civic body office. The corporation may also hold camps in different parts of the city in coming months for tax collection.
