UTTARPARA: Parents and widow of research scholar   (27), who died in Paris on February 11, were on Wednesday finally informed by the Indian embassy there that his body would reach India on Saturday.

 For the past 10 days, the bereaved family had been living in uncertainty over when they would be able to see their dear one for one last time.
 
 Dey was studying evolutionary ecology at   in Paris for the last four years. His parents—Sisir Kumar Dey and Amita—live at Uttarpara’s Bachaspati Sarani, while his wife, Payel, along with their two-month-old daughter, is currently staying at her parents’ place at Chinsurah’s Khadina crossing.
 
 
  
 The family claimed they had been in contact with an official of the Indian embassy in Paris. “He told us the postmortem on Snigdhadip’s body had been completed. He also assured us that his body would be flown back home after some official procedures were over,”   said. “It looks like we won’t receive our son’s remains before Saturday. His landlady, Nathalie Noel, has given us one explanation about my son’s death, another to our daughter-in-law and a third to my son’s friends in Washington DC. He was her tenant for the past 14 months. We demand she be thoroughly interrogated. I want to know how exactly my son died. His death is highly suspicious. My daughter-in-law and I last spoke to him on February 10. We could not contact him from the next day. We learnt about his death only after two of his friends in the US enquired and learnt that he had died. ”
 
 Sisir added, “I had emailed external affairs minister  , who forwarded it to the Indian embassy in Paris. Thereafter, we have been getting feedback from the embassy.”
 
 Payel demaded that she be told clearly how her husband died. “I last spoke to him on Saturday, February 10. We used to speak about four times a day. He was perfectly fine and never complained of any illness. As far as I know, he had no enemies there. What could have happened so suddenly that he lost his life.”
