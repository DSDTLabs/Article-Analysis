PATNA: In a bid to minimise pollution level, the   (BSPCB) on Thursday decided not to allow commercial diesel vehicles more than 15-year-old to ply on city roads from December this year. 

 The action plan envisaged by BSPCB for reducing air pollution in the city will be be executed by different departments and agencies of the state government within specific deadlines. It includes phasing out vehicles more than 15-year-old, introduction of clean fuel and ban on registration of diesel-driven autorickshaws.
 
 For instance, cleaner fuels like compressed natural gas (CNG) are proposed to be introduced in the city by June this year. Gas   ( ) is already working on a project to provide piped natural gas (PNG) to households and   for vehicles through the   pipeline under the  .
 
 The action plan has identified road dust, vehicular emission, domestic fuel burning, open waste burning, construction activities and industrial emissions as major sources of air pollution in the state capital. It has identified particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) as main air pollutant as it is found above the prescribed national standards in the city. The causes for higher level of particulate matter has been attributed to resuspension of road dust, emission from vehicles, diesel generator sets, construction activities, burning of domestic fossil fuels, open burning of solid wastes and transportation of construction materials.
 
 Particulate matter apart, the action plan has also found the level of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at alarming level. The higher level of NO2 has been attributed to vehicular emissions. Plying of old vehicles and traffic congestion causes higher level of NO2.
 
 The action plan has also talked about deterioration of air quality during winter season. “The air quality becomes very poor and severe due to condensation of fine particulate matter in the lower portions of the atmosphere,” it said.
