KOLHAPUR: The western zone of the   (NGT) on Wednesday asked the   (KMC) to submit the details of the project approved by the government to address pollution in Panchganga river and Rankala lake. 

 During the earlier hearing, the tribunal had asked the civic administration to get the project sanctioned from the state government as early as possible. The project proposed by the KMC includes to laying underground drainage network, setting up sewage treatment plants (STPs), and also pumping stations to divert the ‘nullahs’ to the treatment plants. The KMC has faced several strictures from the tribunal over the pollution of Rankala lake. 
 
 Sunil Kemble, petitioner in the Rankala lake pollution case said, “The court had asked the civic administration to get the technical and administrative sanctioning to the proposed works, especially the STP work which will help treat the sewage water flowing into the lake. Recently the state government has agreed to release Rs 72 crore for the works under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT). But, it has not yet delivered the approval letter to the civic administration. The court has given a deadline of two weeks, till the next hearing on February 10, to present the approval letter from the government.”
 
 The approval to the projects by the government has provided some relief to the civic authorities who were facing the ire of the court repeatedly. The court had even summoned the higher officials of Maharashtra   (MJP), which is the consultant agency to grant technical approval to AMRUT projects. The MJP officials were slammed for granting technical approval without visiting the site of the proposed STP. 
 
 After surveying the lake and other areas, the MJP officials have presented a report to the tribunal and have supported the need of in situ treatment of the sewage water to avoid pollution of the lake.
