She is neither from a filmi background nor has a godfather in the industry. Yet,   is happy that she has found her feet in  . Her latest film, ' ', hit screens yesterday and the Australian actress-model is excited with the reviews she has been garnering for her role. Talking to BT from Australia, Lucinda says, “I’m from Australia, so I honestly didn’t expect to have a career in Bollywood. But I’ve got to act in some wonderful films and I’m grateful for the opportunity and exposure that I’ve got. The whole thing has been such a surreal experience.”

 Talking about shooting for the comic caper, she says, “We filmed in London and Mumbai and I enjoyed every day of the schedule. The whole team was very warm and welcoming. They helped me through the shooting.”
 
  
  
 For Lucinda, modelling happened by chance. She was studying law when she was approached to participate in the   pageant. She was crowned Miss World   2010 when she was just 17. Since then, there has been no looking back for Lucinda, who has modelled for top international brands and designers, and been a part of music videos, too. She debuted in B-Town with Akshay Kumar’s 'Boss', in which she was seen grooving to the popular number, 'Party All Night'. She has also appeared in a brand campaign with Arjun Rampal, apart from doing a Telugu film, 'Luckkunnodu'.
 
 “I’ve got the opportunity to work in some amazing movies. But the offers didn’t come my way easily; I auditioned and worked hard for them. I learnt Hindi and Telugu for my roles and spent time understanding Indian culture. Working in a foreign language film is a huge deal and you should have the mindset to learn. Now, I can speak Hindi as fluently as you,” she says with a laugh.
 
 Though offers have been coming her way, Lucinda plans to take one step at a time. “I’ve signed a film in the US, but I’m keeping my options open in the Indian film industry. In fact, I’d love to play the lead in a Bollywood film,” the pretty actress signs off.
