JODHPUR: In what can be called as pathetic, verbal spat between two brothers over placing a   in elder brother’s room led the younger brother hit hard in elder’s head with stone mortar, finally killing him on the spot. 

 According to Pratapnagar SHO Ram Singh, two brothers — Rafiq (35) and Iqbal (32) live in Masuriya locality with their families and ply auto-rickshaws in the city. 
 
 “On Tuesday morning, elder brother Rafiq requested Iqbal to place a cooking gas cylinder in his room. But Iqubal denied which led to a verbal spat between the duo,” said Singh.
 
 This spat turned violent and in a fit of rage, Iqbal rushed to the kitchen to bring a stone mortar. Waving it in his hands, he hit Rafiq in his head leaving him bleeding.
 
 “Seeing his brother bleeding, Iqbal left the house while Rafiq went into his room and laid on the bed. When his wife returned, she found Rafiq dead,” said Singh.
 
 Rafiq was rushed to the hospital where he was declared brought dead. Interestingly, Iqbal, on learning his brother’s condition, also accompanied him at hospital. But he fled from the spot after knowing about Rafiq’s death. Following a complaint of murder by Rafiq’s wife, police registered a case and nabbed Iqbal from Jaljog area.
 
 “We have brought him to police station. Currently, he is being interrogated,” said Singh.
