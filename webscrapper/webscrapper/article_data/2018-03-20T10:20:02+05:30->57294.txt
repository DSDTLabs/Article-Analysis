BENGALURU: The lone accused arrested in the murder of journalist-activist Gauri Lankesh is likely to be flown to Ahmedabad early next week for narcoanalysis.

 KT   Kumar alias Hotte Manja, 38, from Maddur in Mandya district, was arrested earlier this month. Police suspect he conducted a recce for the killers and later helped them in executing the murder. A local court allowed police to subject Naveen to narcoanalysis after he consented to the same.
 
 Sources in the Special Investigating Team (SIT) probing the Gauri killing said the Gujarat Forensic Sciences Laboratory has responded positively to their plea for subjecting Naveen to the test. “The FSL staff need time to prepare themselves for the test. We had written to them on March 14 and they have communicated saying the test can be conducted on or after March 26,” the sources said.
 
 “If we get an appointment on March 26, we will have to reach Gujarat the previous day as the accused will have to undergo various preparatory tests. However, the date is yet to be finalized,” they added.
 
 SIT sources said they are still waiting for reports from Forensic Science Laboratory, Bengaluru, on whether Naveen is the same man seen in the   footage conducting a recce near Gauri’s house before the murder. SIT personnel had made Naveen recreate the recce scenes and sent a video of the same with the CCTV footage to FSL.
 
 Naveen was arrested by   police on February 18 after they recovered 15 rounds of live bullets from him. On March 2, SIT took him into its custody.
