Vadodara: The chief justice of Gujarat high court has assured the lawyers of Vadodara over what has been a bone of contention for over many months. During the inauguration of the new court complex in Diwalipura, chief justice R Subhash Reddy told the advocates that a new building will be constructed for the advocates.

 “Whenever a new building comes up, there are issues. But soon construction of the new building will start and the government too has processed the papers quickly for it,” said Reddy. He added, “Until then the two big halls on the ground floor which were meant for library can be used by the bar association and we will also provide the furniture for it. I have asked the district judge to shift the library to upper floors.”
 
 While assuring sitting space to the lawyers, the chief justice also told them about their onerous duty of clearing pending cases. “By the end of 2018, we should make sure that not a single case which is older than five years should be pending in any court of Gujarat,” he said. He also pointed out how a single amendment in an act increases the burden on judiciary.
 
 While talking about the new court building, which is the largest district court building in Asia, chief jusctice said, “The government spent Rs 130 crore of taxpayers’ money for this building. This is the day we should plan that by ensuring justice for people, we pay them this money back.”
