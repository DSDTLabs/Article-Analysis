    ( ) president   has threatened to pull out electricity poles in the rural belt of western   if increased rates of power tariff are not withdrawn.
 
  “We are suffering. And the government is only contributing to this suffering. Be it sugarcane arrears or increased power tariff, there is no respite for us. Now, we are left with no choice but to initiate a non-cooperation movement against UP government. If tariff is not decreased, we will pull out electricity poles and will also be willing to go to jails,” said Tikait in Baraut tehsil of Baghpat where farmers have been agitating for the last 10 days demanding pending cane dues and reduction in increased power tariff.
  
  A day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Baghpat to inaugurate the Eastern Peripheral Highway on May 28, a cane farmer, Udayveer Singh, who was in his fifties, had died during the protest. 
  
  Baraut is only a km away from Malakpur sugar mill that owes close to Rs 400 crore to farmers and is one of the biggest cane defaulters of western UP.
  
  “The government had promised that mills will release payments within 14 days of selling of crop but months have passed and even mills have stopped crushing, but farmers are still suffering,” he said.
  
  Farmers have now called for a mahapanchayat on June 11.
  
  On December 1, 2017, UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) announced an unprecedented power tariff hike for rural domestic consumers and also for private tubewells owned by farmers in the villages.
  
  The average tariff hike ranges from 12% to 150% depending upon metered and unmetered connections and other usage slabs. Sugarcane and power tariff remained core issues in the just concluded UP bypolls in Kairana and Noorpur, both of which saw the ruling BJP trounced.
