  Apart from the mixed talk the film seems to suffer from, NPS has reportedly also leaked on its opening day with a full movie download available online. Made on a budget of Rs 55 Cr, with the theatrical rights reportedly sold for Rs 75 Cr, the filmmakers had ensured to take steps so such scenario doesn’t play out. However, when the film premiered in US, a cam print has allegedly found its way online after. It remains to be seen if these reports are true and if so, the filmmakers have taken down the links. ‘Naa Peru Surya, Naa Illu India’ also stars Arjun,  , Rao Ramesh, Vennela Kishore and Nadhiya in key roles.
