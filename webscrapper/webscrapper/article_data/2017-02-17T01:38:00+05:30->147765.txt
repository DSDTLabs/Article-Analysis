Lucknow: Mocking at the slogan denoting Congress-SP tie-up ‘UP ko yeh saath pasand hai’, Union law minister   questioned what compelled this “alliance of corruption and crime”. Hitting out further, Prasad said it’s not Akhilesh Yadav's “kaam” but shelter given to criminals and corruption of Rahul’s party that is doing the talking. 

 On a day-long visit to Lucknow, Prasad said if UP likes the “saath” why were the two parties and their leaders not rallying together. “Actually SP has realised, wherever Rahul goes, he does some damage,” he said. 
 
 The   said the   likes the “saath” of only the members of its  . Invoking former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, Prasad said an honest man like him was easily forgotten by the Grand Old Party. “In fact, Congress mistreated his family after Shastri’s death, because Shastri's family was not related to the Nehru-Gandhi family,” he remarked. 
 
 Congress ditched leaders like former Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh, Chaudhary Charan Singh and Chandrashekhar, alleged Prasad, adding that only to nurture the Gandhi dynasty, the Congress did not allow cremation of former Prime Minister Narsimha Rao in New Delhi or allow his body to be kept at Congress office. 
 
 Hitting out SP government over law and order, Prasad cited the murder of trader Shravan Sahu and of a rape victim whose father tried to get an FIR registered against the accused SP MLA.
