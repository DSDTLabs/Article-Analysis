Only recently, actor   had delivered a controversial speech on actors entering politics. The actor had remarked that just because they are popular, it doesn’t mean actors know everything, and added that they stand to lose very little if they lose an election. 

 Now, inspired by the recent happenings in Tamil Nadu,  , who had previously directed films like   and Girivalam, is planning a film revolving around an actor who enters politics. Says the director, “In this current scenario, everyone is floating their own party, but we are still not sure what the outcome of such actions are going to be. I was thinking about this when an idea struck me. So, I decided to turn this into a script and make it as a film, with Sathyaraj sir.” 
 
 The film, he informs, is currently in the scripting stage, but Shivraaj has already found a title for it (which he has registered with the producers council) — Cinema Nadiganum Arasiyavathiyum. Selvabharathi, who directed the Vijay starrers   and Priyamanavale, is writing the story and dialogues for this political satire, while Shivraaj will handle the screenplay and direction. Sathyaraj, he reveals, has agreed in principle to star in it, and has asked him to come with the finished script. In addition to the actor, who was part of his well-received black comedy Adithadi, the director has also roped in the producer of that film, M Gnanasundari, to produce this one.
 
 “We are planning this as a trlingual — in Tamil, Hindi and Telugu. We are hoping to go on the floors by April,” adds the director.
