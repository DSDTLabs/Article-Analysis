Indore: Residents of Machhi Bazaar area, affected by road widening work between Sarwate and Gangwal bus stands on Thursday took their protest to high court where they objected to hearing of the petition by Justice PK Jaiswal.  Fifty residents, living in the area, reached the high court at 10 am and stood outside the gate number 1, which is closer to the judge’s parking. When Justice PK Jaiswal arrived, protestors gheraoed his car and made demand for the matter to be heard by some other bench, instead of Justice Jaiswal’s.  The residents were asked to raise their grievance before the court during the hearing but they refused to budge. They then moved near get number 3 and were waiting for the hearing to be completed, before being briefed by their counsel. On the other hand, the high court bar association also wrote a letter to the high court to tighten security in the court premises so that such incidents of judge’s cars being gheraoed by litigants do not happen in future. A silent march was also carried out by the residents along with social organizations from Machhi Bazaar to Kagdipura square. The residents were demanding proper displacement of affected families.  Protestors said that they were Muslim families and IMC was allotting them flats under EWS category in areas where there were no mosques for daily prayers and other essential facilities like schools. The residents have asked Indore Municipal Corporation to relocate them to a place where at least they have these basic amenities.
