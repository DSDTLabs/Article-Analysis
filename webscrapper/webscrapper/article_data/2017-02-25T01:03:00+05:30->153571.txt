There was a time when she was one of the most revered faces on Indian television, literally. And then, she left it all for marital bliss and a short fling with politics. But the ‘vanvaas’ is over now. Deepika Chikhalia Topiwala, the original Sita of TV, is all set to make a comeback after more than two decades. She will soon be seen in Gujarati TV show Chhuta Chheda.

 Deepika, who shot to national fame after playing Sita in BR Chopra’s   on Doordarshan, dabbled in Hindi films and acted with the late   in three films. However, she quit the entertainment industry after getting married to Gujarati businessman  . She once again entered the limelight as a BJP MP in 1991, but disappeared soon after. 
 
 Ask the actress what prompted her to return to the small screen and she says, “I was busy settling down in life. Then, politics happened and during those five years, I had both my daughters. It’s not that I did not get any offers. It is embarrassing, but I was offered supporting roles in Ramayan made by other makers, which I didn’t accept for obvious reasons. Frankly speaking, roles are not so meaty on TV these days. I didn’t want to play the saas who torments the bahu or remains in the background and cries.”
 
 Deepika adds that television has “regressive” content. She elaborates, “On one hand, we keep harping on bringing about a change in the society, but on the other hand, we show black magic, snakes and saas-bahu dramas on our TV. Forget that, I still fail to understand how actresses are shown so decked up even while cooking in the kitchen!” Ask her if she has watched any other televised version of Ramayan and she replies, “No, nothing holds my interest or keeps me glued to TV. The content lacks depth.”
