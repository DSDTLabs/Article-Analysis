Three women committed suicide at Sangupuram near Sankarankovil in Tirunelveli district late on Tuesday night. The incident came to light when neighbours opened the door as the trio did not come out on Wednesday morning. A suicide note left by the deceased revealed that the three resorted to this extreme step after the fiance of one of the daughters, who was engaged recently after 10 years of courtship, refused to marry her. 

 The deceased were identified as Sheela, 55, and her daughters Sornam, 28, and Padma, 20, from a village near Kurinjiyur in Tenkasi. Sheela’s husband died many years ago and she was a homemaker. Sornam, the sole breadwinner of the family, was working as a postwoman at Sangupuram while Padma was a college goer.
 
 The three women lived in a rented house at Sangupuram. Villagers said that Sornam was in love with K Veluchamy who was a private bus conductor from Panayur, a nearby village, for the past 10 years. A few months ago they got engaged with the consent of their families and their wedding was to be held in the Tamil month of ‘Thai’ (after Pongal).
 
 On Tuesday, Sornam came to know that Veluchamy had planned to marry another woman and went to Chennai. Upset by this, the women consumed a pesticide and died in their house.tnn
