Coimbatore: All eyes fell on  ,   of the  , when he walked into the   on Monday wearing a garland of vegetables.

 He wanted to register his protest against the irregularities occurring at various uzhavar sandhai (farmers’ markets) in the district, Palanisamy said. “The so called farmers who sell their produce at uzhavar sandhai, especially the one at R S Puram, are not real farmers. Though the scheme was started by the government to allow farmers, specifically, to sell their produce directly to consumers, many of them who do business are not farmers but vegetable sellers and traders,” he said. 
 
 “These sellers use identity cards procured from farmers or get the cards by furnishing wrong information,” he said.
 
 Palanisamy also said that the cold storage and composting shed at the R S Puram market are not functioning properly. “The government had set up the refrigerating facility for farmers to store unsold vegetables for the day. But it has not been functioning for a long time. The composting shed was set up next to the market for farmers to dispose of spoilt vegetables and get compost. It is also not functional any more. Farmers, who asked the officers to rectify the facilities were threatened,” he said.
 
 Agriculture officers posted at the administrative office of the markets were not monitoring the sales, pricing of fruits and vegetables, Palanisamy added.
