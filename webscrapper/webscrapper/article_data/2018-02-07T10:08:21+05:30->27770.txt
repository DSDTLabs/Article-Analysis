NEW DELHI. The   led   government in Uttrakhand splurged over Rs 68 lakhs on refreshments in a mere 10 months, a Right to Information (RTI) query revealed.

 The BJP termed these expenses “natural” but also promised to look into the matter, reported ANI.
 
 “Such expenses are natural but if they go beyond a limit then it's matter of concern,” said party spokesperson Virendra Singh Bisht.
 
 Bisht further claimed that a number of meetings are normally held in the CM’s office.
 
 “Janta Darbar and many other official meetings take place at CM office. Nevertheless, CM Rawat will take cognizance of the matter,” Bisht said.
 
 In a letter dated January 22, secretariat administration told Haldwani-based RTI activist Hemant Singh that the Uttarakhand chief minister’s office spent Rs 68,59,865 on ‘chai pani’ (refreshments and snacks) since the BJP government was sworn in on March 18 last year.
 
 
  
 Earlier this month, another RTI application revealed that Kerala Assembly speaker P Sreeramakrishnan claimed reimbursement worth Rs 49,900 for purchasing an expensive pair of eyeglasses.
