Surat: Every year thousands of   lalas, political party workers,   volunteers and the civic body employees join the Tapi cleaning programmes, but many among them continue to throw floral waste and household garbage into the river for sheer lack of awareness. 

 
 The river remains dead for more than 10 months of the year because its carrying capacity has almost reduced to half. There is heavy layers of silt deposited in the riverbed. Despite repeated pleas by experts, nothing has been done to desilt the riverbed for the past many years. After two years of deliberations,   Government has decided to handover desilting of Tapi to irrigation department. 
 
 Superintending engineering, irrigation department (Surat circle), S   told TOI, “Tender for the survey for amount of silting that has taken place in the river would be floated in the next few days. Once it is cleared, the process to desilt the river will start.” This means another two years would comfortably pass before the actual desilting process in the river is undertaken. 
 
 The major silt that gets deposited in the lower region of the riverbed comes in with the water flowing from downward of Ukai region. It is the small minute particles of rocks and other stony substances. Deposition of vegetation adds to the foul odour. Over a period of time, large amount of algae also grows in the shallow water ponds in the riverbed.
 
 Even officials of the hydraulic department of   (SMC) agree that the water quality of Tapi has deteriorated. At present, the intake wells draw raw water from Tapi, which is of ‘D’ quality. But for heavy chlorination and filtration process by the SMC, the water is barely drinkable.
