PUNE: The   Limited (PMPML) is planning a   in fines imposed on  , in case of bus breakdowns or other complaints. 

 At present, the contractors have to pay a fine of Rs 500. Soon, they may have to pay up to 10 times more. 
 
 According to a senior official, buses operated by such contractors experience the highest number of accidents or breakdowns. The contractors also underpay their drivers, who quit. The PMPML hopes the heavy penalty would whip them into shape.
 
 “With the fine being increased, the contractors will be forced to change their ways. They will try and select good drivers and pay them well so that they stay on the job. The contractors will also ensure that the buses are maintained well,” the official added.
 
 Of the 2,000 buses operated by PMPML in the city, 750 are privately run. As per records, over 100 people have lost their lives in accidents involving such buses in the last three years. 
 
 “Though a final decision will be taken soon at the next board meeting. the fine will surely be increased to Rs 4,000-5,000,” the official said, adding: “Each day, there are around 150 breakdowns involving the buses run by the private contractors.”
 
 A few contractors refused to comment, but the regular passengers welcomed the move. 
 
 “I don’t know which bus is operated by the PMPML or which one is being run by a private contractor. However, many buses of the PMPML are in a bad condition and breakdowns are common. Either they don’t start immediately or stop suddenly. If the officials feel that a majority of these buses are privately run and are straightening them out, it is good for the people,”  , a Kondhwa resident, said.
