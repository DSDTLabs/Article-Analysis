IMPHAL/KOLKATA:   suffered a jolt in their bid to avenge the first-leg loss to  , when their Afghan defender   was detained at   on Wednesday as he was not carrying the mandatory Protected Area Permit (PAP). The player was asked to leave the Manipur capital as soon as possible but following an intervention from NEROCA FC, he has been given special permission to stay at the team hotel for the night only.

 
 
 As per law, the citizens of Afghanistan, China, Pakistan and foreign nationals having origin in these countries require prior approval of the ministry of home affairs to visit the states of Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland. "We have told him that PAP is required for Afghan nationals to enter Manipur and we advised him to obtain PAP so that he can play in Imphal. We've asked him to buy a flight ticket for his return tomorrow (Thursday). He has understood our advice. He was actually not aware of the existing rules," officer in-charge of Singjamei police station, N  , said.
 
 Saighani has now bought a ticket for his return to Aizawl via Guwahati. "We will escort him to the Imphal airport tomorrow (Thursday)," the OC said.
 
 Saighani, disappointed at the possibility of missing the match on Saturday, said: "I've never heard about it before and nobody informed me. So I have to leave Manipur tomorrow on the first flight to Guwahati at 9.30 am."
 
 It is obviously not a player's responsibility to know where he can go or cannot; the responsibility lies with the club management. However, contacted over phone, team manager   said, "Unfortunately we were not aware of this law before landing in Imphal, so this incident happened. Let's see if anything can be done before Masih leaves Imphal tomorrow. Though they are our rivals on the pitch, NEROCA have been cordial enough to help us resolve the issue. " said Zadeng, in Kolkata right now and supposed to join the team on Thursday.
