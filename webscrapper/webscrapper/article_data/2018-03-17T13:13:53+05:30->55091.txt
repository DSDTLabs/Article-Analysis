COIMBATORE: About 400 farm workers, employed by the   (TNAU) to work in its institutions across the state, have staged a protest at the   campus here on Friday seeking to make their job permanent and to pay the money deducted from their wages under the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS).

 Despite a government order to make the workers permanent if they had served for more than 10 years, it has not been implemented, said T Suresh Kumar, president of  . 
 
 “There are many daily wagers who had completed 25 years of service. Without a permanent job, they are going to retire without pensions. They come from very humble backgrounds and would have no support for their livelihood,” he said.
 
 Suresh Kumar said they has been fighting for more than 10 years to make their jobs permanent. “In 2009, some workers were made permanent. But after that, no one was. About 2,000 workers continue to work in a temporary basis,” he added
 
 Besides, permanent workers, who had retired, have alleged that they were yet to receive the amount deducted under the CPS from their wages. “I am yet to get my monthly pension of Rs 800. I have been running from pillar to post for it for 3 years,” said I Pappammal, 61, from  , who has to spend her savings money to reach the protest venue. 
 
 Several workers also said they were given work irregularly. “We only work for two to three days a week, which makes our lives uncertain,” said R  , 45, who works in TNAU’s institution at Kumulur, Trichy, for about 24 years. 
 
 TNAU vice-chancellor K Ramasamy said the university had made 2,432 daily wage workers permanent in three phases. “Now the rules for recruiting people have been changed. We want a court or a government order to consider their requests,” he said. On the allegation that workers were not given work regularly, he said the university has been giving as much work to them as it can.
