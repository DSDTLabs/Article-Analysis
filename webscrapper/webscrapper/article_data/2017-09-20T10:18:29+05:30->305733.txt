LUCKNOW: Nine years ago, when Azamgarh resident Abu Rashid went missing after the   encounter of 2008, his father   was so grief-stricken by the incident that he died within a few months. Zafar Alam, the father of Mohammad Ariz Khan from   in Azamgarh, also passed away without getting to know the whereabouts of his son.

 These are just two examples of families from Azamgarh who have been bearing the brunt of the incident that has often being termed as a “fake encounter“.
 
 On Tuesday, a report 'Tareekho mai nau saal' (nine years in dates) was released by the social organisation   on the ninth anniversary of the incident. Written by Masihuddin Sanjari, a teacher from Sanjarpur, the re port raises questions on justice for at least five parents of youths from Azamgarh who either went missing, died in the encounter or are lodged in jail as undertrials. Activists claim there were 3,500 witnesses in the case, but only 950 have been questioned. “At this speed, it would take at least 36 years to finish the process,“ said Sanjari.
 
 “Dr  , the father of Sajid Chhota who died in the encounter, was so overcome by grief that he has become statuesque. Sajid's mother got bedridden, and when she recovered Hasan died seeking justice for his son,“ Sanjari added.
 
 Likewise, Arif Badr's father Badruddin lost his life even before any of the accusations against his son could be proved.
 
 Families of at least 10 boys from Azamgarh, who were arrested on suspicion of links with terror outfits, have been facing a social backlash, economic crisis and emotional turmoil since 2008.
