Panchkula: Heavy branches of trees continue to crash over houses and cars but the horticulture wing of the Panchkula municipal corporation has shown little effort to solve this problem. 

  Some of the branches have even covered the slip roads of the city. A resident Rajeev Saharan said he had pleaded with the MC to prune an overgrown tree near his house.. “Yet, no one has come over to check the status,” he rued. “MC should make proper plan to prune the trees and must also train their employees for this,” said Sonia Verma, a resident of Sector 6.
 
  Councillor of ward no 14 Lily Bawa said, “Time to time pruning of trees is necessary but sometimes, unaware workers cut down all their branches causing irreversible damage to them.” The issue has also raised in the house meetings. Panchkula mayor Upinder Kaur Ahluwalia said, “The horticulture wing has orders to do a survey of the city and ensure proper pruning of the trees in the city.” tnn
