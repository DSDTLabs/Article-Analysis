BHIWANDI: Three teenagers have been rescued from their 150sq ft home where they had been kept confined for six years by their father, paranoid since his wife left him. They had been taken off school and would be let out only twice a year — during Ramzan and Bakri Eid.

 Rehan, 15,  , 13, and  , 11, were rescued on Thursday in  , 20 km from Mumbai, after neighbours took pity on their condition and filed a police complaint against their father, 55-year-old Sayyed Khan. 
 
 Asked why he had kept the kids under house arrest, Khan first said: “My wife left home six years ago and I’ve always feared that she would kidnap the children in my absence.” Later, he said whenever he would take his sons out, they would feel disheartened on seeing other children’s mothers and ask him for theirs. This made him lock them up. Khan worked as an autorickshaw driver. For the past year, he has been employed at a shop.
 
 Once the couple separated, he forced  , then a student of Class V, and Rehman, a student of Class IV, to leave school. He fed the three “inferior food” bought from a local supplier. 
 
 The boys are being treated for calcium deficiency and vision problems and doctors suspect they are suffering from mental trauma because of the long incarceration.
