 is a happy man these days. The actor has just returned from the shoot of his latest movie with   in the deserts of Rajasthan. Ask him about his shooting experiences and he says, “I have been to the deserts in the Middle East, but this is the first time I am visiting one in India. I had a wonderful time shooting for   sir’s  .”

  The Trivandrum Lodge actor plays an army man in the film. “My character’s name is Gunner Nathan and he is an army tank driver. He is a very jovial and cool person. In the movie, along with Padmarajan Ratheesh, Allu Sirish and Pradeep, I am shown as travelling in the tank,” says Saiju.
  The actor adds that his respect for army men doubled after travelling around in the tank for hours. “It wasn’t easy. A person of my height cannot sit comfortably inside it. And also the heat and the suffocation that we went through were beyond words. I admire the men who guard our country despite all these difficulties,” he says, adding that he shot for 10 days in the desert.
 
 Talking about the hardships the team went through while shooting, he says, “The deserts in Rajasthan are really hot during the day and extremely cold in the night. Adjusting to the weather was really tough, especially after going from Kerala, a State with such a moderate climate. More than that, there were vipers in the sands and we had to be really careful while walking in the deserts. However, we managed to handle all these difficulties and successfully wound up the shoot.”
 
  Saiju is waiting for the release of his next Midhun Manuel Thomas film, Alamaara, in which he plays a bank employee, Prasad. “My role is that of a humourous yet serious guy in the movie. I am the mature one in the friends’ gang,” he says.
