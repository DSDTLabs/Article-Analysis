MUMBAI: The captain of a fine dining restaurant-cum-hotel at Nalasopara, who was manning the reception counter, was shot at on Sunday afternoon. The shooter left behind a handwritten note with 'Gangster Suresh  ' scribbled on it. 

  Dilip Varma (26), who works at  , was hit on the chest. The suspect has been captured on the hotel's closed circuit television (CCTV). The footage shows a man in a white shirt and cap entering a little after 1 pm. Varma, a resident of   in Virar (E) is at the counter, when the suspect puts his hand in his right trouser pocket and waits. A few men walk in and out of the hotel. Varma's attention is drawn towards the suspect and he offers to help him. Just when he says in Marathi 'Bola (tell me)', the suspect pulls the trigger and throws a white paper with his left hand. The note has Pujari's name scribbled in English in blue ink. The suspect then runs out of the hotel. 
 
 The 40-second footage has been retrieved by police, who suspect that dropping the fugitive gangster's name may be to mislead them. Pujari, who is believed to be operating from the Middle East, has allegedly been threatening and extorting money from builders in Kalyan-Dombivli and Ulhasnagar. 
 
 Police are questioning the hotel owners to know if there have been extortion calls from Pujari or any other gangster.
 
 Police are also examining CCTV footage of the vicinity for information on whether the suspect came on foot or had used a vehicle. Some people told police that the shooter was seen sitting pillion on a waiting motorbike, indicating that there could have been more than one person. 
 
 Police have still to record the statement of Varma, who is being treated at  's Wockhardt hospital.
