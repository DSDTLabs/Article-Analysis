MARGAO: The Congress camp in Goa is brimming with a new-found enthusiasm ahead of the assembly polls.

 While the recent visit of the Congress vice-president,   to Goa helped in invigorating the rank and file of the Congress, the Congress state brass is apparently buoyed over the private tour of Congress president,  , to the state coinciding with the new year celebrations.
 
 Sonia, who was holidaying in Goa for the last three days, had put up at a starred beach resort in Mobor in South Goa. Sources said that Gandhi had a one-on-one meeting with state Congress president,  , on Monday, before she headed to the national capital Tuesday morning.
 
 Sources said that Sonia, during her meeting with Faleiro, reviewed the Congress’ preparedness for the forthcoming assembly elections. While it could not be confirmed what transpired at the closed–door meeting between Sonia and Faleiro, sources said that Faleiro tried to convince the AICC president that it would be in the party’s best interests to go it alone in the assembly polls.
 
 Faleiro left for Delhi on Tuesday ahead of the Congress screening committee meeting to be held on Wednesday. This is Sonia’s second visit to the state in less than two months. 
 
 In mid-November 2016, Sonia accompanied by her daughter, Priyanka, had visited Shree Shantaurga Kunkallilarin Devasthan temple at Fatorpa, and the   at Benaulim.
