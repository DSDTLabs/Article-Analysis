MOTIHARI: BJP’s Pipra MLA Shyam Babu Yadav has lodged a complaint with police, alleging that the Navyuvak Organisation of Jharkhand (NOJ), a splinter group of Maoists, has sought an extortion of Rs 5 lakh from him. “The group has threatened me with dire consequences if I fail to pay the amount,” Yadav said.

 The NOJ activists had pasted handwritten pamphlets on the boundary walls of four BJP workers’ houses at Kadama village under Rajepur police station in East Champaran district on Sunday night, asking Yadav, Krishna Deo Singh, a retired army jawan,   and Sudip Kumar Singh to either pay the extortion money or face dire consequences. 
 
 Kadama is a Maoist-infested village where an assistant commandant and a CRPF jawan were killed in an encounter with the Red rebels in 2011.
 
 Pakaridayal DSP Vijay Kumar visited the village after receiving complaint and recovered the pamphlets. Om Chandra Singh, a BJP worker of Kadama, had lodged an FIR with Rajepur police station on behalf of the MLA against unknown persons in connection with the  . SHO of Rajepur police station Mahendra Prasad said the police have launched a drive to arrest those involved in issuing extortion threat.
 
 The NOJ pamphlets also targeted PM   and former   minister Radha Mohan Singh. “PM Modi murdabad, MP   murdabad,” the pamphlets read.
 
 The MLA alleged that he had received a threat call on August 5 last year too. “The police are yet to arrest anyone in connection with last year’s threat. The Kadama incident is nothing but an attempt of opposition parties to threaten BJP workers,” he alleged.
