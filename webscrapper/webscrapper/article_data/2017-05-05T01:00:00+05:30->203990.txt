 According to the film’s makers, 'Sarkar 3' is ‘angrier than ever’ and it clearly comes across in the album. The seven tracks, composed by Ravi Shankar and penned by Rohit Teotia, are gripping and the lyrics, powerful. Interestingly, all the songs, except the 'Ganesh Aarti', are spin-offs of ' ', which featured in 'Sarkar' as well as ' '. 
 
 The album opens with 'Gussa' in the voice of Sukhwinder Singh, and is about the social scenario that makes the common man angry. The biggest pluses of the track are the chants of Govinda and the compelling percussion in the background, which establishes connect with the earlier films. 'Angry Mix' is an electronic mix version of 'Gussa', with additional vocals by Mika Singh. 
 
 'Sam Dham' is another take on 'Sam Dam Bhed' from both the films in the franchise. While once again, Kailash Kher has sung this riveting number, he has company in Saket Bairoliya. Niladri Kumar’s 'Sarkar Trance', which opens with a monologue by  , is hypnotic. The techno beats, with elements of classical, gradually builds tension, but ends abruptly. Big B’s baritone in 'Ganesh Aarti', composed by Rohan Vinayak, invokes the bhakti bhav. The number starts on a slow note and picks up tempo when it transcends to the aarti. 
 
 'Thamba' (lyrics by Sirasri) also starts with Big B’s lines — yes, the same one in 'Govinda Song' ('Sarkar') — and Navraj Hans takes over with full gusto. 'Shakti', sung by Mika, Adarsh Shinde and Saket, and penned by Mandhar, is also on similar lines. The album is thematic and doesn’t fall into the trappings of a typical Bollywood film. But the fact that all the songs follow the same template makes the album sound repetitive.
