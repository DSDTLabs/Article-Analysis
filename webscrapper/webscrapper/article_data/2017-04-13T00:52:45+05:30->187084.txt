NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Wednesday questioned why “senior functionaries are fighting over an officer” while hearing Delhi   speaker’s plea against the lieutenant governor’s decision to repatriate the secretary.

 “Will the Delhi Legislative Assembly collapse without him? Why should you (speaker) come and fight for him,” Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva wondered, reminding the authorities that “no officer is so important that two senior functionaries are fighting over him.”
 
 The court’s remarks came after speaker Ram Niwas Goel’s counsel submitted that   (AIR) would not collapse if the secretary, Prasanna Kumar  , is not repatriated from the assembly and sought a stay on disciplinary proceedings against him.
 
 Suryadevara is facing flak for not joining back AIR and for writing an article.
 
 “From Day 1 I told you (speaker) I will not permit you to fight his (Suryadevara) battle,” the court observed, saying that the official can file a separate plea if he is aggrieved by the disciplinary proceedings.
