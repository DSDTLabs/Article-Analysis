Panaji: An attempt to haul the casino vessel, MV   Seven over the last sand bar at Miramar beach had to be abandoned on Tuesday, as one of the tugs developed an engine failure.

 The vessel had been hauled to about 300m in the sea from its grounded position of 63 days on Monday. 
 
 This was facilitated by a better high tide range of 2.09m, but the tide ebbed during the slow and cautious hauling of the vessel, just as it reached a sand bar formation.
 
 It was resting on the sand bar almost on the verge of reaching a deeper stretch of 10-metre deep river channel.
 
 “We will resume the salvage exercise on Wednesday, as one of the two engines of the 60tonne tug, Maria, developed a snag,” a company official said.
 
 The rope was disconnected, while the other smaller vessel of 20 tonne was taken to safe waters.
 
 The vessel has been grounded at Miramar beach since July 16 and had suffered heavy damage. Golden Globe Hotels Pvt Ltd, the hotel company which owns the ship, has awarded the breach-plugging and refloating work to AMS Marine Agency from Egypt. 
 
 After the vessel was refloated on September 17 after pumping out huge quantities of water, it has become possible to tow the vessel.
 
 The sea conditions were rough during the last few days due to inclement weather and heavy rains, hence the company officials, salvors and tug boat owners desisted from taking any risks. 
 
 “We will continue on Wednesday or Thursday, depending on the weather conditions,” an official said.
 
 The high tide is expected have a range of 2.13m on Wednesday afternoon and 2.11m on Thursday forenoon.
 
 Meanwhile, speaking on the issue, Jayesh Salgaonkar, who is also the ports minister, said that the vessel first needs to undergo repairs before it can be towed away. 
 
 “I have been told that the owners subsequently plan on taking the vessel to Ratnagiri for further repairs. It has been pulled to 300m towards the sea, and from there on it will be towed away,” Salgaonkar said.
