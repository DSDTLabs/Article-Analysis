MANGALURU: ‘Special jadoo for specially-abled’ was a magical tribute to the famed   P C Sorcar senior on his 104th birth anniversary by Mangalurean magician Kudroli Ganesh. 

 To commemorate the birth anniversary of   senior aka P C Sorcar, young magician Ganesh, who has bagged several national and international laurels, presented the special show for special kids at   of Chetana Bala Vikasa Mandira in the city on Thursday. 
 
 Ganesh, who has presented magic shows at several places in India and abroad, said the special jadoo for the differently-abled is a dedication to P C Sorcar senior. 
 
 “I dedicate this free show to Sorcar, who conquered the world of magic. It is difficult to enthrall special children with the same magic that we present before others. Hence, I have designed a set of magic that will entertain all kinds of special children,” Ganesh said. 
 
 Ganesh, who is instrumental in making magic a key tool for social awareness, said, children with disabilities will have to observe very closely to realize the fun. 
 
 “All   like appearance of magic stick, notes of Rs 2,000, flowers from a piece of cloth and tricolor with three hand kerchief are presented in such a way that they can enjoy it from a close distance. I chose to present show not in an auditorium. Instead, I presented the show in their classrooms,” he added. 
 
 Ganesh, who has popularized ‘Bhoota kola’, Yakshagana and other folk arts of Tulunadu through magic, said he will continue to hold shows for special children.
