Mumbai: Shikshan Katta, a discussion forum of teachers, principals and educationists, on Saturday met to evaluate the  education department’s Pragat Shaikshanik Maharashtra   and its implementation. The programme aims at improving quality of   and schools in the state.

 While most of them agreed that the programme, which has been explained to schools in four GRs in the past few months, is well-intended; there are a lot of holes to be plugged. Earlier this year, the state accelerated the programme and called it Jalad Pragat Shaikshanik Maharashtra. 
 
 Principal of a girls’school in south Mumbai, Sampada Joshi, said “The programme has pushed activity based learning and it is helping us identify the flaws better but there aren’t enough resources or guidance to help school implement the programme. The teachers must be willing to give extra.” RTE activist, Hemangi Joshi said that the state was expecting schools to progress without allocating funds for the programmes.
 
 Basanti Roy, former board chairperson said it was time a teachers’ job is made more accountable. “Performance linked appraisal could be a right way to ensure that learning levels or class strength increases ,” she said. 
 
 The group will collate the suggestions and submit it to the school education department and education minister, Vinod Tawde.
