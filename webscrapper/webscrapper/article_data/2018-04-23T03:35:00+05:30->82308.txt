Panaji: The department of animal husbandry and veterinary services has been approached by Worldwide Veterinary Service — the sister concern of Mission Rabies — to start a stray dog sterilisation drive for the state, sources said. This comes after Mission Rabies’ three-year long efforts have brought them closer to achieveing their target of rabies-free Goa this year. However, the challenge now is to maintain the same rabies-free standard for years from now, prompting the Worldwide Veterinary Service to step in. “We have to control the dog population too if we intend to maintain Goa’s rabies-free status. For now, we have asked them to submit a project for sterilization of stray dogs, specifically details of the cost per sterilization. The government will then decide how and when to launch this initiative,” said animal husbandry and veterinary services director Santosh Desai. He added that the project will be undertakes in phases. The department already has a sterilization programme amounting to Rs 900 per sterilization under their small animal rescue scheme. So far, the scheme has found no takers, sources said. TOI had reported earlier that the initiative, led by Mission Rabies, had set 2018-year-end as the target to make Goa rabies-free. Statistics shared by them reveal there have been no human rabies cases so far this year. Moreover, the numbers have drastically come down since the operations of Mission Rabies started three years ago.  “Dog numbers are increasing by the day. Right now sterilizations are mostly concentrated in Mapusa and Vasco because the municipalities have been cooperative. We will now concentrate on sterilization with the help of the government.,” said Nigel Otter, chairman of Worldwide Veterinary Service, India. This year, till March, 56,609 students and 2,176 teachers from across 150 Goan schools were educated about rabies and the need for dog vaccination.
