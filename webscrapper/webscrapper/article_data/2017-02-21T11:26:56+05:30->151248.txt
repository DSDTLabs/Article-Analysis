AGRA: Three coaches of Delhi-bound   derailed at Tundla junction in the intervening night of Sunday and Monday.

  The incident took place at around 2.20 am when   rammed into a goods train. However, no causalities were reported in the incident.
 
  According to official sources, the goods train coming from Agra was changing track when the Delhi-bound express train rammed into the last bogie and derailed. “Prima facie, it seems that the loco pilot of the express train got confused and neglected the red signal since all the signals were double yellow on the curve track except one. Yellow signals mean that they can continue moving on the track at slow pace. Since one signal was showing red, he should have applied breaks,” he said.
 
  Amit Malviya, public relations officer of North Central Railway, Allahabad division, said, “No casualties were reported in the incident. We have suspended Devendar Swaroop, the loco pilot, and Sumit Kumar, assistant loco pilot of the express train. A probe has ordered.”
 
  Meanwhile, several trains including New Delhi-Lucknow Shatabdi and New Delhi- Lucknow Gomti Express were cancelled. Over two dozen trains were diverted via Moradabad and Palwal routes.
 
  By evening, the down track was made operational and Anand Vihar-Bhubaneswar superfast was allowed to pass through. An hour later, the up track was also opened for normal traffic.
 
  In January 2010, three persons were killed and 14 others injured when the Kalindi Express train rammed into Kanpur-bound   near Tundla junction amid dense fog.
