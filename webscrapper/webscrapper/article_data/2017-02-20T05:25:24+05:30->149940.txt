PANAJI: The   has demanded that the chief minister make public the details of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between the  ,   ( ) and the state government.

 “The central ministry is on record saying that there was no opposition to the nationalization of Goa’s six rivers. This means that the chief minister lied to Goans and gave a blanket consent to nationalisation,” party president Prabhakar Timble said, adding that the move will turn six rivers—Mandovi, Zuari, Chapora, Mapusa, Sal and Cumbharjua— into coal transportation highways.
 
 The party, on the basis of the reply given by minister of shipping in the Rajya Sabha, asked why the state government gave its consent without consulting stakeholders and political parties.
 
 “Independent MLA Vijai Sardesai had raised the issue in the state assembly and the chief minister had promised that stakeholders would be taken into confidence and that a proper mechanism would be put in place to protect the interest of the people,” Timble said.
 
 The party reiterated its demand for a review petition to be filed by the state government in the Supreme Court’s ruling of banning of all liquor shops along national and state highways across the country. The apex court has also made it clear that licences of existing liquor shops along highways will not be renewed after March 31.
 
 “The government should move the review petition as it was not heard when the order was passed,” Timble said, adding that the government should renew the licences of liquor shop owners for six months instead of one year, pending the consideration of the petition.
