NEW DELHI: The assembly on Monday adopted a resolution seeking restructuring of the   and Steno Cadres within a month and pointed out that   were facing “acute stagnation at all levels” due to the “long-pending” restructuring.

 Social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam, who moved the resolution, said the cabinet had approved the restructuring in December 2015, but it had not materialised till now.
 
 The resolution comes days after some   officers met chief minister   even as the tussle between the bureaucracy and the AAP government was at its peak, thus fuelling rumours of a rift between bureaucrats and lower-ranked officers in the government. 
 
 Gautam was fielded by Kejriwal as a peacemaker to convince the bureaucrats. The resolution was adopted by voice vote and Gautam urged   Anil Baijal to consider the restructuring “on priority”.
 
 He expressed dismay at the delay in the restructuring, which he blamed on the “lackadaisical and indifferent attitude of officers responsible. TNN
