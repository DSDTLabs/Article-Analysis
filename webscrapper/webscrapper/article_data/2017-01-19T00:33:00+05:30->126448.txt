Bhopal: Large-scale Public Bike Sharing (PBS) project is to kick off in Bhopal this February, making it one of the first cities to roll out the scheme.

 BMC will open city’s first cycling track on Hoshangabad Road within a fortnight. The   track will have docked stations for German-made bikes that come with a board computer and integrated electric locks.
 
 Stretching 12 km with 500 bicycles and a central control room, it is going to be one-of-a-kind initiative that will promote non-motorised transport.
 
 The PBS project that boasts of the country’s widest cycling track at 5 metres, is part of the Smart City proposal. 
 
 It will be the first large network, IT-based smart project. Bike rental will cost Rs 10 for first 30 minutes, Rs 20 for an hour and up to Rs 60 for two hours.
 
 “The stations will be connected to a central control room so that cycles can be tracked. In Phase-II, we plan to implement it on an entire 24-km-long BRT corridor with more stations in colonies, markets and public places for better last-mile connectivity,” said Bhopal Smart City Development Corporation (BSCDCL) CEO Chandramauli Shukla.
