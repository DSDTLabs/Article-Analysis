TIRUVANNAMALAI: Three   died and two others sustained serious injuries when the compound wall of a century-old   collapsed in Thiruvudal Street in  .

 The deceased have been identified as K Ramesh, 20, of Edapalayam, M Alamelu, 50, of Pavupattu village and Laxmanan, 50, of Mathur village. 
 
 The injured -- Pongavanam, 45, of Kilpennathur and Abith Hussain, 27, of Tiruvannamalai – were undergoing treatment in Government Tiruvannamalai Medical College Hospital.
 
 The incident happened around 12.15pm when the workers were engaged in digging a trench along the compound wall of the mutt to build a house. They had been engaged by building contractor Mani, Tiruvannamalai superintendent of police R Ponni said.
 
 Dr Srinivasan, a native of Tiruvannamalai, engaged the building contractor to construct a house on a vacant land next to the mutt. Without taking any precautionary measures, the contractor made the workers dig a trench. 
 
 “The old compound wall lost stability and collapsed. The workers were buried under the debris,” said the SP.
 
 Locals acted swiftly and rescued three workers from the debris immediately. They were shifted to hospital, but the doctors declared Ramesh and Alamelu brought dead. Later, fire and rescue services personnel rescued another worker and retrieved the body of Laxmanan.
 
 The condition of Pongavanam and Hussain was said to be critical, said the SP. Police registered a case and began investigations.
 
 It may be recalled that two road construction workers died and another sustained injuries when the compound wall of Ramana Maharishi Ashram along Girivalam path collapsed on December 15 last year.
