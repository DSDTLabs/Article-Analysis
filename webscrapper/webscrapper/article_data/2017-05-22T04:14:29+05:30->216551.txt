NAGPUR: City police are helping a primary school at   at   to reopen by taking action against dreaded ‘Jarman Japan’ gang, which had forcibly ousted the owners from the property in 2012. The   (SIT) of city police arrested one person after registering offence of extortion and threat, among other charges, against nine members of the gang, which has a long criminal history.

 Wasim Khan was arrested by SIT and produced before the court, which remanded him to custody till May 25.

An offence was also registered against Javed Khan and a couple of his accomplices.
 
 Rashid, his sons and their aides had on May 15 threatened Samsunnisa Pathan and her daughter Fatema of dire consequences if they tried to visit the plot again. The gangsters had told the mother-daughter duo that they could get the plot back to resume the educational institution there after paying Rs50 lakh.
 
 Police said Samsunnisa’s husband Mohd Israel Pathan had purchased the 6.5 acre land from Kusumbai Jhungade and Shailaja Wankhede between 1985-1987, when he had formed the Progressive Cooperative Society. Pathan was secretary of the society. On one of the plots, Pathan had started a school which offered education up to standard VIII. After Pathan’s death in 2012, Rashid and his gang had ousted the deceased’s widow Samsunnisa from the place. Apart from shutting down the school, the gang had not even allowed the school to take away the school’s furniture.
 
 Sammunissa and her daughter Fatema decided to approach the SIT since it had recently taken proactive steps to resolve cases against land grabbing mafia under CP K Venkatesh. Under supervision of Addl CP (In-charge), crime and SIT chief Sambhaji Kadam, and ACP, crime, Somnath Waghchoure, the action was initiated after registering an offence at Gittikhadan police station.
