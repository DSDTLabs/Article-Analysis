JALANDHAR: In the aftermath of the death of a large number of fish in the Beas due to molasses of a factory spilling into the river, environmentalist Baba Balbir Singh   has demanded a   on the pollution in the rivers of Punjab to bring out the real picture before the people. 

 He has also said that those responsible for the pollution in rivers and other water channels should be identified in this white paper. “The tragedy in the Beas should come up as a wake-up call for the people of the state and the government. It has received attention of the state but what happened here a few days back has been happening in the Satluj for the last several years and the aquatic life there has already been finished. Those with a conscience should come out and raise their voice for the aquatic life,” he said while addressing a press conference here along with Sant Daya Singh and some other activists.
 
 He said the Ludhiana MC and industry have been throwing effluents into Buddah Nullah, which further flows into the Satluj.
