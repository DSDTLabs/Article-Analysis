JAIPUR/AJMER: Lack of coordination and   of   not paying heed to the continuous updates by the   proved fatal to the Rajasthan police on Wednesday evening when  . A day after 16 policemen were injured and one civilian was killed senior police officers also admitted that they failed to grasp the magnitude of the condolence rally organised by the Rajput community. 

 Only saving grace that helped the Nagaur police to tackle the situation much before it could had created more trouble was deployment of the policemen of Rajput community from a constable to the senior officer. 
 
 According to sources, the intelligence report stated to government that nearly 15,000- 29,000 people of the community will only gather at the condolence meeting by the Rajput community on Wednesday. “It was also stated in the report that the Rajput leaders have no hold on the community and therefore not more than 15,000 to 20,000 people will gather. It made the senior police officers to believe and put deployment accordingly,” said a senior officer of the police headquarters on the condition of anonymity. 
 
 Sources further stated that the community had never shown unity in the recent past even to press demand for reservation for Rajputs in the state. “It was also stated that Rajput community as a whole would be away and indifferent from the rally since Anand Pal was a Ravana Rajput,” said an officer. 
 
 Likewise, it took police by surprise when the calculation stating people of other caste won’t gather. “The miscreants also included people of other cases from Molasar to Merta and from Deedwana to Ladnu so this calculation by state police intelligence was also wrong,” officer added.
