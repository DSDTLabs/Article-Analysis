Panaji: Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) on Thursday said chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s decision to permit the entry of the sixth casino vessel, MV Lucky Seven, in River Mandovi indicated the government’s support for casinos. Congressman Girish Chodankar told reporters that if the BJP was really against  , Parrikar should have approached the Supreme Court seeking relief from the Goa bench of the Bombay high court’s directives.

 Based on a petition by Golden Globe Hotel Private Limited, the high court permitted MV Lucky Seven, owned by former Haryana minister Gopal Kanda, to enter River Mandovi despite unfavourable weather conditions.
 
 “Why else would the government be hell-bent on getting a sixth casino in the Mandovi by flouting rules? It could have appealed to the Supreme Court. If it could appeal for panchayat delimitation, what stopped it from going to the Supreme Court over this?” Chodankar said.
 
 “The BJP government has received money from casinos, may be that is why it is not challenging it,” Chodankar said. He went on to state that the government was pressurizing the Captain of Ports to bring in the casino despite rough weather.
 
 M V Lucky Seven has been anchored at Mormugao harbour and has been waiting to enter River Mandovi since May 19, after the government decided to renew its licence.
 
 Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginald Lourenco decried attempts by owners of the sixth casino vessel to enter Panaji inner port from the Aguada sand bar in the monsoon when the port entry is closed to all vessels. Lourenco told reporters on Thursday that apart from the possibility of vessels being in danger of sinking, staff on the tugs could lose their lives.
