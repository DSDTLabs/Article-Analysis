Expecting the inevitable, most of the affected occupants had removed their belongings well in advance. Mormugao deputy collector  , supervised the operation.
 
 Sources said although 121 structures were slated for demolition, the occupants of 68 had moved the high court of Bombay at Goa, while occupants of another 11 had approached the NGT. Four of the remaining structures had been damaged during a tidal wave, leading the mamlatdar to serve demolition notices to the occupants of 38 structures. Of these 38, the occupants of six subsequently managed to obtain a stay on demolition from the NGT. 
 
 The remaining 32 that had failed to do so, together with two that had earlier approached the tribunal but had failed to get a stay, were finally razed on Thursday. 
 
 Although most of the structures built within the CRZ were temporary, they posed a threat to life and property during rising sea levels in the monsoon.
