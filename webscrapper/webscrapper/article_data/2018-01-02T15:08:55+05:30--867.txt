GANDHINAGAR: While the   government has begun preparing the 2018-19 budget, to be tabled in the assembly in February, chief minister Vijay Rupani’s administration had spent only 55.88% its budget, till December 31, 2017,(in the nine months from April to December). By the end of the financial year in March 2018, at the current average spending rate, the government will spend only 18.63% more. This means that around about 26% of the budget will go unused at the end of March.

 Chief minister   and deputy chief minister   — who holds the finance portfolio — who were sworn in for the second time after the BJP’s victory in the 2017 elections face a challenge to expedite spending by of the government’s mammoth machinery as departments haven’t even shown the ability to spend at the normal rate that the budget would require.
 
  
 A senior officer privy to the development said, “Budget spending is comparatively ok this time, despite restrictions on spending during the almost two months of model code of conduct being in force for the elections. Though in social sector departments like education, spending is above average, the government must separate spending on salaries and similar expenses. Developmental expenditure is more important than average spending percentage.”
 
 “Spending efficiency of a government department also indicates its ability to carry out welfare work. Usually government departments just park their fund by various methods. Not only is spending very low but from the grants allocated, the parking of funds by the most departments with Gujarat State Financial Service Ltd (GSFS) is very high. 
 
 “At present, the total amount of parked funds (not spent and kept idle) is more than Rs 20,000 crore. It is likely to increase substantially as departments have not even been able to spend even last year’s grants, which are parked with GSFS,” added the sources.
