Hyderabad: Realising the significance of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, The Times of India on Tuesday organised an informative session for industry experts, which was attended by prominent developers from the city.

 Exclusively designed for realty majors, the two-hour event was conducted by Vinay T and E Suhail Ahmed from the Bengaluru-based   Consultants LLP, wherein the duo laid down, in detail, the important clauses of the Act that promoters, henceforth, have to abide by while launching their projects.
 
 As per Telangana’s Rera norms, all real estate projects launched on or after January 1 2017 will have to be registered with the state’s Rera authority before they are thrown open for sales.
 
 Among a host of other aspects, the consultants emphasised on the limitations of advertising (builders cannot advertise anything they cannot deliver), the need for promoters to disclose estimated cost of venture, mention specific carpet area and the penalties that they might face if they default, as part of the session.
 
 “It was extremely educative and necessary. Also, it provided us with an insight into the way the Act is being implemented in other states,” said P Sreenivas Reddy, executive director of Rajapushpa Properties Pvt Ltd.
 
 While M Nanda Kishore, managing director of Ramky Estates & Farms Limited, aired concern over plausibility of certain clauses in the Act, he added that Tuesday’s session allowed participants to deliberate and discuss pertinent issues. “Telangana’s norms are clearer than that of other states. They are promoter-friendly and stringent enough to weed out fly-by-night operators,” said Vinay T.
