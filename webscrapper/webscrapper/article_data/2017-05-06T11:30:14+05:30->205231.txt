LUCKNOW:   national president   on Friday said as a politician he has a knack for identifying “asteen ke saanp“ (deceitful people). The comment was being seen as a veiled attack on his estranged uncle   who had, earlier in the day, announced that he would soon launch a secular front.

 Akhilesh, who was talking to the media after presiding over a meeting of the party's cultural wing which was, for the first time, attended by snake-charmers, though said he was unaware of the modalities of the secular front that Shivpal was talking about.
 
 “We samajwadis have always stood the test of times and will continue to do so successfully,“ he said when asked to comment on the possibilities of Shivpal forming a new party. The SP national president said he himself had discussed the prospects of a secular alliance with   chief minister   and that RJD chief had also floated the idea of a grand alliance on the lines of Bihar to counter the communal agenda of the BJP in the country.
 
 Earlier this week, Lalu Prasad had appealed to the non-BJP parties to resolve their diffe rences to form a grand Alliance in order to de feat the saffron party in the next   polls.
 
 “Every party opposed to the BJP should sink its differences and come together to defeat it in 2019 parliamentary election,“ Lalu had said inaugurating a two-day training camp of the RJD in Rajgir (Bihar).
 
 Taking pot shots at chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi, Akhilesh said those who accused the erstwhile SP government of lawlessness should now explain what was happening in   and who was actually behind these incidents.
