Ahmedabad: Various associations of stateâ€™s colleges, their principals,   and administrative staff held a meeting here on Monday, to plan an agitation to press the state government to redress their long-pending issues. The associations unanimously decided to launch an agitation on October 5, when members of all associations will stage dharnas at district headquarters, with the message that wisdom should prevail on the education minister.

 The associations have decided to target minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, because he had held meetings with these organizations and promised to resolve the issues by September. There has been no response from the government about their demands. The employees feel that chances of successfully making the government implement their demands will diminish after the state assembly elections.
 
 The associations have been demanding filling of vacant posts of lecturers, librarians, PT teachers and administrative staff. They also want suitable amendments to the 40-year-old government policy for making grants to educational institutions.
