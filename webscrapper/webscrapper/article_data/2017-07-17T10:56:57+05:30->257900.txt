JAIPUR: Senior police officers said that a few good men and women in Nagaur saved the cops from being burnt alive on July 12 when a memorial service held for the slain gangster turned violent.

 “Stories of violence of such barbaric nature on the police are unheard of, at least, in Rajasthan. Some GRP constables were beaten and doused in kerosene,” said additional DGP (law and order) NRK Reddy on Sunday.
 
 However, rescue came in the nick of time for the GRP constables when a 45-year-old ex-BSF constable, a Rajput himself, stopped the crowd from burning the cops alive. “We cannot disclose the identity of the man. But at that terrifying hour, he spit on the burning matchsticks and stood in front of the irate mob,” Reddy said. This act of standing up to the mob opened a short window for GRP constables to escape.
 
 “Not everybody has taken sides with the gangster. And this is a true testimony of our state and our cultural ethos. Of course, the images coming from Nagaur were disturbing as railway tracks were uprooted and the station damaged. But we also have people who put their lives at risk to save cops,” Reddy told TOI, adding that the uniforms of police officials were torn and their wallets and purses snatched by the rowdy crowd.
 
 The ADGP said that the ticket counter of Sanvarad railway station was ransacked and money was looted. But the most horrifying incident of the violence was when IPS officer Monica Sain was assaulted when she went to rescue GRP constables.
 
 “There were reports of the female IPS officer being molested. This is completely false. A few Rajput women helped her to escape. They warned the mob and gave Sain a traditional dress. She wore it and escaped,” Reddy added.
