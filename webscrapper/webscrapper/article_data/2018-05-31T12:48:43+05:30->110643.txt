PATIALA: Even as the local bodies' department chief vigilance officer S S Manik on Wednesday sent a team to verify 'irregularities' in the execution of some Patiala   corporation projects, the civic body refuted all charges. 

 
 A team headed by executive engineer (XEN)   from the local bodies' department in Chandigarh visited the officials and the private residence of Patiala mayor  , who is on a 15-day trip to the US and is scheduled to return next week. They also went to the Patiala MC office to collect records related to the works allegedly undertaken by the civic body without following rules and regulations.
 
 Meanwhile, Patiala municipal commissioner   said a section of media had reported that some works had been executed without floating tenders, which was totally incorrect. Khaira said they had received proposals for six works, including installing a neon signboard on top of the Patiala MC building and laying of tile road inside the mayor's residence and renovation of auditorium of the PMC.
 
 He said after the Patiala MC House passed resolutions related to these works, tenders were floated recently and none of these works was executed without following the due procedure.
 
  Without, giving the details of their findings, the XEN said they would submit a report to the officer at Chandigarh. Mayor Bittu could not be contacted for his comments.
