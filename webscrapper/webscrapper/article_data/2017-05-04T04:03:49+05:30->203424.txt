NOIDA: An entrepreneur got the shock of his life when he received an   of Rs 23.85 lakh. 

 Mahesh Kumar Palta has urged officials in the power department as well as MP Mahesh Sharma to bail him out but so far there has been no action.
 
 The bill is for the months of February and March with a deadline of May 15.
 
 Palta, an entrepreneur for the last 40 years, has been operating out of his unit in A-35, Sector 7, Noida, where he has a connection of 23kVA. Palta claimed he has been paying all his bills, which range usually from Rs 6,000 to Rs 7,000, on time. He shared a list of his payments and a copy of the exorbitant bill with TOI.
 
 When contacted, Mukul Singhal, superintending engineer, told TOI that the earlier bills served to Palta had some computer-generated errors. 
 
 “As a result, the correct bills have not reached him. The present bill of Rs 23.85 lakh was a result of arrears and correction based on final checks,” Singhal said, adding that Palta was free to meet him for clarifications.
