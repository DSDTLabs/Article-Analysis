CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Wednesday directed the   government to take a decision on the representation seeking 75% subsidy for disabled people under the 'Amma Two Wheeler Scheme'. 

 Justice K   passed the order while disposing a plea moved by Tamil Nadu Associations for the Rights of All Types of Differently Abled and Care Givers (TARATDAC). The association also wanted the court to extend the time limit for disabled persons to file applications under the scheme .
 
 According to the petitioner, section 24 of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 prescribes that the quantum of assistance in such schemes to disabled persons should be at least 25% higher than the assistance applicable to others. The government is providing 50% subsidy to general applicants under the scheme.
 
 According to S  , secretary of the association, one lakh working women will reap benefits from the scheme. The scheme provides 4% reservation to disabled persons and as such 4,000 disabled persons will be benefited.
 
 The association sent representation to the authorities on January 2 and February 5 seeking additional subsidy and an extension for submitting applications under the scheme. Since no action was taken on the representation, the petitioner has moved the high court.
