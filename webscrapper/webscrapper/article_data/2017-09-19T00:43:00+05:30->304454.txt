Trichy: Burglars made an unsuccessful attempt to break into a furniture showroom at K K Nagar in the city in the early hours of Monday apparently after sensing police patrolling in the area. The police seized a passenger van and inner garments stolen from another shop in the same area near the showroom. 

 It was around 3 am that a couple of policemen attached to KK Nagar police station, who were patrolling the area, spotted a passenger van parked in front of a furniture showroom at Sabari mill bus stop in Anand Nagar. Sensing something amiss about the way the van was parked, the policemen came closer when they found the lock of the main door of the furniture shop broken. KK Nagar police said that the burglars had fled the scene on hearing the sound from the walkie talkie of the policemen. The miscreants had succeeded in breaking open one of the two locks by then. They abandoned their attempt halfway on seeing the patrol team approaching and left the van behind. 
 
 The police opened the van and found a bunch of brand new inner garments. On being intimated, the owner of the furniture showroom, Mohammed Ashik from KK Nagar, rushed to the spot.
