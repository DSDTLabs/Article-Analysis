Perambalur: A speeding van ploughed into a group of pilgrims from Cuddalore district undertaking a padayatra to   in Trichy, killing two women and injuring four others, near Padalur in Peramblur district on Saturday morning. 

 The deceased were identified as S Manimekalai, 27, of Aalambadi in Thittakudi Taluk in Cuddalore district and S Murugayi, 50. The victims were part of a group of 50 pilgrims from Thittakudi taluk in Cuddalore. 
 
 Police said the van was heading to Trichy from Chennai when it went out of control and ploughed into the group near Naranamangalam at Padalur on the Chennai â€“ Trichy national highway. While Manimegalai succumbed to the injuries on the spot, Murugayi was badly injured. She was taken to a government hospital in Perambalur where she died without responding to treatment. Four more devotees injured in the accident were also admitted to the hospital. The Padalur police took up the investigation and arrested the van driver, Vignesh, a resident of Udayarpalayam in Ariyalur district.
 
 It may be recalled that several people on pilgrimage to Samayapuram temple and Palani temple in Dindigul district have lost their lives in similar accidents in the past few months. Most of the accidents occurred in the night hours and in the early hours of the day due to the poor visibility. Due to the lack of adequate walking space along the highway, pilgrims are forced to walk on the road and become victims to such accidents. 
 
 A few months ago, the Trichy rural police had issued reflectors to the devotees of Palani temple to wear them on their clothes to alert drivers on the highway.
