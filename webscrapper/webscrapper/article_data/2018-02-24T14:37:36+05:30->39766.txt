PATNA: The state   has asked all schools to get a   ( ) or speed governor installed in the buses carrying children. It has also asked schools to ensure that buses do not run at a speed of more than 40km/hour.

 Though a deadline for the same has not been fixed yet, transport department sources said the schools would be told to implement the order at the earliest. In case a bus is caught without the SLD, its road permit and fitness certificate will be cancelled, they said.
 
 A notification in this regard was issued on Thursday and letters have also been sent to the divisional commissioners, district magistrates, superintendents of police (SPs) and traffic SPs.
 
 The letter also asked the officials concerned to implement the direction given by the Supreme Court-appointed committee on road safety and suspend the licences of bus operators for at least three months if their vehicles are found running at a speed beyond the specified limit. The   had issued 25 directions to the states in November last year, including installation of SLDs in school buses.
 
 The Union ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) had earlier directed all states to install speed governor in vehicles registered before October 1, 2015. According to a notification issued by MoRTH in April 2015, vehicles such as buses, trucks and mini buses need to install speed governors to limit their speed to 80km per hour.
