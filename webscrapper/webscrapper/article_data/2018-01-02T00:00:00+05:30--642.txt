Usually, promo songs are done to promote films before their theatrical releases. But   tells us that she recently shot for a song for a   film so that she could use it to garner audience's attention before releasing the movie online. 

 The actress, who was recently seen in Brahmma.Com in Kollywood, says, “The number in question is a folk song, Saiyyan Mile Ladkaiyan; it talks about the rich cultural heritage of   and has been sung by several popular folk singers previously. We’d recreated it for  , a Bhojpuri film that I produced with my brother, filmmaker  , helming it. The song was part of the movie’s soundtrack, but we shot its video only recently. Ganesh   has choreographed it and we released it online recently.”
 
 The film had a theatrical release in 2011 so that it could be considered for the National Awards. Neetu adds, “The movie was appreciated at several Indian and international festivals, but unfortunately, we couldn’t manage to get enough screens for the film commercially. People usually assume that Bhojpuri films and songs are vulgar and sexist, but this one’s not like that. So, I wanted more people to see the film and hence, shot for this song, which is more about the state’s culture.”
