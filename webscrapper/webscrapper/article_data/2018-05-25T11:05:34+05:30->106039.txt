NEW DELHI: After the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games, the traditional saree, which had long been associated with the Indian women athletes during the opening and closing ceremonies of the multi-sport events, has now been wrapped and packed off for the forthcoming Jakarta-Palembang   as well.

 
 
 
 Carrying on with its   decision, the   (IOA) has decided to leave out the saree from the opening and closing ceremonies of the Asiad, scheduled to be held in two Indonesian cities from August 18 to September 2. Instead, the attire will be replaced by blue trousers and navy blue blazer, similar to the men’s dress.
 
 
 
 This decision was taken after getting a feedback from the women athletes post the Gold Coast Games, where the regular combination of saree and blazer for women athletes made way for blue trousers and blazer embellished with the Indian logo. The men athletes, too, had exchanged their traditional ‘bandhgalas’ for the modern attire of trousers and blazer. At the Rio Olympics, the women athletes had worn the blazer over a yellow saree.
 
 Confirming the development, IOA secretary general   said: “We have decided that the two ceremonies at the Asiad will see the entire contingent maintaining a uniform dress code. The women athletes will sport the same attire they wore during the Gold Coast CWG.”
 
 At the time of taking the decision prior to the CWG, the IOA had cited comfort level as one of the reasons behind doing away with the tradition of wearing a saree. The decision was taken after consulting several women athletes who were of the view that for many, wearing a saree required taking help from others. Many women athletes had often complained in the past about the discomfort the saree caused during such ceremonies.
