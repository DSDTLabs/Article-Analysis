PANAJI: A new brinjal   which has been scientifically developed to grow without being susceptible to bacterial wilt, is being promoted by the directorate of agriculture. Called the 262-4 brinjal, this variety will soon hit shelves of the horticulture outlets across the state.

 “This brinjal has a decent shelf life of up to three days which makes it a marketable item,” said agriculture director  . Currently what is available in the local markets are the Agasaim, Taleigao and   varieties of brinjal.
 
 “The seed itself is developed in such a way that when it crops, the produce has resistance to wilt,” said experts from the   ( ) central coastal agricultural research institute, Old Goa.
 
 “The brinjals were tested with the horticulture department. They have given the green signal so we will take this project further with appropriate permissions from the directorate of agriculture,” said director, ICAR-CCARI, E Chakurkar. “We will be distributing the seeds to farmers. Once the plant is grown and the brinjals are ready to be plucked, the difference between the regular ones and these will be visible. We can collaborate with the horticulture department to sell them at outlets across the state,” he said.
 
 “Variety 262-4 is among the better ones so we will be popularizing it now. Slowly we will introduce the other varieties as well so that the resistance to wilt disease is built in this crop,” Figueiredo said.
