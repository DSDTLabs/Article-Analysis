Then they went to the woman's home to ask for water. But somehow a quarrel broke out and they started beating her up. They punched her in the mouth and the head. Eventually, the old woman fell unconscious. This was when Sarkar raped her."
 
 Varpe said that soon, the woman regained conscious and started crying for help. "Sikhdhar told us he and Sarkar panicked. Sikhdhar said the woman bit him on the hand and furious at this, he, too, raped her. The duo then strangled her before fleeing."
