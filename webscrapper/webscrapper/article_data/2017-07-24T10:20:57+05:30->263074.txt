CHENNAI:   achieved her career best-ranking of 36 in the individual women's sabre category at the latest released list by the  . Bhavani, who became the first from India to win gold at the World Cup satellite tournament at Reykjavik earlier this year, said the rise in rankings couldn't have come at a better time. "It is a recognition for the efforts I have put in my game right through the season. The World Cup win in Reykjavik gave me a lot of self-belief," Bhavani told TOI on Sunday. Bhavani was ranked 57 in the world at that point of time.

 Bhavani finished in the quarters at the ensuing Asian fencing championships at Hong Kong and was part of the recently-concluded   championships in Germany. Bhavani, who will turn 24 next month, feels her Italian coach   brought the best out of her. "I have been training with him in Italy since March this year and we both share a great understanding. He knows how to motivate or improve my game," Bhavani added.
 
 On his part, Zanotti believes Bhavani has only gone from strength to strength. "In every session, I give her some objective and we work on that. I always explain to her to showcase her quality of fencing in competitions without worrying about result. She is a quick-learner and her tactics and techniques have improved well," Zanotti told TOI in an earlier interview.
 
 Bhavani hopes the rise in rankings will benefit her monetarily. "I am happy to be getting the desired results and hope to get a few more sponsorships now as that will definitely help me concentrate on the game," said Bhavani, who will arrive in India on July 28 from Italy. With the new season starting in October, Bhavani hopes to work on her fitness during the off-season. "Working on my fitness is crucial since that'll keep me in good stead for the upcoming season. The aim will be to win more medals for the country," said Bhavani.
