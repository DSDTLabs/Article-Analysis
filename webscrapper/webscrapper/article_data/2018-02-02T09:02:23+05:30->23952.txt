The January transfer window slammed shut on Wednesday after a frantic month of activity during which Barcelona completed the biggest deal by signing   from Liverpool and Premier League clubs spent heavily across the board. 

 
 Below we take a look at the biggest transfer deals in Europe’s major leagues.
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 Liverpool made   the world’s most expensive defender by splashing out a world record £75m to sign the Dutchman from Southampton. 
 
 The improvement in the squad was undermined by the departure of Brazil attacking midfielder Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona for a transfer fee reported at about £142m. 
 
 Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has also not been afraid to spend big on defenders — his signing of French centre-half Aymeric Laporte from Athletic Bilbao for a club record fee of £57m means they have spent more than £200m on defenders and a keeper since the end of last season. 
 
 Alexis Sanchez opted to join rivals Manchester United with Armenia midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan moving the opposite way. 
 
 Arsenal splashed out a club-record transfer fee to sign Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for a reported 65 million pounds from Borussia Dortmund. 
 
 They also got a pleasant surprise when Germany midfielder Mesut Ozil signed a new contract until 2021, though their France striker Olivier Giroud was shipped out to rivals Chelsea.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 Barcelona will feel the most pleased of all the Liga sides with their January transfer business after capturing coveted playmaker Philippe Coutinho and signing Colombia defender Yerry Mina. 
 
 Champions Real Madrid have strangely not boosted their squad to help their crumbling campaign. Spain goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga had passed a medical with Real and was on the verge of a move but eventually signed a new contract with Athletic Bilbao. 
 
 Atletico Madrid got a huge lift with Spain forwards Diego Costa and Vitolo able to play for them.
