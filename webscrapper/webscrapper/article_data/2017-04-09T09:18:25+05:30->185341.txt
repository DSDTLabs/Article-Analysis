LUCKNOW: Deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma said on Saturday that UP chief minister Adiya Nath   had shattered the myth that every successful man had a woman to thank for his success. 

 Making light of Yogi’s bachelorhood during the release of ‘The Governor’s Guide’, a book by SS Upadhyay, the legal adviser to Raj Bhawan, Sharma also said his own experience of married life was equally limited, considering he had only been married for six years. Sharma’s comments not only drew laughs from the CM, who was present during the programme, but also from his ministerial colleague and deputy CM Keshav Maurya, UP Governor  , Speaker of the UP Assembly,  , and also the audiences attending the programme. 
 
 Commending Yogi’s steady rise in politics, Sharma said, “Unki safalta mein patni ka koi haath nahi hai.” The subject of wives came up when the gathering began discussing the role of wives in moulding the success stories of their husbands. While people praised Yogi for rising to such heights in his career without “a wife behind his success,” Naik commented on how people in UP referred to their wives as “dharm patni” versus the commonly used “patni” in Maharashtra, his home state. 
 
 Ram Manohar Lohia law University vice-chancellor Dr Gurdeep Singh, meanwhile, said Upadhyay had credited his wife for being able to write ‘The Governor’s Guide’, but had not thanked her for it, publicly. Upadhyay, admitting his guilt, said he would rectify his mistake soon after the programme. Drawing laughter from the crowds, he also said he would let his wife know he was grateful to her for backing him in his book writing venture.
