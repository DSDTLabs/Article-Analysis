BENGALURU: The Union sports ministry's attempt at a fitness audit of its coaches has come to a halt with just a day to go for the first leg, with a communication from the   (SAI) on Tuesday stating that the exercise has been deferred.

 The ministry had stated recently that it would subject its coaches over 50 years of age to a series of tests to ascertain their fitness levels. It had even stated that those who fail the tests would be forced to retire.
 
 According to the original programme, coaches from all centres were to converge in New Delhi for the tests. But the plan was dropped considering the expenses, logistical challenges and the magnitude of the exercise. Soon, a central team was formed to travel to SAI centres around the country to supervise the tests.
 
 Sonepat was the team's first stop with the battery of tests scheduled on July 20 and 21. Bengaluru was next (July 24 and 25) where 66 coaches from Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh were asked to report.
