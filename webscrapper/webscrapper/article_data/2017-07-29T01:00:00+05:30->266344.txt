Covers with vocalists giving their own touch to popular tracks are passé. Certainly not one to adhere to the norm, this band recreates its own version to popular numbers like 'Mera Saaya', 'Ranjish Hi Sahi' and ' ' with the help of instruments alone. This six-member band The Revisit Project comprises   (saxophonist), Abhijit Sood (drummer), Sayan Sinha (bassist), Raaed Ehsaan Azim (keyboardist),   (guitarist) and   (percussionist).

 
 Minus a vocalist, the band’s focus is to work hard on its sounds in order to develop a distinct character. The idea of having contemporary arrangements of Indian classics was conceived by Abhay, who believes that the only way to make music is to have a hold on one’s roots. Says Abhay, “My band members and I have taken inspiration from old composers and so, we planned to bring back the forgotten melodies of Madan Mohan, SD Burman, OP Nayyar among other stalwarts of yesteryears through our instruments. That’s also one of the reasons why we have named our band ‘The Revisit Project’ — the name completes our concept of keeping the tradition and making something out of it.”
 
 
 While their music is heavily influenced by funk, jazz fusion and 80’s pop music, they concentrate more on the sound than the genre. Their inspiration comes from musicians like AR Rahman, Jaco Pastorius, Cannonball Adderley and   all of who believed in their music and went all out in trying to take it to the next level.
