HYDERABAD: Their acrobatic skills were seen to be believed. Union home minister   was in awe. So was the top Telangana police brass, retired   officers and others. Not just their feats and tactical show, the mock drill showcased by the   commandos also floored one and all during the inauguration of the NSG regional centre at Ibrahimpatnam. 

 The commandos exhibited their skills during the mock drill, including re-enacting the famous rescue-cum-counter-offensive tactics during the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack, wherein they were air-dropped from helicopters.
 
 Sliding technique to move from one building to another, spiderman technique wherein explosives will be used by commandos for forced entry into a building, a technique where a bamboo will be used to climb a building when resources are limited, dropping commandos from helicopter on a building's terrace, assault dog technique and using rugged vehicle in tackling terrorists while on the move. Not just these, the commandos showcased their prowess and other techniques on how they tackle terrorists.
 
 Director general, NSG, Sudeep Lakhtakia said they have conducted joint exercises with the   and France as part of capacity-building efforts. There are 600 trained commandos at the Hyderabad centre, he said. "Ever since NSG was set up, our commandos have taken part in 115 counter-terror/counter-hijacking operations and gunned down 60 terrorists. Nineteen commandos were killed in these operations," he said.
