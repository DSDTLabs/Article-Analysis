NEW DELHI: On Wednesday morning, the equity markets opened with modest gains but slipped into the red in the first half an hour of trading.

  On Monday, the indices had overturned the correction phase by gaining almost 300 points.
 
 30-share BSE   opened with a gain of 136 points on 34,436.98 while the broader 50-share NSE   reclaimed the 10,500-mark, gaining 63 points. However, by 9.42 am, Sensex was down 22 points.
 
 State-run   were once again having a bad day with the Nifty PSU Bank sub-index losing more than a per cent in early trade. Rising bad loans and poor third quarter results of PSU banks have had a bearing on these scrips. IT and realty stocks were gaining the most.
 
 Among blue-chip stocks, Bharti Airtel, Wipro, Adani Ports and   were in the green. Infratel, PowerGrid and   were bleeding the most.
