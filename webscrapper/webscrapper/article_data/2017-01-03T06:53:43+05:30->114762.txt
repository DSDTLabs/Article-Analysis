LUCKNOW: Deciding Lucknow’s position on the   rankings is in the hands of city residents. 

 A team from the ministry of urban development would take feedback from people on various   like installing dustbins, attendance of sanitation workers, door-to-door   status, rise in the number of public toilets in comparison to last year and overall cleanliness. 
 
 The responses would be through LMC’s various grievance redressal portals—the control room, online portal and Swachhata App.
 
 The team will be in the city from Wednesday to Friday. The city would be marked on three board parameters— functioning of municipal body (900 marks), independent observation of sites (500 marks) and citizen’s feedback (600 marks).
 
 Additional municipal commissioner PK Srivastava said, “This time, the competition is tougher as 500 cities with over 1 lakh population are competing compared to last year’s 73 cities of over 10 lakh population. Last time, we scored a poor rank because of poor reviews by citizens and incomplete status of the solid waste management plant. This year, we hope to do better.”
 
 While   would be marked on the biometric system of workers’ attendance, regular user charge collection and sweeping of commercial areas twice every day, site observation will be done in every zone in areas like railway station, planned colonies, private colonies and religious places. 
 
 Srivastava said people who download the Swachhata App on their mobile phone and register a complaint on it would help LMC score better as the corporation would be marked on the number for downloads and speedy redressal of complaints.
