CHENNAI: Business travellers staying on   may soon be able to down a peg or two without driving into the city as the   has directed the state government to take a call on whether hotels on highways in the suburbs can serve liquor.

 The move is expected to be a fillip to the hospitality industry which has more than 2,000 rooms in 40 hotels catering mainly to executives from IT companies on the OMR. 
 
  
  
 
 These hotels have been losing business as their bars remain shuttered after an earlier order of the Supreme Court that said liquor could not be served within 500 metres of a highway. 
 
 S Rajiv, an IT professional, said, “Many hotels opened to cater to the IT industry in the last five years. But they suffered losses after the ban on bars. People used to travel to the city braving traffic to visit bars and pubs.”
 
 In an order on Friday, a bench comprising   and Justices Amitava Roy and   said “it was inclined to allow the state governments to make the determination since it was a question of fact as to whether an area covered by a local self-governing body is proximate to a municipal agglomeration or is sufficiently developed as to warrant the application of the same principle.”
 
 Though bars in about 550 hotels and clubs within major cities and towns were reopened following the Supreme Court’s clarification last year that its order did not cover the municipal areas, the rest located in village panchayats on the highways sharing borders with corporations remained shut. A number of hotels on OMR beyond Sholinganallur are located in panchayats. 
 
 This is the second general direction by the Supreme Court since its December 2016 order banning sale of liquor within 500 metres of national and state highways. Later, in July 2017, it issued a direction exempting highways inside cities. 
 
 When contacted, official sources with the prohibition and excise department said that legal opinion would be sought regarding the Supreme Court’s direction.
