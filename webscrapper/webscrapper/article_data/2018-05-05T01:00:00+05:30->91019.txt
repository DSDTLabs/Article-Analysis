  When we asked Vijayendra about the trip, he told us, “This has been my best work experience. Betaab Valley is so gorgeous and our entire team is enjoying the schedule. I am hoping to explore more areas within the next few days of my stay here. I have experienced weather like this after a really long time and it’s going to be hard to go back to the hot Mumbai weather.”
