Jalandhar: Seizure of 20 excavators from six mining sites in Nawanshahr district has brought to light flagrant violation of an important condition laid down in environmental clearance which prohibits mechanical excavation at small mining sites.

 Sources in the mining department revealed that mechanical excavation was allowed at mining sites larger than 25 hectares, and there are only a few sites which are bigger. “However excavators are being used at each and every site with impunity. It is only due to mechanical excavation that high number of tippers were being loaded at a fast pace at these sites. Sticking to manual excavation would make possible much fewer number of tippers which can be loaded,” said a source.
 
 “The contractors have excavated deeper and beyond the prescribed demarcation of their sites with the help of mechanical excavators which take only a few minutes to take out truckload of sand,” the source said.
 
 Sources also revealed that following consistent demand from mining contractors, department had represented to the state environment impact assessment authority (SEIAA) that use of excavators be allowed at smaller sites also, but the authority refused. “On Tuesday, the department received a communiqué from SEIAA rejecting its representation,” said the source.
 
 While director (mining) Kumar Rahul did not take phone calls, general manager of industries and mining department Mukesh Khanna, who has recently been given additional charge of Nawanshahr, confirmed that mechanical excavation was allowed only at bigger sites.
