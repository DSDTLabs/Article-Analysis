COIMBATORE: Calling Padmaavat — the period drama   directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali — a ‘wonderful movie’,   president   on Friday appealed to all Hindu outfits to stop protests against it.

 He changed his view after watching the film, Sampath told reporters. “The film has been receiving opposition from Hindu outfits. A message is being spread among the members of the Hindu outfits that queen   is insulted in the film. I saw the film on Thursday and changed my view. In fact, the film has honoured the queen,” said Sampath.
 
 “It is a wonderful movie. I appreciate its makers. I am sure the protesters will change their view after watching it. We suspect there is politics behind the protests. Hindu outfits in the northern parts of India should withdraw their protests against the movie immediately. All Indians should watch the movie to know the truth,” he said.
 
 If Hindu Makkal Katchi comes to power in Tamil Nadu, it will promote poet Subramania Bharati’s Thamizh Thaai Vaazhthu (invocation to Tamil mother) instead of the the Tamizh Thaai Vaazhthu written by Manonmaniam Sundaram Pillai, Sampath said. “The DMK government had introduced Sundaram Pillai’s poem in 1970 to promote the Dravidian culture,” Sampath said.
 
 “We respect the current version of Tamizh Thaai Vaazhthu only because we respect the law of the land. We are also against the National Anthem, which was written to welcome the British. We want Vande Mataram to be our National Anthem,” he added.
