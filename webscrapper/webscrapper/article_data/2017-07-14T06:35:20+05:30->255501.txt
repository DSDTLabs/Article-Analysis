CHENNAI: In a bid to ease   on  , Chennai traffic police have asked   not to use the Alandur metro station and   head post office as pick-up points for passengers.

 The move came after complaints of major traffic chaos during peak hours caused by omni buses halting at these spots. A meeting was convened with the Omni Bus Owners Association in Chennai by senior traffic police officials on Thursday to ease traffic congestion on GST Road. 
 
 During the meeting, members of the association were briefed about the traffic gridlock due to the parking of omni buses at the Alandur metro station and head post office to pick up passengers.
 
 In order to ease the congestion, they were requested to stop their buses on Inner Ring Road opposite Officers Training Academy to pick up their passengers and take a right turn towards   to enter GST Road.
 
 The omni bus operators agreed to the arrangements suggested by police and promised their full cooperation, a press release said.
