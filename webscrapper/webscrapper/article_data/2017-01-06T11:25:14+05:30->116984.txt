VADODARA: The Baroda Cricket Association’s (BCA) managing committe will meet soon to decide on the implementation of   recommendations.

 With the   directing all state cricket associations to follow the recommendations, senior office-bearers and managing committee members will have to quit from their posts. 
 
 “After SC order, it is a matter of time that the office-bearers who are ineligible for the posts would quit. We will have to discuss about how the new faces will administrate,” the official said. “There is still a lack of clarity on whether we can appoint a new president or we will have to wait for the administrator who will be appointed at the BCCI,” the official added. 
 
 With many senior office-bearers from other state cricket associations resigning, pressure is mounting on BCA officals to quit as early as possible. From royal scion   to former president, Chirayu Amin and Dr  , the heavyweights will be on their way out. Gaekwad has already said that he will abide by the SC order and quit. But he is currently locked in a legal battle over his presidency at the BCA. 
 
 The matter is now in the Gujarat high court that may take a decision on January 10.
