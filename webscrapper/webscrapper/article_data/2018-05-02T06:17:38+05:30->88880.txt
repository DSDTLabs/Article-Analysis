PANAJI: Director general of police   has ordered a departmental inquiry against police sub-inspector  , who was caught on camera kicking a citizen as his friend’s body lay nearby. The video subsequently went viral on social media and attracted heaps of scorn from netizens. 

 The order came after Chander received an inquiry report on the incident prepared by deputy superintendent of police Uttam Raut Desai. The report states that Redkar, who is attached to the Sanguem police station, kicked the citizen as he wasn’t cooperating with the investigation. 
 
 Chander said that public non-cooperation cannot justify a police officer assaulting anyone. “However unreasonable or uncooperative a member of the public may be, the officer isn’t authorised to kick anyone,” he said. 
 
 After the video went viral, Chander had ordered the report. Pending the inquiry, Redkar was shunted to the Goa police reserve force. 
 
 The body lying near the site of the assault was established to be that of Siddesh Buli, a friend of the victim, Sebastiao Colaco. Bulli had drowned a short while before the assault. Colaco and Bulli, both from Margao, went to Sanguem for a swim. Bulli is believed to have drowned. Police said that preliminary inquiries revealed that while recording the incident, Colaco wasn’t cooperating. This apparently angered Redkar, who spewed abuses at Colaco in Konkani before kicking him.
 
 Police also had identified the boy who filmed the incident on his mobile and questioned him.
