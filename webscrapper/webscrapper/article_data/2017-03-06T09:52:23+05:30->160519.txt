VIJAYAWADA:   briefly came to a   after  , Gouravaram and Anumanchepalli staged a   on Saturday night. 

 The villagers alleged that poor lighting system on the highway has been causing a number of mishaps in the area and criticised the toll management for taking money without caring for the road. The protesters even stalled the operations, resulting in stranding of vehicles on a stretch of 500 m. 
 
 Soon, the Chillakallu police intervened and controlled the protesters. They assured them that they will arrange a meeting with the toll management over the issue. Locals complained that the lighting system along the highway are not working. Since many of the villagers either walk or commute by cycles, the locals point out that it is difficult for speeding vehicles to take note of them.
 
 "The toll management is collecting money from people but they do not bother to rectify the problem because of which many people are losing their lives," Ramaiah, an agitator said.
 
 "We were forced to resort to protests as the memoranda presented by us to the officials have fallen on the deaf ears," Ramaiah added.
