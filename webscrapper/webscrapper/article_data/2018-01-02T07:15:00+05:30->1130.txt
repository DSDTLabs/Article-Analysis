GURUGRAM:   DHBVN has imposed a penalty of Rs 1.31 crore on violators in the   in December, reflecting a progressive decline in the amount levied as penalty over the last few months. Discom officials have attributed this to the frequency of surprise raids. 

 “During winters, theft cases naturally come down. Nevertheless, we are faring better this time, compared to the last two winters,” explained superintendent engineer K C Aggarwal. “We have employed a number of new techniques to bring down theft. We’re also replacing over 400 km of bare conductors in Gurgaon with coated XLP cables. Bare conductors are more prone to being pilfered from.” 
 
 The discom’s data, exclusively released to TOI, shows that 201 theft cases were apprehended this December alone, and the discom has levied penalty to the tune of Rs 1.31 crore. While 99 theft cases were recorded in the sub-urban division, 102 were recorded in the   division. In November, the discom apprehended 294 theft cases and levied Rs 1.56 crore as penalty.
