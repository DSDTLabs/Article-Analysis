NEW DELHI: Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari’s push for electric taxi service in his hometown Nagpur has hit a roadblock, thanks to archaic rules in Maharashtra.

 In Maharashtra, only vehicles of more than 980 CC engine capacity can be registered for commercial operations and these have to be of at least 1,400 CC for high-end service. But electric vehicles don't fall under this category since their engine capacity is defined in terms of kilowatts (KW).
 
 The condition has stumped the Centre at a time when the government is pushing for electric vehicles to check pollution and reduce India’s dependence on crude oil imports. The taxi service is scheduled for launch on May 26.
 
 “Each taxi shall have engine capacity of not less than 980 CC with seating capacity not exceeding seven including driver; provided that at least 50% the total taxis attached to any aggregator shall have engine capacity of 1400 CC or more,” states the 2016 taxi rules. Sources said the   has sent the proposal to the state government for a final call. However, state transport minister Diwakar Raote told TOI, “The announcement of launching electric taxis has been announced by Union minister  . Nothing has reached me. So, I can’t comment.”
