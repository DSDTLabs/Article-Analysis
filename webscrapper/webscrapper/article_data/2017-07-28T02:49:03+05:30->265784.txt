 superstar Akshay   today narrated an incident from his own life to highlight the risk children face in day-to-day life, and importance of communication to identify sexual predators. 

 He was speaking at an   conference on human trafficking here. 
 
 "Let me share my own experience with you all here. When I was a very young kid, a lift-man once touched me inappropriately. 
 
 "Since I had good communication with my parents, I told them about this incident," he said. 
 
 Later the same person was caught in another case and was found to be a habitual offender, the actor said. 
 
 Parents and children must have a free interaction so that such offenders are identified immediately, Kumar said.
