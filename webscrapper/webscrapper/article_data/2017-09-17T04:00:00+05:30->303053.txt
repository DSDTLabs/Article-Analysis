Rajkot: It seems that rains have heralded the arrival of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and may play a spoilsport in his programmes in Amreli on Sunday. 

 The Forward High School ground, where Modi is slated to address a public meeting, has been waterlogged following heavy rains on Saturday. “Amreli city received about 35 mm of rainfall till Saturday evening, which created waterlogging at the Forward High School ground. 
 
 There are big and small puddles at several places in the ground from where we are pumping the water out,” an official from Amreli district administration said. 
 
 Apart from waterlogging, gale accompanied by torrential rains have blown away banners of Modi. “We are trying to place back the banners where they had been put earlier,” the official added.
 
 Modi is scheduled to arrive in Amreli on Sunday, which is also his birthday. 
 
 State home minister Pradipsinh Jadeja, who was in Amreli on Saturday to oversee the preparations being made by the district administration for Modi’s visit, told reporters, “The PM is coming to participate in Sahkar Panchotsav Karyakram. He will arrive at 2.30 pm and depart at 5.30 pm. The PM will dedicate the newly built Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Market Yard to public and perform the ritual of ‘bhumi pujan’ at the state-of-the-art ice cream plant at Amar Dairy and Kisan Training Centre. He will also inaugurate the newly built dairy processing plant and pashudan factory.”
 
 Jadeja said earlier when Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat, he had held a public meeting as part of election campaign for the Lok Sabha election. “Several government schemes had been launched by Modi from Amreli,” Jadeja said.
