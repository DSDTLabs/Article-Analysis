Mumbai: Nearly one year after they lost their elder son, Raghavendran Ganesan, to blasts that rocked Brussels, the Bhayander family is keen on their younger son returning to India and staying with them. 

 Chandrasekhar, the younger son, was keen on pursuing his PhD in Germany, where he is currently completing his postgraduation. He and his father, C Ganesan, are currently in Brussels to pay homage to the memory of victims. The Belgium government invited the families of the victims from 22 nations to attend the opening of a memorial of 32 birch trees dedicated to them, at the heart of the Sonian Forest. 
 
 Raghvendran’s son, Arjun, turned one on February 2. His wife, Vaishali, and son live with his parents at Nirmal Park Housing Society in Bhayander. Struggling hard to hold back her tears, late Raghvendran’s mother, Annapoorni, said that the family is trying hard to move on despite the irreparable loss. “March 20 was his wedding anniversary. He was keen on returning to India last year to stay with us. But God had some other plans for him. Since he was unable to continue studying, he wanted his younger brother to study as much as he wanted to,” she said, adding, “But after losing him, we want Chandrasekhar to stay closer home.” 
 
 Speaking to TOI from Brussels, Chandrasekhar said that he was offered a Ph D position in Germany, but he is keen on returning to India. “I will be looking for a job now. Since my father is retired and my brother was the only earning member in the family, we will have to think about the family’s income too,” he said. Though Vaishali was employed before getting married to Raghvendran, she wants to be with her son in his growing years and also ensure that she fills in for the absence of his father (Raghvendran), said Annapoorni, adding that she may take up a job at a later stage if needed. She said that Infosys, where Raghvendran was working, supported them, but there was no help from the government.
