 Gohil, the complainant in the case, said that the scheme provides for a person wishing to make a pond to invest 10% of money needed and 90% would be provided by the state government. "We surveyed 200-250 sq km of the village using GPS data over a fortnight with help from revenue department officials. We also sought details of grants from the   (GLDC). From the list of suspected grants, we stumbled on two pieces of land which were shown as locations of ponds," he said.
