Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court is all set to issue notices to about 87 buses of private travel companies for flouting rules. On Monday, the court asked its registry to inform about the expenditure to be incurred on issuing notices through newspapers to all these agencies within a week.

 These 87 buses were identified by the Maharashtra State Regional Transport Corporation (MSRTC) for haphazard parking and traffic congestion at the ST stand at Ganeshpeth, as per courtâ€™s directives. The   and RTO would then issue notices to operators of these 87 buses, who would be asked to respond before November 29.
 
 The court took cognisance of a letter by citizens and treated it as a PIL. The judges directed its registry to issue notices to all tour agencies through newspapers. While appointing Harnish Gadhia as amicus curiae, the court asked all private operators to deposit Rs 5,000 each with registry to prove their bonafides. The court also directed MSRTC to supply necessary information on these private operators to Gadhia.
 
 MSRTC earlier informed that the private firms were prohibited from operating within 200m radius from ST Stand. Yet, many buses belonging to private agencies can be seen parked on the side of the road obstructing traffic.
 
 The MSRTC passed the buck to RTO and district collector stating that they failed to act against the operators. As per the Motor Vehicles Act, licences of such offenders must be cancelled, but the authorities are not probing into the issue.
