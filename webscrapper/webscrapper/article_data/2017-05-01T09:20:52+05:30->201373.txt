LUCKNOW: In a candid self-evaluation report, the King George’s   ( ) has admitted that the institution had no innovation linked to its name, even though it had filed for 17 new patents in the field of   in the past five years. This means that the university has had no path-breaking research or innovation which is one of its main functions, thus automatically affecting patient care that is upgraded with research. 

 The fact has been brought out by the university’s own assessment of itself while applying for the National Assessment and Accreditation Council ( ) required for grading of universities. In the self report, the university has also accepted the fact that while the number of nursing seats were increased, the university hostels have been stagnant at just four buildings, incapable of adjusting the students to capacity. Around four nursing students are thus being adjusted in a twin sharing room. 
 
 A 13-member team from NAAC including four vice-chancellors had also visited KGMU last month for inspection and will present its final report soon. According to the self assessment, KGMU has also lacked in consultancy income and on the issue of a road dividing the Queen Mary hospital and dental faculty from the main campus between which most times patients are transferred on stretchers through the main road. 
 
 On the other hand, the university has claimed that its PhD enrolments have increased in the past five years and so has the quality of publications that has improved. The university has also used the Rs 20 crore annual budget it gets for research.
