NEW DELHI: She had been externed from the city two years ago after committing robberies and heinous crimes. However, she couldn’t wait until April this year for the   period to get over. Used to living a  , 30-year-old Ramanjeet Kaur started dressing   — mostly donning her husband’s   — not only to hide her identity but to also  .

 The accused fell in the police net while trying to attack an elderly   in Kirti Nagar. Her three children, aged between four and 12, now live with her mother as her husband is also lodged in Tihar Jail after murdering one of his friends.
 
 On Saturday, the elderly woman told police that two ‘men’ pushed her and snatched her cellphone while she was walking on the footpath. Cops found that 30 CCTV cameras had captured the attack on the woman. Kaur had targeted the elderly woman with an accomplice, Ramnik Singh (23), whom she was introduced to in 2017 by a former associate who is now in the US.
 
 “A team led by SHO (Kirti Nagar) Anil Sharma found her involved in nine cases. We are trying to ascertain if she has committed more robberies,” said DCP (west) Vijay Kumar. A country-made pistol, cash and other valuables have been seized from the accused.
 
 After Kaur’s husband was jailed, she couldn’t make ends meet. She tried to do various jobs, but failed. She then chose her husband’s career path and entered the crime world. She would put on a moustache, speak in a heavy tone and ride a bike so that no one mistook her for a woman.
