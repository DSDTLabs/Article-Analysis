PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The   on busy Pune-Mumbai highway may soon become signal-free as the work on the fifth ramp of the flyover here has finally resumed.

 The work on the ramp, which connects Pimple Gurav to Pimpri, was stopped midway owing to a temple, which needed to be razed to complete its construction. When the   ( ) approached the owner of the land on which the temple stood, he moved the high court, thus, stalling the work for about six months.
 
 “We have resumed work on the fifth ramp as the high court has lifted stay on its construction. Once this ramp is ready, Nashik Phata Chowk will become signal-free, benefitting lakhs of daily commuters here. This will, however, be done after consulting the traffic police department and PCMC office-bearers. The construction of the ramp is expected to be over in a month,” Vijay Bhojane, spokesperson of the Bus Rapid Transit System cell of the PCMC, told TOI.
 
 The Nashik Phata Chowk flyover is a two-storeyed structure located at the meeting point of Pune-Mumbai and Pune-Nashik highways. It has five ramps. 
 
 While the two ramps (ramp 1 & 2) connect Pimple Gurav to   Gaothan and the back side of the Kasarwadi, the third ramp connects Pimple Gurav to Pune city. The fourth ramp connects Pune/Dapodi to Pimple Gurav/Pimple Saudagar/Wakad. 
 
 The fifth ramp, work on which is under way, connects Pimple Gurav to Vallabhnagar-Pimpri-Nigdi via the Pune-Mumbai highway.
 
 The ramp 1 and 2 were opened to traffic about three years ago, while the third ramp was kept closed since the authorities wanted to the complete the fifth ramp before the two could be opened to traffic here. This decision was met with agitation from   and social organisations.
 
 Bhojane said the number of vehicles crossing the chowk will reduce by nearly 80% after opening of all the five ramps to traffic. “Eventually, our long-term goal is to make this crucial chowk signal-free.”
