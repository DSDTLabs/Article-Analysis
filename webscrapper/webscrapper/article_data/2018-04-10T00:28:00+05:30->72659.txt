Trichy: It is not just the farming community in the delta districts which has been affected by the dry Cauvery, but even the railways which has seen a drastic fall in its freight revenue by way of transporting paddy grains from the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation.  The paddy procured from farmers by Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation Limited - the agency authorised by the government for the purpose â€” is hulled at its modern rice mills and despatched to various states on train wagons for being distributed through the public distribution system. The paddy procured from Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam and Thanjavur would be loaded on train wagons at stations such as Needamangalam, Peralam, Tiruvarur, Kumbakonam, Mayiladuthurai, Sirkazhi, Nagapattinam, Thanjavur and Kumbakonam in the delta districts. Trichy railway division has been generating revenue through freight by transporting several tonnes of paddy to various destinations. However, shortage of water and the severe drought have been bringing down the acres of agriculture land under cultivation as well as the yield drastically in recent years. Trichy railway division had transported 6.07 lakh tonnes of paddy bags in 216 rakes. However, this volume had dropped to 2.98 lakh tonnes transported on 106 rakes during 2016-17. This was a 50.8 per cent decline compared to the previous year, railway sources said.  During the current year, the railways has so far handled 1.40 lakh tonnes on 50 rakes. Officials said this drastic decline was due to the failure of paddy cultivation because of water shortage. This had reflected in the revenue of the railways also, officials said. Since thousands of lorries and load men were involved in the process, almost 70 per cent of lorry drivers, cleaners and load men too have lost their jobs in the last few years, a lorry driver, S Manivannan, said.
