BHUBANESWAR: For   MP Tapas Pal, it was not easy spending life inside Jharpada special jail here after his remand in CBI custody ended on Friday. From breaking down after landing in jail to frequent complaints of breathlessness, the lawmaker faced a tough time. 

 Pal, accused of being involved in the   chit fund scam, was served roti and a mixed-veg curry, the same food that is served to other inmates. After dinner, he complained of breathing problems following which jail authorities took him to the hospital inside the jail premises and kept him under observation. 
 
 On Saturday, he was brought to   as he again complained of breathlessness. He was escorted by a police team to the hospital and after a quick check-up, was sent back to jail. 
 
 "We had planned to lodge him in a jail ward, which accommodates about 30 under-trials. Pal would have shared the ward with other inmates. But, after returning from Capital Hospital, he didn't feel well and was taken to jail hospital, where he had spent Friday night," superintendent (Jharpada special jail) R N Swain said.
 
 He said Pal has been provided with a machine to support him in his breathing. "We, however, had to refuse his request to get food from outside without the court's permission," Swain added. 
 
 Jail sources said the lawmaker would be brought back to the ward on Sunday after doctors give them the go-ahead. "We are not providing any special treatment to anyone. He has to stay in the same ward and eat the same food as others," the jail superintendent said. 
 
 Meanwhile, the wife of Trinamool MP   visited the CBI office for the third consecutive day. There is speculation Nayna handed over documents pertaining to Bandyopadhyay's foreign trips, allegedly funded by Rose Valley.
