Actor   might reprise his role as Nick Fury in 'Captain Marvel'. 

 During an event of his new movie 'Kong: Skull Island', the 68-year-old actor teased his appearance in Marvel's first female superhero solo movie. 
 
 "Yeah, I'd love to do a Nick Fury movie. I'm always   and game. But they got Infinity Wars, two movies to do there, and after that there's Brie (Larson's) movie Captain Marvel, which maybe (Nick) will be part of," Jackson said. 
 
  
  
 "Also, I asked them, 'So you're doing Black Panther and the only black character in the Marvel Universe is not showing up?' And they're like, 'Nick Fury is not in Wakanda!' How can he not know the other black superhero on the planet? How the hell does that work? But they just said, 'No you're not in that one'," he added. 
 
 'Captain Marvel' is set for March 8, 2019 release while 'Black Panther' starring Chadwick Boseman is due February 16, 2018 in the US.
