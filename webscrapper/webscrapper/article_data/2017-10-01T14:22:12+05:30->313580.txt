Don't worry if money can't buy happiness, there is one thing that certainly can. A study has found that sleep is a vital element that has one of the strongest associations with a person's well being. The research found that quadrupling your income causes very little increase in your happiness quotient while spending time in the bedroom is a lot more significant.

 The study also revealed that the most rested people score 15 points higher on the index than those who struggled with their sleep. Strong relationships with family and friends, job security and the good health of loved ones are also more important than cars and exotic holidays.The study conducted by researchers from Oxford Economics and the National Centre for Social Research in Great Britain, asked 8,250 people of varying backgrounds to fill out a 60-question survey to determine what it means to 'live well'. The questions covered everything from the state of an individual's sleep quality, finances, and job security to their relationships with friends, family and their community. The result was the creation of the living index, which generated a list of the top factors that separated the happiest 20 per cent from everyone else. In order of biggest influence, sleep quality, sex life, job securities were the top three factors that determined who was actually living well.
