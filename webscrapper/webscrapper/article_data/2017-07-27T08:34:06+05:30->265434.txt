KOLHAPUR: Of the 19   in the district’s three talukas that don’t have electricity, the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL),   has succeeded in   of three so far.

 The remaining 16 villages are still waiting for electricity. But the state power utility cited various reasons like delay in forest approvals and heavy rain for the delay in electrification of the remaining villages.
 
 In February, the district planning committee approved Rs 4 crore for the electrification work of the 19 villages and hamlets. However, five months on, the state power utility succeeded in providing power supply to only three villages. According to the MSEDCL, electrification of 16 villages was halted because of pending forest department nods, testing and commencement, heavy rain and other issues.
 
 An MSEDCL official said that despite fund allocation, electrification of these villages was delayed due to various permissions and natural impediments. “These villages are located in Shahuwadi, Radhanagari and Bhudargad talukas. The main reasons for the delay are pending forest permissions as the forest department has raised objections. We are negotiating with the forest department,” he said.
 
 He added that another impediment stopping them from carrying out the work is heavy rain. “These villages are in the heavy rainfall zones. They receive abundant rain in the monsoon, making it very difficult to install power grids. However, all remaining villages will receive power by the end of this calendar year,” he said.
 
 The Centre has set a goal of total electrification work across the country by 2018. The Kolhapur zone recently received Rs 60 crore funds to strengthen the Centre’s rural electrification programme.
