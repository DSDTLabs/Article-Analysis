PATNA: The Patna   on Wednesday directed the state government to execute its ‘Har Ghar Nal Ka Jal Yojana’ and Nali-Gali Yojana’ through panchayats, and not by the ward development committees formed by panchayati raj department.

 The two schemes are components of chief minister Nitish Kumar’ ‘Saat Nischay’, or seven resolves, initiative.
 
 The HC order came on a petition filed recently by the district mukhia associations of Saran, East Champaran, West Champaran, Arwal and Patna. 
 
 The petitioners contended that construction of roads and drainage in rural areas came under the purview of panchayats as per Article 243 of the Constitution of India, but the state government was executing this work by constituting ward development committees. 
 
 The order was passed by a division bench of Chief Justice   and Justice Sudhir Singh.
