PATNA: A POCSO (Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences) court on Thursday rejected the   petition of automobile dealer  , wanted by police in connection with the alleged rape of a minor girl. 

 The anticipatory bail petition of former BPCC vice-president Brajesh Pandey is likely to come up for hearing on Friday. Pandey is a non-FIR accused in the case.
 
 The girl, daughter of another   leader, was reportedly a minor at the time of incident in January last year. Her FIR accuses Nikhil, his father and retired IAS officer Krishna Bihari Prasad Sinha, brother Manish Priyadarshi and friend Sanjeet Kumar Sharma of sexually exploiting and abusing her. 
 
 The anticipatory bail petitions of the three other named accused have already been rejected by the court. 
 
 Pandey quit the BPCC post after his name cropped up during investigation into the case. He has since been not spotted in public places. 
 
 Special PP Suresh Chandra Prasad said he told the court that Nikhil took the minor girl to his home in a high-end SUV. He introduced her to his family members and promised to marry her. “She was later sexually exploited and blackmailed by Nikhil, who had also filmed the act,” Prasad said.
 
 According to the lawyer, the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act has also been invoked against Nikhil. Under this Act, a rapist can be given punishment up to life term. Anticipatory bail petition is not maintainable in such cases.
 
 Nikhil’s counsel Janardan Rai, however, said the girl was a major according to an examination form filled by her in a reputed private school of Patna. “Her medical report also suggests she is a major and, therefore, the rape charges are not applicable as she knew the consequences of her act,” he said, adding her call detail records proved it was she who called Nikhil for the first time.
