Bhopal: Around 58 new cases of dengue and chikungunya have been reported from Bhopal in the past one week – making the situation as alarming as last year. In 2016, Bhopal reported more than 1,000 cases of dengue and chikungunya – the highest ever.

 At the start of October last year, the state capital had reported 160 dengue cases and about a dozen cases of chikungunya. Compared to previous year, about 200 people have tested positive for dengue and more than three dozen have been diagnosed with chikungunya.
 
 On Sunday, the spurt continued with 8 more people testing positive for dengue. Three patients of H1N1 continued to be in critical condition, said a health department official. Two more patients tested positive for swine flu.
 
 Usually health department does not conduct tests but fearing the worst, district malaria office (DMO) has been open all seven days recently. Survey teams of the DMO are reporting rising incidents of larvae being found after the recent rainfall. It has jumped from about 10% to 40% in houses that were being detected with mosquito breeding larvae.
 
 Chikungunya infection is also being detected on a daily basis. On Sunday, two were diagnosed with the disease. Five deaths have been attributed to dengue this year.
