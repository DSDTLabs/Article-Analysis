PATNA: The Bihar legislative council was plunged into chaos in the pre-lunch session on Wednesday after the opposition   members went into the well of the house and shouted slogans over non-payment of salaries and pension to serving and retired employees of different universities and colleges, respectively, for the last five months. 
 
 As soon as the house assembled, Congress member Dilip Kumar   drew the attention of deputy chairman Md Haroon Rashid towards his adjournment notice and sought the government’s reply on the issue of non-payment of salaries to varsity teachers and non-teaching employees. 
  
 “All teaching and non-teaching employees of state’s different universities and colleges have not been paid their salaries since October 2017. Moreover, pensioners of universities are also not being paid,” Choudhary said. 
  
 When Choudhary’s adjournment notice was rejected, Congress members went into the well of the house and started shouting slogans demanding payment of salaries. 
  
 RJD members led by Subodh Kumar also joined the Congress members and started shouting slogans against the state government over the issue of rape and murder of a scheduled caste girl in   district. 
  
 Despite repeated requests from the deputy chairman, they refused to return to the benches. As pandemonium continued for more than 10 minutes, Rashid adjourned the house till 2.30 pm. 
  
 In the post-lunch session, the RJD members, led by leader of opposition  , staged a walkout from the house after BJP member  , while speaking on the governor’s address, referred to the sentencing of a former chief minister.
