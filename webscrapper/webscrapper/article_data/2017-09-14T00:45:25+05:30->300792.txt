THANE: Residents were woken up from their deep slumber after fierce thundering and   shook the city at 3am on Wednesday.

 The thundering was so strong that the window panes of many buildings started rattling. The   and lightening was coupled with heavy rain. While the showers began at 1am, it started intensifying by 3am.
 
 Residents living near Upvan lake and the foothills of Yeoor Hills were afraid of the extreme climatic activity that they packed their windows with newspaper padding in order to prevent them from shattering. Gaurav Ambekar, a resident of Pokhran Road 1 said, “The winds were so gusty that I decided to pack my French windows with old newspapers as I feared that the constant shattering would break the glasses. The sound of thunder was not as frightening as the lightning. It was like as if someone was continuously clicking pictures. The entire event was scary and we didn’t sleep the entire night.’’
 
 The thunder and lightening scared children and pets as well. Many kids were crying inconsolably as they were afraid of the loud noises. “My daughter was startled with the sound of the thunder. She started crying seeing the lightening as well. She had never experienced such a thing before. So, the entire experience was nightmarish for her. We had to hold her close all through the night to calm her down, ” said Harshita K, from Thane’s Ghodbuner Road.
