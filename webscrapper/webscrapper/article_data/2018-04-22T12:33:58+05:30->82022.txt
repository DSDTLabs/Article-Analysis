KANPUR:   BJP MP  , while visiting his constituency on Saturday, said, “Earlier Unnao was known by the name and work of Sakshi Maharaj, and before that it used to be remembered by the names of many legendary men and revolutionaries, but now Unnao is known for rape.”

 He made the comment while replying to a question from mediapersons, if the rape incident involving party legislator   Singh Sengar would impact his party’s prospects in the 2019 Lok   polls.
 
 
 Sakshi admitted that the rape case, involving Sengar, would certainly dent the image of the party but the extent of the damages caused would be assessed by the party leadership.
 
 “Should Kuldeep be kept in the party or removed is something to be decided by the party’s state and central leadership. My opinion will not matter. Whatever I have to say, I will not tell the media. I will speak to the state and the national presidents and share my opinion with them. They will take the call,” the   MP said.
 
 Defending the Yogi government, Sakshi said that the state was doing well on all fronts.
 
 “It was unfortunate that the girl (rape survivor) did not come to me. Had she come to me I would have helped her. She might have thought that since both of us (  and Sakshi Maharaj) belong to the same party therefore, she would not get justice. But that would not have been the case. It is good that Yogiji accepted the demand of the rape survivor and her family of CBI investigation in the case,” Sakshi said.
