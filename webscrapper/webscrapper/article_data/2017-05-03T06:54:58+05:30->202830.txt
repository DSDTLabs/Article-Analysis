MADURAI: With the temperature on a constant rise and no signs of rain, many   have started conducting 'varna jabams' to invoke the rain god. Special prayers were performed at temples across the region. 

 'Varna homam' was conducted at   temple in Madurai on Monday where priests chanted special hymns to bring rain. While, similar rituals have been performed in previous years, this year it has increased in magnitude as the southern districts are experiencing an unprecedented drought-like situation and 'agni natchathiram' set to begin on May 4.
 
 Special poojas were also performed at   temple in   district on Monday. The district has recorded very minimal rainfall and almost all the tanks have gone dry. A special homam was performed at the shrine of Ramanujar.
