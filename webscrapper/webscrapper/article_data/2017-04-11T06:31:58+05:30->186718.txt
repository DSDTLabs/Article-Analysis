KARWAR: A   which strayed into   of   on Monday was saved by some people after it leapt into the sea in a bid to escape. It is suspected that the stag came to   in search of water, as there is   in some parts of the Western Ghats forests, due to shortfall of monsoon last year.

 Some morning walkers spotted the stag first near NH-66, around 6am. They tried to catch hold of the animal as stray dogs were chasing it. The panicky stag, said to be around two years old, reportedly crossed the highway and ran towards the sea, and jumped in. It swam around in the waves for more than 10 minutes, until citizens caught hold of the animal with help from fishermen, and brought it to the beach.
 
 Forest officials arrived and shifted the panicky stag to their nursery in Karwar.“The stag is a very sensitive animal. It suffers a heart attack when it comes in contact with human beings and also when attacked by other animals. So one has to be very careful with this animal. Fortunately, this stag did not have any problem when it was caught,“ said a forest official.
 
 “We have treated the stag and kept it in a secure place. Once it is out of shock, it will be released in the forest where abundant water is available,“ said forest officials.
