CHENNAI: After getting the approval to expand the Chennai   Airport, The   ( ) is gearing up to apply to the public investment board for permission to tear own the old international terminal. 

 AAI is planning to demolish old terminals and expand the airport to increase passenger capacity to 30 million per year. As a portion of the international terminal building is less than 15 years old, AAI needs permission from public investment board. The process will begin soon, says AAI officials.
 
 AAI has already started the paperwork to get approval from different bodies to demolish the building and prepare the land for fresh construction. The move is necessary because the old terminals do not have enough space and their design does not sync with the new steel and glass terminals which were built as part of airport   in 2013. 
 
 The airport was shifted to   after a domestic terminal was commissioned in 1985. The international terminal was built in 1989. However, AAI opened an international departure building in 2003. "While the domestic terminal is old, the international departure terminal, which is not in use after the operations were moved to the steel and glass building, has more life. This requires permission for demolition," said an official.
 
 "Usually old buildings are not demolished. They will try to retain them, like at some airports abroad. However, in Chennai it has to be pulled down because of space constraint. Only one portion of the building is less than15-years-old. The terminals are being replaced with new buildings because this is a development project. All necessary approvals will be taken before the project will be carried out," a senior AAI official said. 
 
 A consultant appointed by AAI, experts in airport remodelling, will be in charge of studying the feasibility of the work. New terminals will be built at an approximate cost of 2,100 crore.
