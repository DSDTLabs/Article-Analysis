Easter Sunday brings with it the miraculous resurrection of Jesus Christ and great joy to   who end their 40-day abstinence.

 “This is a special time since we are born in the new life after enduring the pains of abstinence. This is an opportunity the church gives us to renew ourselves every year, “ said Fr  , parish priest of Socorro.
 
 In Goa, like any other festival, food is a very important component of celebrations. Nelson Cabral, Dona Paula resident, said, “Home-cooked sweets are still very popular. Crab xec xec, chicken xacuti, pork vindaloo and sorpotel are specialties.” Bakeries prepare hot-cross buns as the tradition of gifting these semi-sweet breads is still practised.
