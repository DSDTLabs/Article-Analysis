QUEPEM: For the fourth time in less than a month, the water pipeline at   industrial estate has been tampered with, in the same place, disrupting supply in surrounding areas. 

 PWD sources alleged that vested interests have been tampering with the pipeline to divert water into a nearly well to benefit the water tanker lobby.
 
 On Wednesday, water was seen flowing out with great pressure from where private tankers source their water. PWD assistant engineer had filed police complaint at Cuncolim police station against unknown persons for illegally tampering and damaging the main conveying water pipeline at IDC, Cuncolim. PWD officials alleged that the water pilferage is to cater to the water tanker lobby and was being done in collusion with some local politicians and migrants. The pipeline comes to Cuncolim from   and supplies water to Velim, Balli, Assolna, Fatorpa, Canaguinim, Quitol Khola and surrounding areas. 
 
 This is the fourth time the area is facing acute shortage. PWD is often compelled to shutdown the entire line for repairs.
 
 “The department had repaired the damaged pipeline after a shutdown on January 17, from 9am to 2pm. The line was packed with laterite stones and rubble and   after carrying out the repair work, but when PWD labourers went to cure the block with water on Wednesday morning, they found that the laterite masonry was damaged and all the nut bolts stolen,”   has stated in his complaint.
 
 PWD lodged a police complaint on December 5, 2017, regarding tampering, but nobody has been arrested. Cuncolim PI   said he had already deployed a police constable at the site round-the-clock. Police will catch the culprit soon, he added. Cuncolim MLA Clafacio Dias said that nobody has brought the water problem to his notice, but promised to resolve the matter.
