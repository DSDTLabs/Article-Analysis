After the much-acclaimed Aaranya Kaandam, Thiaga rajan Kumararaja's second outing, reportedly titled Aneethi Kathaigal, was launched amidst much expectation. Vijay Sethupathi, Samantha, Fahadh Faasil and others were roped in to play crucial roles in the film, which went on floors last year. Veteran cinematographer-cum-filmmaker   and Yuvan Shankar Raja were brought on board for cranking the camera and composing music respectively. However, Sreeram is no more a part of the project now.

 When contacted, he said, “The production of the film was stalled after demonetisation. And as there was an uncertainty with regard to the dates, I went on to work for  's Padman, the Bollywood project, starring Akshay Kumar in lead. I have finished the movie and might go for a two days of work in the US. I have shot for only a few days for  's movie -Vinod will be cranking camera for the film now.“ PC Sreeram now has a Telugu and Tamil film, starring Kalyan Ram and   in lead roles respectively.
