SHIMLA: The   high court has directed taxi-owners, especially those in Shimla, to install meters in their vehicles, so that they don’t overcharge tourists. 

 The court’s direction came during a hearing this past week, and the state government informed it that it would take the required steps within a week. The division bench of Acting Chief Justice   and Justice   took the affidavit filed by director (transport) on record. 
 
 The court observed that in view of the dismissal of a special leave petition, it felt there was no impediment in installing meters in taxis operating at least within the municipal limits of Shimla town.
 
 The additional advocate general saud in court that action would be taken within a week. The next hearing of the case is on May 24. The court has asked the director (transport) to personally be present in court along with entire record.
 
 During the earlier hearing on March 29, the court had not found the affidavit to be in inconformity with its earlier order of March 21. At that time, it had directed Shimla deputy commissioner and superintendent of police to file their affidavits, stating the number of vehicles registered as taxis and plying in Shimla town. 
 
 Court had also asked them to inform whether there was dedicated parking for taxis. 
 
 The court had asked whether there were sufficient sign boards and signages indicating rates which owners of taxis are entitled to and authorised to charge from customers.
