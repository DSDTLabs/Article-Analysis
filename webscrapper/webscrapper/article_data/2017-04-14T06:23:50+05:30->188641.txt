CALANGUTE: Almost two decades after they were first proposed and three years after chief minister   laid the foundation stone for the construction of changing rooms and restrooms at   beach, work on the project finally commenced recently.

 “With the current BJP-led coalition government focussing on creating better infrastructure, work has now started on the facility,” deputy speaker and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo said. The facility, being built at a cost of Rs 1.2 crore, will be ready in four months. As the area falls in the no-development zone close to the beach, the facility, except for the plinth, will be built without using concrete.
 
 Plans are afoot to construct more such facilities near the   jetty which also witnesses high tourist footfall on a daily basis.
 
 Although the state government had acquired land approximately 30 years ago to develop tourism-related infrastructure, the project had become embroiled in controversy, resulting in the construction of the restrooms and other facilities being held up.
 
 The acquired land had belonged to the family of former Congress MLA Agnelo  , who after his election to the post of legislator around 10 years ago, had managed to reacquire the land from the government.
 
 However, when the BJP government came to power in 2012, they took back possession of the land. Soon after, the foundation stone was laid by Parrikar, but in March 2015 it was found vandalized.
 
 The toilets and changing rooms were a long-pending demand of stakeholders in the tourism industry. The lack of restrooms has been a major inconveninece for women and also led to unsanitary conditions of the beach with many tourists relieving themselves in the sand dunes or bushes.
