The first international music gig in Bengaluru in 2017 was cancelled yesterday. Will this affect brand Bengaluru and its tag as the   Capital? We do not know. But what we do know is that the local police have stated the following three reasons for cancelling the tour:

 * After the NYE molestation incident, an event like this, which will have youngsters in attendance & drinks being served, can cause issues.
 * We have a local election taking place, due to which we could not afford to have an incident of this magnitude on the same day.
 * Residents from the area, who have a  , submitted a letter stating that events like this are against local culture. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Photographer Rajesh Criss, who travelled to Bengaluru from Chennai with three other friends just for the concert, says, “We decided to attend the   a month ago and booked our travel tickets. Four of us are here, and four more are on their way. The organizers had not announced the venue till a day before the concert. That made it hard for us to know where to book our stay. And now this! This is a really frustrating situation to be in, and we don’t know whom to vent our anger on. We booked our accommodation close to the venue, which is far from the city, and now that it’s been called off, we have nothing to do!”
 
 
 
 Karan Singh, CEO, Sunburn, stated, “Due to the present law & order situation in Bengaluru, following the events that transpired around New Year’s Eve, the authorities have recommended against holding the   concert scheduled today in the city. We tried our very best to make it happen, but the authorities, understandibly, are not prepared to take any chances. Hence, the concert stands cancelled. We hope to reschedule the concert subject to approval from the artiste and the respective authorities. We will be back with more information as soon as possible. Our ticketing partners will be in touch with all ticket holders for the next steps. Other shows in Mumbai, New Delhi and Hyderabad are on as per schedule.”
 Harindra Singh, chairman and MD, Percept Limited, said, “We have been advised by the administration not to hold the concert and we are abiding by what we have been told. We are in touch with the artiste’s team and the local administration to work out another date. I believe that law, order and security is the responsibility of our government, and if they have decided something, it must be keeping in mind everyone’s best interests, and, as citizens, we will abide by what they decide. We should not forget that it is the same government and authorities who supported us during the Hardwell concert and other concerts in Bengaluru. Right now, if they feel circumstances are not appropriate, we will listen to them.”
 
 
 Bengaluru City Commissioner of Police   says, "There is no David Guetta concert that is happening in Bengaluru city. It’s happening in Bengaluru disctrict, but not in the city,"
 
 
 
 DJ and music producer  , who was supposed to perform alongside David Guetta, couldn't make it for the event. He posted, "I am so sorry not to be with you this weekend playing with David Guetta in India. Unfortunately, I had travelled all the way from my shows in   and I didn’t have the ‘Yellow Vaccine’ paperwork that is required to be allowed into the country after spending time in Brasil. Without this information, I was refused entry and sent home again. My apologies to all my fans hoping to see me perform this weekend. I look forward to partying with you in India again soon!"
