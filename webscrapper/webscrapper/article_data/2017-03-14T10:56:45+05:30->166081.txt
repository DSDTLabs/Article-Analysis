  and Alia have always maintained that they are good friends, denying the rumours of them being in a relationship, however they can’t escape the prying eyes of the media so easily.
 
  
  
 
 On Sunday the shutterbugs yet again spotted the duo at a health café in Bandra. Sid and Alia were snapped taking a leave from the suburban health bistro and juice bar, perhaps after a quiet lunch date. While the ‘
