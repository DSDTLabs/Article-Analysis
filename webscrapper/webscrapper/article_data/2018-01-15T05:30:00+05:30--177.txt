Hassan: A day after seven individuals lost their life in an accident involving a   ( ) bus near Karekere Agricultural College, 19km from Hassan on NH-75, authorities of the transport body have announced that the tragedy was the consequence of human error. The remaning passengers of the bus are undergoing treatment at hospitals in Hassan, Mangaluru and Bengaluru.

 A senior KSRTC officer said that the officials had collected information from the site of the accident, besides speaking to the passengers and analyzing data from the Vehicle Traffic Management System. “We suspected that either the driver was feeling drowsy, or lost control of the bus. His decision to stop twice for tea near Kunigal, and Yediyuru Cross confirms our suspicions. Since both the driver and conductor have passed away, we cannot verify this. Bu, our conclusion is that the accident was the result of a human error,” he told TOI, adding that KSRTC would speak to representatives of Volvo about the accident.
 
 The senior official said that the injured passengers were out of danger. “Four passengers who sustained serious injuries have been admitted to various hospitals in Bengaluru. The corporation will ensure medical reimbursement for the injured passengers,” he added.
