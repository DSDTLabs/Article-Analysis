CHENNAI: The patronage for   may be growing, but railways are yet to ensure facilities for safety of commuters at stations on the BeachVelachery line.

 Both the stations and the trains do not have first-aid facilities, and there are no signboards for commuters to where they can be accessed. Similar situation prevails with most of the suburban railway stations.
 
 Railways officials say staff at the stations have been instructed to call the 108 ambulance service in an emergency and administer first aid for small cuts and bruises with kits available with the guards of trains.
 
 However, a few stations do not have operational staff like station masters, because mass rapid system require staff only at major stations. Commuters here are forced to fend for themselves. Most of the commuters TOI spoke to were not aware of the availability of first aid units at stations.
 
 Commuters say that the 108 ambulance service will not arrive for every minor cut or injury , as they would have more urgent cases to attend to or they will take time to reach. In case of an injury or a fall, commuters will have to the wait for the ambu lance to arrive. In stations like Thiruvanmiyur, Kasturibai and  , there are no station managers and railway protection force personnel.
 
 S Karthik, a commuter at   said that “Depending the ambulance service may not be good because the injured commuter will have to remain unattended till assistance arrives. I have seen situations in which railway protection force personnel are more keen to find out about the reason for the injury than rushing the commuter to nearest hospital.“
 
 A railway official at Velachery said, “Only the guards in the trains carry first-aid kits and we call for 108 in case of any severe emergency as it takes very long time for the railway doctors to assist the patient. The guards have also been trained to assist patients.“
