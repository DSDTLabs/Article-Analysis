KOLKATA: A 45-year-old security guard was killed in a freak   on Friday evening outside a bungalow in New Alipore’s A block. 

 Around 7.30pm, Rathindra   was at the bungalow’s main gate chatting with Shew Kumar Singh (60), a driver, when a   drove up to them. When Banerjee went up to the car, the driver said he had to deliver a gift to one of the residents. “I saw him bending down and opening the main gate when the car suddenly accelerated and crashed into the gates. Banerjee came under its wheels and I hurt one of my hands when the car hit me,” Singh told cops. 
 
 The loud crash brought several people to the spot, but the driver of the Honda City fled without the car. Banerjee and Singh were taken to CMRI Hospital where the guard was declared dead on arrival. The   police have registered a case under IPC sections 304A, 338 and 427 — all bailable. Police added that they had identified the accused but were yet to nab him.
 
 “It seems the driver had pressed the accelerator instead of the brakes by mistake,” said an officer. The case has been transferred to the Fatal Squad of traffic police, but New Alipore police first want to ascertain if the victim and the accused shared any previous enmity.
 
 Police said that besides Singh, there were a few other witnesses to the accident. “We are going to make a watertight case,” said an officer at Lalbazar. 
 
 A resident of   in Thakurpukur, Banerjee joined as a security guard at this mansion a few months back. His agency had promised to shift him closer home soon.
