HYDERABAD: While 50 wild boars were shot dead in   at Dundigal on Saturday, more institutes in the city and individuals, mostly fruit orchard owners, have petitioned the   forest department seeking permission for culling of wild boars as they are damaging crops, tender grass and greenery as well as posing a threat to human life.

 
 According to forest wildlife wing officials, those who have put in such a request include the Medak Ordnance Factory, National Remote Sensing Centre, Shadnagar, and Professor   Telangana State Agricultural University, Rajendranagar.
 
 Wild Life Wing OSD A Shankaran told TOI, “All the major institutions having large campuses and individuals having orchards and farms are asking for permission, and we are forwarding the petitions to the district forest officers for taking action.   at Dundigal, there is a serious situation where the wild boars are posing a risk to the   trainees and also a possibility of causing aircraft mishaps,”
 
 
 
 
 Nawab Shafath Ali Khan, who has been empanelled by the Telangana forest department along with 20 other target shooters, told TOI: “There is a serious problem of wild boars and farmers are in distress. Each wild boar weighs between 100 kg to 200 kg and can damage a quarter of an acre in one night. Imagine if 15 wild boars attack a field. The entire crop will be lost. The crops being damaged by the wild boars include groundnut, paddy, maize and sugarcane. As there is not enough shrub forest, the wild boars are breeding in farm fields and living in canals and trenches. Adilabad, Nirmal, Mahabubnagar, Sangareddy, Karimnagar and   are the worst hit. The animal is nocturnal and is giving sleepless nights to the farmers. I have been empanelled by six states to cull wild boars. The government should take up a policy decision to control the population of wild boars.”
