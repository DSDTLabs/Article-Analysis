The young scion of Manchu family, Manoj, is on the verge of a much-needed career break. The actor, who was known for his experimental cinema is back in an action avatar in and as ' ', which has hit the screens this Friday.

 Directed by SK Satya, the movie begins with a voice over by megastar Chiranjeevi, introducing Kanna (Manoj). The high power action entertainer has Amrutha (Pragya Jaiswal) as the female lead and Sampath Raj as a criminal lawyer Seshu, the antagonist along with veteran Kota Srinivasa Rao as MLA Koteswara Rao. The movie, at least till the interval break, is a run-of-the-mill action drama with the elements that can strike a chord with the mass audience. 
 
 Manoj's Kanna, the son of Rajendra Prasad's character, isn't working but is quite a pampered boy. His heroic acts and daredevil stunts can impress audience. 
  
 Except for a song 'Padhe Padhe', which is picturised well, the songs by DJ Vasanth just go by as the passing clouds.
