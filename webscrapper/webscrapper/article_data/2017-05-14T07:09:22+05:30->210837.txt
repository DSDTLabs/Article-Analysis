VISAKHAPATNAM: These close friends remained together in life and ironically even in death. Friends N Ravi  , P Surya Teja, T   were together since 2006, since the time they were studying at IIT Kharagpur. 

 They were batchmates and roommates. They were working in different companies in the same city together and they were all driving down to   to attend another batchmate’s wedding when a fatal road accident claimed their lives.
 
 Among the four, Ravi Teja hailed from a highly educated family in Visakhapatnam. This 27-year-old engineer at Oracle was planning to do his MBA either from the US or ISB Hyderabad and scored high in GMAT. His father NV Satyanarayana is a lecturer of Botany, mother  , a professor at ANITS College, while brother Abhishek is a final-year MBBS student.
 
 But a phone-call to the family from the Hyderabad police around 9.30 am on Friday informing about the mishap snuffed all hopes and dreams centred around him.
 
 “He used to help me in studies, in my preparation for engineering exams with his IIT background. Such a helpful and affectionate person he was,” said grief-striken V Avinash, cousin of Ravi Teja, who is studying engineering in a Bengaluru college.
 
 Ravi Teja’s maternal uncle Narendra Babu, a core committee member of  , was present at the residence along with some students. “It’s a terrible shock for parents to lose a son. My sister was very close to her elder son, who was not only very intelligent and brilliant, but also lovable and dutiful. Since childhood, my nephew would always occupy the front seat of the car beside the driver and this time too, he was in the front. The four friends were rushing to be on time for the muhurtam of their batchmate’s wedding,” he averred.
