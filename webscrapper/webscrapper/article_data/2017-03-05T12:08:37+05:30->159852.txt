HYDERABAD: Andhra Pradesh ranks second in the country in terms of   of Goods and   (GST) expected to be rolled out on July 1 with 91% of its traders enrolling themselves to migrate from the existing   (VAT) system to GST.

 In AP, 91% of traders re gistered under VAT have enrolled for GST as on February 24. Karnataka tops the list with 92% of its traders getting GST registration. “AP is making quick progress in adapting new things. Despite some concerns, the registration process is successful,“ claimed a top official. Trade and commercial bodies have conducted many workshops across the state for traders. A few days ago, AP finance minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu shot off a letter to Union finance minister   saying that state authorities should not be excluded from adjudicating the cases involving exports imports under IGST Act.
