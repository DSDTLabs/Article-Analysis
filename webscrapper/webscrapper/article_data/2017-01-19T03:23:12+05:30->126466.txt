NEW DELHI:   plans to complete the   drive at   Colony in the next two months so that the much-delayed redevelopment work can start. 

  is also considering the option of extending the cut-off date as per Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board’s policy. According to the existing deadline of 2011, DDA had identified 2,641 families which were eligible to get a flat. But Kathputli residents have been demanding that the new cut-off date of January 1, 2015 approved by the Union urban development ministry be considered for the project. 
 
 “We are carrying out a survey to identify families as per the January 2015 cut-off. A list will be prepared and sent to the lieutenant governor for consideration,” said  , principal commissioner of housing and land disposal, DDA.
 
 Officials said around 400 families will have to be added to the existing list. “We will try to accommodate as many families as possible. But if the number is more then we will accommodate them in the next scheme,”said Aggarwal.
 
 The land-owning agency started the demolition drive on December 19, 2016. Of the 2,641 families, the agency has shifted close to 1,150 families to the transit camp, which has been developed and managed by the project developer, Raheja Developers.
 
 Refuting claims by some civil society groups that people are being shifted forcibly, Aggarwal said the process is taking time as DDA is trying to convince them about the project. “Police are there just to ensure that no untoward incident takes place. We are not forcing them to shift. We are clearing their doubts,” Agarwal said.
