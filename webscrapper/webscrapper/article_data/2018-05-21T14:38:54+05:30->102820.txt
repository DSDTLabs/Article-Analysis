SURAT: Police are yet to get any success in their investigation of two bodies recovered from a rivulet close to Saniya village under the   police station limits. The decomposed bodies of a woman and a boy were found in a plastic bag on Saturday.

 
 Police are examining missing persons’ reports of different police stations to identify the victims and also looking for any suspicious vehicle that could have brought the bodies for dumping at the spot. 
 
 “So far, we have not got any strong lead but attempts are underway to identify bodies of the woman and the boy. We are checking missing persons’ reports registered at various police stations,” said a police officer.
 
 Meanwhile, police are trying to verify if the dead woman was Priyanka Samal and another body of her son Soham, who have been missing for past few days. Police have contacted Samal’s husband Pavitra, who is currently in Odisha. Pavitra had filed the missing persons’ report at   police station after his wife and son went missing on May 6. 
 
 “I came home in Odisha because of my mother’s poor health after submitting a police complaint. I suspect my wife to have eloped with her school-time friend,” said Pavitra, a native of   district. He has provided details of the person to the police with whom his wife is suspected to have eloped. Pavitra, an employee of a textile unit, is likely to return to the city in a few days. 
 
 Police had initially failed to detect the murder and rape of the 11-year-old girl whose body was recovered from Pandesara on April 6. City police failed to investigate the case from another angle to identify the person who murdered her and dumped the body at the spot. 
 
 City police had to face embarrassment when Ahmedabad city crime branch detected the case and nabbed prime accused   from Rajasthan. Meanwhile, police are yet to identify the three bodies that were recovered from the limits of Pandesara police station in March.
