PANCHKULA: Parking space crunch in residential areas is becoming a reason for scuffle among neighbours. Two neighbours in Housing Board Colony, Panchkula, Sector 19, got into a scrap over parking of a motorcycle and the complaint reached the police.

 Nitin Jindal, a businessman living in house number 76 in Sector 19, complained to the police that two youngsters, Anil and  , living in the next house (number 75) with their mother Anita, park their motorcycle in front of the main gate of his house. He said he tried talking to them a number of times, but to no avail.
 
 On Tuesday evening, when Jindal took up the issue again, the entire family came out and started abusing him and also tried to slap him, he said in his statement. Jindal rushed to the Sector 19 police post and complained to the cops. “Anil picked up a wooden stick and Sushil a brick to hit me in front of the policemen,” he alleged.
 
 Jindal said, “I am afraid of these persons. They have threatened to kill me over parking. I have given   footage of the attack to the police after which a case was registered. Cops as well as my neighbours are forcing me to strike a compromise, but I want justice.”
 
 Anil and Sushil have been booked under sections 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and 34 (act done by several person with same intention) of the IPC at Sector 20 police station.   inspector Vikash Kumar said, “One of the accused was arrested, but was later released on  .
