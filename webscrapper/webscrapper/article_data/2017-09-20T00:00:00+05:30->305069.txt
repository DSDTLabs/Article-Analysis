 The stage came alive with singers, who surprised us with their prowess. Priyanka Kashyap was one such contestant, who had us take notice as she sung Rolling In the Deep with panache. This secured her place as second runner-up. It was then time for the dancers to show us what they are made of, with Nafisa Sikdar, Khushi T Jain and Ujjwal V Jain leaving the audiences asking for more. This led Nafisa and Khushi to being crowned winner and first runner-up, respectively, while Ujjwal was adjudged second runner-up, along with Ainan Abbas, whose rendition of   made us feel that   was in the house. It was then the turn of the beat boxers to impress us, and that is exactly what Sahil Munshi and Salman Noor managed to do, which won them the titles of winner and first runner-up, respectively.
