GURUGRAM: Over the last one month, construction work has turned   road into a dustbowl, according to commuters, leaving them gasping for breath. Thousands of commuters use the stretch every day, including labourers working in factories dotting this area.

 While motorists say they are unable to drive with windows rolled down, pedestrians complain they have to cover their faces while crossing this arterial road. The construction work has been going on for almost a year now, between   and the Kapashera border. The stretch is being upgraded into a concrete road.
 
 “The problem got aggravated nearly a month ago, but MCG has done nothing at all to curb the increasing dust pollution here. Are government agencies not bound by strict norms laid down by the   ( )?” said  , a daily commuter.
 
 As per NGT guidelines, ambient air analysis, as well as testing of noise and water, has to be carried out at construction sites on a quarterly basis, to contain dust pollution. 
 
  “There is no signboard here which provides details of the construction agency, neither their contact numbers where we can file a complaint,” said  , a Sector 22 resident.
 
 While MCG officials were not available for comment, the private contractor assured the problem will be addressed within the next two days.
