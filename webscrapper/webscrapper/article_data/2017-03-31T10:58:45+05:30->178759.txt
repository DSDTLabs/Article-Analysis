HYDERABAD: For illegal workers from Telangana who are in a fix on whether to make use of the  , migrants' rights activist   has an advice: "Come back." Bheem Reddy, however, does not prefer to use the term 'illegal'. "No one is illegal in the world. You can only term their overstaying as irregular," the   leader said. 

 Workers from Telangana find jobs in Saudi in the construction industry or offices. Many went there during the 2006-2009 construction boom. However, with the oil crisis, many workers were thrown out of employment but continued to overstay. "The reason why the workers show hesitation in returning is because of the uncertainty back home over getting jobs,"   said. He recalled that in the past when such an amnesty was given, those who came suffered psychological problems. 
 
 There is also another issue. The worker himself has to pay for his airfare and many may not even have that money as such illegal immigrants go without work.
 
 The Kerala government not only takes care of the airfare of the illegal workers returning during the amnesty period, but it provides rehabilitation after they come back. "Firstly, the families of those who are stuck in Saudi should ask their kin not to risk continuing to be there and follow the law of that land," Bheem Reddy said.
 
 In several cases, since the family wants them to earn and send home the money for various needs, workers are hesitant to return. Bheem Reddy said the Telangana government could take a cue from Kerala and help the workers return by taking care of their airfare. And more importantly, provide them work under many of the existing schemes.
