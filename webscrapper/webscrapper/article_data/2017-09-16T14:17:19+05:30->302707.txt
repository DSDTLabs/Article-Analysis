NEW DELHI: 
  , Pakistan's prime minister   may meet with US vice president  , on the sidelines of the   next Tuesday in New York, reported Dawn.

 Abbasi is scheduled to reach New York on Monday and address the UN general Assembly on Thursday.
 
 If a meeting does take place, it will be the first high-level interaction between the two countries since US President   savagely criticised Pakistan for providing "  to agents of chaos, violence and terror".
 
 It was a dressing down that left Pakistan feeling humiliated. 
 
 Islamabad reacted by postponing the visit of Alice Wells, the US's acting assistant secretary of state for South and Asian affairs. It also suspended bilateral talks and visits with the US "as a mark of protest over the recent anti-Pakistan diatribe by US President Donald Trump". And Pakistan's foreign minister   also postponed his scheduled visit to Washington to meet with US secretary of state  .
 
 Abbasi recently met US ambassador to Pakistan David Hale.
 
 A PM office's statement noted that Abbasi and Hale in their meeting agreed that "decades-long relations between Pakistan and the US should be further strengthened through multifaceted engagement".
 
 Still, Pakistan is refusing to back down and has said several times publicly it's not interested in getting US aid. This was a response to Trump threatening to cut off the "billions and billions of dollars" of aid the US has given Pakistan over the decades.
 
 Just two days ago, Pakistan's defence minister said it is not Islamabad's job to satisfy the US, and added that his government is currently "reassessing" ties with Washington.
 
 "We are here to give our point of view logically and with evidence. We will explain our position. But it's not for us to satisfy them," said Khurram Dastgir Khan, the defence minister of Pakistan.
