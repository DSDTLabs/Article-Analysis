PATNA: Chief minister   on Friday said separate wings of animal science and fishery development would be opened at Dr Kalam Agriculture College at Kishanganj and the   (BASU) would provide training to persons engaged in this sector.

 The CM was reviewing the progress made in preparation of the state’s agriculture road map for 2017-22. Ministers and senior officials of the departments concerned participated in the meeting. Deputy CM   was also present.
 
 The CM said an indoor facility should be opened for treatment of animals at the Bihar Veterinary College. He called for linking of Jeevika programme of the rural development department with poultry farming and goat rearing.
 
 The CM also pitched for an action plan to increase fish production in the state. He said Vegetable Growers’ Cooperative Society (VGCS) should be provided with cold chain facility and developed on the pattern of COMFED that manages production and marketing of milk and milk-related products. “Block-level vegetable growers should be supported for production and conservation of quality vegetable seeds,” he added.
 
 Nitish said primary agriculture cooperative societies (PACS) should also be strengthened. “Construction of separate godowns for fertilisers and foodgrains with drier facility is the need of the hour. Arrangements should also be made at block level to provide training to PACS members by engaging   and e-Kisan Bhawans,” he said.
 
 Noting that the state’s trees and forests could be used to supply raw materials to the paper factory, the CM asked the forest and environment department principal secretary to procure latest figures and data from   (Dehradun) regarding green coverage of Bihar.
 
 The CM said saplings should be planted along the rural roads and state highways in a manner that they are able to provide raw materials for the paper industry.
