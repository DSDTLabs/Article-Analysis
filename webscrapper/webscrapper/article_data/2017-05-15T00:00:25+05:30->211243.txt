Women of today excel in every field. But there is one thing which would seem like rocket science to every mother at some point of time — making her child eat the food she has put all her heart and time into. Food blogger Sindhu Rajan turns her daughter’s meal plates into colourful and creative canvases each time. When it comes to a kid, it’s always about how it looks, and not how it tastes, she says. By using her imagination, she turns ordinary meals into nutritious and healthy  , proving that your young ones’ breakfast, lunch and dinner time can actually be fun. Here are a few of her creations!
