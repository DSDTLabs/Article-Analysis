BENGALURU: The countdown has begun for Bengaluru’s bid for a better ranking under  . The city had been ranked a dismal 210 in last year’s survey.

 A central team is expected to visit the city shortly for inspection. However, when it comes to segregation of   at source, there is a long road to go if the city wants to improve its ranking, According to the latest figures on solid waste management in 198 wards, available with the BBMP, only about 45% of households are segregating waste at source.
 
 A BBMP official said they have collected data on waste segregation and categorized them based on the extent of segregation at source. “While there are wards which have achieved more than 80% segregation, their numbers are few. Sadly, there are wards where the segregation is zero. Overall, the average waste segregation for the city is about 45%,” he added. 
 
 N S Ramakanth, solid waste management round table expert, said though the preparation for the Swachh Survekshan exercise has been better this year compared to previous years, the reason for hiccups in solid waste management is that preparedness has not percolated down to most field staff. “This is the reason why the city is lacking in segregation. There’s lack of enough political will to enforce rules pertaining to waste management,” he added.
 
 Sandhya Narayan, another member of the SWM Round Table, said one good thing about the exercise this year has been collection of a lot of data. “The civic body has set up a war room of sorts where data from different zones is being collated. We have come to know that wards which are doing well in segregation are doing so because of active participation of citizen groups coupled with efforts by local officers. But if you see the entire city scenario, there’s lot of scope for improvement,” she added.
