PATNA: Prime Minister   is likely to inaugurate the much-awaited centenary celebrations of Patna University (PU) in the third week of October.

 Sources said though the PMO was yet to communicate a date to the concerned, the state government and the PU administration have been alerted to a tentative schedule just before Diwali in October .
 
 On July 7 this year, the PMO had informed the PU vice-chancellor about the PM’s in-principle consent to inaugurate the centenary celebrations in September or October. 
 
 PU is busy preparing for the celebrations. Several activities have been planned and are being executed as the D-Day is approaching fast. A centenary run was held recently.
 
 VC Ras Bihari Prasad Singh told this correspondent the university was contemplating hiring the services of professionals for making a documentary on the varsity’s growth and achievements during its 100 years of existence. A committee of three teachers headed by Jayashree Mishra is writing a book on the history of PU. 
 
 The university is also contemplating resuming the publication of PU News Bulletin, a quarterly journal whose publication was stopped few years back due to unknown reasons. A souvenir highlighting the achievements of different colleges and PG departments will also be brought out. 
 
 The inaugural function is most likely to be held in the newly constructed ‘Gyan Bhawan’ near Gandhi Maidan, and not in the historic Wheeler Senate House as earlier planned, for security reasons.
 
 The state government has agreed to sanction Rs 4 crore to PU for celebrating its centenary on a grand scale. The UGC is also likely to sanction heritage grants to the university. 
 
 President Ram Nath Kovind is likely to attend the valedictory function of PU’s centenary celebrations in January next year, said sources.
