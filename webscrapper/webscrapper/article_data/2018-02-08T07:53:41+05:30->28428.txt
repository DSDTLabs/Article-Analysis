BENGALURU: Here is some good news for bird lovers of the city. Hornbills have been spotted near Sarjapur, despite the locality's bustling traffic and booming realty sector. 

  Environmentalists and residents of the area recently documented activity and nesting of Indian grey hornbills. Environmentalist   told TOI: "Interestingly, Indian grey hornbills have survived due to some large trees that are part of the old sacred groves and waterbodies in the area. Civic agencies and the state government should protect such lung spaces to help these birds live longer. Stress should be given on growing more indigenous trees." 
 
  Nishanth said they spotted the hornbills at Sarjapur about two weeks ago, following an invitation from Sarjapur residents welfare association. "We were excited to see a pair of Indian grey hornbills entering a bamboo grove and settling in it. After sunrise they came out and sat near a ficus tree," he added. 
 
 Nishanth said Indian grey hornbills were common in Bengaluru a few decades ago. "But over the years, their numbers dwindled due to shrinking lung spaces in the city. Though there were stray recordings of these birds in places like  ,  , Lalbagh, JP Nagar and GKVK a few years ago, sightings and nesting of hornbills at Sarjapur is really encouraging," he added. 
 
  Joy V R, a member of the Sarjapur residents welfare association, said the area where the birds have been spotted belongs to Yamare panchayat under Anekal taluk of   district. "We are creating awareness among villagers and elected representatives on the need to protect waterbodies and large trees to ensure the birds' habitat is protected for future. Many are keen on supporting us," he added. 
 
 Hornbills are known to feed on   like ficus, and also insects, small birds, reptiles, molluscs and scorpions. Some hornbill species are endangered.
