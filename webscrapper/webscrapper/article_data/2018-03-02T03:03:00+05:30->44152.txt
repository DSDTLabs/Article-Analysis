Margao: A delegation of ‘Awake Goans’, a social forum, submitted a memorandum to the Curchorem Cacora Municipal Council (CCMC) chief officer demanding that the municipality desist from “harassing” traditional Goan   selling their produce by the roadsides, and instead provide permanent sheds to them.

 Chief officer Pramod Dessai assured the delegation that all roadside vendors will be accommodated in the GSUDA market complex.
