SECUNDERABAD: The early morning drama was replayed but without grace. A day after they were stopped by the  , a group of morning walkers was again barred from heading towards   on Thursday. Things got worse when the walkers yelled, “We are Indian citizens and certainly not terrorists” at a batch of soldiers on  . After a nearly 45-minute fracas and war of words, the soldiers finally let the walkers have their own “halo moment.”

 
 As part of their daily routine, 30 walkers gathered at ‘The Stop N’ Bakery’ at 6.15 am and started walking towards AOC Circle. But, they were stopped in their tracks at Wellington Road by the jawans. Heated arguments ensued between them. The walkers pleaded that they be allowed to take up their activity. But, the soldiers did not budge, saying “they cannot do anything and they are helpless.”
 
 The walkers questioned the soldiers if they received specific instructions from top   to stop them from walking on civilian roads. “If so, you paste the orders either on the walls or AOC gate pillars. We are Indians and not terrorists,” shouted a regular walker. In the meantime, soldiers started taking photographs of agitated walkers. After persuasion, shouting and cajoling, the soldiers allowed the walkers to move ahead.
