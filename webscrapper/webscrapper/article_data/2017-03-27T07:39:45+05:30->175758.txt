PUNE: The   (RTO) Pune has planned a fresh drive against drivers of   found flouting norms.

 An awareness campaign aimed at reminding them about the rules and letting them know about the legal consequences for flouting those will precede the drive.
 
 “Right now, many schools have examinations followed by the summer vacation. We plan to hold the campaign during the holidays after which the drive will begin,“ said deputy regional transport officer Sanjay Raut. He added the Pune police will be roped in.
 
 “The drivers and transporters should know the legal troubles they can get into if they flout regulations. However, putting an end to all such issues is difficult until the RTO gets support from all quarters, including parents,“ the official pointed out.
 
 The state education department had framed the school bus policy in 2011, laying down several regulations for the vehicles.
 
 Some regulations include good seating options for students, operational   cameras, no overcrowding and the presence of a male and a female attendant for safety. Those operating vehicles for transportation of children should obtain a special permit.
 
 “The RTO has planned 40 sessions with drivers in coordination with Pune police's traffic branch. There will be presentations and leaflets will be distributed citing regulations and the legal consequences. They will be given a chance to air their grievances as well,“ Raut said.
 
 The official agreed there were many vehicles illegally ferrying school children in the city. “Parents tend to compromise on transportation costs. The departments and administration will not be able to help unless parents take steps to provide safety to their children,“ he added.
