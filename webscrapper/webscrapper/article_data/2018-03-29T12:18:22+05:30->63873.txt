ALWAR: Eight persons, who had looted as many as 2,000   belonging to a local   leader on last Friday night, were arrested by Alwar’s Mandawar police on Wednesday.

 Terming it as the state’s biggest ever ‘chicken theft,’ the police teams showed great alacrity in tracking down the suspects and busting the gang within a span of five days. The chickens, however, could not be recovered yet as the gang admitted to have sold them in Haryana.
 
 On March 23, eight suspects barged into a poultry farm belonging to former councillor and local BJP leader Satish Yadav. “The accused came in a pick vehicle. They tied the watchman of the farm and put a gun near his head in order to subdue any resistance,” said SHO Veer Singh Gujar.
 
 The criminals then packed all chickens into their pic-up vehicle and fled from the spot. “We sift through dozens of   footage and spoke with many of our local informers to gather information about the gang,” Gujar told TOI.
 
 The police arrested the kingpin   alias Dushyant and seven others of his gang members.
 
 “We have also seized two vehicles from the gang’s possession which we suspect they had used for the loot,” the official told TOI.
 
 The sources in   police said that the kingpin worked used to sell eggs and saw a great profit selling chickens. “Nandu formed a gang comprising local vendors, cleaners and others for this loot. He has claimed that he sold all the chickens to different persons in Haryana,” an official told TOI, adding that efforts are being made to track the people whom the gang sold chickens.
 
 “We are interrogating him to check if in the past too he had carried out similar criminal activites,” said the official.
