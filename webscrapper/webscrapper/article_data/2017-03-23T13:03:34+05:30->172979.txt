HYDERABAD: M Saritha, a 32-year-old woman who has been trying to conceive through treatments for over a decade, received a shock recently. The reason for her   was genital or   (TB).

 “In spite of pursuing various treatments and undergoing  , the cause was revealed only during a hysteroscopy or  ,“ said Saritha, who then underwent a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. According to a report by the  , 5-13% of women visiting infertility clinics in the country have genital TB. And Hyderabad is no different, say officials of fertility clinics.
 
 “Around 40% of infertility patients in Hyderabad have been diagnosed with pelvic TB. This figure has risen from 15% over the last three years,“ pointed out Nirmala Agarwal, a reproductive endocrinologist at Juhi Fertility Centre in the city.
 
 Doctors say the number of patients being diagnosed with pelvic TB in Hyderabad has in creased by 15% in three years.
 
 “Even two years ago, many were not aware of pelvic TB, a type of extra-pulmonary TB that can cause infertility. The level of awareness about this TB has still not reached the desired levels. TB can affect any organ,“ said Ramana Prasad, a consultant interventional pulmonologist at KIMS hospitals.
 
 Detection is a challenge due to its 'silent' symptoms, say doctors. According to the guidelines issued by the Central TB division of the Union health and family welfare ministry , “Some (particularly female) patients may experience no symptoms at all other than infertility, meaning that a high index of suspicion and careful clinical evaluation are needed (for diagnosis).“
 
 Experts say that in most cases, patients do not know they are suffering from this TB in the early stages. “This is why it is important that people undergo pelvic scans and laparoscopy. It is important that it is diagnosed early. If the damage on the reproductive organ is too much, the condition cannot be reversed and the patient cannot conceive, in a natural or assisted manner,“ said Agarwal.
