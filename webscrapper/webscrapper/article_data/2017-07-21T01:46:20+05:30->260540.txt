NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s decision to reallocate work among his ministers was notified on Thursday. As reported first by TOI, deputy CM   has assumed charge of tourism department and art, culture and languages from social welfare minister Rajendra Gautam. However, Sisodia has been relieved of the charge of the critical revenue department that has gone to law and transport minister Kailash  .

 The reshuffle has been undertaken to focus on areas that the AAP government has marked out as its priorities. The portfolio reallocations come with a plan to make rural Delhi intrinsic to the government’s development plan. The portfolio line-up now reflects a seven-member cabinet where Kejriwal continues to be without any portfolios. In 2015, Kejriwal had justified not keeping any portfolios saying that he wanted to focus on systemic reforms, guiding his first-time ministers and undertaking field visits to get public feedback.
 
 Sisodia still holds charge of nine prime departments and all others that are not allocated to any minister. His portfolios include education, finance, planning, land and building, vigilance, services and women and child development.
 
 Gahlot is being projected as AAP’s rural face and Sisodia the man in the driver’s seat leading key initiatives to showcase the government’s performance. Gahlot has charge of revenue, law, transport, administrative reforms and information and technology. Gautam has the portfolios of water, social welfare and SC/ST department, Gurdwara elections and registrar of cooperative societies.
 
 Satyendar Jain’s profile remains unchanged with six portfolios — health, home, power, urban development, industries and PWD. Gopal Rai’s profile too will remain unchanged with labour, employment, development, general administration and flood and irrigation. Imran Hussain will continue to be in charge of food and civil supplies, environment and forests and elections.
