CHENNAI: A state advisory has cautioned subscribers of   from buying set top boxes (STB) from private dealers. The state has also said that if cable TV operators are found harassing subscribers into paying for STBs, their license will be cancelled.

 The state government began distribution of free set top boxes to subscribers of the   Arasu Cable TV Corporation (TACTV) a month ago. Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami launched the service through government-owned enterprise by distributing STBs and inaugurating MPEG-4 upgraded control room for digital signal transmission.
 
 According to a press statement released by the state government,   Cable is the only state-owned undertaking in India to offer free STBs and combined digital cable TV and internet services. The STB distributed by the government comes with a three-year warranty.
 
 Nearly 70 lakh subscribers of Arasu cable network will have access to nearly 180 channels in digital mode. There will be four packages with monthly subscription varying between Rs 125 and Rs 275 with option of both pay and free channels.
 
 TACTV, known as Arasu cable applied for Digital Addressable System licence in 2012 and got it in April this year. 
 
 Arasu TV, which began operations in October 2007, offers 90-100 channels through local cable operators across the State. From 4.94 lakh subscribers in September 2011, the number has increased to 70.52 lakh. Cable operators can change a one-time activation fee of Rs 200 from customers.
