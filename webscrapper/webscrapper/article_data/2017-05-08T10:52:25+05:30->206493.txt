LUCKNOW: Just a day after   Adityanath Yogi wielded the broom in   and gave a 15-day deadline to   to clean the city, a reality check by TOI found piles of garbage back at the same spot on Sunday. 

 Accompanied by urban development minister Suresh Khanna and other party functionaries, the CM had swept about a 300-metre stretch of the access road to the slum in Balu Adda on Saturday. The move was following Prime Minister  's Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan Swachh Survekshan-2017 which revealed that Uttar Pradesh is the filthiest.
 
 Ranked 269th out of 434 cities included under the survey, Lucknow's position this year fell drastically, compared to the 2016 survey. On Sunday, most dustbins across the city were spilling over. The situation was no different in posh Gomtinagar, Mahanagar, Indiranagar and Hazratganj, Gokhale Marg, Jopling Road and Dalibagh. Residents complained that sanitary workers rarely clean the streets and dustbins, while municipal officials maintain that routine cleaning is being conducted regularly. "From Monday, cleaning of roads will be conducted twice a day, from 6am-9am and in the afternoon from 2pm-5pm. We will make sure that sweeping and emptying of LMC installed trash cans are done regularly," said acting Mayor Suresh Chara Awasthi.
