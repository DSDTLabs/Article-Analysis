HYDERABAD: Rampaging crowds at bus stops and railway stations, and serpentine queues at toll plazas marked the pre-Sankranti yearly exodus from Hyderabad on Friday evening, as migrants made haste for their hometowns.

 Those availing cabs to commute around the city were in for a rude shock on Friday as the fares stood much higher than usual. Commuters also complained of random cancellations by drivers and non-availability of cabs. Those who landed at the Rajiv Gandhi international airport in  , had a harrowing time finding cabs.
 
 South Central Railway (SCR) confirmed that a majority of the additional services for the Sankranti festival were booked in the form of Tatkal and early reservation tickets. SCR introduced three special trains, between Narsapur-Secunderabad, Kakinada Town-Secunderabad and Hyderabad-Machilipatnam, in liue of increased passenger counts.
 
 Many made advanced bookings with the   (TSRTC) , but heavy rush was also witnessed at the offices of private tour operators.
 
 “In trains as well as   buses, bookings have been made more than one month in advance. This is why I decided to go for a private bus operator to travel to Bangalore, although the fares are much higher than usual. We managed to get last minute seats,” said Ramesh Reddy S, a resident of Secunderabad.
