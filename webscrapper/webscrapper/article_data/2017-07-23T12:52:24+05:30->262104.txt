 Addressing a press conference at Tilak Patrakar Bhavan, association’s chief organizer Sanjay Patil said, “Transparency was necessary for ensuring justice. The association has appealed to Maharashtra governor to take cognisance of the issue. “If one enquires about the track record of appointment of government lawyers in the last 50 years, you would find that the persons holding the post are associated with the ruling party in some way or the other.”
 
 The association called staying the current appointments of public prosecutors to the district and sessions court, Nagpur. The panel formed after the assembly elections for appointment of lawyers should be dissolved and replaced with a new one within six months. Till then, the existing public prosecutors should be allowed to practice, the organization said.
 
 “Appointments of experienced public prosecutors are being cancelled and new lawyers are named to the posts since long. Experienced lawyers are able to guide new persons which keeps the balance in practising law,” said Patil.
