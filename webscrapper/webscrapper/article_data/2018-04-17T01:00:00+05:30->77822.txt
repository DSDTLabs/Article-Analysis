Working on ' ', the upcoming political drama, has been an enriching experience for director   and the film’s lead actors,   and  . The trio recently shared some fond memories of shooting for the movie in Ayodhya. 

 Sudhir Mishra said, “I have known the erstwhile raja of Ayodhya for a long time, and it was refreshing to shoot in their grand palace. The family was kind enough to accommodate us and give us a taste of their fine hospitality. When you see the film, you’ll realise how opulent the palace is. It was the perfect place to portray the grandeur that Daas Dev’s setting required.”
  
 Rahul added, “The palace is shown as my home in 'Daas Dev' and most of the film has been shot there. The royal family even treated us to home-cooked food during the shoot. We have nice memories of Ayodhya.”
 
 On her part, Richa said, “ It was amazing shooting in Ayodhya. Rahul and I would often race our production cars to the palace, because we were really excited about using the four-lane highway from Lucknow to Ayodhya. The royal family even invited us over for dinner. Shooting in the holy city of Ayodhya has definitely added to the grandeur of our film.”
 
 'Daas Dev', produced by Sanjeev Kumar of Saptarishi Cinevision and presented by Gaurav Sharma of Storm Pictures, releases on April 20.
