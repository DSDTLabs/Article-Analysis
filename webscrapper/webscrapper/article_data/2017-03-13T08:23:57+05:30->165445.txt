LUDHIANA: The performance of   in the assembly elections has taken political parties by surprise. Both winners and losers did fairly well. Their performance was in stark contrast with the 2012 assembly elections, when the main political parties did not give a ticket to a single woman candidate and only three tried their luck as independent candidates. They got less than 1,000 votes.

 This time however, parties launched three women candidates in rural constituencies of the district while one woman opted to contest as an independent. Congress pitched singer-turned-politician Satwinder Bitti against senior Akali leader and former MP Sharanjit Singh Dhillon. In Jagraon, SAD fielded Amarjit Kaur Sahoke.
 
 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) gave a ticket to Saravjit Kaur Manuke from Jagraon, where she faced Congress heavyweight Malkit Singh Dakha. Her victory came as a surprise, especially as she won by a huge margin of 25,576 votes to get 61,521 votes. Dakha got only 35,945 votes. Woman candidate Sahoke stood third with 33,295 votes.
 
 Bitti, a fresher in politics, lost to veteran Sharanjit Dhillon in Sahnewal. Dhillon got 63,184 votes, while Bitti got 58,633. The fourth woman candidate in the fray from Jagraon constituency was Gurminder Kaur who contested as an independent. However, her security deposit was forfeited as she bagged only 305 votes.
 
 Meanwhile, Manuke assured people of Jagraon that she would not let them suffer problems. Despite her party not forming government, she said she would work as a mediator between the government and people. She pointed out that there was no hospital in her constituency and the government school is in a pathetic condition. She said she would work on these two areas of concern on priority basis.
