NOIDA: The   has missed its deadline to start online registration-cum-appointment process for patients turning up at the hospital due to procedural and technical delays.

 Earlier, officials had promised to initiate the process for mobile phone application by September 15. However, the hospital authorities say that they are working on a tie-up with telecom companies for handling registration charge via the application.
 
  Ajay Agrawal told TOI that the hospital is in contact with telecom giants,   and  , for the same.
 
 “The only problem arising in the process is how to deduct the one rupee registration fee. We are in talks with Airtel and Idea so that they can adjust the fee in their SMS charges. They are yet to give a confirmation but we are hopeful that they will agree,” Agrawal said.
 
 The firm had also promised to provide tablets to the doctors of the hospital so that they can add the details of their patient’s diagnosis in their systems, which can act as a reference record for the future.
 
 This was meant to help the doctors so they don’t have to refer to a patient’s old prescriptions, etc and go through the record on the next visit.
 
 No fresh deadlines have been given for the completion of the process yet.
