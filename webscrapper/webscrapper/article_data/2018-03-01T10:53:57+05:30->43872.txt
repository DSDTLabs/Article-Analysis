NEW DELHI: Amid a weakening global trend,   futures traded lower by Rs 122 at Rs 30,384 per 10 grams today as speculators scaled down their positions. 

 Gold for delivery in June dropped Rs 122, or 0.40 per cent, to Rs 30,384 per 10 grams, in a business turnover of five lots at the Multi Commodity Exchange. 
 
 In a similar fashion, the metal for delivery in April contract was trading down Rs 115, or 0.38 per cent, to Rs 30,264 per 10 grams in 184 lots. 
 
 Analysts said the fall in gold futures is mostly in line with a weak trend overseas where the strong dollar following comments from   Chairman that fanned concerns of faster-than-expected hikes in US interest rates took away some of the safe haven appeal of the precious metal. 
 
 Meanwhile, gold prices fell 0.27 per cent to USD 1,314.20 an ounce in Singapore.
