NEW DELHI:   on Friday accused the Modi government of using “agencies” to disseminate a distorted version of the court order in the   case.

 Congress spokesperson   said, “(The misinformation from government) shows unambiguous insecurity and vindictive approach. Yes, we understand that the ruling party wants to indulge in this campaign of misinformation only because either they want to supply information to their proxies who are fighting us in court or they do not want to go by the facts because they are scared of the facts.”
 
 Singhvi said he had withdrawn the case as the Delhi high court order said all points raised by Young Indian could be raised before the income tax department. “I withdrew the writ petition because of that,” he said.
 
 Arguing that Young Indian was a ‘not for profit’ company,   spokesperson   said, “No one can withdraw a single rupee of profit, salary or dividend from it or benefit from it in any manner as per the Companies Act.”
 
 Accusing the government of spreading misinformation through unsigned notes, Singhvi said, “We will apologise to you if the order shows this. 
 
 Is it not contempt of court? Some of you are told to publish that the order says   and   have been asked to appear.”
