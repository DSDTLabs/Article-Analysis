PALAKKAD: Firefighters gained control over a devastating wildfire that scorched about 50 hectares of forest in the   on Saturday.   in Coimbatore had joined beleaguered firefighters as they battled the fire, which started at   side of the reserve, on Friday. 

 The IAF choppers sprayed water from the   and Thunakadavu reservoirs to extinguish the flames but the fires remained out of control. The fire continued to burn at several forest stretches but wildlife warden of the reserve B N Anjankumar, who spearheaded the firefighting, claimed that the fires were under control and that no helicopters were pressed into service on Saturday.
 
 The fires spread from Anamalai in Tamil Nadu, the forest officials said. They said the blazes were fuelled by the weather, wind and dry bushes and shurbs.
 
  The weak performance of the south-west monsoon has turned the region tinder-dry. The adjacent   ranges have also been facing an unprecedented drought situation, they added. 
 
 The firefighting operations were jointly conducted by the disaster management groups from Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the forest department and the IAF. Ten years ago a fierce wildfire had destroyed hundreds of acres of forests and plantations in the region,
