 Camila Cabello has said she is an introvert and sometimes gets overwhelmed from too much attention. 

  
  
 The   hitmaker revealed she often "froze" in front of people and had to block everything to concentrate on her work. 
 
 "Actually, I'm extremely shy. I've always been introverted. There is a picture from my ninth birthday where people are singing 'Happy Birthday' and there are tears in my eyes because I get emotional from too much attention. 
 
 According to a report, Cabello said, "It happened again this morning. I was being filmed for an interview and there were hair and make-up people in the room, and I froze. You have to stop, block everything out and focus on the job". 
 
 But the 21-year-old singer said she overcame her fears through  . 
 
 ''When you love something enough you get over your fears, and with performing... I can't explain it. I get lost in the music and all of a sudden I'm not me anymore, I'm a vehicle for whatever the emotion is that I'm singing about. 
 
 "I feel exposed, but not exposed, if that makes sense. If I'm singing, I'm fine. If I win an award my first thought is, 'Oh my God, now I have to go up there and talk'," Cabello said.
