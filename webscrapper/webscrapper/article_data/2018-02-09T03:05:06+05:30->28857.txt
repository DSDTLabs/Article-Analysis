GURUGRAM: The inauguration of the   in   village, which was scheduled for Thursday was postponed at the last minute owing to land dispute. 

 TOI had earlier reported that an Ambedkar statue, that was erected by the villagers and inaugurated on January 26, was found vandalised two days later. Following this, the district administration had released funds to erect another statue at the same spot. This statue was scheduled to be inaugurated on Thursday by  , but when he reached the location he informed the villagers that land belonged to the animal husbandry department who had objected to the unveiling of the statue. 
 
 However, locals protested this claim and said that the land belonged to them. A Dalit community leader said, “This is our land and our community has been using it for years. Earlier this land was used for skinning dead animal and later we built a chaupal here.” Meanwhile,  , a leader of the community, said that a panchayat had passed a resolution, many years ago, that said that the land belonged to the animal husbandry. “We are not even sure when that resolution was passed. In 2014, the former sarpanch of the village allowed the community members to set up a chaupal here. Hence proving that the land belonged to us,” he said.
 
 Deputy commissioner  , when contacted, said “We were not aware of the land dispute when the community leaders approached us last week. Hence the amount was sanctioned. However, we have postponed the unveiling of the statue because of the objections raised by the animal husbandry department.”
 
 The DC added that they are now examining the matter with respect to ownership. “Once we are clear on the matter, we will take the decision. We will try to come to an amicable decision,” Singh said.
