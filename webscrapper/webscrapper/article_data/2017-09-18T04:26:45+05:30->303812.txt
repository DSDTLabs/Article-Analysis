KOLKATA: This festive season, buy one ticket, hop on any bus, get off at any Puja and then take another bus to another  . The   (WBTC) is set to introduce a common all-day ticketing system to offer pandal-hoppers easy commute. 

 The common ticket will be applicable on AC and non-AC buses, trams and ferries. A Rs 75 ticket will enable a person to take any number of trips to anywhere in the city for a day.
 
 “One ticket will offer unlimited trips across the city by bus, tram and vessels. It is called ‘hop-on-hop-off Puja parikrama’ and if this succeeds, the model will be replicated at other festivals,” said WBTC managing director Narayan Swarup Nigam.
 
 The tickets will be available with bus conductors and at designated depots of WBTC. “The same tab — festivity transit — can be customised for other festivals, be it Eid or Christmas or Ratha Yatra,” said Soumitra Bose of Ideation Technology, the knowledge partner of the transport department.
 
 “This option will give Puja revellers unlimited freedom to choose the route, direction and time for taking any bus anywhere. We have chosen some routes for pandal hopping on an experimental basis ,” said a transport department official. He added that the model may be replicated for tourists during winter to cover popular spots.
 
 Across Europe and the US, travellers avail of special hop-on, hop-off buses during the day to visit places of tourist interest. Usually, there are guides on board who give a commentry on places as the bus makes its way through the city. The buses stop for a couple of minutes at each historical site or place of tourist interest so that people can alight or board it. In Europe, the service usually ends around 6pm, after which travellers have to avail of regular public transport and pay separately for these rides.
