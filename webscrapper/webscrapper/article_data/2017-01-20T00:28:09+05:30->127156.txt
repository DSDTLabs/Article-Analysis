NAVI MUMBAI:   residents have been complaining about the sludge piling up on a stretch of the extended   for the past six months. The sludge has accumulated from the water and cement mixture being used at an   project in sector 11, said locals.

 But the civic officials are ignoring the issue, alleged locals. Fitness enthusiasts use this stretch for walks. The labourers at the construction site defecate in the open on the roadside, said walkers.
 
 Ghansoli resident   said, “I sent a complaint letter to the additional municipal commissioner in June 2016. I also brought it to the notice of the civic chief Tukaram Mundhe at the ‘Walk with Commissioner’ event held on December 17. He ordered the Ghansoli ward officer to get rid of the problem. But even after a month, the road condition remains messy.” 
 
 Ghansoli ward officer Dattatray Nagare said, “We will take legal action on the concerned developer.”
