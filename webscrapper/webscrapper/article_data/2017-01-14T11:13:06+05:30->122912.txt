PATNA: Concerned over the resentment aired by the jawans of   (CAPF) from public platforms, the   headquarters has asked its regional offices to organise ‘Sainik Sammelan’ within the next few days to hear their grievances.

 The sources said the CRPF authorities took serious note of the problems raised on social media by paramilitary jawans about the poor quality of food served to them and other related issues and the DG issued the directive through a videoconference on Friday. 
 
 “In the wake of complaints by the jawans, all offices have been asked to have dedicated mobile phone numbers, a complaint box and WhatsApp numbers to get their grievances registered and redress them on a priority basis,” a CRPF spokesman said on Friday. 
 
 “Although ‘sainik sammelans‘ are organised at all offices – camps and regional headquarters – to hear the grievances of jawans, we have been asked to organise it once again within two days and redress the problem raised by them on priority,” he said. 
 
 On the issues raised by CRPF jawan Pankaj Mishra, a native of Bihar who also supported BSF jawan Tej Bahadur Yadav’s complaint about poor food quality, the spokesman said their frustration could be a fallout of the nature of duty which CRPF jawans perform. “It is demanding as well challenging. Or, it may be an effort to divert the attention from his other problems. It’s a matter of investigation,” he said. 
 
 An officer said Mishra is posted with F/221 Bn,   in West Bengal. The company was to move to Tripura to take over important assignments of VIP security and to Manipur for the upcoming assembly elections. “He is overstaying after his leave from January 5 and that may have prompted him to raise the issue,” he clarified. 
 
 “However, in this matter, the CRPF DG has already ensured the jawans to take cognisance of those issues which are highly sensitive. Regular efforts are made to redressing their grievances at several levels,” he added.
