MUMBAI: A 500-sq ft tenement offered free to   of all buildings taken up for redevelopment under the old and dilapidated building redevelopment scheme or the cluster housing redevelopment project.

 This was among the several suggestions put forward by legislators at a meeting held at   on Monday. The committee, comprising   from both Houses, was set up by housing minister Prakash Mehta in 2016. The brief of the eight-member committee was to provide suggestions to resolve the contentious issue of old buildings and ensure redevelopment of cessed, non-cessed, BIT, PMGP buildings with the Repair Reconstruction Board.
 
 The committee had its final meeting on Monday where the six legislators present unanimously proposed 500-sq ft homes against the current 300-sq ft homes. In case of   with incentives, the flat size can go up to 390 sq ft to 405 sq ft, the panel has said. The Maharashtra Housing Area Development Authority ( ) will assess the recommendations.
 
 “It is already being offered to residents of BDD chawls so why not to the others?” said Amin Patel, Congress legislator from Mumbadevi.
 
 BJP MLA Raj Purohit said it was not an election gimmick. “Mill workers are being given 515 sq ft houses, those affected by the Metro, 415 sq ft residences, then why not local residents?” 
 
 Other recommendations include bringing down the consent required for redevelopment from 70% to 51%. In case of cluster redevelopment, it has been proposed to reduce the size of the cluster from 4,000 sq m to 2,000 sq m and consent to be obtained from 51% of the landlords. The minimum rent proposed to be paid to tenants during the transition period is Rs 20,000.
 
 Milind Mhaiskar, vice-president, Mhada, said the main thrust of the report is to ensure redevelopment starts on projec-ts that have been in a limbo. He said wherever NOCs have been issued, builders will be held responsible with punitive action, including jail, recommended.
