AHMEDABAD: Ishrat Jahan’s mother, Shamima Kauser, on Thursday filed an application before a special CBI court regarding the discharge plea filed by state police chief and an accused in the 2004 encounter case, P P Pandey.

 Through her advocate I H Syed, Shamima sought the court’s permission to join proceedings on Pandey’s application requesting the court to drop charges against him. It was highlighted that in such cases, the victim’s kin can approach the court and oppose the discharge application, the lawyer said.
 
 The CBI judge M K Pandya shall hear Shamima’s application on January 20.
 
 Meanwhile, the CBI did not file its reply to Pandey’s discharge application as asked for by the court earlier.
 
 Pandey has sought discharge from the case with the argument that the CBI chargesheet does not reveal any role played by him.
 
 Moreover, sanction for prosecution has not been granted by the government in this case. 
 
 The absence of government sanction to prosecute police officers was the reason for the discharge of various IPS officers in the 2005   fake encounter case.
 
 Pandey became the last accused person to be arrested by the CBI in July 2013. He evaded investigators and was declared an absconder by the court. He surrendered only after the   refused to grant him protection from possible arrest in this case, in which four persons including Ishrat Jahan were gunned down by personnel of the city crime branch on June 15, 2004.
 
 Pandey remained in jail for 19 months before being granted bail by the CBI court in February 2015. He was reinstated in the police department and given a promotion. After former DGP P C Thakur was transferred from the post, Pandey was given charge.
 
 Former DGP Julio Ribeiro unsuccessfully challenged Pandey’s appointment as in-charge DGP before the Gujarat high court by filing a PIL.
