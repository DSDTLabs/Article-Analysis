CHANDIGARH: The   (MC) on Sunday cleaned all parks and garbage from choes throughout the city under the "  hi Seva" programme. 

 MC commissioner Baldeo   started the cleanliness drive from Rose Garden along with senior officers and MC staff. Later, the drive was taken to the other parts of the city and similar drives were organised throughout all the 26 MC wards under the supervision of councillors in their respective wards. 
 
 Purushartha said the MC has involved all stakeholders, including youth, defence personal, women and children, to clean their surroundings on a regular basis. "This is because access to sanitation is not an infrastructure problem. There is a deeper behavioural and socio-cultural context at play. Influencing a change in behaviour for all stakeholders is a challenge that has probably never been undertaken before. This could only be achieved through an intensive, time-bound intervention, spearheaded from the highest level, and involving all sections of society and government alike. The Swachh Bharat Mission's Swachhagraha has caught the nation's imagination," he added.
 
 He said today the MC will organise cleanliness drive in city and clean hospitals, parks, statues, bus stops, ponds and toilets according to " " under the 'Swachhata hi Seva' programme.
