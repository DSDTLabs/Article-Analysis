 Q. 
 
 A. The removal of the containers was the aimed at bringing discipline to the garbage disposal system. If containers are placed along roads, they hamper the doorto-door garbage collection. This is simply because many people throw the garbage in containers without sorting the rubbish. It’s only in some cases and locations that we allowed containers because there were no other options. But we are not encouraging bins because they prove harmful to residents. ( , head of PMC’s solid waste management department)
