VARANASI: The start of Durga Puja at   on BHU campus has eased some tension on the campus, however the participation of people has remained low in comparison to previous years so far.

 The police action on girl students on the second day of `Navratras' on campus had made BHU main gate a battlefield from where opposition politicians scored points and termed police action as an insult to Goddess Durga. These politicians kept thronging the varsity gate on the issue of cane charge on girl students till Wednesday afternoon. The beginning of Durga Puja at Madhuban Garden has somewhat eased the tense atmosphere on the campus but organisers sauy that the participation of teaching and non-teaching staff and their families as well as students had remained less till now.
 
 The BHU started Durga Puja celebration since 2004 when then vice chancellor gave his consent and a puja committee was formed.According to committees chief   department, the Durga Puja starts at   on `shashthi' (sixth day of Navratras). During the day, the committee holds 'bhandara' in which 1200 people consume prasad on an average per day, he said.
