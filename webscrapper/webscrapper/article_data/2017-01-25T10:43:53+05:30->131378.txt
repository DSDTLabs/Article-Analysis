 The couple - Rallapalli Rama Subba Rao and Subbalakshmi - from   in Andhra Pradesh was overjoyed when officials of the regional passport office came knocking on their door today to enable their differently-abled daughters get their passports at their home.
 Rao, a retired tehsildar, filed a petition on change.org yesterday about the plight of his polio-affiliated daughters and their difficulty in making a personal appearance at the passport office.
 
 The Union Minister, in response, last night tweeted, "I have gone through your petition. We will definitely help" and sought his personal details.

 The couple, which took care of the two daughters for over 40 years, now wanted to send them to the care of their brothers settled abroad and hence the need for passports.

 Passport officials have already contacted us and taken the details, he said.
 
 "Sushma ji's prompt action restores our faith in good governance and I am really happy that our ministers are helping people," the retired tehsildar added.
