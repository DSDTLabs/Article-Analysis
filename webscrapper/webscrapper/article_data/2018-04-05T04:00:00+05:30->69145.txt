Surat: Roof-top solar power generating systems with 200KW capacity will be installed on 156 BRTS bus stops in the city. A private company into the business of solar power generation will install the system and maintain it for a period of 25 years. The Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) will purchase the power produced at concessional rates.  SMC has invited tenders from solar power developer to survey and set up 200KW solar power units at BRTS bus stops by adopting the Renewable Energy Service Company (RESCO) model.  Under this model, the company will install and maintain the solar power system and civic body will purchase the electricity produced at a fixed rate for stipulated period of time.  “This would suffice us to run electrical operations in and around the bus stop,” said SMC commissioner M Thennarasan.  According to an estimate, a 200KW roof-top solar power system generates nearly 250 units every month and 100 such panels would generate 25,000 units. A solar power company would provide SMC electricity at the rate of Rs 5.8 per unit against regular market rate of Rs 7.69 per unit, resulting in a saving of up to Rs 5.25 lakh in electricity bills. Besides solar power generation, SMC has also started giving contracts for setting up hoardings atop its bus stops. “By letting out this space, SMC will earn few crores every year. It will be a big source of earning for the local body,” said a senior SMC official.
