ROHATK: Upset over the alleged abusive behaviour of the government school teachers, the residents of   and   villages in Jind district staged a dharna (sit-in) inside the school on Wednesday.

 Both the senior secondary and primary schools are located in one campus in   where around 800 students from the village and neighbouring Jeetgarh study.
 
 Staging the dharna from 7 am, villagers pitched tents inside school and sent all students, nearly 800 in number, back home and demanded transfer of all 32 teachers, including the headmasters, to change the school environment.
 
 The protesters said they would continue with the dharna till their demand was met.
 
 Talking to TOI, Roopgarh sarpanch   said in the last four years, the panchayat had to intervene eight times to resolve the internal disputes of teachers deputed in the village school.
 
 “When our children come home, they say teachers use vulgar language and get into verbal duel with each other instead of focusing on teaching. We have been bearing with them for the last four years with the hope that they might mend their ways. Now the panchayat had to take action,” he said.
 
 He said the Class X and XII result of the school was worst in the district. The teachers were not concerned about educating, and just shift blame on each other.
 
 The Sarpanch said whenever they reported the matter to the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) and the district education officer (DEO), the authorities came and left the erring teachers with a mere warning.
 
 When contacted, Jind DEO Vijay Lakshmi said she had reached the school on Wednesday and received memorandum from the protesting residents seeking transfer of the entire staff of both schools over their abusive language and quarrelsome behaviour. She said transfering the entire staff was not in her purview and a request would be sent to the directorate of education for necessary action in the matter.
