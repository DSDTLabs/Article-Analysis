PATNA: Union minister   on Sunday said   president   Gandhi’s assertion that the party will win the 2019 parliamentary elections and also the coming assembly elections in three states was like “counting stars during the daytime.”

 Prasad, who briefed media persons here, also accused Rahul of “undermining the dignity of the country” by making unsavoury remarks against PM Narendra Modi’s informal summit meeting with Chinese president   at Wuhan. Prasad’s reaction came after the Congress president’s outbursts against the PM at the party’s Aakrosh rally in Delhi.
 
 “The   will win the 2019 parliamentary elections under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi with a comfortable margin,” Prasad claimed. He added the BJP, all along, had held the considered view that Rahul needed to do “homework” before speaking on any subject. “Now, we also realise that he does not speak the truth. He has ignored the fact that the Congress has only lost elections under his leadership,” Prasad said.
 
 On Rahul’s criticism of the PM’s China visit, the Union minister said, “The Congress president should know that the country’s foreign policy has always been perceived as beyond criticism. He should maintain the dignity of the country’s foreign policy.”
