BENGALURU:   said it has asked   to re turn $40 million, which was paid by the world's largest drinks ma ker to the former liquor baron last year, as part of a deal which saw him stepping down from   (USL).

 The deal included upfront payment of the amount, with the balance being paid in equal instalments over the next five years, provided   comply with the terms of the agreement such as a five-year global non-compete (excluding the United Kingdom) and non-interference, among others.
 
 "Diageo and other group companies have demanded from Mallya the repayment of $40 million which was paid by Diageo on February 25, 2016, and also sought compensation from him for various losses incurred by the relevant members of the Diageo group on account of the breaches committed by him," the company said in its preliminary results for the year ended June 30.
 
 Mallya stepped down as the chairman of United Spirits after it was alleged he diverted funds to the now defunct   and his   Team. In July 2016, USL disclosed Rs 1,225 crore worth fund diversion and improper transactions with entities associated with Mallya.
 
 "While the first instalment of $7 million would have become due on February 25, 2017, owing to various reasons, including breaches of several provisions of the February 25 agreement committed by Mallya, Diageo believes that it was not liable to pay such amount, and is very unlikely to become liable to pay future instalments, to Mallya," the British company added.
