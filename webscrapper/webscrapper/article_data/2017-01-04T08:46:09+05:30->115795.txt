THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Union government's   comes at a time when the eligibility test ­conducted for the students who complete MBBS course from other countries ­have been scrapped. Even the new proposal says that a person seeking provisional or permanent registration shall not have to qualify this screening test if he/she holds an undergraduate medical qualification from other countries.

 “It is a paradox that the Union health ministry and Niti Aayog are exempting foreign  , who seldom see patients. They can practice any where in the country without any quality checks,“ said Dr N Sulphi, state secretary elect of Indian Medical Association. At present, on an average 3,000 to 4,000 foreign-educated MBBS graduates are reaching India each year. When there was a stipulation to pass the eligibility test to become a registered medical practitioner in India, the pass percentage was 15, said Dr Mohanan.
 
 “Now, this quality check has been stopped at a time when the graduates from countries like China, Russia, Ukraine, Philippines and African countries are passing out without seeing any patient,“ he added.
 
 It is surprising that the same govern ment is imposing quality checks on doctors who are passing out from government medical colleges with high standards, said Dr P S Jinesh, a health activist. He added that exempting those who are passing out from foreign universities, without any expertise on patient care, was not right.
 
 However, Travancore Cochin Medical Council chose to differ on the issue. “They have to undergo strict housesurgency for a year in the government sector before they get their registration.It is perhaps the best quality check we are making for foreign graduates. At least, we are ensuring that they are seeing patients,“ said Dr Mohanan.
