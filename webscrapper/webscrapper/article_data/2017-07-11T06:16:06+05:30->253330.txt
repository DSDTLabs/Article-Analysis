NEW  : Around a year ago, TOI reported on how   existed as if “it was never a part of Delhi”. The problem then was that the twin railway   and   that would have provided the place unhindered access to the rest of the capital had remained incomplete since work began in 2008. Another year has gone now, and the situation remains wretchedly the same. 

 North Delhi Municipal Corporation, which inherited the project from the   of Delhi, does not inspire confidence even today. The civic body is under financial stress and is, therefore, uncertain about when work will resume again. 
 
 Mayor Preety Agarwal could only promise that the corporation would ensure problems like waterlogging and mosquito breeding at the site are resolved at the earliest. 
 
 Sultanpuri has two exits: one is a kutcha road toward Mangolpuri that is almost impossible to use, being a rough, heavily encroached lane. The other is the as-yet-unfinished overbridge-underpass. The alternative is unmanned railway crossing. “We have seen so many accidents happening here, but we have no choice,” said resident Akhil. “To reach the nearest metro station, we have to either dare the railway tracks or take a lengthy detour. Also, the roads are in such a pathetic condition that massive traffic jams occur through the day.”
