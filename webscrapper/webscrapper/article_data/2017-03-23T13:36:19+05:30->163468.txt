  Badrinath Ki Dulhania, which marks the second instalment in the romantic-comedy franchise Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania, tells the story of a Badrinath Bansal (Varun Dhawan) and Vaidehi (Alia Bhatt) who fall in love with each other despite their opposite views on life and gender. Directed by Shashank Khaitan, the movie is all set to hit the theatres on March 10.
 
 
  Together, Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt are the best thing that could have happened to our screens. The beautiful effortlessness of their onscreen companionship plasters a grin on your face. Dhawan as Badri is adorable; you instantly take to him. He even pulls off some high-drama scenes impressively. Bhatt, unsurprisingly, gives it her all, and her sincerity comes through. But her accent, casually swinging between Juhu and Jhansi, is bothersome at times.
