MEERUT:   empowerment logo made with 5,000 paper boats at IIMT University in Meerut's Ganga Nagar entered   on Monday. 

  School and college students of five schools and colleges came together to make this logo. The paper boats were used to mark the fact that women are like kaagaz ki kashti (paper boats), who fight with whatever comes their way to reach their port and hence achieve their identity. 
 
  Speaking with TOI, Deepa Sharma, pro VC, IIMT University, said, "As many as 5,000 students and teachers of IIMT Academy, IIMT University, Gu ru Nanak Girls' Inter College and   came together to make this record a success. First, the wom en empowerment logo was drawn on the floor and the papers boats made by the students were kept ready near the logo for the kids to place them inside the sketch." 
 
  The logo was made in an area of 120 square feet. "A woman is like a paper boat and struggles with various problems that come her way for her own identity and existence. That is why the teachers thought of filling the women empowerment logo with a paper boat," said IIMT chairman, Yogesh Mohan Gupta. While the institution had thought of making this logo on Women's Day, as it could not be done, they chose March 20 which marks   Happiness Day to celebrate women empowerment .
