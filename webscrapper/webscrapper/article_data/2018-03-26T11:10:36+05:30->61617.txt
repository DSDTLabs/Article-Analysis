PUNE: The city and most parts of the state will witness dry weather conditions this week. The   ( ) has forecast “mainly clear skies” till March 31. Both day and night temperatures are likely to remain normal, with a marginal fall in a day or two.

 IMD officials said the trough that runs to Marathwada across east Jharkhand, interior Odisha, south Chhattisgarh and Vidarbha and a cyclonic circulation lies over southeast   off Kerala-Karnataka coasts will impact the weather conditions in the state and in Pune.
 
 The maximum temperature for the next six to seven days will remain around 37 degrees celsius, while the minimum will remain around 16 to 17 degrees celsius.
 
 The IMD in its earlier forecast had forecast, “Rain/thundershowers at isolated places likely over Vidarbha. Mainly dry weather is likely over Konkan & Goa, Madhya Maharashtra and Marathwada on Sunday.”
 
 The new report put out on Sunday said the probability of showers has reduced for the next few days. 
 
 The IMD officials added that chances of convective conditions have gone down. These conditions, which were caused due to increased heat and moisture, led to rainfall in many parts of the state including Pune, Marathwada and North Maharashtra. 
 
 The cyclonic circulation over north Konkan and adjoining east-central Arabian Sea has become less marked, which, according to IMD officials, will also reduce rainfall chances.
 
  The night temperature dipped to the season’s lowest on Friday morning to 12.4 degrees C, an unusual temperature for March-end. Shivajinagar also recorded the coldest night in the state on Friday. In fact, it was even cooler than Dehradun, Mahabaleshwar, Jammu and Madikeri. A fresh spell of snow in Srinagar made March unusually cool for the city.
 
 Lack of cloud cover and moisture in the night aid a dip in temperature.
