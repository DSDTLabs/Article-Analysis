NAVI MUMBAI: Residents of sector 15,   have reason to cheer as   has decided to shield an area next to a walking track by planting bougainvillea on the 700-m stretch of land which is adjacent to mangroves. 

 Plantation work of bougainvillea and golden bamboo began on Friday. The residents have been demanding that the area be beautified and not used as a garbage dumping spot. “The area adjacent to the walking track was fast turning into a convenient spot for dumping of waste and debris. The mangroves are only a few metres away so the illegal activities were damaging the eco system as well,” said a resident CD Gupta. 
 
 The green barrier will act as a deterrent and stop people from crossing over to dump garbage or defecate in public, said locals. “We had specifically sought for bougainvillea as it requires little water and is vibrant enough to add to the beauty of the landscape,” added Gupta. 
 
 NMMC had taken note of the issue and acted accordingly. Additional municipal commissioner   had also done a site inspection, said residents. “The beautification work is part of one time development plan of the node,” informed a civic official.
