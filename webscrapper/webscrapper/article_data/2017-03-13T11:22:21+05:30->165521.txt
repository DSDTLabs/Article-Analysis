NEW DELHI:   leader   on Monday accused the "  of stealing elections in Goa and Manipur."

 "A party that comes second has no right to form the government. BJP stealing elections in Goa and Manipur," Chidambaram tweeted on Monday morning.
 
 The comments of the former finance and home minister came after the BJP staked claim to form the government in Goa and Manipur — where it failed to emerge as the single largest party — with the support of smaller parties and some Independents.
 
 In both these states, the Congress has emerged as the single largest party in the assembly elections results of which were declared on March 11.
 
 Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah, however, took a dig at the Congress.
 
  
  
 Defence minister   was appointed Goa chief minister on Sunday after BJP concluded hectic negotiations with regional parties and independents to stitch up the numbers to form a government.
 
 Governor Mridula Sinha invited Parrikar to form the government after he staked claim and showed the support of 21 MLAs.
 
 BJP defeated Congress, which has more numbers, by tying up with Goa Forward Party, Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (both of whom have three MLAs), independent Rohan Khaunte and BJP-supported independent Govind Gaude.
 
 The saffron outfit has 13 MLAs in the 40-member Goa assembly while Congress has 17.
 
  
  In Manipur, BJP submitted a list of 32 MLAs - claiming a majority of two in 60-member assembly - to governor Najma Heptullah on Sunday and furnished letters of support from regional parties.
 
 BJP, which won 21 seats, claimed the support of National People's Party (4 MLAs), Naga People's Front (4), LJP (1) and two others - lone independent Ashab Uddin and T Robindro Singh, who was elected on a Trinamool ticket.
  
 Manipur CM Ibobi Singh too met the governor and staked his claim. He said that as the single largest party, Congress should be invited to prove its majority in the House.
