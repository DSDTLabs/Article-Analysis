Spending hours to get their hair and makeup done and changing into multiple outfits – the three days of the   was a lot of hard work for the models and the backstage team. So it was time to chill at the after-party on the final day, which was all about soothing, not-so-loud music and scrumptious food. The party was held at Kheer at Roseate House, Aerocity, and also had Rajnish Chopra, Executive Director, Dream Diamonds, proposing a vote of thanks.

  
  IT’s a WRAP: Tina Chatwal
 
 
  
  The models told us that in all the prep work, fittings, rehearsals, and walking for the shows, they got time to talk to each other only at the party. “There is so much going on in our minds that though we see each other everyday and are together all the time, we don't get a chance to talk to each other. It is only after the finale that we were able to catch up with each other said model  . Another model, Vanshika Saxena added, "Last three days were really hectic, but it was a great experience and a lot of fun. I think it was one fantastic show."

The model attended Meera and Muzaffar Ali’s show and was cheering throughout for her friends who were walking the ramp. "I have been away for some time now – was just taking a break. But after watching the show today, I feel I should be back on the ramp soon," said Tina.
