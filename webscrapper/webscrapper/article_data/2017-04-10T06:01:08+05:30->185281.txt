GHAZIABAD: The residents of highrise apartments in Ghaziabad have made a fresh appeal to the state government to form guidelines and norms for installation, operation and maintenance of lifts. 

 On Sunday, the residents sent a letter to chief minister   demanding formulation of a   in the state in the light of numerous accidents taking place in NCR continuously.
 
 A copy of the letter has also been sent to Sahibabad MLA Sunil Sharma. 
 
 On Saturday, a delegation of residents also met Sharma and apprised him about the issue.
 
 A PIL was filed in Allahabad high court in May 2015 by a Ghaziabad-based social activist, Alok Kumar, demanding formulation of a Lift Act in UP on the lines of those formulated in states like Delhi, Haryana and Maharashtra.
 
 “However, the erstwhile Samajwadi Party government did not respond to the court despite more than two orders for filing replies. We had also made repeated appeals to former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav to formulate a Lift Act to ensure safety and security of residents living in highrises in big cities. However, there was no response either from the state government or from Yadav. Lift accidents continued to occur in NCR with alarming regularity,” Kumar told TOI.
 
 “A renewed effort will be made to formulate a regulatory mechanism for installation, maintenance and licensing of lifts and escalators in the state,” said Sahibabad MLA Sunil Sharma.
