AHMEDABAD: A   came to light on Sunday morning when a 40-year-old man was accused of allegedly raping his two  . The   was lodged with the women’s cell of the city police by the maternal uncle of the two girls. 

  Police said they had detained the father — a resident of Vatva — for questioning. 
 
 “It was tough for us to ascertain the allegations made by the two girls, one aged 12 and the other about 14. We had to make the accused swear in the name of a religious book after which he confessed that he had indeed committed the shameful act,” a senior police official said.
 
 Assistant Commissioner of Police, women’s cell,  , said a man had come to the women’s police station with two minor girls. He alleged that the girls had been raped by their father. 
 
 “The man identified himself as the maternal uncle of the girls. He said the two girls were raped around September 2016 at their house,” Momaya said.
 
 The girls said that after their mother expired about 12 years back, their father did not remarry. “The girls used to stay with their father and grandmother. They said their father had taken them to another room and raped them,” a senior woman police official said. 
 
 Their grandmother also did not pay attention to their complaints. “The horrific incident came to light only when the two girls told their maternal uncle about the misdeed of their father,” said a senior official of the women’s police. 
 
 Police said the accused works as a contractual laborer. “We have detained him for questioning. Another team is questioning the grandmother of the two girls who were allegedly raped,” a police official said.
 
 Neither girl has ever been to school. “They used to go to a nearby institution for religious learning. While the father is being interrogated, the girls have been sent for medical examination. We are awaiting the medical report which is expected by Monday afternoon,” a police official said.
