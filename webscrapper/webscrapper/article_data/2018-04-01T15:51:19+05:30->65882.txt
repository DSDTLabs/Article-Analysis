 Referring to his film 'I, Robot', in which he plays technophobic cop who investigates a crime that may have been committed by a robot, the 49-year-old actor joked that Sophia put him in the friends list because he shared a bad 'history' with Artificial Intelligence. 
 
  
  
 
 "I just met Sophia the Robot. She wasn't feelin' me... I guess based on my history with robots," Smith wrote on Instagram alongside a picture that shows him leaning in for a kiss with the robot. 
 
  
  
 The actor also shared a video of what appears to be an 'online date' with the robot, created by Hong Kong-based Hanson Robotics. 
 
 "Sophia can I be honest with you. I don't know whether it's the island air or the humidity but you just so easy to talk to, you've got a clear head, literally," Smith said in the clip. 
 
  But when he leaned for a kiss, Sophia said, "I think we can be friends. Let's hang out and get to know each other for a little while. You are on my friends list now." 
 
  On realising he overreached, Smith tried changing the subject by pointing out he saw a whale in the ocean. "Yeah read that wrong. Oh whale, I just saw a whale. Does your head fog up in this kind of weather?"
