Vadodara: Wild life activists along with a team from forest department rescued a six-foot long crocodile from a slum near Lalbaug on Saturday morning. 

 The activists had received a call late on Friday night about the presence of the crocodile near Ramnath slum located near Lalbaug bridge. 
 
 The locals had alerted the activists about the presence of the reptile that was lying in the open drain. 
 
 The slum area is located on the bank of Vishwamitri river. According to wild life activists, when they reached the spot, they noticed that the reptile was in a drainage line close to the Vishwamitri river. 
 
 “Its neck was covered by tyre tube and plastic wire waste. We immediately informed the forest department officials. It was after they reached the spot that the reptile was rescued from the drainage line,” said Dhanraj Chauhan who along with Devang Datar, Shodhan Gandhi and naturalist Bhautik Desai had rushed to the spot to rescue the reptile.
 
 Forest department sources suggest that that the reptile might have ventured out of Vishwamitri river in search of food and might have fallen in the open drain.
