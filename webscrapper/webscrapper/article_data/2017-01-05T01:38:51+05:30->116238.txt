MUMBAI: The state government has proposed charging an   of Rs 5,000 per sq metre for construction over and above the permissible   (FSI). This has been proposed in case of   of old and dilapidated buildings in the suburbs. The amount is to be used for developing offsite infrastructure and is to be paid during the construction period. It can be enhanced every three years.

 For a long time there has been a demand for extending the scheme for redevelopment applicable in the island city to the suburbs. The government on Tuesday issued a draft notification inviting objections and suggestions to its proposal for redevelopment such buildings in the suburbs with a 50% incentive FSI.
 
 Ajit Khatri, former president,  ,  , said the draft does not clarify the permissible FSI in such redevelopment projects. “The 50% incentives is less than what is offered for slum rehabilitation projects which is 75%. Also the government already charges a huge amount in various cess and premiums. There is no need to add one more cess,” he said. Khatri said the notification speaks of transit accommodation but does not clarify who will bear the cost of creating the transit accommodation.
 
 There are around 10,000 old and dilapidated buildings in the suburbs. Consent of 70% tenants is required for a redevelopment proposal to be approved. The construction work has to begin within a year of the demolition of the existing building and completed within five years, states the draft notification.
