HYDERABAD: In an attempt to streamline procedures for treatment of brain tumours and back aches, and set up common guidelines, a team of 260 neurosurgeons from India and   gathered in the city on Saturday for a two-day non-surgical meeting organised by the Brain & Spine Society (BASS).

 
 “While some doctors favour medication, others suggest micro-surgery for back ache. With each doctor suggesting a different treatment option, the more the number of opinions, the more the time, and the more confused and indecisive the patient becomes,” said Dr Manas Panigrahi, senior consultant neurosurgeon, KIMS Hospitals.
 
 The cost of treatment in case of each option is different. Ultimately the patient tends to lose faith in the medical system.
 
 Experts zeroed in on medication as the best treatment option for back ache.   is required if the patient has complications, or numbness or weakness of any other part of the body, as it suggests compression of the nerve. In the case of brain tumours, treatment, either surgery or radiation without surgery, should be decided upon by observations through repeat MRI scans.
 
 “While some doctors offer radiation as a treatment when the patient is reluctant to go for surgery, radiation should be used only if the patient is too old or not fit for undergoing a surgery (has hypertension, blood pressure or cardiac issues), or if the tumour is in a site that can be very complicated to operate,” added Dr Panigrahi.
 
 Treatment of brain aneurysms, use of brain retractors and proximal control, and Arteriovenous Malformation, a blood vessel anomaly, were discussed by the team from Japan who treated a high incidence of neurological cases. Experts spoke on reconstruction of skull base and potts spine management. Guidelines agreed upon at the conference will be circulated by BASS and other associations for neurosurgeons to follow.
