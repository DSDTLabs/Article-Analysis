LUCKNOW: Leader of opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary said on Tuesday that the   government was deceiving the people of the state in the name of schemes. Speaking against the motion of thanks on Governor’s address in Vidhan Sabha, Chaudhary said that the government had named the loan redemption scheme as ‘Kisan Rinn Mochan Yojana’.

 “Mochan is very similar to the word ‘mocha’ used in Bhojpuri dialect for thugs,” said Chaudhary while adding that though Rs 36,000 crore had been earmarked for farm loan waiver, Rs 15,000 crore was still left.
 
 He also lashed out at the government for poor law and order in the state and said that FIRs are not being lodged at police stations. “If complainants insist on lodging FIRs, then cops request them to tone down intensity of the crime,” said Chaudhary and cited some incidents.
 
 He also alleged corruption in wheat purchase centres and said that instead of farmers, middle-men have been benefited. He even suggested that the CM should go for inspection without his saffron robes like kings used to do to check ground reality.
 
 Targeting the government over police encounters, Chaudhary said that most encounters are fake and managed as the police that used to run away whenever criminals open fire cannot risk themselves in real encounters during Yogi government and has in fact been still running away.
 
 Chaudhary said that those criminals who were active about two decades ago and had even left crime completely were picked up and killed in fake encounters.
 
 He said that a state cabinet minister also claimed that fake encounters have taken place and even demanded a CBI probe. If the minister is not speaking truth, then how is he continuing in Yogi cabinet, he asked. Chaudhary was referring to the statement of BJP’s alliance partner   chief and cabinet minister   who has been unhappy with BJP and government on some issue.
