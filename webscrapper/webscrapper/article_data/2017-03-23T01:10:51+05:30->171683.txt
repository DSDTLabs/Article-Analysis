NEW DELHI:   has written to the state election commission, accusing some of its officials of having pandered to the “diktats” of another political party. The move comes in the wake of the SEC order, asking for removal of all references to “aam aadmi’ from government installations and billboards as this is against the model code of conduct. 

 In the letter written by the party’s Delhi convener Dilip Pandey, AAP has said that the SEC order was issued on the basis of a letter written by   MLA Vijender Gupta without giving any hearing to either the state government or AAP.
 
 “The aam aadmi mohalla clinic concept has brought about a revolution in the field of healthcare and the model is being appreciated the world over. It is quite natural that anti-people forces like BJP are upset and are leaving no stone unturned to derail the programme. 
 
 But what shocks us the most is the fact that a constitutional body like the Election Commission is acting as subordinate to its political masters and is taking orders from them...,” the letter said. 
 
 AAP has alleged that “in a haste to please a political party, the commission did not even care to follow the due procedure and issue notices to the state government and AAP and allow them a hearing”.
 
 Pandey wondered whether similar action will be taken against names of schemes, which carry the words “bhartiya” and “janata” or “Indian” and “national” because they could refer to Bharatiya Janta Party or Indian National Congress.
