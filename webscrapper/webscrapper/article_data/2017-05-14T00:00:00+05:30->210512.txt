Actress   shares her secrets.

 
  An extension of my personality and mood.
 
 
 Loyal. 
 
 
  An introverted extrovert! I’m shy, but when you get to know the real me, you’ll know I am a clown. 
 
 
  Easy, classic and comfortable. 
 
 
 Clothes that fit me perfectly, especially jeans. 
 
 
  A crisp white shirt, a well-fitted black dress, a summery maxi dress, a nice leather jacket, and a cool pair of sunglasses. 
 
 
 My phone, lip balm and wallet. 
 
 
 My nani’s Cartier bracelet. 
 
 
  
 
 
  A jumpsuit. 
 
 
 High-waisted palazzo pants with a cute top. 
 
 
 Boyfriend jeans, shoes and a tank top. 
 
 
 : A maxi dress with pretty earrings – something delicate. 
 
 
 No strategy at all; depends on my mood! I can’t shop continuously, I need to take food and coffee breaks, in between. 
 
 
  Be comfortable in your skin and you’ll be happy. 
 
 
  Matching crop top and skirts – let’s get over with it.
 
 
  A pair of white sneakers and a pair of classic heels that go with almost everything.
