TRICHY: It has now become mandatory for faculty members in   to get its prior permission to attend  , conferences and training programmes. The rule is applicable for sending applications for any awards, fellowship or other posts. 

 Sources in the university say that many faculty members were found to have been misusing the liberty they enjoyed so far and keeping away from their respective departments. The university has decided not to entertain requests from them for no objection certificate or duty leave (OD) to attend seminars, workshop and training programme. 
 
 A circular dated March 5 from the office of the registrar quoted the vice-chancellor as saying that all such applications should only be routed through the university. Anyone found violating the rules and being absent would be treated as on leave on loss of pay and the participation in the event rejected and not entered in the service register. The principal of constituent colleges and head of the departments have been asked to relieve members on leave or duty leave only if prior permission was obtained from the office of the vice-chancellor.
 
 It is pointed out that while teaching is the primary function of colleges, research is the priority of university teachers. “There was no restriction on university teachers from remaining away from the university for seminars and conferences. But it has now been imposed after the university found that the liberty was being misused by faculty members,” said sources in the university. 
 
 On the other hand, such an announcement might also discourage faculty members from attending conferences and seminars in future. This would adversely affect the performance of the university during   assessment, said a faculty member. “There should not have been any restrictions in sending out research papers for presentations,” said another faculty member.
