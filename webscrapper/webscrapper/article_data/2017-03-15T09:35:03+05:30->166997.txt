GUWAHATI: Three persons were killed and one injured in a   when the vehicle they were travelling in rammed into a bus at   in Kamrup district, 55 km from here, early on Tuesday morning. 

 A bloodied rhino horn was found inside the vehicle, leading police to suspect the victims were poachers.
 
 The deceased were identified as Jacob Tluanga, Lamminlal and  , all residents of Manipur's Churachandpur.
 
 Besides the horn, police found four packets of what looked like brown sugar, a country-made rifle butt and mobile phones in the vehicle. "The horn looked like it had been recently chopped off. It weighed around 300 grams and could have belonged to a calf," police sources said.
 
 "It looks like they were taking the horn to Manipur or Nagaland. From there, it could have been smuggled to Myanmar," sources claimed.
 
 Forest minister   ordered her department to find out if any recent incident of poaching had been reported in the state. She said, "The vehicle was coming from the Tezpur side. Since the rhino horn was covered in blood, authorities of both Orang and Kaziranga national parks have been alerted."
 
 A forest official said, "During a recent crackdown against poaching, we found the call records of a poacher that showed he was in touch with smugglers from Manipur. The deceased might be connected to the same racket as well. An investigation is on."
 
 The official cautioned against treating the rhino horn as having been freshly chopped off an animal as the blood on it might have belonged to the deceased.
 
 The lone survivor, yet to be identified, was shifted to a city hospital where he is said to be critical.
