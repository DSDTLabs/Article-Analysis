NEW DELHI: The reiteration of Uttarakhand high court chief  's candidature for the   has been further delayed as the five-judge collegium, headed by CJI Dipak Misra, could not reach a consensus on other names to be recommended for appointment as judges of the apex court. 

 "Today (May 16), in the meeting of the collegium, a unanimous view was expressed that there should be further deliberation and broad-based consideration of the names of the chief justices as well as judges of the high courts which are at present not represented in the SC. In view of the above, the meeting stands deferred to be held at the earliest," said the resolution passed by CJI Misra and Justices J  , Ranjan Gogoi, Madan B Lokur and Kurian Joseph.
 
 The lack of a decision means that Justice Joseph will need to wait a while longer before his name is sent to the government for reconsideration. The government had argued that he is 42nd in the seniority of high court judges and there were 11 chief justices of different high courts senior to him. Besides suggesting that his elevation would be at the expense of other judges, the Centre also said there is need to ensure better representation of high courts which do not have judges in the SC.
 
 The government had split the recommendation of the collegium, agreeing to the elevation of senior advocate   to the SC but holding back assent to Justice Joseph.
 
 At the May 11 meeting of the collegium, it was unanimously decided to reiterate the proposal to elevate Justice K M Joseph. 
 
 Though the decision to reiterate the name was taken, it wasn't sent to the government as most members felt it would be incongruous to send a single name when there were seven Supreme Court vacancies.
 
 With the SC going for a summer break from May 18 till July 3 and Justice Chelameswar retiring on June 22, there is some uncertainty about when the collegium will meet again.
