THANE: The   (TMC) here organised a two-day disaster management   to handle situations before help arrives.

 The intentoon of the drive arranged along with an NGO on Tuesday was aimed at faster rescue and control at disaster spots. Women residing in hillocks and slums, which are mostly inaccessible or difficult to reach in case of calamities, were invited for the sesson.
 
 Few areas in the city have narrow lanes and during disaster, the rescue teams and the fire brigade vehicles face immense mobility issues. During such eventualities, if simple and primary disaster management methods are deployed, it can go a long way in saving loss of life and property. The workshop trained women on how to deal with floods, landslide, fire, gas leak or short circuits.
 
 Over 100 women participated in the workshop and the team plans to conduct similar workshops in other areas also.
 
 "Women mostly don't know the helpline number and often end up calling their family members - thereby losing crucial response time. We gave them lessons in disaster management as they are mostly at home during the day and could be the first to attend to any disaster locally," said  , regional disaster management officer of TMC.
