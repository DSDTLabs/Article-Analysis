 The students of classes VII and VIII were invited to meet Kejriwal after one of them wrote to him seeking an appointment. Asked about policy and governance issues ailing Delhi as it is land-locked as compared to Mumbai that has a coastline, Kejriwal said that there was no competition between the two cities. “Both cities have their own advantages and disadvantages,” he added.
 
 Kejriwal, however, conceded that since Delhi is not a full-fledged state, there are problems that are tough to overcome. 
 
 Most students were concerned about the pollution levels in the city and asked what was being done to tackle the menace. “Pollution is a very complex problem, but this government doesn’t lack political will. We introduced measures like odd-even scheme, which was difficult to implement yet we did it,” the CM said.
 
 Many students were also keen to know the difference between being an IRS officer and a CM and whether he lost out on family time. “When you become the CM, the whole family helps out so there is no question of compromise. Everyone chips in with their responsibilities,” Kejriwal said.
 
 He added that being a bureaucrat gives one certain responsibilities and powers, but as a politician there is more power and discretion to do things.
