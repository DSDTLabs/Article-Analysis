MUMBAI:   on Wednesday introduced a   in  , for women to communicate with the train crew in an emergency. Installed in a rake to coincide with International Women’s Day, it is adjacent to the windows and above the last seats.

 WR chief public relations officer Ravindar Bhakar said it was introduced as a pilot project. Two-way communication can be established between a commuter and the guard in an emergency at the press of a button. 
 
 He said, “The guard will receive the audible sound and visual indication on the cab control panel and assistance can be provided at the next station. This will hugely benefit women in case of security or medical issues. The system will be provided in another rake very soon.”
 
 The decision was taken after incidents of molestation in running trains in broad daylight. The system is similar to the ones in the Metro. The air-conditioned local, which is expected to run on Central Railway, also has this system.
 
 TOI had first reported about this technology to be introduced by WR in June 2016. WR also plans the system in another rake. The cost of installation in both rakes is estimated to be Rs 25 lakh.
 
 CR general manager D K Sharma said they plan to have the system for their suburban system too. CR had experimented with an emergency alarm system, in which at the press of a button, the guard and motorman are alerted about a “threat’ in the compartment. It was abandoned as some women were pressing the button without reason. This affected punctuality as the train crew had to attend to the coach only to find that somebody had played a prank.
