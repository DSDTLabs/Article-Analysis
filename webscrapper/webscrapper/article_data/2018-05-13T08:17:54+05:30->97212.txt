ALLAHABAD: The concept of 'green marriage' is fast turning into a fad as a groom and members of his ' baraat' (wedding procession) pedalled all the way to the wedding venue in Mumbai, the capital of  , on Friday. 

 The groom Ritesh Agrahari and ' baratis' pedalled all the way from Nalasopara to the wedding venue, a guest house in Bhayandar. 
 
 Environmental activist Ajay Krantikari, who launched a campaign of 'green marriages' in Pratapgarh, UP, to check unnecessary expenses and create awareness about environment conservation through his organisation Paryavaran Sena, said that the marriage of a Paryavaran Sena volunteer Ravi Agrahari's sister was solemnized at Bhayandar, Mumbai, where the groom and wedding procession pedalled to the wedding venue.
 
 Ravi, brother of the bride Puja, told TOI, "Taking ahead our campaign, on our request, the groom Ritesh covered around one-and-half kilometer from Nalasopara to Bhayandar on a bicycle along with baratis." 
 
 Wedding guests welcomed the initiative as it was the first time when a wedding procession used a bicycle to go to the venue. Even bystanders were seen clicking photographs and shooting videos of the unique 'baraat'.
 
 The family of bride hails from Mandhata block in Pratapgarh district and had settled in Mumbai. Both families said they took the decision to check unnecessary expenses and to create awareness about environment conservation. 
 
 Till now, as many as four green marriages were arranged by Ajay Krantikari including three in Pratapgarh. The first green marriage was held at Ibrahimpur when groom Javendra pedalled to bride Chanda's home in Pratapgarh district.
