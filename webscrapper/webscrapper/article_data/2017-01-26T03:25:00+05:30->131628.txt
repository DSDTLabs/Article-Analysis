Yavatmal: A week after the death of a patient in a family planning operation at a camp in village Belora of Pusad tehsil, no action has been taken against the doctor by the government or the police.

 Sharada Kale died, while Aruna Chavan and Vandana Deokate are still struggling for their lives at GMC after Dr Swapnil Satpute cut their intestines instead of the Fallopian tubes. The doctor is still at large. Three others admitted to hospital were discharged on Tuesday.
 
 District health officer Dr KZ Rathod said he has received the preliminary inquiry report, which presents a prima facie case of doctor’s negligence. “We will send the report to the health secretary at Mantralaya and wait for his order before we take action against the doctor,” Dr Rathod.
 
 When asked about the possibility of filing an FIR, Dr Rathod said the post mortem report is yet to be received. He said cops can file an FIR against the doctor after getting the report. He could not say when the report will come in.
 
 The brother of deceased Sharada has lodged a complaint at Khandala police station against the doctor.
