JAIPUR: A special   (NIA) court in Jaipur is scheduled to announce its verdict in 2007   on Wednesday.

 The investigation into the blast which claimed three lives witnessed several twists and turns as the cops first suspected the blast to be a handiwork of banned terror outfit HuJi (Harkat-ul-Jihad) until the forensic evidence and sustained interrogation fetched men-in-khaki startling facts into the blast.
 
 Soon after a powerful timed-bomb rocked the compound of   Dargah on the evening of October 11, 2007, the sleuths of state police began rounding up scores of suspects, sent team across the nation and even sought help from other state police. It was only after several failed attempts that cops realised their investigation is heading nowhere. 
 
 The security establishment of was caught off guarded when they found the involvement of a Hindu right-wing organisation called Abhinav Bharat. 
 
 The investigation was transferred to ATS ( ) in November 2007, but the first accused Devender Gupta, Lokesh and Chander Mohan were arrested as late as in April 2010.
 
 Later, in first week of December of 2010, the chief judicial magistrate court permitted the National Investigation Agency to interrogate accused and later NIA filed the bulky charge-sheets in this matter which for the first time brought the focus on the nefarious scheme of right wing terror groups who wanted to fan communal passion in the wake of their actions.
 
 During preliminary investigation, the local police, special police team,   and later NIA investigated the Ajmer dargah blast. Later, the trial was transferred to Jaipur designated court for fast track trial.
