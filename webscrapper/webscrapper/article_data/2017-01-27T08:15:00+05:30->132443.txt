Noida: The construction of an underpass at the   crossroads, one of the busiest crossings in Noida, is running about 10 months behind schedule. It was scheduled to be completed by December 2016, but work on the facility had been stalled as utility services needed to be relocated from the area. Work has now resumed on the underpass and it is expected to be completed by October 2017, officials said.

 According to Noida Authority officials, the construction of underpass located at the crossing of sectors 25A, 24, 33A and 22 on Master Plan-II road began in July 2015. This crossing, popularly known as the NTPC crossroads, is used by thousands of   daily. To come at a cost of Rs 52 crore, the facility will be about 730 metres long and have six lanes. 
 
 According to officials, work on the underpass has been at a standstill for nearly a year. “Utility lines including several water, sewer and electricity lines were coming in the way of the facility and they needed to be shifted,” said S C Mishra, Noida’s project engineer in charge of the project. “We have been trying our best to expedite the construction but somehow the project faced a delay in the initiation of tenders and in clearing of estimates. We have now restarted the construction on the underpass this month,” he said.
 
 “Currently, the facility is about 58% complete,” Mishra said, adding that the new deadline was Ocotber this year.
