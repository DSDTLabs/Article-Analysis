Actor   is all set to make his presence felt on the big screen. After being featured in big-ticket TV shows like ' ', ' ' and ' ', he has been roped in to play the central character in the film 'Pankh'. The story is based on the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao campaign, a brainchild of the   government, which aims to fight prejudices prevalent against the girl child. Says a source associated with the project, "The woman-centric film revolves around four siblings --- three sisters and one brother --- and how the son of the family enjoys all the freedom. However, a dramatic turn of events brings about a positive change in the brother's outlook, who then decides to help his sisters fight for their rights."

 Aayush says, "I am giving my best to this project and I hope I am able to justify the opportunity given to me. The film is on real issues; there are so many women in this country who regularly face differential treatment and sexist attitude." When asked about his expectations from the film, he added, "After being accepted on TV, I hope to get a similar response with films, too."
 
 The movie will be shot in Mumbai, Haryana and Shimla.
