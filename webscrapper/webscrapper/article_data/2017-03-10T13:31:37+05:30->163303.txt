KOLKATA: Six sergeants on motorbikes ferried students stuck in   at Park Circus till   on   on Thursday to ensure they could take the examination on time. 

 The sudden showers in the morning, coupled with minor disruptions in the suburban rail network, a major traffic blockade at   by SFI for over two-and-a-half hours and at least five rallies across central Kolkata led to huge traffic snarls across the city on Thursday. When the officers realized that the kids couldnâ€™t make it to their school in time for the examination, scheduled to begin at 10am, they whisked the children through alleys and bylanes, bypassing the snarls, to drop them at the school gate.
 
 Police said the worst affected areas included Esplanade, Maa flyover, RR Avenue and Behala-Mominpur stretches. Such was the delay that motorists like   and   took to Facebook, posting on the Kolkata traffic police page how the city was suffering due to the snarls. 
 
 Cops said with arterial roads getting clogged due to the blockade, both incoming and outgoing traffic from south to central Kolkata was seve-rely affected.
