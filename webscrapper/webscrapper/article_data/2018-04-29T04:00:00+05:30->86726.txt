Rajkot: A 30-year-old Dalit was stabbed to death in Thana Pipadi village of Vanthali taluka in Junagadh district on Friday night. 

 Police said Sanjay Makwana, a resident of Nagadia village of Vanthali taluka, was stabbed to death by four assailants identified as Rama Dalit, Gafoor Dalit, Munna Dalit and Manoj Dalit, all residents of Thana Pipadi village. 
 
 “The murder was the result of an old dispute between the victim’s family and the families of the accused over a love affair,” Vanthali police station sub-inspector B H Jadeja said. 
 
 “The murder occurred when Sanjay had gone to Thana Pipadi village from Nagadia village for some domestic work when he met the accused and had an altercation with them, following which the accused attacked him with knives, killing him on the spot,” Jadeja added.
 
 In the attack, one of the assailants Soma Dalit (60), who is the father of all the four accused, was injured when Sanjay retaliated with an axe. He has been admitted to Junagadh Civil Hospital.
