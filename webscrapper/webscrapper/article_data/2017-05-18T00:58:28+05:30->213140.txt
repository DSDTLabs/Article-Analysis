Gurgaon:   ( ) is all set to auction 58 commercial sites on June 5 and 6, to raise around Rs 150 crore, in the wake of the good response it received over its e-auction of properties.

 The commercial properties in sectors 5, 9A, 10, Old Judicial Complex and Jail Land will be up for grabs during the e-auction. 
 
 Huda has fixed the reserve price of these properties in the range of Rs 55 lakh to Rs 2.6 crore. 
 
 The high price of properties has raised doubt over the success of the auction, but Huda is confident of finding buyers. 
 
 “Our properties are located at prime locations, and we have been managing to get buyers so far, so we are hopeful that we’ll sell out most of the properties through the auction,” said a senior Huda official. 
 
 Reeling under financial stress, Huda is banking on selling its properties to meet its daily expenses. For this, Huda has been carrying out auction of property at regular intervals over the past one year. 
 
 “We are hoping to collect Rs 100 crore in a month through auction of properties,” said the official, adding that till now, they have been putting 30 properties for auction at a time. 
 
 So far, the urban development authority has been successful in selling properties through online auction, even at a time when the market is going through bad phase. 
 
 Between May 2016 (when e-auction started) and February 2017, Huda has successfully raised Rs 611 crore through e-auction. 
 
 In the last 10 months, Huda listed 936 properties for auction, of which it sold 216 and collected Rs 611.29 crore, much more than the total reserve price of the properties, which was Rs 505.27 crore.
 
 “We’ve been receiving very good response through e-auction of properties. Most are being sold above the reserve price,” said Huda administrator Yashpal Yadav.
 
 Even demonetisation failed to affect the e-auction of Huda's properties. According to documents available with TOI, the agency managed to collect around Rs 240 crore through auctions in December, January and February, when the cash crunch due to demonetisation was at its peak
 
 Highlighting a big-ticket auction, a Huda official said, “In November 2016,   purchased a 7,820.80 sqm plot in Sector 29 for Rs 205.88 crore, to build its new office.”
 
 In September, Huda collected Rs 135 crore from auction of three plots for schools. Five acres of land reserved for senior secondary schools in sectors 47 and 56 were sold for Rs 60 crore each. 
 
 The reserve price for each was Rs 34 crore, but they were auctioned for much higher. 
 
 Another 1.25 acre plot in Sector 52, reserved for a primary school, was sold for Rs 15.5 crore.
