AHMEDABAD: According to a new state government directive as part of Gunotsav,   which got poor ratings, i.e.   for two consecutive reviews would be penalized. This means that if students don’t perform well in these schools, strict action will be initiated against these teachers. Sources said that a note of the poor performance would be made in the annual confidential report of the school, and the same will also be recorded in the service book. Earlier, this was implemented in secondary schools, which had less than 30% results for two consecutive years.

 CM  , on Monday, inaugurated the statewide Gunotsav programme from a primary school at Kalasar village in   in Surendranagar district. The two-day campaign is held for improvement of education standards and quality across 34,000 primary schools and all round evaluation of teachers and 54 lakh students in these schools. 
 
 Interestingly, the government has dropped the ‘A to Z Gunotsav Survey’ that was conducted till last year on the sidelines of Gunotsav. The survey was conducted to assess rural development in Gujarat, which not only gave an idea about the quality of education in government-run schools, but also several civic issues faced by respective villages.
 
 “The government is concerned about poor students and those studying in village schools, and want to ensure they get free education in higher studies and hostel facilities,” said Rupani while addressing the school management committee. There is a plan to make a digitally smart system to reach out to students in remote areas, he said. The CM asked retired teachers and educated villagers to take part-time classes, four hours a week.
 
 The evaluation of teachers and students would continue for another two days. On Thursday, schools are supposed to self-evaluate themselves. The review of teachers’ performance will depend on the grading of their schools.
