AMRITSAR: Confusion over the return of the remains of those killed by IS terrorists in   have left the kin of the deceased angry and hurt. Relatives of Parvinder Kumar and Jasvir Singh from   and Mahindpur villages in Nawanshahr had arrived at Amritsar airport on Wednesday morning along with two ambulances and government officials to take the remains back to their native villages. 

 
 However, neither the Amritsar administration nor the officials accompanying the families had any details, and after waiting for about three hours, the grieving kin had to return home empty-handed. Jasvir Singh’s brother Bhupinder said an officer of the rank of deputy superintendent of police had arrived at their home on Tuesday night and asked them to reach Amritsar airport by 10 am on Wednesday. 
 
 “Apparently there was communication gap,” said Nawanshahr DC Amit Kumar. Bhupinder said they have now been informed that it could take a week or two for the arrival of the remains. The grieving families from villages in Majitha had gathered at the house of Gurpinder Kaur, sister of the slain Manjinder Singh, to console each other. 
 
 They also talked about mounting pressure on the government for compensation. The families of the four Punjab youths killed along with 35 other Indians in   have demanded credible evidence, including reports of the DNA tests based on which the government declared their kin dead, as well as compensation for their deaths. 
 
 This came even as Himachal Pradesh chief minister   announced that the families of four residents from the state who were killed in Mosul would get Rs 4 lakh each. Thakur personally spoke to the family members of the victims and expressed his condolences.
