AHMEDABAD: The number of girls dropping out of school in rural Gujarat presents an alarming picture amid the government’s vaunted ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ campaign. The figures of the Union human resource development ministry suggest that girls’ dropout rate ranged between 11.69% and 12.75% from 2013-14 to 2015-16. Gujarat’s number was poorer than the national average — 7.11% in upper primary level, which comprises class VI to VIII. This means more girls are quitting school in the class VI to VII level. If the figure is compared with the boys’ dropout numbers, it appears that more girls had dropped out of school at all three levels: primary (class I to V), upper primary (class VI to VIII), and secondary (IX and X).

  
  According to the   (U-DISE) Report for 2015-16, Gujarat has performed well only on the count of girls’ dropout rate at the primary level, if that is compared with the national average of 5.02%. 
 
 At the secondary level, the situation has been constantly worsening for girls with 20.40% dropping out in 2013-14 and 31.33% dropping out in 2015-16. The national average of girls’ dropout rate is 22.10% according to the U-DISE report tabled in the   recently.
 
 Interpreting the trend, Professor Gaurang Jani, a sociologist in Ahmedabad, said: “If the girl is not in school it means that she is toiling in a farm or on the field. 
 
 The girls are often given various household responsibilities such helping mothers and looking after younger siblings.” He said that many girls avoid attending schools during the menstruation period which ultimately results in dropping out. “Moreover, many villages do not have upper primary schools, and parents hesitate to send their girls to other villages to attend school,” he said.
