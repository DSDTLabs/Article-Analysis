MELBOURNE:   revelled in the joy of being back, following her 80-minutte 6-1, 7-6 (7-4) second-round win over  .

 "I was watching the   with a box of Kleenex next to me," the Russian said of her situation last year during the opening Grand Slam of the year, when she was serving a doping ban. "I feel like I transported myself into the TV this year and I'm finding myself on   Arena competing."
 
 "I wanted to be here. I got myself here. It's great to be back," the 30-year-old, who'll take on former No. 1   in the third round on Saturday, said.
 
 Sharapova, who split meetings with the sticky, tricky Sevastova last year, their previous encounter going over three hours, appeared to be running away with it this time, closing out the first set in 23 minutes. She stumbled, however, when serving for match in the tenth game, before pulling off a near flawless tie-breaker.
 
 "I was really happy with how aggressive I was. I played well at the net, finished the balls off with a swing volley or good volley," Sharapova, whose smile matched the brightness of the Melbourne afternoon sun, said. "It's a warm day. I did my job in two sets against someone that's been troubling me in the past. I think I deserved to smile out there after that victory."
 
 The Russian leads the head-to-head against the left-handed Kerber 4-3, the German, who turned 30 on Thursday, won their last two encounters, both of which were played in 2015.
 
 The pair met for the first time in the third round of the Australian Open in 2012 with Sharapova coming through in straight sets.
