HYDERABAD: Giving up his comfortable job in a reputed e-commerce firm, Sunil Kumar, a city-based chartered accountant, is all set to travel to Antarctica's   in January 2018. Sunil is one among 10 members selected for an expedition from across the world by Robert Swan, the first person to have travelled both north and south pole.

 Sunil got to know about the expedition to Antarctica in 2011 during a 'Jagriti Yatra', a two week-long train journey across the length and breadth of the country. 
 
 The purpose of the expedition, Sunil explains, is to spread awareness among people about climate change and how survival is possible even at harshest place on the planet with the help of renewable energy. "We will be surviving solely on renewable energy. We will be walking 100 kilometers per day using wind energy. Apart from that, we will use solar energy to make our food and bio-fuels to contact with the outer world," said Sunil, who is firm to battle temperatures ranging from -40 degree to -50 degree Celsius. 
 
 All the energies are being provided by companies such as US space agency  , Siemens and  . The team will be carrying nearly 80 kgs on their back and battle wind speed of 200 miles/hour every day. 
 
 Interestingly, this is the first time that such an expedition is being undertaken wherein members will depend solely on renewable energy. 
 
 He has even started a crowd   campaign on his official website www.suniltosouthpole.com.
