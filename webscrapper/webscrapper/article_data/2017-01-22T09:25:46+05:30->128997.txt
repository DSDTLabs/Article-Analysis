KOLKATA: A day after the Indian and English cricket teams got stuck in traffic for over half an hour - which   calls a '10-minute delay' owing to a vehicle's breakdown - Lalbazar on Saturday tried to ascertain what actually led to the delay.

 It's being questioned why the convoy was allowed to be hounded by fans at important crossings, leading to a security scare. A section of cops has also pointed to the convoy's poor coordination with local traffic guards.
 
 Though Lalbazar refused to comment, a source said the convoy had been asked to take the Park Circus connector instead of Maa flyover to allow the President's cavalcade to pass through. As a result, the teams had to deal with the crowd around the   grounds. “The city witnessed a traffic chaos because there were too many VIP movements on Friday . We have not received anything in writing and this was only an aberration,“ said an officer.
 
 Sources maintained that there were no strict rules for escorting the team. “We do not halt traffic for their movement,“ clarified a source. “Perhaps, better coordination could have avoided the situation.“
 
 The police, though, took no chance on Saturday when the teams went for practice at the  . RAF personnel were posted and the traffic was asked to follow lane driving to make sure that no vehicle can come in the way of the convoy.
