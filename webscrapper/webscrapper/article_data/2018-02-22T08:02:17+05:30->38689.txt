CHANDIGARH: Former deputy speaker of Punjab assembly   Singh has moved Mohali district court challenging an application moved by two accused in the multi-crore   (AIT) land scam for transfer case trial to a senior judge.

 Taking up his application, Mohali sessions Judge Archana Puri on Wednesday put all parties in the case on notice for submission of their replies by February 26. Chief minister   is one of the accused in the case.
 
 On February 17, two of the accused   and   had moved an application for transfer of case to a senior judge. The former deputy speaker had earlier submitted before the court that huge amount of money had changed hands in lieu of granting exemption and releasing the 32.1 acres out of 188 acre scheme of the AIT to colonisers.
 
 The former deputy speaker submitted in his application that the case trial was pending for the last more than 10 years and the accused were evading the process of law on one pretext or the other. His application reads, “Prosecuting agency has connived with the accused/applicants”.
 
 He has further submitted that the accused had sought transfer of the case to another judge with an ulterior motive and had rather aimed at undermining the authority and judicious competence of a judicial officer.
