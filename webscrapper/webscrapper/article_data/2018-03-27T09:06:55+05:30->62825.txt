HYDERABAD: Taking a cue from   flicks, a motorist caught twice for  , asked two persons to impersonate him and his father to evade arrest. However, his marital status was recorded in the police database and this exposed his plan.
 
 Begumpet traffic police said Manohar Krishna, an employee at a mobile phone service company, was recently caught on   road no. 36 for riding under the influence of alcohol and was asked to attend the counselling at traffic training institute in Begumpet.
 
 
 On Monday, Manohar asked his friend,  , to impersonate him and one Shiva to impersonate his father and attend the counselling. Manohar also accompanied them claiming to be their friend.
 
 Traffic inspector C   said as Lazarus came to attend the session claiming to be Manohar, the cops checked previous records of Manohar and found that he was a repeat offender. “Last time, Manohar had attended the counselling with his wife. The cops enquired Lazarus about his wife, but he was unaware about Manohar’s marital status and said he was unmarried. When cops questioned the man impersonating as Manohar’s father about his daughter-in-law, he too goofed up,” Nagendra Rao said.
 
 Earlier, Manohar was caught for drunk driving at Krishna Nagar. Smelling something fishy, the traffic cops posed several questions to the trio. The cops then checked the identify proofs of all three, which revealed their real identity. The drama was planned by Manohar, who feared that he might be sent to jail for being caught for drunk driving for the second time.
 
 Traffic police lodged a complaint against the three in Begumpet police station, where a case of impersonation and cheating was registered.
