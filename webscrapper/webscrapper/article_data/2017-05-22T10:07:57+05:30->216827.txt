Popular for her role of '  Girls on Top'. TV actress   is back to breaking stereotypes yet again.
 
  Earlier this year, she shot for a bold photo series in which she talked about issues such as sexuality, rape, slut shaming etc. Now, she is back doing the same even more effectively.
  
  In her latest photo series, Saloni is seen wearing a shirt with no bra and talks about women empowerment, equality, rape and #freethenipple campaign.
  
  
 
  
  
  
  One of her picture captioned saying "'I find it interesting how society doesn't care when the media sexualizes women, when men sexualize women, when schools and the government sexualize women. But the second a woman is in control and sexualizes herself willingly it's wrong and disgusting.' #anonymousquote #traveldiaries #freethenipple #womenempowerment #beyou #thefutureisfemale #equality #educateindia #adelaide #australia #bethechange ðŸ“¸ @m3anker"
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  With most women coming out in the open and boldly talking about their choices and preferences, Saloni's photo series is praise-worthy. Her thoughts are neatly put out with precision.
