LONDON: In the quest for sustainable energy sources, scientists have developed “grassoline“ -a biofuel derived from   that may one day power aircraft.

 For the experi ment, researchers investigated methods to disintegrate and treat grass until it could be used as a fuel.“Until now, grass has mainly served as feed for animals. But apart from that, grass can also be used as biofuel. Due to its vast abundance, grass is the perfect source of energy ,“ said Way Cern Khor from  's   . To improve its biodegradability , the grass was pretreated at first. Then bacteria were added to convert sugars in the grass into lactic acid and its derivatives, researchers said.
 
 This lactic acid can serve as an intermediate chemical to produce other compounds such as biodegradable plastics (PLA) or fuels. The lactic acid was then converted into capro ic acid, which was further converted into decane. Decane could be used in aviation fuel, researchers said.
 
 “Right now the amount of biofuel that can be made from grass is still limited to a few drops. The current pro cess is very expensive, and engines should be adapted to this new kind of fuel,“ they said. “If we can keep wor king on optimising this process in cooperation with the business world, we can come down on the price. And maybe in a few years we can all fly on grass!“ Khor said.
 
 New fibre to help rockets stand extreme heat
 
 Scientists, including those of Indian origin, from   have developed “fuzzy fibres“ that act like velcro and could stand up to the heat and pressure of rocket engines. The fibres made of of silicon carbide strengthen composites used in advanced rocket engines that have to withstand temperatures up to 1,600 degrees celsius. Ceramic composites used in present rockets can crack or become brittle when exposed to oxygen.
