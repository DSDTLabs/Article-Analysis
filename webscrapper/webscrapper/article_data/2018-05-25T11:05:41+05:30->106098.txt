 Amitabh Bachchan said he will consider himself a failure if he is not able to preserve the writings of his late father and poet,  .

  "Poetry needs understanding the mind of the poet. Believing his nerve, his pulse, his every pore, his breath. It's not an easy task. At times an impossible task, for we shall never exactly know what gave them the reason to put to thought what they did even if they are your own blood," Amitabh wrote in his blog on Friday.
 
  
  
  "In the absence of my father, my responsibility rises even greater. Not just for its justice, but for its preservation for posterity and life. I shall fail as a son if I did not accomplish this, and I would never want to fail in his eyes. I shall never be able to fill his exalted mind, but even the minutest effort would give me the smallest of beliefs in his greatness and acclaim and his renown," he added.
 
  Big B has been reciting poems of the renowned poet on various public platforms for a long time. "I shall be forgotten in a year or two, but Dr. Harivansh Rai Bachchan shall be remembered and known for a 1000 and more till eternity," Amitabh said.
