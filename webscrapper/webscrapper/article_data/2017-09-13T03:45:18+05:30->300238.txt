KOLKATA: Amit   indicated on Tuesday that not all decisions taken by the   may have worked according to plan. He defended the government, however, by saying many of these decisions were historic. 

 Interestingly, while highlighting the achievements of the government in the last three years, Shah mentioned demonetisation but only as the first step, prompting many to wonder whether this was a decision that didn’t go according to plan. 
 
 The successes he highlighted included opening of Jan Dhan accounts and the direct transfer of benefits. “Nearly Rs 59,000 crore worth of fake benefits were stopped after this...The decision to build toilets for all families by 2022 will restore the self-esteem of girls. The surgical strike across the LoC was also a high point for India.... Most importantly, we succeeded in getting rid of dynastic politics,” Shah said.
