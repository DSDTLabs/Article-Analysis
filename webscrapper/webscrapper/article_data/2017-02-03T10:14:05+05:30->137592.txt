NAGPUR: A park displaying 38 stone sculptures made by national awardee artists was opened on the SCZCC premises in Civil Lines on Thursday. Commissioned by the Centre from 18 states for a workshop organized in the city from January 12 to 31, the 80-odd artists worked day and night to complete the sculptures which were put up all around the campus. Internationally acclaimed artist   curated the works.

 Huge stones in different colours and hues were brought from Rajasthan for this workshop. “We researched and found that maximum variety of stones are available in Udaipur, so we bought from there,” said project in-charge Gopal Baitawar. 
 
 Pink sandstone, yellow Jaisalmer, grey and white limestone, four colours in marble, pista, black and green granite were used by the artists who were given a free hand in selecting the subjects. “The artists first made a model and showed it to the curator who helped them in fine tuning it,” Baitawar said. 
 
 Some of the unique designs included the set of molars made by   from Varanasi, the imposing vertical art work by Harpal from Haryana, which denotes that an individual is hollow from within, and a column depicting balance of life by   from Udaipur.
 
 Most of the art works are of 10ft to 15ft in height and the tallest made by   from Lucknow is 19ft. The artists were permitted to have their own carvers who assisted in giving shape to the stone.
 
 This is an attempt to create a cultural tourist destination in the city, said SCZCC director Piush Kumar who is all set to relinquish charge on Friday. “More than aesthetics, the effort is to provide patronage to these artists as stone carving is a dying art,” Kumar said and added that the centre would charge a nominal fee of Rs20 for those who wished to view the art work. 
 
 “This initiative is also a part of our effort to put art at public places and we want government organizations like Metro Rail and civic authorities to use them strategically,” the director said.
