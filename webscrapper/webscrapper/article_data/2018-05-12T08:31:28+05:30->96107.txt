CHENNAI: The Madras   on Friday directed the Pondicherry University to register a   complaint for   against Usha Lachumanan College of  , Thirukkanur, which admitted and collected fees from students without possessing a valid recognition. 

 Justice S M Subramaniam passed the order on a plea by a group of students who were cheated by the institution.
 
 “The university registrar and controller of examinations are directed to lodge a police   against the college in respect of the cheating committed against the students as well as the society at large and set the law in motion. The competent authority, on receipt of such complaint, shall register the same and investigate the matter in a manner known to law and proceed with all further action,” Justice S M Subramanian said.
 
 Noting that writ petitioners or all other similarly placed students, who were admitted in the BEd degree course in the academic year 2017-2018 are entitled to claim exemplary compensation from the institute, the judge said, the quantum of compensation to be awarded to the students will be decided at the time of final hearing on June 11.
 
 However, the court refused to permit the students to appear for university examinations, noting that the court cannot allow an illegality to continue.
