Team  , which gave some catchy songs through the film Oppam, is back again through another   film, Villain. Just as in Oppam, this project too offers tracks that can go on to be chart busters and may be also live on, further.

 Veteran K J Yesudas’ timeless voice is what beckons you into the music of Villain, through the sweet melody Kandittum Kandittum. It has an intensely persistent sense of déjà vu throughout it, reminding listeners of many much-loved melodies we have had in the past. Often, you also feel that it’s vintage Yesudas all over again, singing to you through an eighties’ movie cassette. The song is very similar to Snehathumbi from the film December, which was yet again a modern version of the age-old album song Maavu Pootha Poovanangalil and regardless, it’s a pleasant listen. The song’s second version by Sithara Krishnakumar is also equally mellifluous.
 
 Pathiye Nee by Haritha Balakrishnan is another melody, starting in a low pitch and gradually picking up pace. A song about missing a loved one, it has an overall surreal feel to it and it glides smoothly in Haritha’s rendition. Though a lot of it is in low pitch, the song is a soulful listen and can make you hit repeat button.
 
 Yet another song that probably reminisces the dear and near far away, Angakale by Niranj Suresh and Shakthisree Gopalan has some rigorous beats and effervescent vocals. In the backdrop of some pulsating arrangements, the rock-flavoured song is given a heartfelt rendition by the singers and it’s scaled appropriately to suit the lyrics.
 
 Villain promo song follows, with the teaser dialogues of the film making an appearance in it on and off. Sung by Rashi Khanna and Niranj Suresh, it’s got what it takes to add value to sequences of a thriller. Nevertheless, it’s not much of a go-back-to song as a standalone composition.
