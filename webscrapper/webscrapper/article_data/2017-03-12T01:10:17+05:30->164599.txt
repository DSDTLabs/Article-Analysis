MUMBAI: Former chief minister   on Saturday said that Prime Minister   and BJP president Amit Shah’s meticulous planning and strategy led to BJP unprecedented victory in Uttar Pradesh.

 “SP-Congress lost owing to family feud within the Yadav family over the chief minister’s post. We were unable to halt division in the secular votes, as a result, minority voters, particularly Muslims and Dalits, distanced themselves from the   alliance,’’ he said.
 
 Secondly, Chavan said Congress failed to capitalised on the decision of Modi to ban currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000. “Modi succeeded in convincing the people that the decision was against rich people, to check influx of black money and halt financial assistance to terrorist. We failed to convince them that demonetisation was anti-poor and will have adverse impact on common people,” he added. 
 
 He said that a day after the demonetisation, Congress should have launched a nation-wide agitation to condemn the decision, but there was prolonged delay. “Modi kept changing goals after demonetisation, from note ban, he brought in the concept of cashless transaction, we were silent spectators to these anti-people decisions,” Chavan said.
 
 Even the statement that surgical strike had adverse impact on the UP electorate. “We should have taken on the Prime Minister, instead we indirectly criticised the armed forces, which was not liked in any quarter,” Chavan said.
 
 “In all the five statesno regional party was able to make an impact, only Congress and BJP are now left in the fray, it’s a welcome change,” said Chavan.
 
 NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said while there was no Modi wave, anti-incumbency played a key role. “In all the five states, ruling party was dislodged. In Uttar Pradesh, ruling SP lost to BJP, while in Punjab, Akali Dal lost to Congress. It clearly indicates that there was no Modi wave,” Malik said.
