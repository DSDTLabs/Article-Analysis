PANAJI: After calling a section of the domestic tourists visiting Goa the "scum of the earth" and claiming that "north Indians" wanted to "create a Haryana" in the coastal state, agriculture minister   on Monday said "there are also good people in Haryana". 

 Sardesai's remarks, seemingly aimed at playing down the controversy caused by his intemperate comments about domestic visitors, came a day after Haryana chief minister   called up his Goa counterpart,  , and expressed strong objection to the minister's utterances.
 
 "Haryana has also got good people and we are in touch with them," Sardesai said, while referring to his recent meeting with   of the   at Gurugram to understand the concept of cosmic farming.
 
 "These days, we have been hearing about Haryana. A few days ago, I had gone to Gurugram to meet Dr Avadhoot Shivanand, who is working on cosmic farming," he added, while addressing an event organised by the   (GSHCL) here. Shivanand had told him that "farming with celestial sounds" needed to be promoted, the minister said.
 
 "Shivanand is not talking about magic. He has a doctorate from the Barkley University. There is some basis for his claims on cosmic farming," he added.
 
 At the GSHCL event, some farmers were felicitated for their performance in maximising the crop yield.
 
 "We are willing to work with the Shiv Yog foundation. I had gone there with the director of agriculture. We need to encourage local germ-plasm and give a push to organic farming," the minister said.
 
 The minister had last week kicked up a storm when he described a section of domestic tourists visiting Goa as the "scum of the earth" and claimed that "north Indians" wanted to "create a Haryana in Goa".
