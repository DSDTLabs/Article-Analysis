KOLAGHAT: The body of a 25-year-old MTech aspirant, who went missing on Saturday evening, was recovered from the railway tracks near Mecheda station in East Midnapore in the wee hours on Sunday. The youth reportedly killed himself out of   as he could not crack several entrance exams to pursue his masters despite graduating from a private engineering college with decent marks in his BTech exams.

 A resident of Jhalda in Purulia, Subhojit Singh Deo, was upset about his academic career recently, said his family. 
 
 Deo had rented a flat near Kolaghat Engineering College after he secured his admission in the graduate programme. His mother then relocated from Purulia to stay with her son and his father would visit them on weekends.
 
 Apparently, Deo left home on Saturday evening. Initially his absence went unnoticed but when he did not return till late in the night, his parents raised an alarm and lodged a missing complaint. The police launched a search and around 1:30am, the GRP found a mutilated body on the tracks. Later, Deo’s parents identified the body as their son’s.
 
 East Midnapore superintendent of police, Alok Rajoria, said, though prima facie it appears to be a case of suicide due to depression, investigation will be done before a conclusion is drawn.
