 On Friday, JDA warned local residents and house owners to vacate the area voluntarily by September 16. A senior JDA official said the drive would be carried out in phases. The JDA has urgent requirement of nearly 15 bighas of land, which connects the area with Sikar Road. “The JDA has already deposited Rs 9 crore as compensation for this chunk of land in the court. The drive will be carried out to take possession of it. As not many permanent structures have been constructed on this land, it will be not be a major demolition drive,” said a senior JDA official.
 
 The JDA had planned to acquire 1,300 bighas to develop the housing scheme. Out of this, the civic body took possession of 110 bighas recently from the ‘mandir mafia’. Till date, the JDA has taken possession 600 bighas located in the scheme. It has also deposited Rs 60 crore in the court for the acquired land. “The government has allocated around 200 bighas for the scheme. Similarly, nearly 100 bighas of PWD land is in JDA’s possession. The farmers have surrendered 300 bighas. In the second phase, they will surrender 120 bighas. The allotment letter will be issued next week,” added the official
 
 Authorities had announced the scheme in January 2011. It is proposed that the project, located 20km away from Ajmeri Gate, will have 10,000 houses. After the failure of Privthiviraj Nagar housing scheme planned on 1,300 bighas, this is JDA’s second-largest housing scheme.
 
 Official sources said the JDA made a mistake by launching such a big housing project on private land when people were unwilling to give their expensive land for such a project.
