On the third day of his North Karnataka rally,   president   on Monday asked PM Modi to tell the nation how a firm owned by   national president   allegedly made a huge turnover in three months. 

 Through this, Rahul sought to turn the tables on Modi, who had called the Congress government in Karnataka a "10% commission sarkar". He told a rally: "When you come to Karnataka next time, look at your leaders and you will find   and four of his cabinet ministers who went to jail on corruption charges. If you look further, you will find 11 more ministers who resigned on corruption charges."
