AHMEDABAD: With parts of the state flooded and heavy rainfall, transport has come to a standstill, with movement of trucks greatly reduced. North  , Kutch and   regions are the worst affected with large numbers trucks ferrying goods stuck.

 “Highways in the affected areas of north Gujarat are flooded and many trucks ferrying goods are either stranded on highways or can’t leave the origin point. Waterlogging in Aslali has crippled movements out of Ahmedabad, as the locality is a major transport hub,” said Jitubhai Sanghvi, president,  . Sanghvi said trucks can enter Rajkot, albeit very slowly; but it is impossible to go beyond. Some warehouses are also affected, so loading and unloading are affected.
 
 “Some 5,000 to 7,000 trucks enter and leave Ahmedabad every day. All of them are stuck on account of the heavy rains on Thursday morning. Loading and unloading was also hit with many godowns being flooded. Dispatches and deliveries of raw materials have been hampered. This will increase the backlog in the weeks to come,” said Mukesh Dave, honorary secretary, Akhil Gujarat Truck Transport Association.
 
 Cloth, iron, ceramics, FMCG products and raw materials for the chemical industry are usually ferried by truck. The transport logjam has significantly impacted industry players, as they are short of raw materials.
