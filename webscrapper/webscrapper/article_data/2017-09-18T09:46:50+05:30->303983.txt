LUCKNOW: For the past eight years, this 49-year-old has been saluting the   and singing the national anthem without fail in front of the Vidhan Bhawan gate without paying any heed to the curious onlookers.

 Every day when the clock strikes 9.30am, Hiralal  , who works at a hotel in Hazratganj, starts singing ' ' wearing a fancy hat adorned by the national flag.
 
 Famous as 'Bengali Baba', Samanta has been doing this to inspire youth to be patriotic and to stand whenever the national anthem is played. “I love my country and want to teach others to love and respect the freedom that we got after a long struggle,“ he said. The idea to do this struck him while he was in a movie hall singing the national anthem.
 
 A native of a small village near  , Samanta came to Lucknow in 2010 for a job. Since then, it's routine for him to sing the national anthem before going for work. After saying `Vande Mataram' thrice, he soaks in the feeling of nationalism and starts singing the national anthem. “At first, some police officers got suspicious and asked me why I was doing this. But when they saw me doing it regularly, they appreciated my efforts and supported it by saying 'Bengali Dada accha kaam kar rahe ho' (you are doing a good job),“ Samanta said.
 
 A fan of OP Nayyar, Samanta wears a hat similar to the one worn by the music composer adorned with the national flag. “I have three hats with the national flag and I never put them on the ground as a mark of respect,“ he added.
