BALRAMPUR: Settled comfortably atop a commercial vehicle, this group of four hogs the limelight in the final stage of election campaigning at Balrampur assembly constituency. Out to canvass for a political candidate on Friday, Nankan, Rajesh, Azaad and Pappu are orchestra artistes hired at Rs 4,000 a day.

 While orchestra troupes have always been roped in by political  , there is something unique about Nankan, the lead singer. “I am known for mixing political messages seamlessly with   and aartis,” said Nankan who takes the lion’s share of the daily earnings. At present, they’ve been hired by BJP contestant Paltu Ram.
 
 On account of Mahashivratri, Nankan renders popular Shiv dhuns before the villagers in such a way that the BJP’s political agenda is pushed through popular bhajan tunes. For instance:
 
 “Om Namah Shivay, chalo BJP layein, beimani aur bhrashtachar se pradesh bachayen
 
 Badi der bhai, badi der bhai, ab toh jaago do BJP ka saath” 
 
 The party may be known for advocating the Hindutva agenda but the two Muslim artistes in the group have no qualms in joining the campaign. “We all are performers and part of the same group. The local candidate treats all for us the same way,” said Azad, who was on dholak.
 
 Pappu, another Muslim, is a backing vocalist who also plays the harmonium. Between singing Shiv bhajans, he points out, “Business interests are beyond politics. We will sing bhajans for Samajwadi Party or Bahujan Samaj Party as well if they pay us the same amount,” said Pappu. The four are from three different villages under Tulsipur assembly in Balrampur district and also aspire to make it to Bollywood some day.
 
 Suddenly, driver Gunjan Pandey made a sharp turn, cutting the conversation abruptly at Shuklaganj Gumdi village, across Gonda–Utraula state highway. The vehicle has entered Utraula assembly constituency, beyond the territory the four were asked to cover.
