SALEM: A day after Madras high court gave its nod for the mercy killing ( ) of Arulmigu Sugavaneswarar temple elephant Rajeswari, devotees and volunteers on Tuesday started flocking near  , where the elephant is held captive at the temple property.

 “I have been getting blessings from Rajeswari for nearly 20 years. It’s heart-breaking to see the elephant on deathbed,” said M Narayanasamy, who visited the elephant.
 
 Since Rajeswari was born with deformation in left forelimb, it had to stand on its right forelimb all these years. The elephant was not able to stand of late, as it developed lameness on forelimb six weeks ago.
 
 About 20 days ago, officials attached to Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious & Charitable Endowments Department (HR&CE) lifted the elephant without the consent from the animal husbandry and forest departments, using an earthmover. However, the animal fell down in the process and lost one of its tusks.
 
 Meanwhile, Chennai-based activist S Muralidharan moved the high court, seeking mercy killing of Rajesewari. The first bench of chief justice   and justice Abdul Quddhose said euthanasia can be allowed if veterinarians certify that the elephant cannot be cured. The court has given authorities 48 hours to complete the process.
