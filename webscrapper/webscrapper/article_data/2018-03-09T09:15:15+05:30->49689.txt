KOCHI: The high court has stayed further proceedings in two of the three cases filed against   M M Akbar, the managing director of  , alleging promotion of religious enmity by teaching communal content in schools.

 
 A stay was issued by the court after considering a petition filed by Akbar stating that three different cases have been filed by police for the same offence. The suo motu cases were registered at Kottiyam, Palarivattom, and   police stations.
 
 
 While issuing a stay on the proceedings on cases registered at Kattoor and Kottiyam stations, the court has asked the state government to respond to Akbar’s contentions.
 
 It is alleged by Akbar that there are 10 schools bearing the name ‘Peace Public School’ and that they are established and managed by separate independent trusts or managements. Peace Educational Foundation, of which Akbar is the managing director, is only coordinating these trusts. For optional religious instructions in these schools, moral textbooks published by renowned publishers are used, like various other schools in the country, the petition stated.
 
 The controversial textbook was published by Mumbaibased Burooj Publications and it is circulated all over India in around 400 schools. The petitioner or Peace Educational Foundation has no connection with Burooj Publications or the books published by them. The various Peace Public Schools work independently, Akbar has contended in the petition that seek to quash the FIRs.
 
 By registering multiple cases for the same offence, police are trying to arrest him in one case after the other so that his fundamental rights are violated, he said in the petition. “The entire allegations against the petitioner and the schools are false and ill-motivated. It is intended to close down these schools once and forever. The allegation against him does not constitute the offence alleged,” said the petition.
