NEW DELHI: Appointments of non-official directors of public sector enterprises have not violated selection guidelines such as relevant experience and selection of eminent individuals from areas like industry, business and agriculture, government sources said.

 The government feels there is no bar on selection of some individuals with political affiliations as long as they meet norms based on provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and care has been taken to ensure thorough screening. In the context of persons with BJP connections like Shazia Ilmi, Asifa Khan, Rajika Kacheria, Surama Padhy and Kiran Ghai Sinha being named non-official directors of boards, sources claimed such cases were limited as compared to UPA.
 
 Apart from making “fewer“ political choices, the government has adhered to criteria such as ex-government officials who held senior positions, academics,  ,  ,   and notables from the fields of industry, business, management and agriculture. The reports on non-official directors caught notice as it was felt that the BJP-led government had lapsed into its predecessor's habits, but sources said an effort had been made to expand selections beyond a Delhi-centric bias. This was kept in mind in Padma awards as well with the PMO represented by additional secretary P K Mishra in the selection process.
 
 Sources said some of the selections included individuals like former finance secretary Sumit Bose, IIM Ahmedabad's Dheeraj Sharma, former health secretary Sujatha Rao and academic Kiran Pandya “The government has been consistent in maintaining balance between domain expertise and age. Majority of appointments in the past three years have been under 55 years,“ said the source.
