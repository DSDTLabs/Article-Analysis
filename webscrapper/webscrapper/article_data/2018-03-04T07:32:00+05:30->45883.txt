AMRITSAR: A second-year MBA (marketing) student of   has been offered an annual pay package of Rs 54 lakh, the highest a student of the institute has been offered since it was started in 2015. 

 The amount is three times more than the previous highest package offered to a student of the business school. IIM-Amritsar placement cell chairperson Prof   said Singapore-headquartered Tolaram   had made the salary offer to Abdul Qadir, who hails from Ahmedabad in Gujarat. 
 
 Before this, ICICI Lombard, with an offer of Rs 18 lakh, held the distinction for making the highest salary offer. 
 
 However, as recuriments at IIM-Amritsar will go on for another three days, no final data on placements for this year are available with the institute.
 
 The IIM has been operating out of a temporary campus and without a permanent director. Sources at the institute said marketing, finance, pharmaceutical and petroleum companies, including Tolaram, HPCL and BPCL, had come to the business school for placement of fresh graduates this year.
 
 Tolaram Group has business interests in Africa, Asia, and Europe, in diversified fields, including energy and digital services. Abdul is likely to be posted at Nairobi.
 
 A resident of Ahmedabad, Abdul has completed his two-year post graduate diploma in business management (PGDM) with specialisation in marketing. Hesitant to talk and reveal more about his placement, he said he was thrilled with the offer. “It’s a great opportunity for me,” he said.
 
 He described his stay at IIM-Amritsar as “fantastic”. “The administration, faculty and fellow students have been very cooperative,” he said, adding that IIM-Amritsar had established itself well, not only in placements, but in academics too.
