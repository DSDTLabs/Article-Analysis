CHENNAI: A man entered a   and robbed the headmistress at her office in   near   on Monday evening. Sujatha, 44, was working at her desk when the man barged in and snatched her 10-sovereign gold chain, pulling her to the floor in the process. 

 On hearing Sujatha's cries, her office assistant and other employees of the school came rushing, but the robber escaped, pushing some of them away.
 
  Police said Sujatha was signing some files when the intruder struck. "She said she first thought the man was a parent who wanted to make some inquiry. When she asked him about his identity, he said he had come from the district education office, with some DVDs of short films for the students. Even as they were speaking, he snatched her gold chain and ran out. Hopping on to his bike that he had parked outside the gate, he rode away," said an officer. 
 
 
 
 
 The security guard was missing from the gate when the incident happened. Based on Sujatha’s complaint, the Mappedu police registered a case and are looking for CCTV camera footage from the vicinity. “We come across such incidents on streets, but someone striking in an office is a rarity,” the officer said.
