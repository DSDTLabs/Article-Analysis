PANAJI: Goa will approach their opening clash against Meghalaya with some trepidation as coach Mateus Costa admitted the pressure on his side to deliver their sixth   title, especially when playing at home, is immense.
 
  Goa tackle Meghalaya in the opening match at the GMC Athletic Stadium on Sunday while Chandigarh will take on the might of West Bengal in the other game to be played simultaneously at the Rosary ground in  .
  
  “It’s not easy for the boys but I am sure they will give their best. Meghalaya is a strong side and we will have to be at our best to secure a positive result. It’s important that we start positively. A good performance is a must; results will follow,” said Costa, who coached Sporting Clube de Goa in the I-League last season.
  
  The Santosh Trophy has returned to Goa after 21 years and whenever the tournament has been played at home, Goa has done enough to at least make it to the semifinals. In 1972, when Goa hosted the National   Championship for the first time, Goa lost to Bengal in the semifinals, while they won it in 1990 and lost against Bengal in the 1996 final.
  
  This time around, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has made it mandatory for all teams to field at least three under-20 players in the starting eleven and Costa has enough to choose from.
  
  The team is being led by former India midfielder Francis Fernandes (FC Pune City), while players like Peter Carvalho (FC Bardez) and Marcus Mascarenhas (Sporting Clube) have enough experience, having won the tournament for Goa in the past.
  
  Goa will have to emerge among the top two in their group which has teams like Meghalaya, Services, West Bengal and Chandigarh.
  
  Group B consists of Kerala, Mizoram, Maharashtra, Railways and Punjab. The top two teams qualify for the semifinals.
