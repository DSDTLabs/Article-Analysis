THANE: Thousands of families residing in   have been complaining of nausea, uneasiness and irritation of the eye after a fire broke out in a garbage dump, alongside Diva-Shil road on Wednesday night. This was the second such incident which took place at the same spot behind   in the last one week.

 Upset with the repeated incidents, Diva residents and local activists have dragged the TMC to high court for the indiscriminate dumping of garbage here since the last couple of years.
 
 Adesh  , an activist from Diva, said, “The TMC has been dumping garbage collected from in and around Diva at this particular ground. They have even encroached upon the mangrove land to dump garbage. So, we have filed a petition in the high court requesting the officials to shift the dumping site to some other place. We are suffering from numerous ailments due to this and it is just getting worse by the day.”
 
 Although the regional disaster management cell and fire fighters did bring the situation under control within a few hours, residents claimed that the toxic fumes are still being emitted from the dump.
 
 Santosh Kadam, disaster management officer at RDMC, said, “We rushed to the spot with one fire engine and a tanker. Even in the morning and afternoon since there was a lot of smoke, we had sent fire engines and tankers. It is difficult to ascertain the exact cause of the fire.”
 
 Meanwhile, the TMC has assured residents that the problem would be taken care of as they are already looking for alternatives places and are in the process of identifying a new landfill spot alongside Shil Phata- Mahape Road.
