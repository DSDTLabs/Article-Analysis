RAJKOT:   University (SU) is considering to start a bridge course for its students from the next academic year, which will help them connect better with the industry. The university is also planning to design some of the courses as per the requirement and recommendation of industries. 

 There are many small-scale industries around Saurashtra which require good talent. SU is planning practical training in industries for the students of some of its departments like electronics,   science and advance material, computer science, pharmaceutical science and physics. 
 
 SU registrar (acting) Dhiren   said, “We will approach some of the industries and their associations in Rajkot, Morbi and   and set up meetings with the deans of various departments. We will invite industrial experts to teach our students and request them to provide practical training to our students.” 
 
 SU is planning to approach the industries of Rajkot, Morbi and Jamnagar, which are famed for engineering, ball bearing, ceramic and brass manufacturing. The courses will be designed as per the requirement of industries. 
 
 “We are developing the content for this bridge course and plan to approach chambers of commerce and trade bodies too,” Pandya said.
 
 Ironically, students from universities other than SU are preferred by the local industries. SU is keen to change its image to change this convention.
