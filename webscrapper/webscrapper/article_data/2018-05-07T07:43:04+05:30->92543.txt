PATNA: A man shot dead his father and brother in their sleep and injured two others over property dispute at Chitwaha Dih under the   police station area in   on Sunday.

 Salkhua police station SHO   said the accused was identified as Vinod Yadav alias Mantu Yadav (50), who fled from the spot after the incident.   said the deceased were identified as Vinod’s father Hardev Yadav (80) and his younger brother   (48).
 
 He said Ashok’s wife Chandan Devi (40) and his son   (18) were also shot at and were undergoing treatment at the sadar hospital. “The incident took place at around 3am when the family members were asleep on the terrace after power cut,” the SHO said.
 
 He said Hardev and Ashok were perhaps shot dead in their sleep. “Hardev was shot in his head and Ashok in the neck, resulting in their death immediately,” Kumar said. He said Chandan received two gunshot injuries while Bittu was shot at in his chest.
 
 “Five empty 9mm cartridges were recovered from the terrace,” Kumar said. He said Chandan had chased Vinod for some distance even after receiving bullet injuries but none of the villagers dared come out to help him as Vinod was armed. The SHO said partition of land between the two brothers by Hardev was the main reason behind the killing.
 
 “Preliminary investigation revealed that Vinod had quarrelled with Hardev and Ashok a couple of days back. Vinod had received land share from his in-laws after the death of his wife almost four years back. Perhaps due to that, Hardev gave more share to Ashok, which Vinod had opposed,” Kumar said.
 
 He said Vinod did not regularly live with his family and it was Hardev who took care of his children. He said an FIR was lodged on the statement of Chandan.
