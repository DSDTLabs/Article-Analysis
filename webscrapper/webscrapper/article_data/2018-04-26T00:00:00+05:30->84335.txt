There was a lot of talk of all things beautiful at this event. And why not, after all, it was the launch of a makeup studio. Topics also, naturally, one should say, veered towards the latest in makeup trends in India and abroad, with many exchanging tips and trends. Many beauties from Chennai’s social circle graced this event. Sometime in the middle of all the laughing and catching up, the models did what they’re wont to, and walked down in outfits that had been put together to a theme. Post this, the guests spent some more time bonding, chatting up and making plans for the long summer months ahead.
