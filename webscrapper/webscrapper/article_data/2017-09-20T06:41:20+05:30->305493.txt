BENGALURU: Just 5km apart, two lakes in east   are crying for attention. While the abandoned Hoodi Lake has its dry bed full of weeds and garbage,   has been battling a constant onslaught of sewage,  .

 Vishal Mathur, who lives 5km away from Saradamangala Lake, says that repeated surveys by BBMP's lake department have incorrectly assessed the size of the water body and sought to reduce the catchment area.
 
 “A survey was done in 2015 and another last week. These surveys grossly underestimate the lake's size by almost 10 acres. The lake sees a   and houses located nearby,“ Mathur said.
 
 T Jagannath Rao, executive engineer in charge of the lake, said tenders for Rs 4.8 crore have been floated for taking up development of the water body. “Once the bound ary is fixed, we will put up a fence. As of now, tagging of the boundaries using GPS is pending. If a property is under litigation, we will file an application to allow work to continue. Otherwise, we will have to leave out a stretch of 10-15 metres of the contentious property and go ahead with work,“ he said.
 
 While the state of Saradamangala may soon improve, Hoodi Lake may have to wait for some time. Rao said while a project report for Hoodi Lake has been prepared, tenders haven't been floated.
 
 Balachandran P, who lives near the lake, said: “The lake has been reduced to a drain.The fence has been taken down and make-shift boundary walls have been built.“
