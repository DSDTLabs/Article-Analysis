GANDHINAGAR: government will launch a monthlong drive to deepen water bodies and conserving water, and also turn it into a mass outreach campaign, as Union and state ministers are expected to join the ‘Sujalam Sufalam Jal Abhiyaan’ that starts on May 1. 

 Collectors and DDOs have been asked to ensure businesses and NGOs working locally, provide 50% of the costs required to deepen their local water bodies, and associated expenses. While the government will be spending Rs 315 crore from   and state funds, collectors and DDOs are expected to raise an equal amount of contribution, Rs 315 crore from local businesses and NGOs in a month.
 
  
   , deputy chief minister and state government spokesperson said, “The state government will start the monthlong ‘Sujalam Sufalam Jal Abhiyaan’ from May 1. We will involve local NGOs and other groups. Against the local share, the government will bear 50% costs in diesel and other expenses wherever required. In tribal areas, the government may bear all expenses for deepening water bodies.’’
 
 Earlier, the state government had announced that it will fully fund the deepening of local water bodies, but in Wednesday’s cabinet meeting, the state government passed instructions to take 50% local contribution mainly from local companies, social and religious groups, NGOs etc.
 
 There is a lot of scepticism among officials about the government’s new drive and fear of backlash from villagers said a source in the secretariat. 
 
 “The government has asked local   administration to organize functions in as many villages as possible, but there is possibility that villagers who are facing severe water crisis may not prefer pep talks and have tussle with government authorities visiting the villages. District authorities have been instructed to ensure to avoid any clash with locals.’’
