LUDHIANA: Despite several attempts,   (Glada) has not been able to curb mushrooming of illegal housing colonies in Ludhiana. In a recent survey,   found that the number of   in the district increased from 1,800 a year ago to 1,931 now. 

 Of these, 1432 colonies were in Ludhiana and the remaining around the city. When contacted, Glada estate officer (regulatory) Harpreet   said they had now fixed responsibility of officials to keep a check on such colonies and warned of “strict action” if they failed to keep things in control.
 
 He said the state government had issued instructions for the fresh survey because it was planning a policy for regularization of such colonies. Though the number of illegal colonies has increased, Glada officials say they have carried out action against such self-styled real-estate developers regularly. According to data, Glada has recommended 500 FIRs against colonisers for developing illegal colonies. 
 
 Sekhon said the number of illegal colonies could have doubled had it not been for measures taken by the development authority. “After the survey, we have made it clear to our staff that the in case any other colony is developed, then officer concerned will be held responsible and action taken against him/her too,” Sekhon said. 
 
 The previous state government, ruled by the SAD-BJP alliance, had had come out with the regularization policy for illegal colonies. However, it could not generate much response due to strict conditions. With the   coming to power last year, developers have been demanding a new policy for regularising illegal colonies. At present, there is a ban on registries in illegal colonies.
