JAIPUR: A Rajasthan police team landed up in Ahmedabad earlier this week to arrest VHP's Pravin   in a case that doesn't exist technically - it had been withdrawn three years ago by the state government. However, the order withdrawing the case never reached the court because of a bureaucratic blunder, and the court went on hearing the case and continued to issue summons. 

 This came to light only on Tuesday after Togadia accused the Rajasthan police of conspiring to kill him in an encounter. A red-faced government pulled up the cops, after which police and civil officials dug up files to realise they were on a 'dead' case. 
 
 The case dates back to 2002, when Togadia and 16 others were booked by the Sawai Madhopur police for violating Section 144 CrPC in the   area. 
 
 Although the police filed a final report citing errors in facts, the then sub-divisional magistrate had moved a complaint in the court against the accused. 
 
 The court took cognisance of the complaint and issued numerous summons to Togadia. However, in 2015, after BJP came to power, the case was withdrawn.
 
  IGP (Bhartpur range) Alok Kumar Vashishtha said that after withdrawing the case, the state government issued a letter to district officials on June 9, 2015. "But it somehow did not reach the court. It's the responsibility of the prosecution to inform the court that the case has been withdrawn by the government," Vashishtha told TOI, adding there must have been a "communication gap". 
 
 Sawai Madhopur collector Kailash Chand Verma said the letter was addressed to the superintendent of police and that he should have acted on it. 
 
 SP Maman Singh Yadav said they were probing how the blunder happened. 
 
 Additional SP (Gangapur city) Yogendra Faujdar said the court would be informed about the affair at the next hearing. "We will move an application for requisition, but it's up to the court to take a final decision," he said.
