GURUGRAM: MCG on Monday demolished seven under-construction buildings and sealed one building in the 300-metres restricted zone around the ammunition depot. 

 According to the officials, of the seven structures that were razed on Monday four were residential buildings. The civic body also sealed three commercial buildings in the area for illegal construction. Around 500 cops were present at the spot when the drive was conducted. 
 
 “As per the Punjab and Haryana high court directions, 300 metres around the ammunition depot falls under the restricted zone. The demolition drive carried out on Monday was done to clear the restricted zone of the illegal structures. The drive is likely to continue for a couple of weeks,” a senior MCG official said.
 
 MCG’s enforcement wing has drawn up a three-month-long demolition schedule to raze illegal structures near the ammunition depot. Earlier in March, it had demolished 11 structures and sealed around 25  , including 16 residential properties.
 
 According to a recent MCG survey, there are around 5,987 properties that are built within 300 metres of the ammunition depot. 
 
 Meanwhile, the civic body also sealed two banquet halls on old Delhi-Gurugram road for non-payment of properties taxes.
