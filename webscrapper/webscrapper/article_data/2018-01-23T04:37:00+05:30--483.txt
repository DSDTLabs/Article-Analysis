Ahmedabad: Seeking withdrawal of the Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance (FRDI) Bill, 2017 (FRDI) the All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) has launched a nationwide signature campaign. AIBEA claims the bill will compromise safety of people’s money deposited in the banks. As part of the campaign, the body plans to submit a mass petition to the Parliament and Lok Sabha speaker, after collecting one crore signatures.

 Highlighting the flaws of the bill, C H Venkatachalam, general secretary, AIBEA, said, “The depositors’ money must be protected. However, the FRDI Bill is trying to remove the safety for the deposits in the banks with its provisions. Total deposits in the banks should be fully protected and guaranteed.”
 
 Venkatachalam also said, “FRDI is not required in India because the banking system is very different from that of other developed countries such as USA. We have deposit-oriented banking whereas others have investment-oriented banks. Moreover, the Banking Regulations Act does have provisions to prevent banks from liquidation by merging them.”
 
 An aggressive awareness campaign will begin from Friday across the state and signatures from some 10 lakh people from across Gujarat will be collected, said Janak Rawal, general secretary of Maha Gujarat Bank Employees Association.
 
 Apart from the bill, AIBEA has also raised the issue of bad loans which is a major concern for the government.
