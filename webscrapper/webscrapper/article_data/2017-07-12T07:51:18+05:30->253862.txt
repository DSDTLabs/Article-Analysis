LUCKNOW: Putting the Yogi government in the dock for its apathy to Aliganj   survivor, the Lucknow bench of the high court on Tuesday directed the district magistrate to ensure her admission in   for treatment. The   was forcibly discharged on July 7 without proper treatment. 

 A bench of justice Ramesh Sinha and justice Rekha Dixit also directed the director general, health, to explain under what circumstances she was discharged from KGMU. The court was concerned on seeing the survivor’s photographs. The bench also summoned the district magistrate and SSP to appear in the court on July 14 to explain how the two gunners provided to her failed to protect her from the miscreants who threw acid on her on July 1. The survivor had been provided with gunners because she had been attacked with acid many times earlier and had been seriously injured. 
 
 Entertaining the petition filed on behalf of the survivor, the bench said, “Looking at the condition of the victim and her photograph, which appears to be very serious, and the fact that KGMU hospital has ousted her without her being fit, the chief medical superintendent, KGMU, is directed to admit her today and also provide adequate medical facilities to her till further orders of this court as she is a victim of acid attack.”
