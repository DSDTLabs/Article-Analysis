Comedian-actor   has issued a public apology to his pregnant wife   and kids   and  , his children from a previous marriage, for some "bad" behaviour on his part. 

 Sharing the reason behind his rudeness, the 38-year-old   said someone was trying to extort him for "financial gains" as a result of his actions. 
 
  
  
 In the video posted on Instagram, Hart said, "I'm at a place in my life where I feel like I have a target on my back and I should make smart decisions and recently I didn't. 
 
  
  
 "I made a bad error in judgement and put myself in an environment where only bad things can happen and they did. And doing that I know that I am going to hurt the people closest to, whom I have talked to my wife and my kids." 
 
 At the end of the video, the actor, who has been married to Parrish since 2016, said, "At the end of the day, I just have to do better." 
 
 Hart also said, "But I am not going to allow a person to make financial gains over my mistakes." 
 
 Along with the video, the actor wrote, "Sending so many apologies to my wife & kids. I gotta do better and I will. I'm not perfect and have never claimed to be ...I love you all."
