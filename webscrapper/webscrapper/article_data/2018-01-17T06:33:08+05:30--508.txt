MUMBAI: CM Devendra   has exhorted the   in   to gear up for the state assembly elections. Stating that poll preparations in   had begun a tad late in the day, which affected the party’s final tally, Fadnavis, it is learnt, said the   should lose no more time and get into poll mode. The Maharashtra assembly polls are scheduled for October 2019.

 
 Addressing a closed-door conclave of BJP functionaries, including district unit presidents, at the party’s Mumbai office on Tuesday, Fadnavis said partymen should go right to the booth level to bond with voters. “You will have to be in active mode,” he said, it is learnt.
 
 Stating that the recent Bhima-Koregaon violence was a “conspiracy” against the BJP regime, Fadnavis urged party workers to keep a vigil in their constituencies and thwart any plan to breach social peace. He said BJP and his government were “fiercely committed” to the Constitution.
 
 “We will not let anyone tamper with the Constitution which guarantees equal rights to every citizen, irrespective of caste, creed and language. We are committed to maintaining social harmony and peace in the state,” he said. A judicial inquiry into the Bhima-Koregaon incident will get to the truth and find out who was responsible for the violence, he said, according to a party source.
 
 The CM asked party workers to lay emphasis, while connecting with voters, on how BJP government has given a push to development in the state, especially in infrastructure. A “frustrated” opposition is trying every trick to obstruct progress, he added. “Devendraji made it clear to us development should be the cornerstone of our assembly poll campaign,” said a party functionary.
 
 The state BJP will hold rallies to “uphold the sanctity of the Constitution,” it is learnt. This is meant as a reply to farmer leader Raju Shetti’s Jan 26 ‘Samvidhaan Bachao’ stir.
