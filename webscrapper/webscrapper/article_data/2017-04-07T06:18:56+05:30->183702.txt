MUMBAI: A proprietary software major served a `licence non-compliance notice' to   Bombay recently.

 It is probably the first such incident in the recent memory said faculty and students on the campus. The institute, in turn, shot off a mail to all the campus residents warning them against the use of pirated software as it is illegal. What is surprising though is the fact that the institute already had procured the requisite licence for the software in question.The incident has prompted the authorities to frame a policy for the use of licensed software on campus and also to explore better methods of real-time tracking.
 
 “The software major has its own ways to figure out who is using an unauthorized copy of their software. They have written to us with the details of the IP address and the machine names where it was being used illegally,“ said  , head of the computer centre.
