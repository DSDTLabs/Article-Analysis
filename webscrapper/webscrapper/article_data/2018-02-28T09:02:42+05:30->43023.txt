NEW DELHI: The now suspended BJP man accused of mowing down nine children in Muzaffarpur,  , on Saturday, and going on the run, surrendered this morning, reported ANI.

 
 The accused,  , was allegedly driving while drunk, when his sport utility vehicle rammed into a crowd of school children. In addition to the nine children dead, some 20 were also wounded.
 
 After he surrendered this morning, Baitha was moved to Patna Medical College & Hospital from Sri Krishna Medical College & Hospital for treatment of the injuries he reportedly suffered during the accident.
 
 The police registered an FIR against Baitha on the complaint of a local who lost his granddaughter in the incident. The BJP suspended Baitha on Monday, after first denying he belonged to the party.
 
 About reports that a banner fixed on that vehicle described Baitha's designation in the party as state secretary general of Mahadalit Prakoshth, Kumar said, "No such post exists in the organisation. The worker appears to have fabricated it."
 
 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi has said the police were directed to take "sternest possible action" against Baitha irrespective of his political affiliations.
 
 The opposition RJD has accused the   government of trying to shield Baitha and alleged that the BJP worker was "drunk" while behind the steering wheel even though sale and consumption of alcohol is banned in the state.
