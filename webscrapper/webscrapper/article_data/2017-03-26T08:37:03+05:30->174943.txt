RANCHI:   air connectivity will become a reality in   by   this year.   Jayant Sinha on Saturday made this announcement soon after the Jharkhand government signed a tripartite MoU with the DRDO and AAI for setting up an   at  . 

 Chief minister Raghubar Das said, “Air connectivity is of vital importance to the state’s development. Inter-city   and flights linking Ranchi to Hyderabad and Chennai are essential to draw more investment. This new airport, the second to come up in Jharkhand since Independence, will boost tourism and improve connectivity to the Santhal Pargana.”
 
 Sinha assured that in six months an aircraft would be stationed in Jharkhand for flights connecting Ranchi, Bokaro, Jamshedpur, Palamu, Dumka, Daltonganj and other cities. 
 
 “The runway at Dumka is being extended to enable larger aircraft to land there. Within a span of three to six months, this inter-city air connectivity project will take off in the state. All major cities of Jharkhand will be connected. In the last two years, flights at the Ranchi airport have increased from six to 18. Very soon we will also have flights taking off from Ranchi to Chennai and Hyderabad,” Sinha added. 
 
 “The Deoghar airport will be completed by December 2019 at a cost of Rs 350 crore. While the DRDO will give Rs 200 crore, AAI will spend Rs 100 crore. The remaining amount will be taken care of by the state government. Even jet aircraft will be able to land at Deoghar. The state government has given us a plot of 600.69 acres near the existing 53.41-acre aerodrome at Deoghar. This huge piece of land will be utilised to set up allied facilities like cargo complex, hotels and offices,” said Sinha. 
 
 Senior officials of AAI, DRDO and the state government were present during the signing of tripartite MoU at the chief minister’s residence on Saturday. The state government will give free electricity and water to AAI authorities at Deoghar for five years.
