Chandigarh: The signing up for the e-auction of vanity registration numbers 0001 to 9999 for the CH01-BN series of vehicles started on Wednesday.

 The registering and licensing authority (RLA) will hold the process from July 18 to 24. Vehicle owners can register on the national transport website https://parivahan.gov.in/fancy, where get a unique acknowledgement number (UAN). Vehicle buyers with a Chandigarh address alone qualify to participate. The sale letter or form 21, Aadhaar card, and address proof are the documents required.
 
 After signing up, the vehicle owner will have to deposit the participation fee and the reserve price for the desired number by issuing a demand draft in favour of the ‘Registering & Licensing Authority, UT’, payable at Chandigarh. The details of the participation fee, reserve prices, online procedure, and the terms and conditions of e-auction are on the Chandigarh transport department website www.chdtransport.gov.in. 
 
 Delay in hiring an agency for making high-security registration plates has led to a pendency of more than 70,000 HSRPs. The plates have not been affixed in the CH01-BK, CH01-BG, CH01-BH, CH01-BJ, and CH01BL series of vehicles. The affixing is also pending in the old series starting from CH03-N.
