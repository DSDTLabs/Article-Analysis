CHARMINAR: The deplorable   at   has made players a disgruntled lot. In a sign of uneven levelling, layers of stones and pebbles can be seen all over the ground. 

 
 Senior coach Mir Alamdar Ali told TOI that the bumpy ground is quite a challenge for players during practice sessions. Umpteen pleas of players, coaches and sports enthusiasts to GHMC authorities have fallen on deaf ears. 
 
 "Coaching of players at Darulshifa ground has been going on since 1938. National and international players have attended regular practice sessions at this famed ground. Unfortunately, official apathy has left the ground in a pathetic state. Many footballers have been suffering knee and other injuries," Ali said.
 
 Players said except hollow words, no concrete initiative has been taken to improve the condition of the ground. "The players feel as if they are in no man's land. The facilities leave a lot to be desired. No official is bothered to take care of ground maintenance and material. At least they can provide basic facilities," said Mohammed Ali Khan, secretary,  .
 
 Despite hurdles, around 120 players from various parts of the   play here. The schedule has changed due to Ramzan. Coaching now begins after midnight and continues till 3.30am. Otherwise, coaching continues between 7pm and 10pm.
