MUMBAI: While film fans across the country have been wondering which film to watch first on the Republic Day weekend—Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s period drama  , that has been mired in controversy, or the Akshay Kumar-powered   based on the true story of a man behind a low-cost sanitary napkin manufacturing machine in rural India—Kumar, often the last man standing at many a box-office clash has bowed out of this one following Bhansali’s plea to push back PadMan’s release.

 Bhansali, who is facing threats and protests since he started filming last year until it was cleared by CBFC last month, told a media gathering on Friday at Kumar’s Juhu residence: “Padmaavat is releasing after a lot of struggle. We know that   was initially the date for PadMan’s release, but Akshay is such a big star that it might get more difficult for Padmaavat to endure another battle. Akshay knows what we’ve been through and it didn’t take him two minutes to give us the head start. He has a very large heart to exude so much goodness I will be grateful for a lifetime for what he’s done.”
 
 Kumar’s PadMan will now hit the theatres on  , and share the box-office with Aiyaary, the first film to have opted out of the January 25 release. Padmaavat will have the benefit of a solo release over the long holiday weekend.
 
  
  
 
 Kumar, who is averting the clash of the big Ps in deference to the filmmaker’s distress and concerns, said, “I can completely understand that his need of this date is more important than mine. They’ve gone through a lot and the stake of their film is higher. He’s a great friend so when he asked for it I went ahead with the postponement.”
 
 Bhansali, who has avoided going public since the Padmaavat controversy hit him, with his hands folded, thanked Kumar, and said: “This is how we stand by each other and respect each other. The fraternity will be proud because it’s a gesture that is otherwise quite impossible in this industry.”
