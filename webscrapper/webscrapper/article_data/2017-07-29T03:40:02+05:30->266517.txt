MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government has ordered a probe against   vice-chancellor Dr   over the manner in which tenders were floated and the system for online checking of answer papers was set in place, which has resulted in delay of results of final year students.

 Replying to a calling attention motion raised by party MLAs, minister of state for higher education Ravindra   said the inquiry will be held about the manner in which system was decided to be implemented.
 
 Waikar said the presentation for the system for online checking of exam papers was demonstrated in front of the managing committee. “Questions were raised over whether the entire system could be put in place in such short time. But the VC assured the committee and accepted complete responsibility for implementation of the system and due tenders were issued on May 2,” said Waikar.
 
 According to the reply, out of 17.36 lakh answer sheets, the university is yet to check over 4.07 lakh.
 
 Education minister   said while an inquiry committee will deal with the investigation over the manner in which this system was put in place, the present task before the government was to announce the final year results of students.
