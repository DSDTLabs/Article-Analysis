NAGPUR: Noted thinker   on Saturday said he had no choice but to part ways with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) as many of his views on a number of issues did not go down well with the then functionaries due to which he felt ideologically suffocated.

 “I always wanted to be associated with RSS, but not at the cost of my way of thinking,” Deodhar said, while delivering a lecture on ‘Majhi Jeevan Yatra’, organized by   as part of Dnyanyoddha lecture series at   of Dharampeth Mulanchi Shala.
 
 Deodhar said, “During my college days, I was deeply influenced by RSS and  , who was the Sarsanghchalak then. After joining the RSS, I spoke my mind out on many changes that could be brought about in the organization, and were backed by Deoras. However, there were differing views in the top echelons of RSS who were averse to my way of thinking. Senior ideologues believed my views were contrary to the ideals of the organization.”
 
 “I soon realized that I was deliberately kept out of important RSS meetings. Despite this, there were many in RSS who backed my pragmatic approach on several issues,” he added.
 
 A purse of Rs1 lakh was donated to   to provide aid to the divorced women and underprivileged children.
