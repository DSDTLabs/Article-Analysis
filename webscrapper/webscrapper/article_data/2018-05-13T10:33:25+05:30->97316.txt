ALLAHABAD: Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission ( ) has debarred an engineer from appearing in any exam conducted by it for three years, for attaching Rs 1,000 currency notes and writing mobile number on his answer script of   held in 2014.

 Besides, UPPSC has also sent a recommendation to all state public service commissions in the country to debar him.
 
 The notes were rendered useless as the evaluation of the answer scripts started after 2016 when the government had demonetized Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.
 
 The commission has also debarred two other candidates of PCS (Prelims)-2017 for a year for keeping cellphones with them in examination hall and taking OMR answer sheets with them.
 
 The debarment order was issued by UPPSC examination controller Anju Katiyar on May 7, two days after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) lodged an FIR against   on charges of anomalies in exams conducted by it.
 
 The FIR said that “some candidates had marked unique features in their answer scripts, which could lead to their easy identification. However, no evaluator or UPPSC official pointed out the conduct of the candidates which shows ulterior motive on the part of UPPSC officials”.
 
 UPPSC secretary Jagdish said that the currency notes were found in the answer sheets of one Surjeet Singh of Etawah. He had stapled Rs 1,000 notes each in Hindi, Agriculture Engineering I and II answer scripts.
 
 “The candidate has been debarred for three years starting January 18,” said Jagdish. The Combined Junior Engineer Examination-2013 was conducted to fill 3,222 posts of junior engineers and 925 vacancies of assistant engineers in various state departments. The advertisement for the recruitment was issued in 2013.
