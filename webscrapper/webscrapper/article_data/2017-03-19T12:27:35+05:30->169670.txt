PANAJI: All India Congress Committee general secretary and Goa desk in-charge   took a dig at the   for the week-long delay in announcing their chief ministerial candidate for Uttar Pradesh. 

 Singh, in a tweet, also suggested that the party send   as the chief minister of UP if defence minister   could be relieved from the defence ministry to take charge of Goa.
 
 “A week and they can't decide on UP CM! For 40-seat state, number four can be sent. Then they have an option to send No 1 for a 403 seat state,” Singh said in a tweet.
 
 Singh’s jibe was aimed at the BJP in a bid to counter the statement made by Parrikar after Friday’s cabinet meeting.
 
 BJP leader and former defence minister Parrikar had implied that the Congress failed to form the government in Goa as the party failed to decide on its chief minister and failed to conclude alliance discussions. Parrikar had gone on to say that Singh had come to Goa “just to enjoy, not to work”.
 
 Singh and the Congress have repeatedly questioned the BJP’s hurry to form the government in Goa even though Congress emerged as the single-largest party in the state assembly elections.
 
 “Congress was blamed for being late in deciding its leader. BJP yet to decide leader in UP and Uttarakhand. Results came on 11th evening,”Digvijaya said in a series of tweets.
