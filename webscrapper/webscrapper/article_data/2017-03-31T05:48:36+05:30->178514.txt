The circular also said that as it has ‘rained well’ in most parts of the state in 2016 and production has been ‘quite good’, farmers should start repaying loans.
 
 Slamming the move, Opposition in the legislative council on Thursday said it is for the farmers to decide what they want to do with the funds they receive and the state shouldn’t hold the insurance amount against their loan outstanding. “A farmer gets insurance claims only when he has suffered crop losses and now, the state wants banks to take the funds away from them. We dem-and the circular be withdrawn,” said Dhananjay Munde, NCP MLC. The state had sanctioned Rs 893 crore towards insurance claims for crop losses in 2015-16. Officials said 36 lakh farmers signed up for the insurance scheme and collective premium of Rs 54 crore to insure 24.6 lakh hectares of land for Rs 2,865 crore.
 
 State finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said the previous government had in fact allowed banks to deduct the entire insurance money against the outstanding of farm loans. “To avoid confusion among farmers, we are likely to revoke the circular,” he added.
