BHUBANESWAR: Motorists, struggling to spot stray dogs and cattle in darkness, may now heave a sigh of relief. In a bid to prevent stray dogs and cattle from being hit by vehicles in night, some animal lovers here have started an initiative by fitting these animals with reflective collar belts. 

 The first of its kind campaign in the state has been launched by   (AWTE), a voluntary organisation. “We started the drive on Sunday evening and tied the reflective collar around necks of nearly 50 stray dogs along the national highway-16 in Khandagiri area here. Our purpose is to cover all stray dogs and cattle along the NH,” AWTE founder Purabi Patra told TOI. 
 
 The collars reflect the light from vehicles, helping motorists to avoid ramming into stray dogs and cattle in the night. “Every day, a number of vehicles run over stray dogs and cattle in dark stretches of the NH and other roads. Accidents occur as the motorists cannot spot a dog or cattle in the dark and visibility was an issue. We hope, our initiative will protect both these animals and motorists,” Patra said. 
 
 A recent enumeration by the   (BMC) put the population of stray dogs at over 12,000. Stray animals roaming around the city have been posing a tough challenge for the civic body and traffic police. Since June-end, the BMC has not been able to conduct sterilization of dogs due to absence of veterinary doctors. “We were earlier provided with five doctors to carry out the Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme of stray dogs. But the doctors were recently taken back. We will approach the government again to provide us veterinary doctors to resume the ABC programme,” BMC mayor A N Jena said. 
 
 The city records 25 dog bite cases every day on an average. “The roads inside the wards are often blocked by the stray cattle and dogs. We have to make our own way or wait till the animals make way for us,” said Susanta Ray, a resident of Sailashree Vihar.
