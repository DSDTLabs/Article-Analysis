Pune: A 27-year-old medical practitioner was found dead in his Moshi residence on Thursday afternoon. It is suspected that he injected an intravenous injection, police said.

 The MIDC Bhosari police identified the deceased as Mahesh Mahadev Mohite (27), a resident of Sector 4, Santnagar, in Moshi. The police said he was running a clinic in Bhosari.
 
 Mohite did not go to his clinic till 11am on Thursday. When his cousin’s calls went unanswered, the latter went to Mohite’s home and knocked on the bedroom’s door — bolted from inside — several times, but there was no response.
 
 Mohite’s cousin and other family members broke open the door and found him lying on bed with a syringe injected to his arm. He was rushed to a private hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead.
 
 Senior inspector B N Shingade of the MIDC Bhosari police said, “The reason behind the suicide is yet to be ascertained.”
