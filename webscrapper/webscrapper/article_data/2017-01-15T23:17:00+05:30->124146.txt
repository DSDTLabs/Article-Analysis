Mangaluru: A road   installed to ensure road safety, helped the police in nabbing three youths who had fatally knocked down a   near Karnad, at Mulky.

 Police said the incident occurred early on Friday. Rajendra Shetty, 61, a resident of Karnad had stepped out of his house for morning walk and was knocked down by a speeding car along NH-66.
 
 After hitting Rajendra, the car veered to the roadside and hit the barricade. As the wheels of the car got stuck in the metal barricade, the vehicle could not move from the spot despite the car occupants tried their best to flee from the spot.
 
 Meanwhile, a few autorickshaw drivers who saw that the barricade set up by them had been damaged, demanded compensation from the occupants of the car, who dismissed the same and also spoke dismissively. When the occupants failed to oblige, auto drivers called up the jurisdictional police station, who arrived and took them to the station.
 
 Meanwhile, Rajendra’s family members grew anxious when he did not return from his morning walk even after two hours and set out to look for him. They found Rajendra’s body in a bush near a petrol bunk. 
 
 The auto drivers, who learnt about the incident, informed the police. The policemen questioned the youth in the car and took them into custody. They also registered a complaint against them.
 
 The CCTV camera installed at the petrol bunk has blurred images of the accident. Police said that the three youths hailing from Mulki were coming from Kundapur.
 
 A case has been registered at North traffic police station.
