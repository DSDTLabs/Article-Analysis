 Refuting the allegations, principal Rakesh Chandra said, “She (the complainant) is a part-time teacher in our college. She caught the student one hour into the exam. She didn’t follow the UFM process.”
 
  proctor Prof Vinod Singh said, “I have sought comments from the seniormost member in the flying squad. Only after his comments will we examine her case. If her allegations are true, action will be initiated.”
