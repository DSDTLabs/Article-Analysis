Bhopal: Two days after a whistle-blower into the   scam, Ashish Chaturvedi, was allegedly threatened by a police station in-charge with dire consequences, he filed a formal police complaint with senior police officers in Gwalior on Monday evening. He was forced to lodge a formal complaint as no action was taken despite his repeated urgings with police officers over phone.

 Chaturvedi is key complainant and witness in many of the Vyapam cases, and has so far reportedly been attacked 14 times.
 
 In a fresh complaint to IG Gwalior range Anil Kumar, Ashish Chaturvedi alleged, “On January 13, I informed Justice Satish Chandra Sharma during a hearing in Gwalior bench of High Court that I am being harassed on instructions of the government and to falsely implicate me, allegations like theft and loot are being levelled against me by local police. Subsequently, the court summoned Jhansi Road police station in-charge Rajkumar Sharma. The very next day, Sharma threatened me with dire consequences. He abused me and said stop complaining or he would fix me. Despite informing the IG Police (Gwalior range) over phone same time, no action was taken against erring official and I am being pressurised.”
 
 When TOI contacted IG Police (Gwalior range) Anil Kumar, he asked to talk to SP Gwalior. SP Gwalior Dr Ashis said, “Chaturvedi complained about security guards and we are looking into his complaints. Besides, we are also getting allegations levelled by him against Jhansi road police station in-charge investigated.”
