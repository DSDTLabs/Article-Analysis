Model-turned-actor   came into limelight with  's show ' ' and there has been no stopping for this talented actor since then.
 
  Sahil was seen in a boy-next-door look whilst playing the role of Arjun in 'Everest' and he was absolutely fab in it.
  
  However, now, Sahil is shooting for  's TV show 'P.O.W' and will be playing the antagonist of the show.
  
  
 
  
  
 
  
  The actor had to go through a huge transformation to do justice to his role. Sahil has worked really hard to completely change his look from a charming boy to a rugged, macho terrorist.
  
  Not just this, the transformation in his look begins right from his hairdo, to his eye colour and entire physique.
  
  
 
  
  According to close sources, Sahil is slated to have yet another change in look in the show which is under wraps for the moment. And with all this happening things really seems to be on an upwards graph for Sahil Salathia.
  
  
 
  
  "It's amazing that you all noticed the transformation from Arjun to Yussuf. Yussuf needed me to be a little beefy with a super super thick messy beard! Yussuf is always with his surma on, has green eyes and oh, boy keeps quite a few guns handy all the time! Haha! But that's him. And he speaks a certain way considering he is from Pakistan and is obviously, not an urban Pakistani so, I had to work on the language since he does use a lot of Urdu, of course."
  
  Well, that's a lot of hard work put in from Sahil.
