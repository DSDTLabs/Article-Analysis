With volumes in derivatives trading based on Indian indices and securities reaching large proportions in some of the foreign jurisdictions and resulting in migration of liquidity from India, domestic bourses — BSE,   and   (MSEI) — have decided not to allow trading of their indices on foreign bourses. The exchanges said that this offshore trading “is not in the best interests of Indian markets”.

 
 The move comes close on the heels of NSE, the country’s largest exchange, raising concerns over Singapore Stock Exchange’s (SGX’s) plan to launch single-stock futures on the 50   constituents. This could lead to a shift of trading in futures contracts by foreign funds from India to Singapore.
 
 All existing licensing agreements between Indian and foreign exchanges for trading derivatives on bourses abroad and other such platfor ms will be ter minated immediately, subject to respective notice periods, a joint statement from the three bourses noted. Additionally, no new licensing will be allowed, they added. These conditions, however, will not apply to products traded on exchanges based in any   (IFSC) operating in India. The ban will also not apply to exchange-traded funds, the statement said.
 
 Domestic bourses, through licensing pacts, provide market data to index providers for creating indices. Exchanges could also create indices based on their market data which could then be licensed to foreign exchanges for trading of products based on Indian indices.
