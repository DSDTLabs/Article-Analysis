MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court has allowed a man to contest the election to the Primary Agricultural Credit Co-operative Society in Kundrakudi in   district to be held on Saturday, after his name was left out of the initial list. 

 The society was established in 1960 to help agriculturists in the locality by disbursing loans in various levels from short term, middle term to long term loans and by providing fertilisers. To hold election to the society, the election officer issued a notification on March 9. When Arumugam, who is one of the members to the society filed his nomination, the election officer announced the final list leaving Arumugam.
 
 Challenging it, he filed a petition. When the plea came up for hearing before the division bench comprising chief justice Indira Banerjee and justice J Nishabanu, the petitioner’s counsel, K P   said that as per the election notification, verification of nomination must be done on April 2 and final list would be published on April 3. But the election officer picked 11 people out of 44 and published the final list on April 1 itself, as if they are the only contestants. 
 
 This led the bench to peruse the documents related to the election and find that the petitioner left the column (name of constituency) blank. The special government pleader submitted that the constituency means special category such as scheduled caste or female. Following it, the chief justice said, “However, there is no constituency allocation for SC or for women under the   and Rues framed under it. Besides, almost all the 11 people merely struck out the column. Thus, the petitioner shall be allowed to contest.”
