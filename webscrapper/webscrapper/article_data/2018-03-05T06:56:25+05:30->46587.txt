HYDERABAD: It is not new for the   to impose restriction on constructions on the premises of government schools within the Army area.

 In 2013, a government primary school in   received a ‘red notice’ from the local Army restricting construction of additional building on the school premises. The Army cited ‘security’ reasons for the ‘red notice’.\
 
 The local Army officials told the school authorities to obtain security clearance from the GOC,  , Secunderabad (now headquarters of   and Andhra Sub Area) before undertaking any construction within 500 metres from the boundary wall of Defence property.
 
 The state education department made serious efforts and pursued the issue with  . Finally, the restriction was relaxed and the school got permission for the construction, said Mohammad Yakoob, assistant executive engineer, Sarva Siksha Abhiyan, Hyderabad.
 
 There are nearly 600 government schools in Hyderabad district. But a few schools in the vicinity of Defence area face the problem.
 
 The local Army restrictions for these schools are in tune with the changing scenario of security protocol. Though government schools do not pose any threat, they face restriction from the Army when it comes to the issue of new construction.
 
 If the Army imposes restrictions, under privileged students, would lose their bright future. The state government is concerned with a huge drop out ratio. Parents, who cannot afford high tuition fee in private schools, are forced to send their children to government school, where education if free. Educationists and child rights activists demand that the state government take up the issue with the Defence ministry and ensure that all the restrictions on government schools in Defence areas should be removed.
