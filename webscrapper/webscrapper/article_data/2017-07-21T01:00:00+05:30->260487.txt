BHAGALPUR: Following a directive of Patna high court, the technical team of state vigilance department started a probe on Thursday into alleged anomalies in widening and substantial increase in the height of roads passing through the main city areas causing immense difficulties to the inhabitants besides business and trade establishments.

 The high court had earlier wanted to know what prompted the   construction department (RCD) to widen the roads despite its instruction to maintain the existing road heights. The court termed it as a deliberate disobedience and obvious case of commission of Contempt of Court's directives."What action has been taken against the officers, who, in violation of the order of this court, permitted the present road to be made above the existing roads, thereby raising the height of the road in Bhagalpur town," the HC bench had asked in its order on September 16 , 2016.
 
 Sources said the technical team is making spot verification of the roads under HC scanner. 
 
 Earlier, the vigilance had indicted 10 engineers and other officials for various irregularities including violation of courtâ€™s previous orders.
 
 A vigilance team led by ASP (vigilance) Sanjay Bharti had questioned RCD officials and contractors to get into the bottom of the issue. The vigilance officials had also met Bhagalpur DM Adesh Titarmere and Rajesh Chandra Jha, the man who had filed public interest litigation (PIL) in the high court. The vigilance team had also summoned the then executive engineer Lalmohan Prajapati and other engineers in connection with the case in May this year.
