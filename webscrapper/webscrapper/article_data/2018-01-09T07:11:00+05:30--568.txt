Chandigarh: Continuing stern action against the property   violators, the tax branch of the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) on Monday morning sealed a commercial shop-cum-office (SCO) in Sector 34. As per MC’s record, the owner of the SCO had to pay Rs 15,79,991 to the authority, but did not pay even a single penny since day one.

 Significantly, this is the second such incident in the less than a week’s period, as the authority had sealed a commercial building in Sector 7 on Tuesday last week in a similar case.
 
 “We don’t know the exact details of the owner, but according to information, some political person from Punjab is the owner of the building. We used to paste notice on the shop’s door. We also tried to locate the exact address of the owner, but failed to get anything concrete,”said sources in the office.
 
 “We have been giving notices to the owner since 2006, but he or she did not respond at all. We gave enough time to the violator and finally, sealed the office,” said an official.
 
 Significantly, on Tuesday last week, MC sealed another shop-cum-office in Sector 7 on Madhya Marg for not paying Rs 7 lakh tax. The owner failed to pay the amount despite repeated notices. The tax branch of th MC has prepared a list of around 1,100 commercial tax defaulters, and notices will be sent to them. The defaulters owe the MC around Rs 30 crore.
 
 The cash-strapped corporation, in recent months, has slapped notices on defaulters. The civic body, on Monday, sent around 2,000 notices to the residents of sectors 16 and 22. This is the first time that the MC has sent notices for property tax on the residential properties. Residents have been given a month’s time to pay the tax.
