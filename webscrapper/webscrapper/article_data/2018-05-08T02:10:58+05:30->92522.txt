MUMBAI:   executive   case will not be hit by lack of a body. The “no body, no murder” principle from the 17thcentury died effectively mid last century and forensic evidence plays a key role in establishing murder sans a body, courts have held.

 The   had, in 2011, held that no body doesn’t mean no murder. Justices P Sathasivam and B S Chauhan in a case from Punjab held that "in a murder case, it is not necessary that the dead body should be found and identified, ie, conviction for murder does not depend on   being found...'' 
 
 The Latin phrase ‘Corpus Delicti’, which refers to ‘body of crime’, essentially means that there must be some proof of the crime being committed before a person can be convicted of that crime. The US Supreme Court in a 1960 case of People vs Scott held that “circumstantial evidence, when sufficient to exclude every other reasonable hypothesis, may prove the death of a missing person". In Mumbai, a high profile case of a trial that is under way even when the body of the alleged murder victim is not available is the Sheena Bora case.
 
 Leading criminal law counsel Amit Desai had earlier said "if there is compelling evidence of murder, absence of dead body can't prevent conviction”. He said the last seen concept and other circumstances could play a role in gathering up a body of evidence. What needs to be proved is that a murder did take place. Justice M Hidayatullah, upholding a murder conviction in 1959 in the then State of Bombay, had quoted a British ruling that enunciated the legal principle. “At the trial of a person charged with murder, the fact of death is provable by circumstantial evidence, notwithstanding that neither the body nor any trace of it has been found..''
 
 In the UK, a murder accused, Mark Bridger, was convicted despite lack of body in 2013 as the victim, a five-year-old girl, was last seen entering his vehicle. The only things found were ‘blood and tiny bone fragments at his cottage which matcher her DNA’.
