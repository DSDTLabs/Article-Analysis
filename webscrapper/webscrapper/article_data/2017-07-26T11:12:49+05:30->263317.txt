CHENNAI: Kudankulam   power plant operator NPCIL should not just focus on developing technologies but also should communicate with local communities to spread awareness about nuclear energy, said scientist SK Malhotra, department of atomic energy on Tuesday.

 “Distributing pamphlets, school bags and pens may help for a short time. But spreading knowledge will go a long way in convincing people. It is our duty to remove the fear among people and create a generation that will support and will lead the subsequent generations,” he said. The DAE scientist was in the city for the inauguration of the three-day science festival for students organised by   (Rosatom) and   Science and Technology Centre.
 
 He said the project saw a two-year delay and loss to the government due to protests that was a result of lack of proper communication with the locals by the authorities on the dangers and the safety of the plant. Appreciating the efforts taken by   in organising the science festival, he said NPCIL too should hold similar programmes.
 
 Mikhail Gorbatov, director, Russian Centre of Science and Culture said the kudankulam plant is one of the important part in the long-standing cooperation between India and Russia. “Rosatom is not only doing business here but also organizing activities to create public awareness to help people understand Russian technologies and its safety,” he said.
 
 A Tamil book on the basics of nuclear energy titled ‘Anukaru Arichuvadi’ was also released at the event. The three-day festival will have seminars by atomic energy experts, animation shows, science exhibition, quiz competition and games for school students.
