New Delhi: After the Ontario legislative assembly in Canada declared the 1984 anti-Sikh riots a “genocide”, the government responded strongly on Friday and said the motion was based on limited understanding of India.

 India has also taken up the issue with the Canadian government and conveyed its reservations to the political leadership.
 
 "We have noted the passage of a private member’s motion in the legislative assembly of Ontario on April 6. We reject this misguided motion which is based on a limited understanding of India, its Constitution, society, ethos, rule of law and the judicial process," MEA spokesperson Gopal Baglay said.
 
 According to reports, the motion was passed with 34 members voting in favour and just five against.
