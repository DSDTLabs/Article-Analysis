Ludhiana: With the present MC house coming to an end on September 20, Congress MLAs are gearing up for the upcoming MC elections. Congress MLA Surinder Dawar held a meeting with MC officials and Congress councillors in his constituency at B Zone office of department on Thursday. The MLA asked officials to expedite works of his constituency and ensure no Congress councillor or ticket aspirant is ignored.

 Sources said MLA Dawar was prompted to act after Congress MLAs Bharat Bhushan Ashu and Sanjay Talwar made efforts to get grants for their respective constituencies. Recently, Sidhu made announcements worth several crores for the city, in which most of the works were restricted to East and West constituencies which belonged to Talwar and Ashu. 
 
 An official said MLA Dawar has asked officials to float tenders to cover the drain from Transport Nagar to Shingaar Cinema at a cost of Rs 6 crore. He has also asked officials concerned to get road work in his constituency done as soon as possible. He visited two bridges where the ganda Nallah covering project is being done and asked officials to complete work as soon as possible.
