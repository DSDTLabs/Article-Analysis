PANAJI:   emerged victorious in 17 constituencies, making gains in eight constituencies and outdoing its 2012 tally. Its vote percentage, however, dropped to 28.4% this year as against 30.74% of 2012 when only nine of its candidates were elected. Though AAP failed to open its account in Goa, its candidates, put together, received 57,420 votes (6.3%). AAP had laid its thrust on Salcete, a Congress bastion. Its focus outside Salcete was on constituencies that traditionally belonged to Congress. AAP candidates managed to grab thousands of votes in these constituencies.

 Considering Congress did not have a tie-up with any party and contested 37 seats, its vote share ideally should have gone up. Besides AAP, the Congress candidates were pitted against NCP and other regional parties, such as Goa Vikas Party (GVP) and Go Suraj Party in Salcete, affecting its vote share.
