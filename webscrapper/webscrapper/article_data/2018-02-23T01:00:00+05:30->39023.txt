PATNA: The turnover of   (BSKGB) is expected to rise once the upcoming seven-storey building near Gandhi Maidan is ready by July next year, said its chief executive officer B N Prasad on Wednesday.

 In a bid to promote the khadi industry in Bihar, the state government in 2016 had sanctioned Rs24 crore for its new building behind the existing one, which is also being renovated. “The first three floors of the new building will be for sale of variety of khadi products like clothes, accessories, beauty herbal and edible items. We will also engage the grassroots people in making khadi products. There will also be training and manufacturing units in the building,” he said.
 
 Delhi-based firm has prepared the design of the new building. Prasad said the centre would impart training in raw material processing, washing and dyeing, designing, cutting and stitching to branding, marketing and packaging of khadi garments.
 
 He said the turnover of the existing showroom was around Rs2 crore in 2016-17 and it’s likely to increase three fold after the showroom opens in the new building.
