NAVI MUMBAI: Motorists were caught unaware in an   on the busy   (state highway 54), from Uran Phata to   intersection on Palm Beach Road, on Friday morning.

 The jam was caused due to ongoing gardening work on the road divider. 
 
 Vehicular flow returned to normalcy by 2pm when additional traffic cops were roped in for streamlining heavy vehicles plying towards JNPT. 
 
 The Uran-bound corridor was jammed for over 4 hours since 10am. The traffic cops had a tough task clearing the pile-up. This state highway has to bear the load of several thousands of multi-axial trailer containers plying to and from JNPT.
 
 “It was a horrible ride this morning on my way to JNPT. It took me over an hour to cross the jammed stretch,” said Ramesh Gharat, a Thane resident. 
 
 Traffic inspector of Nerul Anil Pawar told TOI that workers filling soil on the divider had blocked a portion of the Uran-bound carriageway, leadin to the snarl.
