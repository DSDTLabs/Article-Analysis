PANAJI: Minister for labour and employment   has requested the industry sector to provide Aadhaar-linked data of the employees working with various companies to enable the government to understand the severity of the unemployment situation in the state.

 The labour and employment ministry is trying to collect information on the precise employee requirement of industry in the state. They have been also trying to use data analytics to understand the existing unemployment scenario.
 
 Companies, however, have expressed apprehensions over handing over employee data to the government.
 
 “Only data will help us understand the unemployment scenario,”   said while addressing general managers and human resource managers at an industry conclave organized by his department.
 
 The meeting was followed by a panel discussion where industry leaders and academia expressed concerns about preferential employment to locals and having to share employee data with the state government.
 
 Khaunte maintained that the government remained serious about reducing unemployment in the state and in order to do that, data transparency was a vital requirement. “There has to be transparency between industry and the labour department. I appeal to companies to cooperate with the labour department and share the requested data, whether it is Aadhaar seeded data. If there’s an issue talk to us and we can sort it out,” he said.
 
 Khaunte said that if the state was easing regulations and implementing policies to facilitate industrial growth, the private sector had to reciprocate and create employment opportunities for locals.
 
 The minister said that the state government wanted to create a talent pool of Goans who could get gainful employment in the state. 
 
 “I am personally monitoring the situation. In the coming assembly session, the will be some announcement for employment in the budget speech,” Khaunte said.
