KOLKATA: With an aim to double the export in the next three years, the state has decided to showcase   as a hub for ready-made garments at the   ( ) to be held this month. 

 The initiative is a strategic effort to give a boost to this unorganized sector that contributed nearly 28% to 35% to the state export, but is now facing a major slump following demonetisation and implementation of GST.
 
 “Bengal is the leader in ready-made garments in the country. Metiabruz contributes to the bulk of these garments supplied across the city . We have made elaborate plans to facilitate traders there so that they can export their products to even foreign countries,” an official of the   department said.
 
 According to a source in the finance department, Bengal’s garments export turnover grew to Rs 53,649 crore in 2016-17 against Rs 47,857 crore in 2015-16 and is likely to cross the Rs 1lakh crore mark by 2020-21. “Due to GST and demonetisation three major sectors for export — leather, garments and jewellery — saw a huge setback and we have a fear that it might have an impact on the export market. We are trying to showcase the garments industry so that they can overcome the slump,” the official said.
 
 The industry directly and indirectly involves 2 crore people, with a financial involvement of more than Rs 10000 crore. “There are some big players who are mainly into export. Condition is pathetic for small and medium scale traders and manufacturers,” President of  , Samsuddin Mondal, said.
