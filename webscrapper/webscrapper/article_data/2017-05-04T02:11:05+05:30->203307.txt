Commuters can put their money in the allocated slot on the machine and either fill water in their own bottles or pay an additional Rs 1 to purchase a plastic container to fill the water.

We have two tanks attached to the machine where purified water is connected to the filter and then made available to commuters. The other tank contains water rejected after the RO process. In addition to that, we have also installed a chiller unit to supply cold water,” said Deepak Sahni, in-charge of the maintenance of the water   machines at Thane.
