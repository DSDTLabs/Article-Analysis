WASHINGTON: White House senior adviser  , US President  's son-in-law, is visiting Iraq with Marine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the US military's  , a senior Trump administration official said on Sunday.

 The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Kushner wanted to see Iraq for himself and to show support for the Iraqi government. The official was confirming a report by other media, including a tweet by a New York Times reporter.
 
 Kushner's West Wing portfolio is robust. He has been deeply involved with presidential staffing and has played the role of shadow diplomat, advising on relations with the Middle East, Canada and Mexico. Last week he launched a task force meant to modernize government using lessons drawn from the private sector.
 
 Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi met Trump for the first time on March 20 and said afterwards that he won assurances of greater US support in fighting   militants but cautioned that military might alone would not be sufficient.
 
 Trump took office on January 20, pledging a new strategy to defeat the hardline militant group that seized large swaths of Iraq and Syria in 2014.
 
 Before Trump took office, Iraqi forces recaptured a string of major cities from the group, shrank its finances and significantly stemmed the flow of foreign fighters, all with the support of US-led coalition air strikes and military advisers.
 
 Kushner is married to Trump's oldest daughter, Ivanka.
