New Delhi: The Enforcement Directorate on Thursday filed a charge sheet in a Delhi court against former Himachal Pradesh chief minister Virbhadra Singh and his wife Pratibha Singh in a money laundering case.

 The charge sheet, filed before Special Judge Santosh Snehi Mann, names six accused, including the former chief minister and his wife. The court has kept it for consideration on February 12.
 
 Besides 83-year-old Singh and his 62-year-old wife, the others named are Universal Apple Associate owner Chunni Lal Chauhan, Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) agent Anand Chauhan and co-accused Prem Raj and Lawan Kumar Roach.
 
 All have been chargesheeted under relevant provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).
 
 This is the second charge sheet against Anand Chauhan. The ED had earlier filed a charge sheet against him while it was probing the matter against other accused.
 
 In a status report regarding its ongoing probe, the ED claimed it recently recorded the statements of several witnesses and investigated bank transactions. 
 
 The court, which had earlier granted ED time to file its supplementary charge sheet in the case, had directed it to submit a status report after the agency on January 18 sought one more month to complete the probe.
 
 Anand Chauhan, arrested on July 9, 2016, by the ED under relevant provisions of the PMLA, was granted bail on January 2 in the money laundering case. In a separate case filed by the CBI in relation to the matter, Singh, his wife and Chauhan were chargesheeted along with others. PTI
