Thiruvananthapuram: A Dubai court has imposed a travel ban on Binoy Vinodini Kodiyeri, son of CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, following a cheating case filed by Dubai-based  . The ban order, issued on February 1, also wants Binoy to pay AED 10,00,000 (approx Rs 1.73 cr) to the company. He has also been advised to submit his passport for safe custody in the court.

 Interestingly, the CPM state secretariat and Balakrishnan himself had claimed earlier that Binoy had no cases against him in India or abroad. People close to Binoy had also produced a certificate purportedly from Dubai police saying there were no cases against him.
 
 Binoy’s brother Bineesh Kodiyeri later confirmed the travel ban reports. “Binoy is in Dubai to face the civil case and he has not run away. It is a fact that there is a case pertaining to settlement of Rs 1.72 crore; he is staying back in Dubai for a settlement through the court,” he said.
 
 However, he refuted reports that emigration authorities had detained Binoy at the airport. “Neither was his passport seized nor was he stopped at the airport. There is only a travel ban, which means he cannot travel outside Dubai till the case is settled,” he said.
