After the uninspired ' ' and 'Manasuku Nachindi'   and   are back with the 'comedy' '
 ' directed by  . This tale of a kleptomaniac that should by all means tickle one's funny bones just seems to drag from the first frame.

 Raju (Raj Tarun) is a kleptomaniac since birth and just cannot stop himself from stealing. He steals from his ex girlfriend Vennela (Pujita Ponnada), driving her away, and even steals from his own supermarket. He falls in love with Tanvi (Amyra Dastur) whose police father and grandfather (Nagineedu) despise thieves. Will he manage to find a solution for his disorder is what remains to be seen.
 
 The first half is cluttered with an inane storyline featuring unnecessary side plots of Dr Saima (Prudhvi Raj) trying to find a cure to Raju's kleptomania and winning a Nobel for it and even more insanely, a bunch of terrorists wanting to wreck Hyderabad and looking for their missing bomb unknowingly stolen by Raju. There's also a village drama featuring Anji ( ) and three mind numbingly subpar songs woven into the plot.
 
 'Rajugadu' is so far neither funny nor engaging. This reviewer does not hold out hope for the second half really!
