AGRA: Commuters in the city will soon be able to travel by electric buses. To boost clean and green transport, the directorate of urban transport is going to start the tendering process for buying 40 such buses very soon, which will operate on popular routes in the city. The plan has been prepared under the pan-city initiatives in urban mobility component of   project. Meanwhile, several Chinese companies have shown an interest and have approached the authorities to get the contract for supply of electric buses. The cost of these   are yet to be worked out, said officials.

  According to road transport department officials, in the first phase, 20 electric buses will be delivered to Agra City Transport Services Limited. These buses will run on a trail basis for three months and if the project is successful, the process to operate 20 more electric buses will begin. The central government will bear at least 50% cost of the project, said officials concerned.
  
 Director of state urban transport   said, “The electric bus service is very important for Agra as the entire city lies in eco-sensitive Taj Trapezium Zone. Soon, the proposal to purchase 40 electric buses for Agra will be prepared. Recently, electric bus services was started in Lucknow and Kanpur and the projects became a success.”
 
  Electric buses are battery driven, and these are charged at designated charging stations. Operating electric buses means zero emission, silent operation and better acceleration as compared to buses that run on fossil fuel. With energy consumption of 1.3 kWh/km, the cost of operation of these buses is also low, compared to CNG buses.
  
 The directorate of urban transport will finalise the routes and fare of these buses. The charging facility for buses will be provided at   (UPSRTC) workshops.
  
 At present, 150-odd CNG buses run on the city roads. Electric buses will further augment the green fleet.
