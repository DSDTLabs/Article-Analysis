HYDERABAD: With the start of  , the City of Pearls sees the establishment of night bazaar around the iconic  . This year, however, the surroundings have had a metamorphosis as laying down of bricks have been bit of a bane for businesses around the monument.

 
 There are various shops and hotels around Charminar, whose income and profits have been affected by renovation around the structure. The Charminar Pedestrian Project got delayed and despite the beginning of Ramzan set as a deadline, authorities have failed to meet the deadline, thus hitting business badly.
 
 “There has been a drastic fall in the number of customers. The machine that I use isn’t the one which can be moved at will and customers are not able to reach the stall, leading to a massive loss in business,” said  , a sugarcane juice vendor, who is unable to provide a three square meal to his family now.
 
 “We have recently started this business and thought that our earnings can shoot up during Ramzan. But since the work started here, our surplus have sunk and now we do not have enough budget to get the extra stock,” says  , owner of a Chinese fast food centre.
 
 The hawkers said Ramzan is the only time for them to make good income as after that they will be allotted a new location by the police.
 
 Meanwhile, the renovation around Charminar has been a boon for a few hotels and has definitely shot up the aesthetic value of the monument. “We have no problem with the renovation work. If we talk about profits and losses, the number of the customers at my hotel have increased. We used to close by 11pm or midnight and therefore, we did not have any sort of trouble with the construction work around,” said Syed Rafi, manager of   hotel.
 
 However, non-established or temporary businessmen have suffered losses. “Major work has been done and only few things are left. It will not affect the shops any more,” said a labourer.
