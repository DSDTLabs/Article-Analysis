BENGALURU: Bihar chief minister   on Wednesday said his state gets more   after he enforced prohibition, contrary to fears that the ban would negatively impact tourism.

 Nitish’s assertion in favour of prohibition rings a bell in poll-bound   as chief minister Siddaramaiah vehemently argued against  , recently in the legislative assembly, when a delegation of the   submitted a report supporting a liquor ban after visiting Bihar and opposition parties sought a government clarification.
 
 “Challenges notwithstanding, we dared to enforce the ban on alcohol in Bihar. People advised us against it, saying the move would result in a reduction in tourist footfall. But, our state gets more tourists now,” said Nitish.
 
 Nitish, also national president of Janata Dal (United), was here to address party workers ahead of the May 12 assembly elections and oversee the party’s poll preparedness. He told JD(U) workers the government has to bring in social reform while its prime duty is to provide good administration.
 
 “When people said prohibition would discourage tourists visiting the state, I retorted that tourists don’t come to drink booze and if that’s their intent, let them not come. Remember, Bihar is the land of great men like Gautam Buddha and Guru Gobind Singh,” he said.
 
 He recalled how he organised a human chain last year to create awareness about the evils of alcohol, in which over 4 crore people took part. He listed his development works and welfare schemes, including distribution of bicycles to girl students which resulted in more girls joining school and a sapling plantation drive to increase the green cover.
