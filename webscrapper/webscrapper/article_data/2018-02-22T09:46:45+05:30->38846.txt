MUMBAI: Mumbai City are right now like a train that has entered a very long tunnel, seeking that speck of light showing them the way out. However, The Islanders need far too many factors to fall their way for them to qualify for the playoffs. And one of the factors is simple, in theory at least. They need to follow up on Sunday’s triumph at ATK by winning all their remaining matches, and on Thursday, they face NorthEast United whom they beat in the first leg in Guwahati.

 
 Mumbai City have 20 points from 15 matches while the fourth-placed Jamshedpur have 26 points from 16. If Mumbai City win all their matches, their tally would rise to 29 points. But they will still need Jamshedpur and the fifth and sixth-placed duo of Kerala Blasters and Goa to lose all their remaining games for The Islanders’ ‘light at the end of their tunnel’ to become a reality.
 
 And as long as they mathematically remain in the race, Mumbai City coach Alexandre Guimaraes is looking ahead with optimism. “It’s good to be alive. We come here knowing that we have a chance and that we have to play better to try and win against a team which has played well but didn’t have the luck. I also hope we can win a game at home which for us, besides the importance to continue the fight, should be a good present for our fans.”
 
 The Costa Rican was referring to the alarming fact that his side have lost their last four games at the Mumbai Football Arena. Their last home win came 54 days ago when they thrashed a sorry Delhi Dynamos 4-0.
 
  lie bottom of the league with nothing left to play for. Assistant coach Elco Schattorie put that feeling into proper perspective in his pre-match press briefing. “It’s difficult to prepare for a game where we cannot qualify. It is difficult to motivate the boys,” he said.
