IDUKKI: The state government and district administration had announced several steps to improve the tourism infrastructure in the Munnar in anticipation of mass-flowering of   (Strobilanthes kunthianus). But they have been realised only partially. Lack of toilet facility is one of the main issues at Munnar. Every week, thousands of tourists reach the hill station town. Parking of vehicles is also an issue. Though the district administration had decided to arrange parking facility near the PWD office, this is yet to be realised.

 The one-way traffic system and facilities to offer drinking water and medical aid for tourists have also not been implemented.
 
 The mass-flowering of Neelakurinji is likely to begin on July first week and last next three months.
 
 Over eight lakh visitors are expected to visit Munnar during the season. But there is no proper facility to handle the huge tourist inflow. Narrow roads and insufficient parking space are the main problems faced by Munnar.
 
 Eravikulam national park is the main Neelakurinji flowering area and presently 2,750 tourists per day are allowed. The authorities will allow an additional 40% visitors during the flowering season.
 
 This means that only 4,000 tourists will get a chance to watch the flowers daily, said a Munnar native Saju Joseph, adding that many will have to return disappointed. The denial of entry could result in a law and order situation, he said.
 
  secretary Jayan P Vijayan said they expect to complete the construction of a budget hotel, amenity centre, botanical garden and multi-level car parking system before the flowering season.
 
 The Eravikulam national park officials have decided to extend the ban on visitors till April 24. Normally, the park is closed from February to April 1 in view of the calving season of the Nilgiri tahrs. This is after forest officials spotted many pregnant tahrs inside the park.
