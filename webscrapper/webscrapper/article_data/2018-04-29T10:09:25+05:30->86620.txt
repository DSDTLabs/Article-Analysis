Actress  , who shot to fame with the movie ' ' as a child artist in the role of the young  , was in Lucknow, recently. The 14 year-old-actress,for whom it was her second visit to the city, says that Lucknow reminds her of the rich culture that the country beholds. "Lucknow is a beautiful city and I really love it. From the cleanliness to the mesmerising sculptures, all of it is beautiful. I have been to the   and Chhota Imambara, and I was in awe of the monuments.I loved   the most," she said.
Being a complete foodie, Suhani also tried her hands at the famous Lakhnawi khana. "Food was the first thing which I tried here when I came here last time. The tempting biryani and chicken were my favourite. I have had people in Mumbai praising Lakhnawi food, so that is why I wanted to get a firsthand experience also."
 Sharing her experience of working with the perfectionist   and her journey in Bollywood, the actress said, "One would always like to work with a person who is a good actor but when you get to work with a person who is a perfectionist, then I think you don’t need anything more. In each step of my acting, Aamir sir guided me, explained me the do’s and don’ts and supported me a lot. There were some scenes in the film where I had lost all hope of getting them right but Aamir sir never gave up on me and had faith in me. That was something which made him a great mentor. I was really nervous about working with him in the beginning, but eventually everything went off well."
 Struggling to strike a balance between work and studies, the young actress said, "Right now I am not working in any movie as I am concentrating on my studies. When I was shooting for 'Dangal', I was in class VI, at that time I took leave of six months but right now I am in class IX and want to focus on my studies. However, if something really interesting and irresistible comes my way, then I will think about it, but nothing of that sort has happened so far."
