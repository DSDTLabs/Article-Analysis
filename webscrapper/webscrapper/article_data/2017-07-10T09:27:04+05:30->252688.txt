BHUBANESWAR: The   on Sunday scanned   to identify the police officer who had allegedly molested women at   during Sandhya Darshan of the deities on July 2, a day before the 'return chariot' festival (Bahuda Yatra). 

 "We have received CCTV footage of the Gundicha Temple from the  . We are verifying the allegations," said an officer, but refusing to divulge any details.
 
 A medical student had alleged on her Facebook page that police had misbehaved with women at Gundicha Temple. The girl had written that she had slapped a policeman for molesting women near the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. Her allegation had triggered a massive public outcry, prompting DGP K B Singh to direct Puri Police to immediately lodge an FIR. 
 
 Police said it would be difficult for them to find out the identity of the molester as the sanctum sanctorum and the hall facing it (where devotees had gathered in large numbers) had no CCTV cameras. Puri SP Sarthak Sarangi had earlier said they were yet to identify the cop in question as the name mentioned by the girl was incorrect. 
 
 The temple administration also handed over CCTV footage to police to verify allegations that an inspector had touched the idol of goddess Subhadra during the Pahandi procession outside Jagannath Temple on July 6. "Our chief administrator Pradeep Kumar Jena had asked the inspector general (central range), Soumendra Priyadarshi, to probe the matter," the temple's public relations officer Laxmidhar Pujapanda said.
 
 The Orissa high court in 2014 had prohibited pilgrims from climbing the chariots and touching the deities during Rath Yatra. Only servitors on duty are entitled to mount the chariots.
 
 "We were always criticized for allowing our guests to touch the deities. Why is the government silent when a police inspector violates the high court order?" asked servitor Binayak Dasmohapatra.
