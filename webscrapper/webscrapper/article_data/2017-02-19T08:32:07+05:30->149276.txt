PANAJI: Goa government employees association has advised political parties to immediately stop making irresponsible statements on the issue of voting rights exercised by government employees, who were appointed for polling duty on February 4, and have been given the opportunity to cast their votes through ballot papers. The association took offence to political parties stating that “all government employees are corrupt and selling their votes”.

 The association has requested the   to issue instructions to such political parties to stop making the irresponsible statements. “Political parties haven’t paid heed to the pain and hardship government servants undergo in fulfilling their constitutional obligations. Ever since the elections are declared and code of conduct is enforced, many government employees, who were on election duty, hardly enjoyed any holidays or had sufficient time to rest and discuss important matters with their families,” a statement by the association said. 
 
 President of the association John   has welcomed the special camp organised by the election commission and district election officers to facilitate their voting through postal ballots, by making arrangements of gazetted officers and identifying officers.
 
 “Government employees in Goa are by and large honest, sincere and non-corrupt. Political parties should note that making blanket generalized statements, that all government servants are corrupt and will sell their votes or succumb to pressure, are demoralizing and will provoke the peace-loving, sincere and hardworking government employees to unite and revolt. There may be isolated cases and if there are, people can file appropriate complaints before concerned authorities instead of making such statements,” the statement said.
