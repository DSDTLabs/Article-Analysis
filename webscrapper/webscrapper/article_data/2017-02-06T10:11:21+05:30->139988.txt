 "In cybercrime, it is very important to identify, seize and preserve digital data. Besides creating a pool of cybercrime experts, all police personnel will undergo basic training in digital data analysis," Sahay added.
 
 More than 2,000 police personnel are already undergoing training in dealing with cyber threats and internet-based crime. Moreover, some 8,000 personnel are being trained in basic computer operations
 
 Assam Police's ambitious plan of setting up at least seven Cyber Investigation Labs (CILs) in seven police ranges across the state has also begun taking shape. 
 
 "A work order has been placed against two CILs," said the DGP. He informed that the CILs will be set up in Tezpur, Diphu, Silchar, Bongaigaon, Kokrajhar, Jorhat and Guwahati.
 
 Currently, the lone 'state-of-the-art' cyber crime cell is under the CID.
