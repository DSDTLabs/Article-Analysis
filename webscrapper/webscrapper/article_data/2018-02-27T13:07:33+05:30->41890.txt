Trichy: A six-member team deputed by   (SBM) arrived here on Monday to embark on its much-touted national cleanliness survey, Swachh Survekshan 2018, which would rank the city’s progress in urban sanitation in the last one year. 

 According to sources, verification of documents made available by the civic body detailing the implementation of cleanliness and sanitation projects was carried out on the first day of the three-day survey. An agency named   was commissioned by the   (MoHUA) to conduct the survey this year. District corporation officials were upbeat that the city would bag a good ranking this year, possibly among the top three. 
 
 In Swachh Survekshan 2017, which was held in more than 400 cities in the country, Trichy was ranked sixth in the survey conducted by   (QCI). In August 2017, MoHUA had come up with a timeline for preparing, participating and evaluating Swachh Survekshan 2018 and increased the number of participating cities from 434 in last year’s survey to 500.
 
 An official of the corporation, who said that they had started preparing for the ‘D-day’ since August last year, said that six members from the agency split into three teams – two in each – to cover the operations including document verification, field inspection and citizen feedback.
