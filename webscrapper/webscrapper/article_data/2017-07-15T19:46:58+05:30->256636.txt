NEW DELHI: A man was allegedly stopped from entering Kolkata's Quest Mall on Saturday for wearing a 'dhoti'.

 The man was wearing a traditional Indian dress, a dhoti, and was "respectably dressed", according to his friend,  , who was with him when the incident took place.
 
 "Yet another incident. After a series of restaurants it's now a mall refusing entry to someone. A man wearing a dhoti and kurta was not allowed to enter Quest Mall in Kolkata today. Apparently wearing dhoti or lungi isn't allowed in this particular mall anymore," Debleena, a Kolkata-based actor, wrote in a Facebook post.
 
 
 
 
 She added that "this form of racial profiling has induced in our society so much that it's disgusting."
 
 
 
 "The guards outside (the mall) stopped him and confirmed with someone over the Walky-talky and then let him enter only because the man in question argued in "English". When inside we approached the management team there and the man clearly stated that they don't allow people wearing dhoti and lungi to enter," Sen wrote.
 
 
 
  
  She further said, "...more when the manager of the place (some woman) came in and sat down to talk asked me strictly that I cannot video record anything even though I clearly have the right to record anything in a public space. That's when we decided it's best to leave the place to rot..... I will not keep quiet anymore and will question the authority!"
  
  In a similar incident which took place last month, a northeast woman was denied entry in   because she was wearing a jainsem, a traditional Khasi dress.
