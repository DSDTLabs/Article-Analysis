MARGAO: Power minister   on Saturday said that his department’s infrastructure has not been maintained since the time   MLA Digambar   held the portfolio . 

 The minister was speaking after inaugurating a 10 MVA transformer at Navelim, which replaced the 6.3 MVA one put in place by Kamat in 2006. The new transformer will solve the outage problem faced by   residents, Madkaikar said, going on to praise Kamat and   Luizinho Faleiro for approaching him with their grievances instead of resorting to rasta roko threats as done by Congress Cuncolim MLA Clafasio Dias for “political mileage”. 
 
 Works worth Rs 24 crore have commenced in Fatorda, Madkaikar added.
