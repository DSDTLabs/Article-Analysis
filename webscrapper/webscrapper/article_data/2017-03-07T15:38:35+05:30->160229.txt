PANAJI: The inclusion of the 10.7-km road from   to   junction in the list of new national highways proposed by the public works department (PWD) drew protests from some members at a gram sabha of   panchayat on Sunday.

 The meeting chaired by Neura sarpanch Sunita Naik discussed the issue of the proposed new highway, as a member pointed out that if PWD goes ahead with the proposal, several houses and trees would have to be axed for the required broadening of the road, as per norms followed by highways authority. 
 
 A member said that “the trees help store water and felling of large number of trees would impact the local environment”. When the issue of broadening the existing Pilar-Old Goa road had surfaced in 2009, members had opposed the project, as it had proposed to widen the road to 25m. The members were against any widening of the road, as scores of compound walls, wells, places of worship and other structures would have to be demolished to pave way for the road. The Pilar-Old Goa road links NH 17 and NH 4A (Panaji-Belagavi). 
 
 The sarpanch explained that PWD minister, Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’  , had assured that no houses would be demolished if the project is taken up. But, villagers said that they would launch an agitation and stop traffic on this route if they were bypassed by the government.
