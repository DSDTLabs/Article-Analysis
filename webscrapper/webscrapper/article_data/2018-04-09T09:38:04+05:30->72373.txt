It was averred that Vermani was not entitled to any refund as both the articles were duly served on the addressee.
 
 DHL authorities in their reply denied that any shipment was booked by the complainant with it or that any consideration was accepted by it. It has been averred that the complainant has no privities of contract with it.
 
 Forum after hearing both sides stated that it is clear that there is no evidence that the documents in question were delivered to Vermaniâ€™s son within the reasonable time period on two occasions.
 
 It was for post office and DHL to ensure the delivery of transcripts in question to the son of the complainant in time which they failed to do. This negligence on the part of post office and DHL certainly forced the complainant to spend three times for the same purpose and of course he (in India) and his son (in a foreign land) had to undergo stress and mental harassment. They were then directed to pay up.
