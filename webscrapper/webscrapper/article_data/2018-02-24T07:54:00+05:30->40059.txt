An official said that out of 92 students, 90 students had meal together after counselling. Two students complained of stomachache and refused to eat.
 
 Deputy superintendent of police  , who is investigating into the matter, said, “We have already registered a criminal case against the school management. Our investigation is moving in the right direction.” 
 
 Kullu deputy commissioner   said a task force has been formed to deal with caste related problems in government schools in the district. “Such practice will not be allowed at any cost. The team has been asked to pay surprise visits at schools and check caste related discrimination,” he said.
