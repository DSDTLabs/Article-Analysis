CHANDIGARH: Anxiety is running high as students are going to take the NEET test on May 6. In order to perform well in the exam, experts have advised to read up the list of prohibited items to avoid undue harassment, besides concentrating on revision.

 
 
 
 For last-minute preparation, focus only on NCERT books of class XI and XII and during the exam, analyse each option well before selecting an answer.
 
 According to Biology expert Dr  , at this stage, students should go through everything especially diagrams, names, dates etc. "Biology needs repetition, so do revise the examples of morphology, anatomy and kingdoms on the last day. Though the Biology section is based mostly on NCERT books, the questions require analytic abilities and it is easy to make the wrong choice if all the options are not read and analysed carefully. Even if the question seems basic, read them all carefully and go through all the options before marking the choice.
 
 Experts suggested that during the exam, students would have about 1 hr and 10 minutes left for the Physics section, so they must speed themselves accordingly. "Analysing previous years' papers, half of the section is covered by mechanics, magnetism, current, electrodynamics, heat and thermodynamics, ray and wave optics. Students must revise topics/formulas of semiconductors, wave optics and thermodynamics. Generally, questions from modern physics, semiconductor, current, thermodynamics and waves are easy and scoring," said physics expert Kunal.
