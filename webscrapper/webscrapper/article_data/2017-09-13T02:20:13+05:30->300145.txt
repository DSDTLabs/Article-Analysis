NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Tuesday gave its nod to   to declare the results for the president’s post in the Delhi University Students Union (DUSU) polls once the counting of votes is over.

 Justice   allowed the plea of DU seeking to modify its September 8 interim order by which it had allowed NSUI presidential candidate   to contest the election but directed the varsity not to declare the results for the post of the president.
 
 High court’s relief for DU came after it informed that the counting system is different and a partial counting of votes excluding that of the president is not possible, as the polls were being conducted through electronic voting machine which consists of a single control unit.
 
 Justice Kaur, however, made it clear that election outcome will be subject to its final decision in the matter where Tuseed has challenged the University Election Commission’s order rejecting his nomination.
 
 “The result for the post of the president will be declared as per schedule. The outcome of the election result will be subject to the outcome of this main petition,” HC observed.
 
 After Tuseed did not oppose the plea of DU to declare the results, HC modified its order giving the go ahead. HC has kept for September 28, Tuseed’ main petition challenging the rejection of his nomination on grounds of disciplinary action.
