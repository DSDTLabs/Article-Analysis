MUMBAI: With   Chhota Rajan lodged in jail, his close confidante,   alias  , has been shifting his loyalty to different bosses, depending on his needs.

 In 2015, when the crime branch arrested a gang of eight who were allegedly planning to bump off film producer  , actor   along with Karim Morani and Farah Khan, the police found Bachkana that had hatched the plan on behalf of gangster Ravi Pujari.
 
 Now, while probing a conspiracy to kill Rajkot businessman Asfaq Khatri, allegedly hatched by Anees Ibrahim, it has come to light that Bachkanahad realigned with Anees and hatched the conspiracy to kill Khatri.
 
 Bachkana, lodged in Mysore jail since 2005 in murder cases, had allegedly taken contract money to kill Khatri through Ramdas Rahane, a former aide of Anees. Rahane has been arrested with seven others including two women in a joint operation by the anti-extortion cell and the Rajkot police.
 
 A senior police officer said Bachkana had accepted Rs 20 lakh. “He is in financial trouble with the liability to get his kids married. In 2015 he tied up with rival Chhota Shakeel and borrowed a big amount to marry off his daughter,“ said the officer.
