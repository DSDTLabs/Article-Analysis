CHENNAI: The   has cancelled the   granted to a man who had got his daughter married though she was a minor. In August last year, Justice   granted anticipatory bail to him after he submitted that only the betrothal of his daughter had been completed by the time   volunteers stepped in, and that marriage had been called off.

 However, now the volunteers have brought to the notice of the court the fact that the man had actually married off his daughter, and the girl’s marriage had been consummated.
 
 The court then ordered verification of the claims, and asked for medical examination of the girl.
 
 After the medical report confirmed that the girl was in a physical relationship, the judge said: “The medical report states that there was physical relationship with the victim-girl. Only on the ground that the betrothal, which had been arranged, was cancelled, and that no marriage was performed, that this court granted anticipatory bail to the accused.”
 
 Justice Vaidyanathan further said: “The complainant has now sought for cancellation of anticipatory bail, and it now appears from the pleading that the marriage itself has taken place and that there was physical relationship.”
 
 Referring to a statement by the girl’s mother, the judge said: “There appears to be marriage and that physical relationship after marriage has also been complained of, more particularly, in the light of the statement made by the mother of the girl, coupled with the fact that the medical records have also been produced to substantiate the same.”
 
 He then cancelled the anticipatory bail, exposing the man to the danger of getting arrested, if police choose to do so.
