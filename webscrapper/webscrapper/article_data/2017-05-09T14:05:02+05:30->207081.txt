PANAJI: Goa Common Entrance Test (GCET) will be answered by 5,116 students on Tuesday and Wednesday. This year, the examination is being held for admissions to degree programmes in engineering, pharmacy, nursing and allied health courses. Students will answer the exam starting May 9 across 15 centres in Goa.

 The numbers of those answering GCET has come down by around 400 in 2017, as aspirants of medicine, dentistry, homeopathy and ayurveda courses had to answer the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) for admissions this year onwards.
 
 “Still the number of those answering GCET has not come down much. Some students who are not confident of cracking NEET are answering both the national and the state tests. If they do not get a homeopathy or ayurveda seat, they can opt for an allied health programme in Goa,” said a state official.
 
 Principals and professors from the engineering, pharmacy and other professional colleges will act as supervisors for GCET.
 
 The test will cover the subjects of physics, chemistry, maths and biology based on Class XII syllabus of the   of  . Each paper will consist of 75 objective questions carrying one mark each. The examination for each subject will be of two-hour duration. Unlike NEET, there is no negative marking in GCET.
 
 Goa has 1,230 engineering course seats on offer across five colleges, 120 pharmacy programme seats available at two institutes, 100 seats in nursing and 20 each in five allied health sciences like physiotherapy, which will be filled through GCET.
