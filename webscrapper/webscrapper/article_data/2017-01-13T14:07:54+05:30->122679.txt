INDORE: After the protest against shifting of district court to agriculture college land, the college’s parent university   has announced that they will take legal action against the court authorities and the administration for their right over the land.

 Addressing the media on Thursday, vice chancellor of the   Anil Kumar Singh said that the construction of district court on the college land will be protested.
 
 “We will take all legal measures to stop the construction of the court building at the land which has been declared as the most fertile land in the Malwa region,” said Singh.
 
 He said that the land in question has been used for conducting many long-term experiments on a wide range of issues related to agriculture. “The area which has been proposed for building court is also used for production of many important crop seeds which are then sold to the farmers. The sale of these seeds will also be affected,” Singh added.
 
 The college authorities claimed that the land did not belong to the government and that its ownership was changed by the administration through a conspiracy.
 
 “Earlier in 1998, the administration had taken 22-acre of the college land for constructing roads and had also paid us compensation. If the administration paid compensation, it is evident that the land did not belong to them. Then suddenly after 18 years, how did the ownership of the same land on other side of the road change to government land?”  , dean of the Indore agriculture college said.
