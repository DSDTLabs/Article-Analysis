Trichy: The Veterinary University Training and Research Centre in Trichy has been witnessing the sale of quail eggs for the past two weeks as part of an awareness drive and popularisation of its health benefits. The eggs were laid by around 700 Namakkal Gold Japanese quails raised there for a research project.

 According to assistant professor Dr K Shibi Thomas, who conducted the research, though the average weight of a quail egg was only around 10 to 12 grams, they still possessed great nutritional value. “Quail eggs are packed with enough vitamins and minerals and their nutritional value is in fact three to four times greater than chicken eggs,” she claimed. The eggs served as good sources of protein, fat, vitamin E, minerals (nitrogen, iron and zinc) and sex hormone - P. She said that besides being a natural combatant of digestive disorders, quail eggs helped prevent several diseases though consumption should be moderate. “A person can consume two quail eggs a day,” Shibi said.
 
 On the other hand, professor and head of Veterinary University Training and Research Centre, Trichy, Dr P N Richard Jagatheesan said that awareness about quail eggs and its benefits was low in the city. “A quail egg, on an average, costs only Rs 2 and its small size means children would like it,” he said.
 
 Jagatheesan also claimed that one of the main reasons to conduct the awareness programme was to encourage people to consider quail for poultry farming. “Unlike many other birds, quail is very disease-resistant and hence don’t even need to be vaccinated,” he added. The research project was aimed at identifying the right energy and lysine requirement for quails by feeding it various levels of amino acids.
