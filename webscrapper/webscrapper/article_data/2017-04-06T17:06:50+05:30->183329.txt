NEW DELHI: After   MPs were earlier today heard shouting in Parliament that they "won't let airlines fly from Mumbai,"   has asked for increased security at all airports in Maharashtra, airline sources told ANI.

 Earlier today, there was uproar in the   after Union aviation minister Asok   implied that he has no interest in lifting the ban on 
  , who's been accused of slapping a senior Air India staffer.
 
 After the Lok Sabha was adjourned, due to the uproar, home minister Rajnath Singh said the aviation minister and the Shiv Sena MPs will look for an "amicable resolution" to the ban issue. This has led to speculation that the airlines may revoke their ban on Gaikwad.
 
 Following the slapping incident March 23, all domestic airlines put Gaikwad on a 
  , essentially banning him as a passenger on all their flights.
 
 Gaikwad has refused to apologize. Even today, Gaikwad apologised to Parliament, but pointedly refused to apologise to the Air India official.
 
 "I apologise to Parliament if I've caused any hurt, but not to the Air India official," Gaikwad said.
 
 After his brief, unrepentant speech, when Gaikwad's Sena colleagues arose to demand the airlines' ban on him be lifted, the Union aviation minister implied he was disinclined to act on the MP's behalf.
 
 "Aircraft are machines where people fly and safety will not be compromised," Gajapati Raju said, implying that Gaikwad's actions compromised passengers' safety.
 
 Gaikwad insisted today that " 
  started it."
 
 "The AI staff abused me and pulled me by my collar. The AI staff who misbehaved with me is roaming scot free. But here I am with curbs from all airlines," he said to the House.
 
 In his first statement in Parliament after the incident, Gaikwad said, "What wrong have I done that there is a trial against me in media without a through probe?"
 
 "I have been charged under IPC 308, which is for 'attempt to murder'. Was I holding any weapon? Is this justice," he added.
