NEW DELHI: Before municipal elections, students in the city will learn the value of casting ballots in elections.   (SEC) has decided to utilise the morning prayer assemblies to impart the importance of participating in political processes on students. The students would be asked to motivate their parents to vote during the municipal elections.

 State election commissioner   said: “I am writing letters to private and government schools to use the morning prayer assemblies for the purpose.” 
 
 Srivastava believes that sending a message on the value of votes to eligible voters through their children is an effective step.
 
 Municipal elections in past have witnessed below expectation voters’ turnout because of indifference towards the political process.
 
  An SEC official said many eligible voters believe their votes are futile. “They think one vote cannot make a difference. But more the people vote, stronger the democracy becomes,” he said.
 
 Morning prayer assembly, Srivastava said, is the best time to make an impression on students’ as they take things spoken in the assembly very seriously. 
 
 However SEC’s innovative plans to increase voters’ turnout goes beyond morning prayer assemblies. 
 
 “We will also hold essay competition on the value of polled votes, importance of democracy and other similar subjects. We want to rope in celebrities from sports and other fields to motivate voters,” he told TOI. 
 
 The SEC wants to start the exercise as soon as possible, so that the children are ready before the municipal  .
