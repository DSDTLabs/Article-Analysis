Filmmaker   is back with the ninth season of ' ', and much like other seasons, this year too, the makers are trying to rope in a great set of contestants. After TV actor  , comedienne   and husband  , it’s actress  , the ‘balika vadhu’ of Indian television, who has been finalised for the show. “I was approached earlier for other seasons as well, but due to prior commitments like my show ' ' and some southern projects, I couldn’t be a part of it. This year it was practical and possible, so I immediately gave a nod,” she said.
 Looks like Avika is all set to get into action mode. “I am an adventure junkie, but honestly, even if a person is adventurous, there is something or the other that he or she is scared of and in 'Khatron Ke Khiladi' there is no mercy. I have always been the youngest and the most pampered on the sets. Here it’s a competition, this show will be a challenge for me,” she told us.
 
  
  
 The actress is quite thrilled and believes the show will be a huge test for her physical and mental strength. “I have no phobias as such, just a little scared of creepy crawly creatures, they aren’t cute at all. This show will be a test of my strengths. I am going with a lot of hopes. I will face all my fears with complete control, focus and confidence,” she said.
 While Avika made her debut at   last year, she told us about this year’s cancelled Cannes plan. “We were supposed to go this year as well, my hotel and flight reservations were done. I was supposed to attend a press conference and walk the red carpet as I was one of the invitees to a friend’s screening. Four-five of us were supposed to go, but one of them cancelled and everybody else did after that. I was very sad because we couldn’t go. But I am sure next year I will be there,” she said, adding, “There are so many pretty faces from India this time. My heart melted when I saw a picture of Aishwarya (Rai Bachchan) kissing her daughter.”
