BENGALURU: The   (KEA) has announced a   each in   in the   (CET) 2017. There were errors in the options provided for answers to a question in each of the two subjects. Students, though, are asking for more, claiming more   

  The KEA has uploaded on its website th e provisional answer key along with the master question papers for physics, chemistry, biology and mathematics. In the physics paper, the question on finding the density of a substance with a mass of 49.53 grams occupying 1.5 cubic centimetres of volume was found to have an error. The options given to candidates were 3.30, 3.300, 3.3 and 3.302. But the answer is 33.02, which means none of the options was correct. 
 
  The chemistry paper had a question on Cannizzaro's reaction being an example of auto oxidation. Of the four options, two were right. This means students would get a mark even if they had chosen the wrong option for the answer, given tha t there wasn't any one correct option provided. 
 
  However, students pointed out mistakes in more questions. "There were two more questions in the chemistry paper which were wrong. I hope they include those as well during evaluation," said Yashini Agarwal (name changed). Another student, Karan M, added, "Another question in physics was very ambiguous. I checked with my teachers as well, and they were of the same opinion." 
 
  KEA executive director Manjunath K S said, "Students can go through the provisional answer key and if there are more incorrect questions, they can file objections on the website itself ." 
 
  Students can file objections online till May 10. They must mention the subject and question number of the master question paper along with justification and email to keauthorityka@nic.in (email should be titled CET 2017 - Objection - Chemistry/Physics) on or before 5.30pm on May 10.
