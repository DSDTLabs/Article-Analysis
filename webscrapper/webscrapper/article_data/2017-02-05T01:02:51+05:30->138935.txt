JAIPUR: The   (RU) may rewrite its history textbooks. BJP MLA from Jaipur’s Kishanpole constituency, Mohanlal Gupta, has proposed to amend the historical event ‘Battle of Haldighati’ by declaring that the 1576 war was won by   against the popular view of historians who say   forces defeated the former.

 Gupta, a government nominee in the RU syndicate, proposed this change at the syndicate meeting for revising history syllabus on Saturday. He has also proposed the addition of four chapters, including one on Cultural Nationalism by Swami Vivekanand. “Distorted version of history is being taught in the textbooks. The time has come to make the correction to teach the right history to this generation and thereafter,” Gupta told TOI. KG Sharma, head of RU’s history department, who himself has done a research on this, says that the battle between   & Akbar was ‘drawn’.
 
 RU V-C Rajeshwar Singh has referred the suggestions to the history board of studies for consideration. “The BOS will examine the proposal of the MLA and then submit its findings to the academic council for approval.”
 
 The BJP government has already amended some history chapters in school books. A year ago, the school education department had eliminated the suffix ‘Great’ from Akbar’s name. It had also downsized content of many Muslim rulers.
