MUMBAI: The state government on Thursday finalised a Rs 2,500 crore agreement with Larsen & Toubro (L&T) for construction of a 210-metre tall  , pegged as world’s tallest statue, off the Mumbai coast. The firm has to complete the project in 36 months.

 
  
 
 For almost a year, the government has been negotiating the cost with L&T, which emerged as the lowest bidder in April 2017, as it had quoted Rs 3,826 crore—60% over the state’s estimate of Rs 2,300 crore. The firm finally agreed to bring down the cost to Rs 2,500 crore plus taxes.
 
 After giving the letter of acceptance to L&T directors, CM   said, “It’s a historic day. This project was envisaged several years. This government has got all the permissions and with the same speed the project will be completed.”
 
 Officials say movement of machinery is likely to begin soon, while the is likely to begin after monsoon as L&T will take a couple of months to finalise the design.
