 Arvind Rana, a government school teacher and president, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Teachers Welfare Association, said, “The only reason was the fear of storm. News of closing of private schools in Chandigarh and schools in Haryana stopped children from coming to school.”
 
 Swarn Singh Kamboj, another teacher and president,  , said, “Schools closed at 12 noon and many parents were not aware about this, which created a little trouble. As there was a storm in the night and a forecast was made for Tuesday, parents decided not to send children to schools.” Rana said there was a need for education department to start an online service in which parents can be informed over phone about emergency situations.
