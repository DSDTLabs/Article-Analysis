 Donya Fiorentino, the third of Oldman's five wives, said during their marriage, the actor "yelled at me constantly, ruined my life and stole my children".
 
  
  
 Breaking a vow of silence, the former model said she wants the world and her children to know the reality about Oldman. "He stole my children and ruined my life. The truth needs to be told. I would like Gary to stand up and take responsibility for his actions. Will he? Who knows? He has always denied everything," she said.
 
 The #MeToo movement sweeping Hollywood emboldened Fiorentino to speak up. "He is a great actor. Was he a great husband? No. Our marriage was a giant car crash in which demented things happened. I lost my self-esteem, I was broken."
 
 "I've been empowered by hearing other women speak up. When a woman gets her voice back, she gets her power back," she said, adding that "I would rather get eaten by a great white shark than go through that marriage again".
 
 "I have $20 in my purse. I've got nothing else he can take from me. I'm not speaking out to hurt Gary. In fact, I wish him well. He's a brilliant actor and he fully deserves his Oscar. But when you are nominated for an Academy Award you have to be held to a higher standard."
 
 Since his divorce with Fiorentino, Oldman has become one of Britain's most successful exports to Hollywood, starring as   in   and in blockbusters such as   and  .
