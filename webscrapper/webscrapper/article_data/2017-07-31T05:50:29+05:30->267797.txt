LUCKNOW: Promising to bring Uttar Pradesh out of the   category on the lines of other BJP ruled states   and  , party president   claimed his was the only party that was truly democratic.

 Addressing intellectuals at the Scientific Convention Centre in Lucknow on Sunday evening, Shah hit out at policies of the previous Congress government which, he said, ignored the interests of the poor even while remaining in power for over 70 years. 
 
 “In 70 years, the poor could not get LPG connections nor could fulfil the basic requirement of toilet, but Modi government ensured LPG connection to poor through Ujjwala scheme and got 4.5 crore toilets built in just three years,” said Shah. 
 
 He went on to say that it was the internal democracy in the party, that made it possible for a tea-seller to become the Prime Minister or a simple worker who used to paste posters on building to become its national president, referring to Modi and himself and assured there would be no damage to the democratic system of the country. 
 
 Making mockery of the functioning of Congress and other parties, Shah asked the gathering to guess who would be president of the Congress after Sonia Gandhi. On hearing the name of Rahul Gandhi in chorus, he asked everyone to guess who would be the next national president of the BJP. When there was no reply, Shah said this was an example of how democratic the BJP was compared to other parties that were confined to family members. 
 
 “The journey from the Bharatiya Jan Sangh to the Bharatiya Janata Party is based on ‘Antyodya, ekatm manav-vaad’ (welfare of the weakest and humanity) and cultural nationalism,” he said, adding that while Congress wanted to build a new India, the BJS and BJP want India to renovate its cultural heritage with timely changes. 
 
 Chief minister Aditya Nath  , Deputy CMs Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dr Dinesh Sharma, BJP’s UP in charge Om Mathur, city president Mukesh Sharma, national general secretary Anil Jain, national co-organisation secretary Shiv Prakash and Noida MLA   were also present at the meeting.
