HYDERABAD: TJS leader   said that a party membership drive would commence from Monday.

 
 At the event on Sunday, he declared that TJS would move forward with democratic principles of BR Ambedkar as its foundation, and social justice as its pillars. People should realise that the state which was achieved after so many sacrifices were made by students, unemployed, farmers, women and every section of society, should not become the ‘jagir’ (property) of one leader or or a single family. It is the duty of every citizen to ensure that such ruling parties which are interested in filling up their own pockets are ousted from the power, he said.
 
 Prof Haragopal, who participated as a guest speaker, said people need to think whether they are being allowed by this government to express their dissent and vote. Former MLC Dileep Kumar, TJS leaders Vidyadhar reddy, venkat Reddy, Rachna Reddy, Mallanna, and   among others spoke.
 
 A huge stage was set at the event on which 1,000 people were accommodated comprising representatives from all sections including students, unemployed, contract employees, women, farmers, family members of statehood agitation martyrs, family members of farmers who committed suicide, victims of   sand mafia and police torture, handcuffed farmers among others.
