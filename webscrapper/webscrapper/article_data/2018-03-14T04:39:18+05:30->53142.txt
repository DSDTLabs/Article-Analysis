Navi Mumbai: Chief minister   has, on Tuesday, agreed to approve Cidco’s comprehensive proposal to waive off all charges like transfer, mortgage, change of use, besides NOC. 

 He has also given a green signal to extend the lease term of property to 99 years as against the existing 60 years leasehold for the land in   area after payment of one time premium to   during the renewal stage.
 
 The CM has consented to reduce the premium amount mentioned in Cidco’s proposal, which was said to be an exorbitant amount by residents and has asked the principal secretary of the urban development department (UDD) to fast track the process which will allow leaseholders to carry out redevelopment and renovation sans hassles. 
 
 The Cidco board has proposed a perpetual lease for all properties in the satellite city, in lieu of a freehold as demanded by residents for years, while giving more autonomy to buyers as consolation unlike previously. While turning down the demand for freehold of land, Cidco has allowed more autonomy to the residents.
 
 In a meeting convened by the CM at Mantralaya on Tuesday, it was decided that Cidco will only collect renewal premium and waive off all other charges for which the residents have to run from one department to other for obtaining various documents during transfer, change of land use, mortgage and more. 
 
  N, one of the members of the Cidco board, said, “The CM has in principle approved the proposal. Cidco will only collect the renewal fee and incur losses of transfer and other charges which amount to Rs 70-80 crore annum.” 
 
 Now buyers will have the right to sell, mortgage and redevelop the property without seeking NOC from Cidco as has been the case till now.
