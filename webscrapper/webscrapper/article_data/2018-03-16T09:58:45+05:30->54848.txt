CHENNAI:   customers in the city who have surrendered their   and   connections have been kept waiting for a   of their caution deposits, with officials from the state-owned telecom company citing a   at the firmâ€™s regional office for the delay. 

 A subscriber from Adyar said he paid a caution   of more than Rs 3,000 for the landline connection. When he surrendered it six months ago, officials at the BSNL office concerned had assured him that the amount would be deposited in his bank account within three months. But when he checked his account after three months, it was yet to be credited, he said.
 
 The caution deposit is around Rs 3,000 for landlines and Rs 2,500 for broadband connections for which customers have to return the modem to the telephone exchange. 
 
 When contacted, a senior BSNL official said they had not received money from the ministry since November last year due to which no refund could be made. More than 15,000 customers who surrendered their landline or broadband connections in Chennai district are waiting to get back their caution deposits, with the amount running into a few crores of rupees, the officer said. In Adyar alone, more than 500 customers are awaiting refunds, he added.
 
 Conceding that there is a difficulty in repaying the caution deposit to subscribers, BSNL spokesperson G Vijaya said the funds have to be released from the corporate office in New Delhi. The money will be released before the end of the month or in April, she said.
