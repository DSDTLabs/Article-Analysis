 Calling it an “important day for the historic city of Delhi”,   said the Sunder Nursery project was a model of public-private partnership combining the elements of “nature, culture and future” and it was a great addition to the capital. 
 
 Naidu said it was he as urban development minister who had approved the project to redevelop the area. He also announced that the 90-acre park would be expanded to 900 acres to reach Purana Qila to make it the biggest park in India.
 
 The Aga Khan, who is the 49th hereditary imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims and founder and chairman of Aga Khan Development Network, said, “It was designed to honour the past while also serving the future. And it is with the future in mind that we now dedicate Sunder Nursery as one of the world’s great public parks—open to all for recreation, for contemplation, for education, and for inspiration.” 
 
 The Sunder Nursery project, the Aga Khan added, was an example of the importance of open, green spaces in a healthy urban landscape with aesthetic, recreational and economic potential. This would act as a catalyst for tourism, science, education, sustainable community development and sport, he added. 
 
 The Aga Khan also said that the park has been dedicated to communal harmony and syncretism of India as exemplified by the message of Sufi saint Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya. 
 
 Once used as a nursery by the British, the Sunder Nursery has been transformed over the last decade by Aga Khan Trust for Culture in collaboration with the ministry of housing and urban affairs, CPWD, ASI, SDMC and US Ambassador’s Fund for Cultural Preservation. Landscape works were supported by Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation.
