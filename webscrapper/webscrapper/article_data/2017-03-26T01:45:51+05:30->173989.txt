Lucknow: An   officer of Uttar Pradesh cadre batch Himanshu Kumar was   on Saturday for indiscipline. The action followed a series of tweets from the 2010 batch IPS wherein he accused the Aditya Nath Yogi government of targeting selectively Yadavs in UP police as they owe allegiance to the previous Akhilesh Yadav government.

 “The action has been initiated after a preliminary inquiry found him guilty of indiscipline with reference to his comments on the social media questioning the authority and objectivity of his senior officials,” said a Home department official. On March 22, Himanshu had tweeted that there was a “rush among senior officers to suspend/send to reserve lines all police personnel who have ‘Yadav’ surname.” Once senior officials objected to his  , he deleted it claiming that he was being misunderstood.
 
 In a series of tweets that followed, Kumar questioned state police chief, accusing him of “forcing officers to punish people in the name of caste” and tagged his tweets to chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi’s official handle. Minutes after his suspension on Saturday, Himanshu tweeted: “Truth alone triumphs”.
 
 Having served as police chief in six districts of the state including Maharajganj, Shravasti, Hapur, Kasganj apart from Samajwadi Party (SP) bastions of Mainpuri and Firozabad before he was transferred and attached to the DGP headquarters, Himanshu was currently on medical leave.
 
 Earlier, the IPS officer had made headlines for filing a case against his estranged wife Priya Singh in Noida. His wife too had lodged a dowry harassment and domestic violence FIR against him with the Bihar police where she was presently staying with her parents.
