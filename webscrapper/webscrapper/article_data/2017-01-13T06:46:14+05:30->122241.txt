AHMEDABAD: Any   enthusiast knows the joy of celebrating   in the Walled City. Old-timers, especially, can vouch that the energy and zeal of the festival found on rooftops and terraces of pol houses can’t be found anywhere else. And Amdavadis don’t mind shelling out anywhere between Rs 15,000 and Rs 20,000 to enjoy Uttarayan in the pols. So, those who own property in the   are offering terraces on rent.

 Rajiv Patel, the owner of French Haveli, said, “For the past few years, renting out of terraces for the festival has become a common trend as people want to enjoy the festival in a traditional set up. Groups of 20-25 persons tend to hire terraces.”
 
 “The cost goes up when it comes to premium properties,” said Patel.
 
 People who host guests from other states, or even abroad, during the festival tend to book terraces in the Walled City. “We have been hosting people for the festivals for long. This time, however, a large group of our relatives are coming over so we’d keep it a personal affair,” said Ketanbhai, a pol resident.
