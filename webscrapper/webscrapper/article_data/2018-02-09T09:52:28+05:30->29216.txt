HYDERABAD: Former bureaucrat and ex-legislator   and Jana Sena Party ( ) leader   have joined hands to exert pressure on the Centre to implement what was promised in the AP Reorganisation Act. 

 Pawan Kalyan met Jayaprakash Narayan here on Thursday and said like-minded people would be involved in the effort. Asked if the group would function as a  , Pawan said they had not spoken about the nomenclature at this juncture, but added that it would function as a strategy group. 
 
 "What is due for the people for AP and Telangana should be given as per the Reorganisation Act. More promises were made on the floor of Parliament verbally and these also have to be fulfilled," Narayan said. He said it has been more than three and a half years since the state was bifurcated and bureaucrats should know how to implement the Act. "They should not try to tell us how and why they are not able to do it," he said. 
 
 Narayan also pointed out that though AP did not get the special status as promised, Telangana too did not get what it was supposed to and gave the example of AIIMS hospital which was promised but no funds were released for it. 
 
 Meanwhile, former MP,   whose support Pawan solicited to proceed in a way that the Centre will grant special status to AP, said he would cooperate with Pawan. He, however, said he would limit himself to the issues in front of them. "It is not about posts or positions. But I also have to get more clarity on what Pawan Kalyan wants to do," he said. Arun Kumar said it was good Pawan had taken up the issue because he was a natural crowd puller. Narayan too appreciated Pawan for taking the lead on the issue.
