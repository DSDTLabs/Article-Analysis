PUNE: The forest department will carry out a   census of wildlife at all the forest areas in the region on May 10 and 11.

 The 24-hour exercise is an annual affair wherein forest staffers as well as nature enthusiasts and organisations participate by observing and counting the wildlife species that visit each waterhole.
 
 The waterhole   method is considered more a direct census survey, KP Singh, chief conservator of forests, wildlife for Pune, said.
 
 As per Singh, there is no estimation in this method. “We count the number of animals and their type that visit each waterhole. Each animal needs to consume water at least once in a 24-hour period. Hence, all the wildlife in the area will be covered through this activity. It will help determine the concentration of wildlife species in the particular area.”
 
 To ensure participation from volunteers, the forest department will be spreading the message through banners and pamphlets displayed at forest department offices as well as at the various sanctuaries and wildlife welfare organisations.
 
 Survey Procedure 
 Before the start of the survey, the forest department will begin the activities of collecting animal droppings as well as pugmarks to determine what species are to be found in a particular area.
 
 The forest staff and volunteers from wildlife conservation NGOs as well as nature lovers will then be divided into groups with each group being assigned a waterhole in the area.
 
 The group will then spend 24 hours starting from 4pm on May 10 until the next day. During this period, they will observe the wildlife species that visit the waterhole and keep a count of each type. All the reports will then be compiled into the census survey.
