BHUBANESWAR: The   government has passed a resolution to appoint 32 state-level observers (SLOs), not below the rank of  , to monitor the implementation of   at the district and sub-district level. 

 The first-of-its-kind initiative was passed by the planning and convergence department on Friday. Justifying the move, the government said feedback from independent sources other than the implementing and supervising authorities was a must in removing deficiencies in the implementation of various programmes.
 
 Officers from the   (IAS), Indian Forest Service, Odisha Administrative Service and Odisha Finance Service, who are willing to walk the extra mile, have been empanelled in the 'pool of observers' to monitor the implementation of various government schemes and for effective disaster management.
 
 The move comes close on the heels of the Naveen government rejecting the Centre's suggestion of appointing joint secretary-level officers as prabharis (in charge) of 115 backward districts in the country, including eight in the state.
 
 A senior government officer said the SLOs would be given assignments to check various schemes from time to time. They will have to submit written reports to the chief secretary.
 
 The move has resulted in a war of words between BJP and BJD. The saffron party's spokesperson   termed it a 'purely political' move. "The officers will be used to get political feedback as BJD doesn't trust its elected representatives any more," Mohapatra said.
 
 BJD spokesperson Amar Prasad Satpathy welcomed the move, terming it yet another initiative to ensure speedy and timely implementation of government schemes. "There will be greater scrutiny of works to bring more efficiency in governance," Satpathy said.
