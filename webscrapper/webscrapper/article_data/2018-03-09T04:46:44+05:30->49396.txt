MUMBAI: Central Railway services were delayed by up to 20 minutes during evening peak hours, inconveniencing scores of commuters on Thursday. Sources said there was a case of ‘signal passed at danger’ or signal jumping between Thane and   stations. Sources said a probe will be instituted.

 Some trains leaving   were rescheduled, which upset daily office-goers who were returning home late in the evening. A passenger said, “A Kalyan 15-car local was rescheduled by more than half an hour and left around 8.15pm from CSMT. Platforms were crowded as services were hit.”
 
 Although train services were normal around 8.30pm, some trains were cancelled, while the 9.54 fast Kalyan train was delayed indefinitely and then cancelled.
