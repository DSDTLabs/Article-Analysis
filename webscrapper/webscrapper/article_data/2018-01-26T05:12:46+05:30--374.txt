MUMBAI: To decongest roads, the   have barred vehicles providing   like supplying vegetables,  , bread, bakery products, petrol, diesel and kerosene from parking in 'no-parking' zones on any road in Mumbai from February 1. 

 The vehicle operators will have to create  , according to a fresh directive issued by joint police commissioner (traffic) Amitesh Kumar. He said parking is a big issue in Mumbai and there’s an urgent need to decongest roads for smooth movement of vehicles. 
 
 “In case of essential services, there will be exception for ambulances, government/semi-government vehicles and school buses. But for the rest, we will strictly enforce the new rule from February 1, and anybody found violating the order will be imposed with penalty,” he said.
 
 The basic fine is Rs 200 and could increase depending on the seriousness of the offence, sources said. “They will have to park at locations earmarked for them or in pay-and-park lots or rented spaces,” he said.
 
 The traffic police on Wednesday issued a notification, wherein 'all heavy vehicles and private buses carrying passengers are restricted to enter and ply on roads in south Mumbai from 7 am to 12 am." This will come into effect from February 1. The private tourist bus operators are upset over the new notification and threaten to protest aggressively. Sources said they may go on strike, tentatively in the first or second week of February, to raise their voice. If this happens, it will affect 1,200 tourist buses ferrying around 50,000 passengers to the city daily.
 
 Said Harsh Kotak from Mumbai Bus Malak Sanghatna, “The government should realise that a private car passenger occupies more road space than a bus passenger. A single bus carries passengers equivalent to nine taxis or cars on road.” He added that company buses will also be hit if the notification was implemented and this will affect thousands of office-goers.
