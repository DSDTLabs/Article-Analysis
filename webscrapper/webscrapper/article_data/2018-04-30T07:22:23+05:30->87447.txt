AHMEDABAD: At least 45 members of   family, whose four sons had been flogged by self-styled cow vigilantes, renounced Hinduism and embraced Buddhism at a ceremony in  , 15km from  , on Sunday. 

 
 The family members included the four flogging victims, their wives, father Balu Sarvaiya and his wife, among others.
 
 “It has been more than two years that our sons were flogged. The state government hasn’t given us any help so far. We haven’t got justice yet and all the accused are out on bail,” Balu Sarvaiya, the victims’ father, told TOI over phone.
 
 “After the incident, there was Dalit uprising. But we continued to face discrimination. Even our own community members told us not to adhere to a religion after tolerating humiliations. Even today, we shudder to see the flogging video,” Sarvaiya added.
 
  
  
 
 The July 2016 Una flogging had triggered widespread outrage and left the Dalit community fuming. 
 
 Sarvaiya said he and his family members had to take up skinning dead cattle due to deep caste system. “We have been forced to convert on Sunday. We believe it will give further momentum to Dalit uprising. Other Dalits, who are facing tortures, will eventually have to embrace Buddhism,” he said.
 
 No prominent Dalit leaders, such as Vadgam MLA Jignesh Mewani, were present at the event — Dhamma Diksha Mahotsav — organised by the Sarvaiya family. They had announced renouncing Hinduism in January. The Sarvaiyas had invited Mewani and BSP chief Mayawati to the event.
 
 Asking Mewani to embrace Buddhism if he is a "true follower" of BR Ambedkar, he said, “The Vadgam MLA shot to limelight and became the face of Dalit agitation after he raised our issue. But after that he never cared to visit us.”
 
 Tight security was made in and around the village as well as Una town in wake of threats that some members had received four days ago by one of the 43 accused in the flogging, Gir-Somnath SP Hitesh Joisar told TOI.
