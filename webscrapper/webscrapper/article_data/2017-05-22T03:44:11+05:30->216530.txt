PELLING (SIKKIM)/NEW DELHI: Union home minister   said on Sunday that the   government would find a permanent solution to the   even as Pakistan was trying to destabilise India.

 Warning Pakistan, Singh said it would have to change or India would change it. “Kashmir is ours, Kashmiris are ours and Kashmiriyat is also ours. We will find a permanent solution to Kashmir,” Singh said.
 
 Speaking at a public reception, the minister said Pakistan was trying to destabilise India by fomenting trouble in Kashmir. “But I want to tell all of you that our government will find a permanent solution to the Kashmir issue,” he said, without elaborating.
 
 The statement comes at a time when Kashmir Valley has been witnessing widespread unrest since April 9 when the bypoll to the Srinagar Lok Sabha seat was held. Eight people were killed in firing by security forces that day. The turnout was a mere 7.14%. The April 12 bypoll to Anantnag Lok Sabha seat had to be postponed.
 
 Referring to the 2014 swearing-in ceremony of the   government, the minister said leaders of all neighbouring countries, including Pakistan, were invited to show that the new government wanted to have friendly relations with all countries.
 
 However, he said, there was no change in Pakistan’s attitude towards India and it wanted to destabilise India. “We hope that Pakistan will change. If it does not change, we have to change them. After globalisation, one country can’t destabilise another country as the international community will not forget it,” he said.
 
 Rajnath is on a three-day visit to Sikkim during which he attended a conference of Himalayan states to review the security situation and development activities along the India-China border. He also visited Nathu La border post, besides visiting a few posts of ITBP and SSB along the India-China and India-Nepal border respectively.
