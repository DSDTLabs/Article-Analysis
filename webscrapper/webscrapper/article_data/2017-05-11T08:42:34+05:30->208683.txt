LUCKNOW: A   on Wednesday set May 23 as the next date of   in the   murder case.   Vinita Tiwari has summoned the six accused from jail on May 12. 

 The court passed the order after the   filed a charge-sheet in the special court on Tuesday.
 
 The central agency had forwarded the charge-sheet against six people arrested by Lucknow police for the murder of the Sadatganj-based businessman.
 
 On February 1, bike-borne assailants had gunned down Shravan outside his house at night. An oil mill owner, Shravan was pursuing a court case against Aqeel, a listed criminal from Thakurganj. Aqeel had killed Shravan’s son Ayush in October 2013 over a tiff when the two were at a bar in Thakurganj.
 
 Shravan had been threatened on multiple occasions on Aqeel’s behest.
 
 As the name of three city policemen had cropped up in the episode for supporting Aqeel clandestinely, the high court directed CBI to take over the case. The agency took over the case in April.
 
 As the 90-day period was getting over since the time of arrest, CBI decided to file a charge-sheet against shooters Satyam Chaudhary and Aman Singh. Ajay Patel, Raju, Sonu and Aqeel were booked for criminal conspiracy and destruction of evidence.
