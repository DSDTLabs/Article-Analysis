BENGALURU:   DGP (Prisons) H N  , who is due for retirement this month-end, has been directed to go on leave while DIG (Prisons) D   has been posted as commissioner for traffic and road safety, a not-so-coveted post. The government also shunted out Krishnakumar, chief superintendent of Parappana Agrahara central jail, following allegations that jail staff were destroying evidence, and silencing inmates in a bid to disprove Roopa’s report.

 Roopa had exposed how jailed fake stamp paper racket kingpin Abdul Karim Telgi was leading a life of luxury, and the rampant drug menace inside the prison. These allegations were refuted by jail personnel, including Rao. Though the government announced an inquiry by retired IAS officer Vinay Kumar, the officers continued their blame-game in full public glare.
 
 With their duel threatening to cause more embarrassment to  , who holds the home portfolio, transfer orders were issued to the officers on Monday. The decision caused an uproar.   and social media criticised the move. A section of tweeple expressed solidarity with Roopa, another section slammed Siddaramaiah.
 
 “Despite the inquiry being in process, DIG (Prisons) D Roopa and her senior, DGP (Prisons) Rao, went to the media to discuss the case. The interaction of both police officers with the media during the course of inquiry was unwarranted and amounted to serious violation of service conduct rules,” Siddaramaiah said in a statement.
