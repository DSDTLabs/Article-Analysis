 Sarthana police station officials booked Sharad, who allegedly  , a resident of Khodiyar Krupa Society. Along with Sharad, police also booked his aide Shailesh Mer, a resident of Kamrej village.
 
 Sources said cases have also been registered against Sharad in Chhota Udepur district, too, for illegal sand mining from river Orsang.
 
 In his complaint, Donda alleged that Sharad and his associates were excavating sand from Tapi during night hours and their truck passed through his residential society, which is on the riverbank. Donda went to meet Sharad on the riverbank and asked him why excavation was being done during night when it is prohibited after 6 pm.
 
 Sharad retorted and told him that he was the son of an MLA and he has all the permissions, Donda told the police. About an hour after he left from there, Sharad called him on his mobile phone and threatened him for dire consequences if he tried to tarnish his image. Mer also spoke to Donda and told him to leave the city with his family.
 
 “I went to meet the district collector on Tuesday and then lodged the police complaint. I am approaching the court now to get details of three police cases of 2017 against Sharad registered in Chhota Udepur district for illegal sand mining from Orsang,” Donda said. 
 
 When contacted, MLA Zalavadiya said Donda was affiliated to the Congress, a claim that the latter denied.
 
 “Recently, illegal sand mining from Tapi was raided and stopped by mining department after my complaint. Some people whose businesses have suffered are trying to tarnish my reputation,” said Zalavadiya, refusing the allegations against Sharad. “I don’t have any knowledge if there are cases registered against Sharad in Chhota Udepur,” he added.
 
 Deputy commissioner of police R P Barot said, “We will register statements of the accused and collect evidences in connection with the complaint.”
