BENGALURU: He was stabbed in the back of his neck while riding his bike on September 14 in   town,  . Venkata Ram Prasad, 43, lay in a pool of blood when police reached the spot and shifted him to the government hospital.

 Prasad was returning home from court in the afternoon when the scooter-borne attacker stabbed him and sped away. Around 8pm, Prasad was brought to Columbia Asia Hospital, Hebbal. The knife was still stuck in the nape when he was brought in.
 
 A CT scan revealed the knife had pierced the spinal cord. Administering anesthesia was difficult as he would have to be turned on to his back. “But we went ahead with anesthesia in the position he came in,“ explained Dr  , consultant anesthesiologist. Once anesthesia was administered, the next challenge was to position him for surgery which needed manipulation of the patient and his neck.
 
 “We made sure the surgery was done without any movement of the neck and without any upper body movement. He had also suffered paralysis of the left hand,“ Dr   M, consultant neurosurgeon.
 
 Prasad has recovered and is now back on his feet and can walk too, said doctors. However, the circumstances of the attack are still mysterious.
 
 “It's good the knife was not removed at the local hospital as he wouldn't have survived the excessive bleeding,“ said Dr Ananth Rao, unit head at the hospital.
