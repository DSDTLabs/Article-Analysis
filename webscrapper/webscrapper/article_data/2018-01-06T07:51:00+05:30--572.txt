Ludhiana: Business associations in the city have decided to go on daylong strike on January 11 to protest government inaction on rising prices of steel raw material. 

 A total of 10 business associations led by Fastener Manufacturers Association of India (FMAI) warned the government that they would stage a protest against the Union government and observe strike against the failure of the government if the price of steel raw material, which has increased by more than Rs 8,000 per ton, is not controlled. 
 
 Narinder Bhamra, president, FMAI said, “Rising steel prices have hit businessmen and almost all kinds of industry in Ludhiana hard. Losses are mounting for every industry. It is shocking that the government is silently watching steel cartels fleecing us of our hard-earned money. Therefore, we have decided to stick to our decision of going on strike on January 11 and stage a protest against the government and ministry of steel to show our resentment.”
 
 Kuldeep Singh, general secretary, FMAI, said, “It is time that the ministry of steel stops playing into the hands of the steel lobby and saves micro and small industrialists struggling to operate their factories for eight hours. We have got the support of at least 10 business associations for our protest on January 11. We hope that around 50 associations join hands with us to make the protest successful.” 
 
 Other businessmen present on the occasion included Atul Sethi, Bharpur Singh, Racchpal Singh, Gurjit Singh, Kuldip Singh, Jugal Kishore and Charanjit Singh.
