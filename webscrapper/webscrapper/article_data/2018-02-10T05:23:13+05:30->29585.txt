MUMBAI: The state government has developed cold feet over its Rs141 crore contract with   for digitizing e-services of urban local bodies across the state and is set to exit the deal. The same firm had handled the   portal and the online loan waiver scheme, both of which reported major glitches and resulted in a public setback for the government's   push. 

 Asked whether the state would continue its contract, CM   who holds the IT portfolio, said, "Don't think so." The firm, however, remains empanelled with the state IT department as an HR consultant for supply of technical manpower. The company declined comment.
 
 The government has also ordered an audit to assess what went wrong with the functioning of the scholarship scheme on Mahadbt portal set up by the company last year. The Mahadbt ('dbt' standing for direct benefit transfer) portal was set up last year and was meant to dispense state funds directly into the accounts of beneficiaries. 
 
 Innowave was also awarded the contract for processing online applications for the state's loan waiver scheme. However, after widespread glitches delayed the scheme's rollout, the company was abruptly replaced. "No payment has been made to the company for the loan waiver scheme," a senior official said.
 
  "The question is why the government gave this Nagpur-based company so many contracts when each scheme was resulting in a public fiasco. And how was the loan waiver contract given without calling for tenders?" asked   spokeperson Nawab Malik.
