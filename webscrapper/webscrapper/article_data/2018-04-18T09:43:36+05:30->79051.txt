GUWAHATI: The public sector   (NRL) in   district has sought proposals from upcoming entrepreneurs for promoting startups in the northeast under its iDEATION 2018 initiative. 

 NRL managing director  , speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, said 362 proposals were received altogether last year, out of which four qualified for NRL's grants under the iDEATION programme.
 
 iDEATION is a platform created by NRL for selection of startups for funding that have the potential to grow as business ventures in future. NRL has earmarked a fund of Rs 10 crore to be invested on selected startups in the northeast for a period of three years.
 
 "Under iDEATION we want to promote industry and entrepreneurship in northeast. We seek innovative business solutions for startups which we can support so that we can create a startup ecosystem in the region. Doing this, we want to remove the regional disparity so far as startups are concerned," Barua said.
 
 Barua said the majority of the proposals received last year either did not conform to the idea of a startup or lacked innovative business solutions. He added that out of Rs 10 Crore, NRL provided a total of Rs 1.29 crore to the four selected startups.
 
 According to NRL officials, the startup activities in the country are primarily concentrated in six major cities, with Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru having the maximum concentration.
 
 Barua said boot camps were organised last month in IIT Guwahati, Assam Engineering College, Gauhati University, Jorhat Engineering College, Dibrugarh University, Assam Agriculture University and Kaziranga University to encourage students to take up entrepreneurship as a career. He said the objective of iDEATION is to nurture the enterprising skills of youths in northeast through business innovation. The iDEATION initiative was launched last year.
 
 NRL was dedicated to the nation by Prime Minister   on July 9, 1999.
