AMRITSAR: The acting president of Sikh organization Chief   (CKD) on Monday reversed various decisions of his predecessor  . 

 Slashing rates of books published by the CKD by more than 60%, its acting chief   Singh said he would make it a true charitable organization.
 
 He said the Chief  , which aimed to provide affordable education to under-privileged children, especially those living in rural areas, had been making money by selling books, uniforms and giving canteen and construction work contracts allegedly to give benefits to a few.
 
 "We have revised the cost of set of books from nursery to Class V, giving a relief of more than 50% in the purchase of books alone," Dhanraj told TOI on Monday.
 
 Chadha had recommended the name of Dhanraj to officiate as president of the Sikh body after registration of a police case against him by a woman principal of a school running under the management of CKD.
 
 "This has been done to make the institute a charitable one in real terms and prevent people's hard earned money going in the pockets of few persons," Dhanraj said. 
 
 He said he had also issued orders not to give contracts of canteens of schools to outsiders. Instead, he said, the school management would provide quality refreshments through its canteens to the students.
