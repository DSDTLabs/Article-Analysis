HYDERABAD: Lashing out at the government for unnecessarily destroying the   road - which they claim is one of the best stretches in Hyderabad - IT professionals from the city, on Friday, took to the streets to protest against the move. Turns out, the authorities have dug up the existing road here to replace it with a white-topped road. 

 Techies, fuming over the unwarranted repair work, brought horses on hire and threatened to commute to work on them, to register their protest against the exercise. They later aborted the mission. 
 
 "This road was one of the best roads in Hyderabad and didn't require any maintenance for next three-four years. Yet, K T   and his ministry vigorously pushed for white topping of this road. The decision is completely uncalled for and highlights the careless attitude of government," said Ramanjeet Singh, one of the protesters. "The government should have thought this through thoroughly before initiating a project that affects lakhs of people." he added.
 
 Singh also said that they decided to bring in horses to drive home the point that the government was forcing IT employees to go back to the decades-old system of commuting (read: on horseback).
 
 "If the authorities are not ready to hear our problem, we will continue to take to platforms like twitter to run an online satyagraha. We can come up with more hi-tech ways to raise our voices, as well," said Anumod Thomas, a   employee.
 
 While drawing the authorities' attention to other pressing issues another protester,  , said how they should work on providing alternatives to residents there, to beat the traffic menace. "They should create parking space near   stadium and Cyberabad commissionerate office and provide shuttles from there so that we are not struck in traffic for hours together ."
