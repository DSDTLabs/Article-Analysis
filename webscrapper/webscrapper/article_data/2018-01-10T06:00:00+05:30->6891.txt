The usually dusty, crowded streets of Dhoolpet wear a festive look these days, doused in the colours of Sankranti. Patangs, charaks and manjas adorning scores of shops that have cropped up, jostle for 
attention everywhere you look. The narrow gallis are full of eager customers checking out the designs, patterns and styles of patangs on display, haggling for the best bargain as they move from one shop to the other. “Ded sau rupay bahut zyada hai bhai. Mereko teen dozen chahiye, assi karlo...,” says a young boy to which the stall owner says, “Aap pura market chanlo, isse acche patang nahi milegi. Hamara patang bhi best hai, aur hamara rate bhi. Aap pila ke toh dekho, malmal ki tarah udjayega. Phir aap hi wapas aayenge....”
 
 
 
 Apart from cartoon characters like Superman, Batman, Chota Bheem etc.,   and Prabhas (Baahubali) continue to hold sway over the motifs of fancy but cheap plastic kites this season. Most of the shops on either side of the busy market area have been adorned with Baahubali and Modi patangs. But, this time, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister   and   diva Deepika Padukone’s images have also found their way onto the kites on display at Dhoolpet market.
 “Modi has always been one of the top favourites among the buyers, ditto with Baahubali. But this time kites bearing Yogi and Modiji together are also in great demand among customers,” says a shop owner, Durga Singh. These mostly come from Gujarat and prices usually range between `7 and `12, say vendors, adding that they just go by the recent trends in the market.  , another vendor says he has bought nearly 2000 Modi kites and is hopeful of selling the entire stock by the end of the festival at a rate of `5 each.
 
 
  
 As we arrived at Lodh Bhavan area, we could see that the place was buzzing with activity. While the kite makers are busy giving final touches to the patangs, a gang of boys are busy rubbing a mixture of rice, glue and glass pieces on twines to make manjas with a razor sharp finish. 
 
  “For the last one week, the work has been very hectic and we have been working from dawn to dusk to complete orders,” says Vishnu, a young manja maker, adding, “I complete four boxes full of manja reels every day. Each reel is being sold at a price ranging between `300 and `500. Hopefully we’ll make some good money this time.”
 
 
 His friends are all making colourful manjas — chedar, barata, rajari — to name a few among the myriad varieties, as they hurriedly roll out manjas and tuck them into plastic boxes. But the banned machine-made Chinese manjas that have found their way into the markets pose a big threat to the hopes of these manja makers. “The government has banned the sale of Chinese kites and manjas as they have a high glass content and pose a major threat to birds. They can be deadly for humans too, especially for those commuting on bikes. But, it is still being sold secretly in the market. I request the government to strictly implement the order this time and put an end to all such tragic mishaps,” urges a seller, Vikas Singh. The challenge posed by the Chinese-made kites and manjas notwithstanding, the traders are hopeful of having a happy Sankranti this year!
