CANACONA: Two days after TOI first front paged the acute   in many of the villages of Canacona and followed it up with another front page report on how Goa’s greenest belt is facing a   situation,   minister   visited Canacona on Friday and instructed his department to complete all works without delay.

 Paleykar reviewed various works undertaken by the water resources department to augment supply to the taluka.
 
 TOI on Wednesday had reported that though Chapoli dam had sufficient water, the residents were suffering from shortage mainly due to the failure of the water resources department. Engineers from the department claimed that the pipeline supplying water to the area is 33 33 years old and very narrow. As a result, settlements located within a 200-300 metre radius of the dam face severe water scarcity.
 
 Palyekar visited the Chapolim and Gavnem dams and also instructed WRD officials to expedite the process to rehabilitate two families that live close to Gavnem dam. “Rehabilitation of the two families was neglected even as the dam was completed,” an official said.
 
 “It is amply clear that the department lacks the will to supply water to the people, as it ought to have laid a new pipeline well before the summer,” social worker Janardhan Bhandari said.
 
 Water scarcity has surfaced in the taluka’s municipal areas also. Though water is supplied every alternative day, it is available only to those living on the ground and first floors of residential complexes due to poor pressure. The lack of set supply timings inconveniences people further.
 
 Many residents have also complained that the water supplied to them is dirty and unsuitable for drinking and cooking, leading them to buy and consume packaged drinking water instead.
