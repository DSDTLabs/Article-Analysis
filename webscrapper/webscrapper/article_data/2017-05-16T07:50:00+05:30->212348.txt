Noida: The All Noida Schools Parents Association (ANSPA) has condemned the constitution of the panel by the state government under the proposed ordinance meant to regulate fee hike in schools as it has no representation from the parents’ side. The   also criticised the appointment of chairman of the DPS Ghaziabad Society (DPSG), Om Pathak, as its member.

  “We are disappointed because Om Pathak, who is running at least three schools in the region, has sbeen nominated on the committee. How can he be expected to think of parents’ benefit?,” Yatendra Kasana, president, ANSPA said. 
 
 Pathak heads the society which also has DPS Vasundhara under its purview. The school had issued a transfer certificate to a girl student in August 2016 apparently because the child’s father was involved in anti-DPS activities. Most recently, DPS Ghaziabad refused to give admission to a differently-abled girl child leading to protests from the family.
 
 Parents also demanded that the committee be headed by a retired high court judge. “We can expect a fair probe only when the committee is headed by a retired high court judge and involves a parent representative,” ANSPA general secretary K Arunchalam said. “We hope that till the time the government brings an ordinance on this issue, the schools should not charge the hiked fee ,” he said.
