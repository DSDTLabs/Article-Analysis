NAGPUR: A 24-year-old goon,   was   by former friend in   on Sunday. Bawane, who had around half a dozen offences against him bled to death after having sustained a deep gash on his left leg. 

 The accused   (20), Ranjit Raut (26) and Piyush Pantawane (20) have been arrested. It is learnt that Dhone, who was earlier a friend of the deceased had taken some money from Bawane and had not yet returned it. This had soured the relationship between the two. 
 
 Bawane was released from jail in May and as Dhone had not paid up his money yet, wanted to take away the latter’s mobile phone. This had enraged Dhone. Sources close to Bawane family said that the deceased had shifted to Andhra Pradesh where he was working as a menial labour. He had come to Khaparkheda on Friday and was due to leave on Saturday. They added that it was Dhone and the others who had insisted on Bawane staying back in Khaparkheda.
 
 Sources informed TOI that Dhone, who has several offences, including two attempts to   cases against him, had summoned Bawane to ward number 4 locality using Pantawane’s phone. When the three accused spotted Bawane, they started chasing him. Bawane couldn’t out run them and the trio pinned him down and stabbed him to death. 
 
 According to unconfirmed sources Dhone’s mother and sister had tried to drag the body of Bawane to another place, but did not succeed. Senior PO Ashok Sakharkar of Khaparkheda police said that he was on the spot shortly after the incident. “The three had already escaped. We nabbed Pantawane first on Monday early morning. This led to the arrest of the other two. There might be more accused in the case,” he said.
