PUNE: A 33-year-old   working at a warehouse in Wagholi allegedly ended his life by shooting himself with his licensed 12-bore gun late on Friday night.

 The deceased has been identified as Krishna Jadhav. The Pune rural police suspect the suicide to be a fallout of a   between Jadhav and his fellow security guard over some issue.
 
 “We have registered a case of accidental death. Further probe is on,” Sarjerao Patil, inspector of the Lonikand police, said.
 
 Patil said Jadhav was on night duty at the warehouse on Thursday. “Around 10.30pm, Jadhav and his colleague had entered into a brawl over their duty location,” Patil said.
 
 Patil said the supervisor and other officials at the warehouse had then had intervened. “They had even confiscated Jadhav’s gun as he had threatened to shoot the other guard,” he said.
 
 After pacifying Jadhav, the supervisor had returned the gun to him. “Around 11am, Jadhav shot himself at his throat with the gun. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival by the doctors,” Patil said.
 
 Interestingly in November last year, four unidentified men had attacked and shot dead Shivaji Kajale,   of the same warehouse. “The suspects in this case are still at large. We are working on some clues,” an officer from the Pune rural police said.
