PATNA: The state police headquarters on Thursday suspended sub-inspector   and  , a munshi, for detaining two entrepreneurs – Nemi Kumar of Madhubani and   of Begusarai –who were picked up from the Startup Summit in the presence of CM   at the S K Memorial Hall on Wednesday and kept in the Gandhi Maidan police station for six hours.
 
  Earlier, the issue had rocked the state legislative council on Thursday.
  
  Leader of opposition Sushil Kumar Modi alleged the two entrepreneurs were tortured by police because they had dared question the CM. “They had asked the CM why their applications for a startup were rejected. Don’t they have the right to question a CM in a democracy?” asked Modi.
  
  Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj, however, told a section of the media that the duo were picked up for verification of their identity as they were creating nuisance at the meet. They were released on personal bond, the SSP said.
  
  On the other hand, the state industries department issued a press release on Thursday, claiming Nemi had been briefed about the status of his application by department’s principal secretary S Siddharth. “His application was taken up by the preliminary scrutiny committee on March 1 and assigned to the Indian Institute of Technology-Patna with a direction to it on March 7 to do the follow-up,” read the press release.
  
  The department also claimed the principal secretary met Suresh after the incident and assured him to look into his application.
