RAJKOT: A multi-utility vehicle which was carrying eight calves was set ablaze by gau rakshaks or cow vigilantes at Dari tollbooth near Veraval in Gir Somnath district early on Friday. One of the accused who was taking the calves to the slaughter house was arrested and all the calves were rescued. 

 Police identified the accused as   Panja, a resident of Prabhas Patan of Gir Somnath district. However, two accused — Yasin Fakir, a resident of Kodinar in Gir Somnath district, and Rafiq Patani, a resident of Veraval —fled from the spot. 
 
 “The accused were transporting the calves from Keshod to Veraval. The gau rakshaks who seemed to have got the tip-off about the scandal were waiting for the vehicle at Dari tollbooth. Seeing the gau rakshaks, Yasin and Rafiq fled, while Afzal was caught. The angry gau rakshaks then set ablaze the vehicle,” Prabhas Patan police station sub-inspector S I Mandhara said.
 
 “We have also booked the gau rakshaks, whose identities and numbers are yet to be ascertained, for setting the vehicle ablaze,” Mandhara added.
