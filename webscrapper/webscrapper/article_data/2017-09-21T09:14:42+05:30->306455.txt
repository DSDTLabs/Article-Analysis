NEW DELHI: Justice (retd)  , the High Court-appointed administrator of the Delhi & District Cricket Association (DDCA), expressed disappointment at the   members for rejecting the  's reforms.

 Speaking to TOI, Sen said DDCA members will have to comply with the order as there isn't any alternative to it. “I am very disappointed with the way the DDCA members have refused to abolish the proxy system. The members should know they will have no other option other than adopting the Lodha reforms after the apex court passes the order,” Sen said a day before the   hears the BCCI case on Thursday afternoon.
 
 “Proxy system is a contempt of court. It has been a big bane in DDCA for long and I am sure the current members will have to be shown the door, if need be, to implement the reforms,“ Sen said, adding that officials with vested interest are doing their bit to manipulate the system.
