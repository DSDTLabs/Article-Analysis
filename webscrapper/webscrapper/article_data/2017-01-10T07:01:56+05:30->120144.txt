HYDERABAD: Days after the   department made government approval mandatory for institutions to run pre-primary sections, school managements are up in arms against the move. They say the decision is a bad one and designed only to fill government coffers as there is no uniform curriculum, textbooks or teacher training facilities.

 As per the ruling, applicable for the academic year 201718, it is compulsory for schools to submit an online application to the department and procure its consent before running pre-primary sections.
 
 “The government has initiated the recognition process in a haphazard manner without outlining a standard curriculum, identifying teacher training institutes and infrastructure such as playgrounds. The department could have waited for another year before pushing us to seek recognition,“ said Prasad Rao, owner of a private school in Karimnagar.
 
 “The government has not decided on the age at which we can begin admissions,“ said Sreenivas Reddy , president of Telangana Recognized School Managements Association.
 
 In absence of curriculum and government prescribed books, managements use books from private publishers.“The content in books from pri vate publishers varies. While some concentrate on rhymes, shapes and colours, others focus on alphabets, numbers and basic words,“ said Prabhakar Reddy Enugala, school principal of Progress High School in Hanamkonda.
 
 While parents do support the government move to recognise pre-primary schools, they also want a standard curriculum suited the child's age. “In a few schools, two-year-olds are taught to hold a pencil. Other schools feel oral education should suffice for that age,“ said Sangeetha Kadi, a parent of a three-year-old.
