MUMBAI: Technical problems plagued the Common Law Admission Test ( ) held on Sunday, even as students suffered at several centres. 

 At some centres, candidates had to wait for up to 30 minutes for the technical issue to be resolved. At a centre in Thane, students lost the first 10 minutes of the exam as the technical team tried to fix the problem. While they were given extra time, there was a gap of 20 minutes which affected the concentration. "The portals hanged and we had to log in again. We wasted nearly 40 minutes," said a student who took the test at a   centre.
 
 Power cuts, unavailability of stationery and change in seating arrangement due to issues with the computers were other problems. "Electricity went off during the paper. We asked the invigilator give that to us in writing, but he refused. Others didn't address our concern too. We have spent days preparing for the exam," said a student from a   test centre.
 
 For some students the problems did not end even after the two-hour paper started. "When the test began, the screen was showing garbled sentences for at least three minutes. Students lost precious time in an exam where every second counts," said a parent from Delhi.
