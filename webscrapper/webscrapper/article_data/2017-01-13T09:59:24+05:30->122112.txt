LUCKNOW: Leading industry body,   (The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India) released a report named ‘Action Agenda for the new government of UP’ that suggests   should focus on growth of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups to help create about 80 lakh new jobs in next five years. The association submitted this pre-election agenda to leaders of major political parties in UP to include in their election manifesto. 

 The report pointed out that UP’s economic growth not only surpassed India’s economic growth in last financial year, its contribution to India’s economy has shown consistent improvement owing to stability in economic activities during the tenure of the present regime. “UP’s contribution to India’s economy had declined from 8.78% in 2004-05 to 7.97% in 2011-12, but thereafter it picked up gradually to reach 8.16% in 2014-15,” the agenda highlights. 
 
 The chamber’s secretary general   said, “Assocham Special Task Force on UP has formulated a ‘Sustainable Action Plan’ to achieve double-digit growth in the state in next five years to help UP enter the ‘high income club of states.” UP should aim to sustain current level of workforce participation rate of about 33% for working age group of 15-30 years. About 1.40 crore people are already a part of the workforce.
