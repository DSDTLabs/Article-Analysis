NEW DELHI: Keeping up the pressure on Amazon, India has instructed its ambassador in Washington to convey to the e-tailer that while allowing sale of products by vendors on the website,   should respect Indian sensitivities and sentiments.

 “As a follow up to the matter regarding the sale of doormats with the Indian flag on Amazon, our ambassador in Washington has been instructed to convey to Amazon that while providing a platform for third party vendors, they should respect Indian sensitivities and sentiments,” a spokesperson of the ministry of external affairs said on Saturday.
 
 This even as some Twitter users tagged external affairs minister Sushma   in their tweets complaining that beach sandals with Gandhi’s image were being sold on the Amazon US site.
 
 Earlier this week, after she received a complaint about   selling doormats depicting the Indian tricolour, Swaraj reacted sharply and asked the etailer to withdraw the products and tender an unconditional apology.
 
 She also said that if Amazon failed to do so, the e-tailer’s employees would not be granted an Indian visa and the ones issued earlier will also be withdrawn. Following the stern message, Amazon expressed regret for “offending” Indian sentiments and informed Swaraj about removal of the offensive product from its Canadian website.
