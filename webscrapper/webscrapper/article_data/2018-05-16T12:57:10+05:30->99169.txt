PONDA:   national president Amit Shah, during his visit to the state on Sunday, said that the   issue would be solved through the court, however, mining-dependent businessmen said they do not trust senior BJP functionaries.

 Stating that the party is in power both at the centre and state and that could have solved the issue by raising it in the parliament, president of the All Goa Truck Owners’ Association Nilkanth Gawas said the BJP is not keen about solving the matter. He said BJP national leaders come to Goa for political gains and have nothing to say about issues pertaining to Goa. 
 
 “In 2012, then chief minister Manohar Parrikar, then Sanvordem MLA Ganesh Gaonkar and now MP Narendra Sawaikar had assured to solve the issue once they come to power,” president Dharbandora Truck Owners’ Association Balaji Gawas said.
