The   that has been struggling since long with the number of potholes on   over the recent years, is now exploring new ways of tackling the issue.

 On Tuesday, a private agency gave civic authorities including Mayor  , civic chief   and others a demonstration on a modern pothole filling technology. 
 
 The firm filled a patch of around 3X2 feet near Town Hall in less than 20 minutes and said it will last for over 3 years. The agency claimed to have filled potholes in a very effective and time-bound manner using infrared asphalt repair technology. A company representative also said that the method is far better that than the conventional way.
 
 As of now, the civic body fills potholes using the conventional method which is time consuming and can’t be carried out in the rainy season. Moreover, its results aren’t very satisfactory.
 
 A civic official said that they may adopt the technique if it is feasible for the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). “We will study the method and compare it with the conventional technique before adopting it,” Mugalikar said.
 
 Despite spending significant money on patchwork, the city’s 1,350-km-long network of roads is in bad shape. There are potholes everywhere and residents are consistently demanding that the civic authorities to improve the system.
 
 The number of potholes particularly increases in the   and it was expected that the civic body will take precautionary measures.
