SHIMLA: The Himachal Pradesh cabinet, in a meeting held on Thursday, provided major relief to Kullu royal and senior   leader   by deciding to exclude Raghunathji Temple, Sultanpur in Kullu district from Schedule-I of Hindu Public Religious Institution and Charitable Endowment Act, 1984. The previous   regime headed by   initiated the move to acquire the temple, which was resisted by Maheshwar Singh.

 Through a notice issued on July 26, 2016, the government requested Maheshwar Singh to hand over all temple properties -- movable and immovable, temporary and permanent fixtures, structures and devices as well as stock, stores and cash, including cash books, among others, to the chairman of   Trust Sultanpur, Kullu.
 
 Maheshwar Singh approached the high court challenging the government decision and on August 2, 2016, Himachal Pradesh high court stayed the operation and execution of this notice. Raghunath temple of Kullu is located on one side of the Rupi palace complex owned by the erstwhile royal family of Kullu and Maheshwar Singh is the chief custodian of Lord Raghunath, principal deity of Kullu district.
 
 After the December 2014 temple heist, the Congress government initiated the move to acquire the temple saying it would help improve its maintenance and management. However, Maheshwar Singh claimed the temple is private and the government notification applies only to public temples.
 
 Addressing a deputation of the Dev Sanskriti Charitable Trust at Oak-Over in Shimla on September 8, 2016, Virbhadra Singh said the Raghunath Temple is not the private property of any individual as it is the epicentre of Kullu Dusshera festivities and Lord Raghunath is principle deity of people of Kullu valley.
