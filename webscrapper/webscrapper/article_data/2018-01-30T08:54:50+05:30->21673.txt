But, in present system, a large number of multinational companies are involved in it.
 
 Additional chief secretary development, Punjab N S Kalsi said the need of the hour is that after the collection of the data, it should also be supervised by the data controller, which is not covered in the digital data collection policy. He said there are various places where the citizens are sharing their data and the agency, which is collecting it, is not accountable for its security.
 
  commander   said the major issue which needs to be addressed by the data controller is who is collecting data, how it is used and where is it saved. He said that the supervision on the data collection agency is the main area which has to be part of the policy.
