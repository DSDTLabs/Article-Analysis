New Delhi: All services, including emergency unit, came to a near halt at   (DDU) Hospital on Monday after resident   went on an indefinite   to protest attack by relatives of a patient. One doctor and several guards posted outside the casualty ward were injured in the incident.

 Dr Sumit Paria, president of DDU’s Resident Doctors’ Association (RDA) said a woman in her 30’s came to the casualty with complaints of abdominal pain around 11pm on Sunday.
 
 “A doctor attended her, gave medications and referred her to labour room for evaluation of pregnancy-related issue. But the attendants felt they were being ignored, and started fighting with the guards. When doctors tried to intervene, they assaulted them too,” he said. Female doctors had to hide in the duty room to escape getting hurt, she added.
 
 “We cannot work in such an environment,” the RDA president said.
 
 All resident doctors of DDU on Monday skipped work as a mark of protest. “We will join work only when we are satisfied with the security arrangements,” said a doctor.
 
 They were also joined by resident doctors from other government hospitals like   and   among others. The strike will continue indefinitely or till the time a solution has been found to stop such attacks, doctors said.
 
 “Till now, there is no response from the government on our demands. The administration is supporting our cause,” Dr Paria said.
 
 Many patients who were turned away said they empathise with the doctors but said patient services shouldn’t be affected. “My son has been suffering from high fever for the past two days and is vomiting frequently. He needs to be admitted but due to strike , there is no one to listen to us. Where do we go?” Rekha Devi, a resident of Uttam Nagar, said.
 
 In the past, DDU had hired bouncers to prevent attacks in the emergency ward. They have now been replaced with special security personnel. The RDA of DDU claim they are fewer in number.
