The investors, lured with high returns on various investments, had invested in 2008 after which the firm shifted to Mumbai wounding up it’s activities from city. 

 Police said Ingle and his partners had floated a firm by name VV Investment at Bajaj Nagar in 2008 claiming that it would deal with shares and debentures of foreign-based companies, commodities, currencies including dollars. Several customers, including Kadu, had approached Ingle for parking their cash into financial opportunities offered in the foreign lands. Kadu and others were lured by Ingle with high returns on their investments. 
 
 It was shortly after investments were made that Ingle and other moved to Mumbai discontinuing their communications with the city-based investors including Kadu. It was after prolonged efforts, which did not borne fruits, that Kadu and others approached the city police.
