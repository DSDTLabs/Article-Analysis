Gold Coast:   emerged as the new queen of   in   when she powered past Mengyu Yu of Singapore to win the gold medal in women’s singles category.

 
 
 
 
 
 In a ruthless display, the 22-year-old former model, came back from 1-6 down in the first game to win 11-7, 11-6, 11-2, 11-7 to stun the Singaporean fans who had thronged the Oxenford Studio in good numbers.
 
 It was a historic win as she beat Yu, who had won the silver in the last edition. On Friday, Batra had won the silver in women’s doubles.
 
 
 
  
 The Delhi paddler showed great mix of attack and defence and backed herself whenever she was down. From 1-6, she soon levelled it at 7-7, moving her opponent around with her long reach before reeling off four straight points.
 
 “Whenever I’m down I motivate myself and tell myself I can win it,” she said in a courtside interview. “I never thought that they are world No. 4 or anything like that. I played my natural game.”
 
 Asked about her dominating show, Batra, a winner of people’s choice awards at TOISA, said: “I have to stay calm and dominate on my best stroke. I attacked more and today I defended well too. When we started the tournament, our aim was to win the team gold. In singles, I thought it would be difficult. Now that I have won, I don’t have any words.”
