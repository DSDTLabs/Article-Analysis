NAVI MUMABI: An   has questioned the   ( ) on why old and ‘second-hand’   are being used to   a stretch of a pavement near Satra Plaza tower at Palm Beach Road in Vashi. 

 “I have noticed that the broken tiles on the footpath are being replaced with paver blocks which do not look new. They are, in fact, worn out and dull. I want the civic body to inquire as to who is carrying out this work and if there is a racket behind using old paver blocks instead of new,” said RTI   Anarjit Chauhan.
 
 He added that even in the past he has received several complaints from citizens saying that old paver blocks are being used to lay the pavements.
 
 NMMC executive engineer Manoj Patil said, “We have used reusable paver blocks from our old stock to repair the footpath. This is being done in the run up for the FIFA tournament. Since these are reusable tiles money is also saved.”
 
 “As long as one can properly walk on the repaired footpath it shouldn’t be a problem,” he added. However Chauhan said that he has demanded an inquiry into the issue. “I have demanded a full-fledged inquiry on this issue, which includes the work order details, cost of the tiles used and cost of labour
 
 NMMC deputy engineer Umesh Patil said that this was an emergency repair work ahead of the FIFA event so whatever available material was used.
