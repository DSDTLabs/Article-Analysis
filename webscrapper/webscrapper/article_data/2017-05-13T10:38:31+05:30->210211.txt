BHUBANESWAR: The   (BMC) has decided to install   in five big parks, where there are  . The move is aimed at providing   to walkers and fitness freaks and discouraging water bottles inside the park. The decision comes two weeks after the BMC decided to provide ATM water for free in slums. Around 20 such ATMs have been installed in the city's water scare areas to provide safe drinking water. But unlike the slum pockets, people will have to pay for availing water from ATMs in the parks. 

 The open-air gymnasiums are drawing huge crowds. "Although there is water facility inside the park, people bring their own water bottles. Installation of water ATMs will help check plastic waste pollution. It will also relieve people from carrying water bottles," said an officer of BMC, adding, "The Biju Patnaik Park and Madhusudan Park have been identified for the purpose. Three more parks will be identified soon and installation work will start there." 
 
 The BMC has also decided to give demonstration for operation of water ATMs in slum pockets considering that people are yet to be conversant with the operation resulting in its less use. "Each water ATM contains minimum of 500 litres. But in slums, it has been seen that there is surplus water even during summer," said the officer. 
 
 On a given day, maximum 20 litres of water can be fetched using one card. In the first phase, the BMC installed ATMs at Jharana Basti, Gandamunda, jadupur, Dumduma, Pokhariput, Siripur, Ganganagar square, Bhimtangi, Sundarpada and Bhoi Sahim, Barmunda. These pockets had reported jaundice last year. After ATMs were installed, no cases of jaundice from these areas were reported.
 
 The BMC has signed MoU with a private firm Piramal Sarvajal to set up water ATMs. Bhubaneswar is the second city in the country to have this facility after New Delhi. Among the smart cities, it is the first one to introduce the system.
