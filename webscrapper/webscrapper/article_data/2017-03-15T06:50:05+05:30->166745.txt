SURAT: Large number of  , working on contract for   (SMC) and who were released from their jobs as their 85-90 days’ contract expired on February 16, took out a rally to SMC’s main building on Tuesday. They were demanding permanent jobs as they said they had worked for five years without any break and were released from jobs without any intimation. They took out a   under the banner of Daily Cleaning Workers to   main office at Muglisarai and gave a memorandum to   M Thennarasan and mayor Asmita Shiroya, demanding that they be taken back to jobs and made permanent in 30 days. 

 Vinod Parmar, one of the workers, said, “We are all from backward class and dalits. In the past, shudras were treated badly in our society. As a reminder to that, we wore black dress, had pots dangling from our necks and brooms tied to our waist.” He added, “We are not treated well now by our employer. We have pleaded with them in the past too but have not got a reply. But hope to be heard this time.”
