MYSURU: City police have arrested one youth involved in   and confiscated Rs 32.2 lakh from him during a raid on his residence on Friday. 

 Though RC   claimed that the money seized was collected for construction of house,   sleuths seized the money as he didn’t show any record to prove his claim. Four mobile handsets, one LED TV and a currency counting machine too have been confiscated from him. 
 
 Acting on clue, CCB sleuths led by   and   police, raided Jayakumar’s residence in Ashokapuram, during a T20 match between Kings XI Punjab and Sun Risers Hyderabad. 
 
 According to Gopal, the accused Jayakumar, who is into real estate business, failed to give account of cash with him during the raid and hence, the amount has been seized. He can still get back his money from the court if he shows the account of it. The officer claimed that so far the maximum amount seized in cricket betting in Mysuru is around Rs 1 lakh but since, we found huge money with Jayakumar during the raid, we had to seize it. 
 
 Jayakumar organizes cricket betting during   matches through his known people over phone, police said.
