HYDERABAD: Move over traditional dhobi ghats. The Telangana government is preparing ground to distribute latest washing machines to Rajakas i.e., washermen community in the state for mechanised washing of clothes.

 Backward classes welfare minister   has asked officials to work out modalities and submit to him a comprehensive plan to launch and promote in a big way the mechanised washing of clothes among the Rajakas, Gangaputras and other washermen communities in the state.
 
 A team of officials will visit Karnataka where mechanized washing of clothes has been introduced.The plan is to set up mechanized clothes washing centres and hand it over to a group of washermen families to run it after providing training to them.
 
 “The plan is to give mechanised centres contract for washing bed-sheets and other cloth material used in all government and maternity hospitals, primary health centres in the state. In the first phase, only bedsheets from   and Gandhi Hospital will be given for washing,“ said an official.
 
 When contacted, backward classes department joint secretary V Saida confirmed that even suitable locations to set up mechanised cloth washing centres would be identified. Borewells have to be drilled as sufficient water facility has to be provided to these centres. “These are not small washing machnes used by households. They would be big machines that cost anywhere between `10 lakh and `30 lakh depending on the features provided in the machinery,“ he said.
 
 There are about one lakh washermen families who would be benefited by the mechanised washing centre scheme. There is already one such mechanised washing unit operational at   in the city. It was set up on an experimental basis.
