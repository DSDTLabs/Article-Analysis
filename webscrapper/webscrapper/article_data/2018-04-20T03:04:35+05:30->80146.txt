THANE: A 19-year-old student has been acquitted by the district court of   of the suicide of a 16-year-old   with whom he was in a relationship. Additional sessions judge A S Bhaisare held that the prosecution had miserably failed to prove the charges; the girl’s family had accused the 19-year-old of using derogatory words towards her. 

 The prosecution informed the court that the accused was in a relationship with the girl but her family had told him to stay away from her as she was studying for the crucial Class 10 exams. The young man would still make calls and chat on the mobile or computer with the girl and often meet her, said the prosecution in court. 
 
 The court was informed that on October 19, 2015, both the girl and the accused played garba in their locality and about 4 pm the next day she leapt to her death from from her building.
 
 The judge pointed out in the order that there was no suicide note. The judge said the allegations made by the prosecution were not digestible and the deceased had never said anything about harassment.
 
 “There is no cogent and reliable evidence on record to show that accused had tried to defame the deceased by calling her a using a derogatory word,” the judge said. The court said there was no evidence of abetment and called the prosecution case fundamentally defective.
