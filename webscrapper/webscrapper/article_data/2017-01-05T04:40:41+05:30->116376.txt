NOIDA: Disgruntled at the issues of garbage, streetlighting and potholed roads, residents of Sector 137 met the chief executive officer (CEO) of  , Deepak Agarwal, on Tuesday. The CEO has promised to visit the sector this month and speedily handle the issues being faced by the residents.

 In the meeting, residents expressed concern about the pressing issues in the area — haphazard dumping and burning of garbage, broken and badly constructed roads, poor streetlighting and lack of horticulture parks. TOI has previously covered the issues of Sector 137’s garbage dumping problems extensively.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Agarwal admitted that the residents of the sector have multiple issues. “We have discussed these, and I will personally visit and inspect the area so the problems are addressed soon. Till then I have asked other officers to look into the sector’s problems and look for feasible solutions,” Agarwal said.
 
 Nandini Srivastava, a resident of   in the sector, said she and other residents had brought up the issue of the poor quality of water supplied to the sector. “The sector is neglected and most unsafe at night. Garbage from all over Noida is being brought and burned here. We raised our voice against that. We have had earlier meetings with Noida Authority officials as well. The sector has become most hazardous to live in. If nothing is done now, the prolblems will only snowball,” Srivastava said.
 
 TOI had earlier reported how two local waterbodies in the sector were being used as a dumping ground for solid waste. Residents of the sector have also formerly complained of a section of sector 140 being used for dumping solid waste. The authorities had said that the garbage dumping was part of a makeshift arrangement.
 
 “We are hopeful about the proposed visit by the CEO. We hope to get some relief soon,” Srivastava said.
