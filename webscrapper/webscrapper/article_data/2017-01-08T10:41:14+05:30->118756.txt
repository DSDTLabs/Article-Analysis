HYDERABAD: Union external affairs minister   has asked for a report from the   in Saudi Arabia on the case of an MBA graduate sentenced to jail for one year with 300 lashes.   from Malakpet refused to accept the judgement arguing that he was not guilty of stealing his company's cash. 

  TOI had published a story about Hussain's plight on January 3. Subsequently on January 6, Sushma Swaraj tweeted: "I have asked for a report from the Indian Embassy in Saudi Arabia." 
 
 Hussain, 32, was arrested when he went to complain about a theft of a cash of 1,06,000 riyals belonging to his company in a bank. When he went to lodge a police complaint, he was arrested and the court sentenced him on finding him guilty on December 26, 2016. "The court did not examine the CCTV footage at a petrol bunk where my son was robbed of the cash by two men, one of who pointed a weapon at him," his mother, Hoor Unissa told TOI. 
 
 Hussain's friends, meanwhile, have taken a video of the place where Hussain had said the robbery had taken place. The video shows that CCTVs were there at the petrol bunk and that the examination of the footage can prove that the robbery took place. 
 
 The court had reportedly relied only on footage available at the bank, on the opposite side of the road, which had not captured any robbery. The court gave Hussain one month's time to appeal the sentence.
