NAVI MUMBAI: The Panvel City Municipal Corporation ( ) officials have said that there will be no major changes in the voter list. The announcement comes after political parties demanded changes to suit their requirements. The civic administration said it will only allow minor changes like moving a housing society or few houses on the boundaries or limits of some of the wards.

 Rajendra Nimbalkar, the new PCMC commissioner, said that complaints about voters’ list should be made on True voter app and manually as per the format. 
 
 “The deadline to put forward objections has been extended till Monday evening. Mistakes will be corrected, wherever found. Experienced Ulhasnagar municipal corporation officials will be brought in to train the officials for election,” he added.
 
 The political parties had also made allegations about deliberate mismanagement of voters’ list. PCMC administrative officer Ganesh Salve sought voluntary retirement of service after allegations were made but he was persuaded to withdraw his application.
 
 Confirming that he had sought VRS, Salve said, “The allegations are baseless and politically motivated. The parties want PCMC to retain the voters’ lists of the erstwhile municipal council.”
 
 He explained that housing societies or houses existing on boundaries of wards can be included into other wards. 
 
 “Those who have changed their address after the preparation of the voters’ list by election commission cannot be included at their new address. The law prohibits us from making changes in the the voters’ list. The authority is vested with voter registration officers. Minor changes like moving a housing society or few houses on the boundaries or limits of ward can be possible,” he added.
 
 A group of   and left wing   leaders had earlier petitioned the PCMC commissioner about goof-ups in the voter list. A PCMC official told, “We have sought deployment of rapid action force in some sensitive ward such as ward numbers 14, 17 and 20.”
