Kolkata: Investigators on Thursday indicated that legal opinion has backed their   findings to charge actor Vikram Chaterjee for  . At present, Vikram is in prison after an Alipore court remanded him to jail custody till July 24.

 According to a senior officer, “The legal go-ahead for the charges were given after experts examined witnesses’ statements recorded both under CrPC sections 161 and 164 and forensic report that confirm Vikram was under the influence of alcohol on the fateful night and the car driven by him was speeding at 93 km/hr at the time of the crash, respectively.” Cops, however, refused to put a time frame to filing the chargesheet.
 
 Police said, the final draft of the chargesheet was sent for correction to the lawyers for their approval. “There were some points where we want clarification. We had asked for further footage from his press conference where he made certain claims. This will be used as evidence of how he tried to mislead the investigators. The fresh raw footage from a news channel was collected. We have also asked for a clarification from the forensic team on the exact timing when Vikram was seen at the Gariahat crossing just before the   on Rashbehari Avenue. These issues have now been addressed,” said a source.
