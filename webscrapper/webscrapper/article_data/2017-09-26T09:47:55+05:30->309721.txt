  trains in the city are expected to carry two lakh passengers per day when the 30-kilometre stretch between Nagole and   via Ameerpet becomes operational, most likely by November-end. The state government is readying the stretch hoping that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate it on November 28. However, the Prime Minister's Office is yet to confirm the dates.
 
 In the first phase between Nagole and Miyapur,   (HMRL) will run trains from 5.00 am to 11.00 pm every day .Depending on the rush, they might stretch the time by one or two hours. HMRL has fixed the metro train frequency as six per hour at the rate of one train every 10 minutes at each station in each direction.
 
 Hyderabad Metro Rail managing director N V S Reddy said, “Across the world, the experience is that the number of metro rail passengers per day will decrease after the first few months and then go up.Our passenger traffic studies for   indicate that we can expect 2 lakh passengers in these two stretches after the launch date and then go up to 3 lakh passengers per day once feeder service linkages are done.“
 
 “Around 1,000 people may get off from each train. We will increase the frequency of trains to every two minutes in the future after completion of other stretches and corridors.The number of trains per hour too will go up from six to 30hour once the entire 72-km project is completed,“ he added HMRL and L&T have already procured 57 trains from South Korea and they would be deployed as per the need.
