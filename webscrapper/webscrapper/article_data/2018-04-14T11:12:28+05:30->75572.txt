PUNE: The prospect of timely clean-up of a part of the Bhairoba nala stretch — which passes through the Pune cantonment limits — before the impending monsoon, appears to be dim. 

 There has been no response yet to the Pune Cantonment Board’s ( ) notice, released last month, inviting tenders for the clean-up work.
 
 The 21-km long Bhairoba nala flows from near a hill in Yevalewadi and passes through various parts of the city and merges with the   in Koregaon Park. An 8km of this stretch falls under the PCB jurisdiction. DN Yadav, chief executive officer, PCB, told TOI, “We haven’t got any response to the tender notice. We have to go for a re-tendering process and hope to get some response in the coming weeks.”
 
 The nala has been reduced to a sewage and garbage dump. “Apart from the cantonment’s sewage water, locals dump garbage in it. The board has been spending lakhs of rupees every year for its maintenance, but all effort have gone in vain,” a senior PCB official said.
 
 Board officials said cleaning of the nala before monsoon was imperative. “During monsoon, the nala’s condition would be more difficult as it would be totally filled with plastics and mud,” they said.
