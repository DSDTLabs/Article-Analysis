MUMBAI: The chief minister told the legislative assembly on Tuesday that the state has issued a notice to   seeking Rs 550 crore in lieu of unearned income on land once leased to the firm. The area adjoins   zoo.

  
  
 
  was responding to questions on whether land reserved for zoo expansion had been given to developers. “The development plan for E ward (where the zoo lies) was changed in 2004. Land reserved for the zoo’s expansion was divided into two parts. One half (seven acres) was reserved for the zoo. The same amount of land was allotted to retention activity (zoo-related),” Fadnavis said.
 
 The company’s lease on 15 acres adjoining the zoo expired in 2012 (see graphic). The entire land was originally supposed to go to the zoo. In 2004, TOI was the first to report the state’s decision to give   over half the 15-acre plot. The state also decided to give the firm transfer of development rights (TDR) for the remaining seven acres. Citizen groups and environmentalists had protested against the government’s move to let Mafatlal retain any of the land, a crucial green lung for the city.
 
 In 2011, the company sold the land to Piramal Realty for Rs 605 crore. But the collector’s office declared the sale null and void (the land belongs to the collector and the state revenue department). In 2017, the state transferred the land reserved for the zoo to the BMC, but Mafatlal went to court, the CM said. “The company was given permission for parking FSI by the previous government. Also, third-party rights had been created. The state has issued a notice for unearned income. The matter is in court,” he said.
 
 The CM also said that land reserved for the zoo’s expansion had been transferred to the BMC and work on it would begin soon.
