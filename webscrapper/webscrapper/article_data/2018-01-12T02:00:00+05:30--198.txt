PATNA: The mere thought of wetting her hands to wash clothes in the chilly weather sends shivers down the spine of homemaker Poornima Roy. The Boring Road resident finally went to a store near her house and bought a   on Thursday. 

 Roy was not the only one though. With the weather playing truant, tricenarian Amit Singh also purchased a washing machine for his wife. He said, “I don’t remember having witnessed such a weather in the last decade. The water is so cold that it is difficult to wash clothes and dry them.”
 
 Traders in the business claim that the demand for washing machines has suddenly gone up in the state capital. They are available in the range of Rs 8,500 to Rs 25,000. “A lot of Patnaites live in flats where it is difficult to dry clothes owing to limited space. Besides, working women, who leave their houses early in the morning or homemakers, who are busy in household chores, have limited time... Washing machines only make their lives easier,” salesperson Narendra Kumar, who works at a retail shop near I-T roundabout, told this reporter. 
 
 Most of the shopkeepers in the Chandani Market area are finding it difficult to meet the demands of their customers. According to electrical appliances’ dealer R S Jeet, “Demand itna zyada hai ki stock khatm ho gaya... We have placed fresh orders and asked our customers to come back in a day or two.”
 
 Amit Avikal, representative of a reputed brand dealing in household appliances, said, “We ran out of stock. Since we had not expected that the weather would be so chilly, we were not prepared to meet the customers’ demands.”
