Saligao: The   intends to begin constructing a common municipal solid waste management facility at   on land handed over by the  . 

 The   granted environmental clearance for the waste project just last month.
 
 Managing director of the Goa Waste Management Corporation, Sanjit  , has written to the chief officer of the Cacora-Curchorem civic body, asking that the proposed site - measuring 82,750 sqm - be barricaded to facilitate the commencement of construction, even as remediation of existing waste continues.
 
 “In order for construction to start, the remediation of existing waste at the site has to be carried out. At the same time, daily waste being disposed by the council would have to continue,” Rodrigues said.
 
 The Cacora-Curchorem Municipal Council will have to issue a no-objection certificate to the Goa Waste Management Corporation while also providing access for construction equipment to be brought in.
 
 “In order to commence remediation and allow the council to continue treating garbage, it is proposed to barricade a certain area while the remaining space is left open for disposal of fresh waste,” Rodrigues has stated in the letter.
 
 The site has been used as a dumpyard for unsegregated garbage for over a decade. The Goa Waste Management Corporation intends to reclaim the present site through scientific treatment of waste. 
 
 The proposed greenfield garbage treatment facility will have a material segregation and recycling centre, a bio-methanation and composting section, and a scientific landfill.
 
 Though the plant will require water and electricity supply, once operational, the municipal solid waste management facility at Cacora will generate electricity for its own utilisation and will also harness recycled water for its needs, the project proposal states.
