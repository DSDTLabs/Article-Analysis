CHENNAI: The Union water resources ministry has prepared a draft for a mechanism to regulate   water supply and it comes close to the proposed management board, a senior officer privy to the process told TOI. 

 This is contrary to the utterances of the Centre that made an oral submission in the Supreme Court last week seeking two more weeks to prepare the draft. "They are seeking more time so that it can be submitted to the SC after the May 12   assembly election," the source said.
 
 Media reports on Monday also suggested that the Centre might make a submission that the SC itself put in place a mechanism acceptable to all the riparian states. The NDA government is under pressure, with Tamil Nadu demanding immediate constitution of the  , and Karnataka, where the BJP faces a crucial assembly election, resisting it.
 
 The official said the Cauvery 'body' is likely to be headed by an IAS officer or a technocrat. The authority is likely to have five full-time members, including a chairman and four part-time members from the four riparian states, including Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry. "The full details will be presented to the Union cabinet," the official said. "Tamil Nadu need not have any apprehension ... Whatever may be its nomenclature, the scheme will ensure water will be shared by Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and other riparian states as per the SC order," said a senior water resources ministry official.
 
 The Supreme Court had set May 3 as the deadline for the Centre to frame the draft scheme, but the government sought more time.
