NEW DELHI: A political storm broke out on Thursday over the  , an outcome of a wide-ranging probe into Delhi government’s decisions bypassing the LG. Ahead of the civic polls, the findings, ranging from nepotism to financial irregularities, are potent ammunition in the hands of BJP and Congress.

 AAP reacted by seeking concrete evidence, dismissing the opposition blitzkrieg as usual business before polls.
 
 BJP was quick to demand suspension of the   government. “We demand answers from it for taking illegal decisions. It should be suspended and strict action initiated against those who are involved in unconstitutional work,” said Nirmala Sitharaman.
 
 Delhi Congress chief   too called for Kejriwal’s resignation and sought a CBI probe. He said the allegations can be divided into three parts: illegal land and office/residential space allotment on taxpayers’ money, nepotism and sending people on “non-statutory foreign tours”. The party will observe a ‘black day’ in all municipal wards on Friday.
 
 Reacting to the onslaught, senior AAP functionaries said they were ready to be “hanged or sent to jail” if there was any concrete evidence against them. “Before elections, opposition parties come out with such allegations to show the party in poor light,” said AAP national spokesperson  .
