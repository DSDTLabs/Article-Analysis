RAJKOT: Upper caste community including   have bitterly opposed allocation of 1.25 bigha land to Dalits for crematorium in   village near Morbi. 

 A group nearly 1,000 upper caste people, mostly Patidars, organized a ‘dharna’ (sit-in) in the Morbi collector office premises, urging the administration to revoke its order regarding land allocation. As tension built up, police had to beef up security in the collector office.
 
 On Thursday, Dalits had taken the body of a man who died on Wednesday to the collector office and sat on a dharna for hour hours complaining that they had no space in the village to cremate him.. 
 
 The upper caste people claim that the ‘kharavad’ land given for the crematorium is actually the property of the village which had given to them years ago by the erstwhile king. ‘Kharvad’ is a land given to farmers to keep their harvested crop. 
 
 For the past four years Dalits have been demanding the space for a crematorium. Assistant collector had ordered allotting this land for crematorium in 2015 but somehow the possession was not given, following opposition from other villagers.
 
 District collector RJ Makadia’s order triggered opposition from other villagers. Khanpur has a population of nearly 5,0000. 
 
 Khantil Patel, Khanpur sarpanch said, “We strongly oppose the collector’s decision to allot village land for crematorium. The farmers have been using this land for various activities like storing the harvested crop and keeping grass and livestock there. The decision has been taken without taking us into confidence.” 
 
 The villagers plan to visit Gandhinagar on Monday to meet chief minister   to make a representation regarding the issue.
 
 Collector Makadia told TOI: “They have submitted a memorandum to me. This is a quasi-judicial order and they can challenge it in the higher forum. I have forwarded their memorandum to the government.”
