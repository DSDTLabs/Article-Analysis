PANAJI: Accusing the Goa Forward Party-BJP coalition government of being in favour of the “neo-rich elite”,   on Sunday said that the BJP and GFP were trying to destroy the livelihoods of the poor and the middle class in Goa.

 All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary Girish Chodankar said that the statements by chief minister   and town and country planning minister Vijai Sardesai over the last couple of days had exposed the elitist mentality of the coalition government.
 
 Taking objection to Sardesai’s statement that North Indian tourists were “scum of the earth”, Chodankar said that the statement was an insult to Indian tourists who come to Goa and contribute to the economy without creating a nuisance.
 
 “There maybe a few tourists who create disturbance, but one cannot call all Indians bad,” Chodankar said.
 
 He said that several Goans depended on budget tourists, who stay in guesthouses or use vehicles given out on rent by Goans in the villages.
 
 Chodankar also went on to accuse the ruling government of being “anti-poor while only trying to benefit casinos and resorts that belong to non-Goans”.
 
 He went on to state that the government instead of creating new employment opportunities, was snatching away existing jobs as well. 
 
 On Parrikar's statement on how he had begun to fear as even girls were drinking beer, Chodankar said, “Manohar Parrikar calls himself an IITian. Then he should know that any effects of alcohol are gender neutral and no law can ban only girls from drinking beer.”
