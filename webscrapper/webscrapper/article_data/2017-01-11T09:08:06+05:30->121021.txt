GUWAHATI: The Kamrup (Metro)   has prohibited e-rickshaws from plying the main roads of the city from January 20.   M Angamuthu has also asked the drivers of e-rickshaws to get their   by then. 

 There are around 2,000 e-rickshaws in the city.
 
 "I have asked the district transport officials to not allow dealers to sell new e-rickshaws before registering existing vehicles. If someone violates the norms, his licence will be cancelled," Angamuthu, who is also chairman of the regional transport authority, said after meeting the e-rickshaw drivers' association here recently.
 
 The administration also said the vehicles, once registered, could only be used for last-mile connectivity.
 
 "For the safety of passengers and better traffic management, e-rickshaws will only be allowed in areas where there is no other mode of communication. Drivers with valid licences will be permitted to drive the vehicles to ensure safety of passengers," Angamuthu added. The deputy commissioner has also asked the transport department and the traffic police to demarcate the areas where e-rickshaws would be allowed to run.
 
 Meanwhile, president of All Guwahati E-Rickshaw Drivers' Union Biren Sharma said these formalities should be completed as soon as possible. "We demand that the department initiate the registration at the earliest so that our boys could run their business smoothly," said Sharma.
