BHUBANESWAR:   Hota, the placement officer at the   (ITER), was arrested here on Friday in the wake of students unrest over the recruitment scam.

 Police commissioner Y B Khurania said Hota was heading the placement cell at ITER, a college under the Siksha 'O' Anusandhan (SOA) deemed university. 
 
 "Since Hota was responsible for the conduct of campus recruitment, it was his lookout to ensure genuine companies participate in the drive. Others, including functionaries of a Gurgaon-based consultancy firm, which conducted the fake recruitment drive, will also face the music," Khurania said.
 
 Over 300 students, who were offered jobs during campus placement, alleged on Tuesday that the offer letters were fake. On Wednesday and Thursday they staged demonstrations outside the campus demanding Hota's arrest. 
 
 Hota, who was a chemistry professor at ITER before being appointed as the placement cell's additional dean, insisted that he was innocent.
 
 "Our institute earns global recognition. We never promoted fake job agencies to select our students for jobs. We are conscious of SOA's reputation. I have sincerely and honestly been overseeing the campus recruitment drives since 2003. This time a fake agency took us for a ride," Hota, 52, told the media at Khandagiri police station. He was picked up from his office at the institute.
 
 "There was no deliberate fault on our part. There was no financial bungling by us as we did not collect any money from students to sit in the campus interview," Hota said.
