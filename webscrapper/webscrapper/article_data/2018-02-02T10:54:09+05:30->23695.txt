PANAJI: Christiane Nusselein-Volhard, awardee of the   in medicine in 1995, said that   in science has to be carried out just to understand complex issues of life on earth and need not only be done directly aimed at improving mankind. Nusselein-Volhard, who won the Nobel prize for identifying and classifying 15 genes that direct growth of cells into more complex living beings, was speaking at the opening of the Nobel Prize Series India 2018 in   on Thursday.

 “I think it should be pointed out that science is not always directly aimed at improving mankind, and often not in the first instance meant to improve mankind. I think basic research should be pointed out as a very important part of science where it is not directly aimed at discovering something helping in medicine or agriculture or technology, but just to understand complicated issues in biology, which has been quite important to fundamental research, which then later on led to important medical discoveries,” said the German scientist.
 
 Nusselein-Volhard said that, in her research, she started out just to satisfy her curiosity about how a simple unstructured egg developed into complex organisms.
