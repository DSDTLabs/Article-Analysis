SURAT: Members of social group crusading for   have urged Union minister of state for   Jayant Sinha to start   from Surat to Jeddah to cater to   of  . 

 ‘We Want A Working Airport at Surat’ (WWWAS) office-bearers in their letter to Sinha said there was good potential for growth for Jeddah flights as pilgrims travel in huge numbers from south Gujarat and north Maharashtra every year for Hajj. 
 
 WWWAS said around 2,070 Hajj pilgrims travelled from various districts in south Gujarat including Surat, Tapi, Valsad, Navsari, Bharuch and Narmada in 2015. Its data showed that around 1,976 people travelled for Hajj pilgrimage from Dhule, Nasik, Jalgaon and Nandurbar in northern Maharashtra during 2015. In 2016, the number of pilgrims for Hajj from south Gujarat increased to 2,900, whereas more than 2,500 pilgrims travelled from northern Maharashtra. 
 
 The WWWAS members stated there is huge potential for international airlines to tap Hajj pilgrims from south Gujarat and northern Maharashtra by starting direct flights from Surat to Jeddah. At present, Hajj pilgrims travel to Jeddah via Mumbai international airport. 
 
 WWWAS member Sanjay Jain told TOI, “Hajj pilgrimage is held only for a month. Pilgrims have to travel long distance from interior villages in south Gujarat and northern Maharashtra to reach international airport at Mumbai, since there is no facility for international travel from Surat.”
 
 Jain added, “The runway extension work is likely to be completed by May 2017 and the customs notified status is expected in the next two months, when Surat airport will be ready for limited international flight operations. We have requested the minister to convince international airlines to start direct flights from Surat to Jeddah.”
