GURUGRAM: The department of   has decided to launch an extensive drive to  , hotels and shops selling edibles without any licence in the city.

 A rough estimate suggests that there are at least 300   — mainly bakeries, sweet shops, street vendors, tea stalls and such other small outlets that common people visit frequently — across Gurgaon are running without licence. 
 
 During the crackdown, which is likely to kick off later this month, officials will inspect all shops and restaurants to check the quality of   or beverages served. Also, officials will check if outlets have registered themselves with the department and whether they have validity licences. Shops found without a valid licence will be sealed and a case will be registered against their owners.
 
 “We will carry out random inspections of shops and collect food samples. Also, we will check their registration and licence details. Owners will be prosecuted in case of any violation,” said Dr KK Sharma, the food safety officer, Gurgaon.
 
 In 2014, the department had directed owners of all hotels, restaurants and shops selling eatables to registered themselves under the Food and Safety Act 2006 and obtain licences from the authorities. The department has extended the deadlines to apply for the licence six times in the past three years, yet many eatery owners failed to abide by the order.
