BHOPAL: Chief minister   might have won hearts of hundreds of girl students by taking selfies with them during ‘mil banchey’ campaign on Saturday, but boys had a grouse that CM sidelined them.

 A number of boys of Classes 6 and 8 of Sanjay Gandhi School in Bhopal’s Shivaji Nagar where ‘mamaji’ took lessons, aired their grievances to TOI. They rued that Chouhan not clicking a selfie with them made them feel that the gesture was a biased one.
 
 “We are not happy because ‘mamaji’ did not spend time with us and also did not ask us to take pictures with him. He had many selfies with girls but not a single one with us,” said Ashish Merkham, a student.
 
 Another student, Aditya Choudhary of Class 8, said that CM did not even come towards them when he was teaching. “It was kind of favouritism that ‘mamaji’ completely ignored the boys while paying attention to the girls. Even in his address, he told girls that he loves them but did not deem it necessary to tell that he has the same feelings for us,” he said with an upset face.
 
 Boys have appealed to Chouhan that he should give them equal attention during his next visit to the school.
