Madurai: Four days after a nationalised bank near Vilakkuthoon was robbed, police are yet to make any arrest in the incident. 

 Meanwhile, the CCTV footage of the theft got leaked and has gone viral on social media networks.
 
 The incident took place in the Indian Bank main branch located on East Avana Moola Street on Monday afternoon. 
 
 Based on a complaint from the assistant manager of the bank G Seenivasan, 49, a case was registered with the Vilakkuthoon police station the same day.
 
 The leaked video shows a man entering the branch as soon as a couple of customers leave. 
 
 All alone, the man wearing a cap, tries to reach out to the cash bundles kept on the desk. He fails in his first attempt. 
 
 He then climbs on the desk in the second and third time to successfully reach the cash bundles. 
 
 He keeps the bundles in a dark coloured shoulder bag. Although there are many cash bundles, he leaves with just two bundles. 
 
 Police officers said that three teams formed by them have been conducting inquiries. 
 
 The culprit would be arrested soon. They said that details of the customers, who came to the branch at the time of the incident are being scrutinised. 
 
 Apart from tracking the culprit, they are also inquiring the role of any bank employee.
