If you are pretty, the least that can happen to you are linkups! So, the series of men linked with Tolly’s girl-in-the-woods,  , doesn’t surprise me. First, she was thought to be dating  , then it was   and now, another name has cropped up from nowhere. Gossip mongers tell me she is fast friends with south actor  , who acted with her in the web series, Six. I don’t know if it’s for friendship’s sake that she is also concentrating on south cinema and has started shooting for the Telugu film, Aatagallu. What I do know is that she bowed out of the TV series Bhoomi Kanya without informing its makers and turned down Anjan Dutt’s Finally Bhalobasha. I guess, finally, it’s bhalobasha that matters.
