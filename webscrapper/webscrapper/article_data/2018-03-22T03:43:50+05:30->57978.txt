NEW DELHI: The Centre has filed a fresh affidavit in the Delhi   opposing the   granted to  .

 Last week, HC allowed the Centre’s plea to take the fresh affidavit indicating a change of stand on record and delete the last affidavit filed in 2011. The earlier affidavit had supported the notification of National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions (NCMEI) granting it the status of a minority institution.
 
 Reversing its stand, the fresh affidavit relies on a previous decision by the   that said, since the university was set up by the Act of Parliament, it cannot be granted a minority status.
 
 HC has been hearing a petition since 2011 challenging the NCMEI minority status of the university. The petitioner has argued that the panel had wrongly accorded the status to the varsity.
 
 “The institution, created by an Act of the Parliament, cannot be declared a minority institution,” the petition filed by Vijay Kumar Sharma argued. 
 
 A change in the stand of the HRD ministry came after it sought a legal opinion a few years ago from the then Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi. The AG had opined that Jamia Milia Islamia is not a minority institution as it was created by an Act of Parliament.
 
 Rohatgi too had quoted the 1967 Supreme Court judgment included in the latest affidavit that said   is technically not a minority institution and the same principle should be applied to Jamia Milia Islamia.
