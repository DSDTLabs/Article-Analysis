MUMBAI: A month after the massive debacle in municipal council, corporation and panchayat samiti polls, the   and   have drafted a joint plan to keep the   at bay in elections to the zilla parishad president and vice-president on Tuesday. According to a source, the Congress may not hesitate to secure or extend support to the   wherever possible to ensure that the BJP does not gain control over the zilla parishads. 

 The BJP has secured a clear majority in Latur, Wardha and Chandrapur, while the NCP in Pune and Satara, Congress in Sindhudurg and Sena in Ratnagiri zilla parishads.
 
 State Congress president Ashok Chavan said an understanding has been reached between the Congress and the NCP for Nanded zilla parishad. As per the agreement, Congress will secure the president's post and the vice-president will be from NCP. "Our efforts will be to keep BJP out of power," Chavan said.
 
 Though Chavan was non-committal, a statement issued by the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress stated that a decision was taken by the party to support Sena wherever possible to restrain BJP from securing control over zilla parishads. "There is no open support to Sena but an understanding has been reached at the district-level. We have worked out a power-sharing formula with the NCP and the Sena. The president's post will be given to the party that has maximum seats in the zilla parishad," a senior Congress leader said.
 
 A BJP leader said that if the Sena supports the Congress or NCP in the zilla parishad elections, it will be unfortunate. "In BMC, we had extended support to the Sena in the mayoral elections, we expect a similar gesture in the elections to the zilla parishads," he said.
