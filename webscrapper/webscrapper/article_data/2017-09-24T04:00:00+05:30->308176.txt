Rajkot:   

 According to police, accused Salman Gameti (22) and Arwind Solanki (30), both residents of Ramdevpara in Junagadh, intercepted the motorcycle of Haresh Luhana (61) and Rajen Gadhiya (26) and robbed them of their cash at knife point. 
 
 “Both Luhana and Gadhiya had taken the cash from an angadiya firm and were taking it to their company when the robbers intercepted them on their bikes. The robbers seemed to have been keeping track of their movement and were in the know of the cash they were carrying,” Junagadh crime branch inspector R L Rathod said. 
 
 The LCB officials and the officials of A Division of Junagadh police swung into action soon after lodging of the loot complaint. They checked the CCTV footage of the crime and tracked down the accused. “After arresting them, we recovered Rs 6.65 lakh from them,” Rathod added.
