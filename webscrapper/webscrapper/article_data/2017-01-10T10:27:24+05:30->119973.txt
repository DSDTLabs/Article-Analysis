Panaji:   of Secondary and  , in a new circular, has warned heads of institutions against   allotted to them during the board’s class X and XII  . The board has also said that teachers will not be allowed to pick and choose duties to be allotted to them during the examinations.

 “It is essential that all teachers should work in any capacity during the board examination as there is no seniority maintained. It has been observed that deputy conductors/chief moderators etc refuse to work as invigilators as well as during assessment and hence it is the duty of the heads of the institutions to instruct their staff accordingly to co-operate,” the circular states.
 
 The circular also states that secondary school teachers will not be allowed to supervise for higher secondary examinations and vice-versa. The board utilizes nearly all teachers teaching from Class IX to Class XII for supervision and assessment related responsibilities during the public exams.
