Italian director   says director   should be ashamed about replacing actor Kevin Spacey from 'All the Money in the World'.

 During the world premiere of his restored film 'Last Tango in Paris' at an International Film Festival, Bertolucci criticised Scott's decision last year to replace Spacey with actor Christopher Plummer. The decision came after Spacey was accused of sexual assault by more than a dozen men. 
 
 According to reports, Bertolucci said when he learned Scott had agreed to erase all of Spacey's scenes in the film, his first reaction was to message Scott's frequent editor   "to tell Scott that he should be ashamed".Bertolucci thought Scott was succumbing to pressure. "And then I immediately wanted to make a film with Spacey," said the director. 
 
 Bertolucci said he agrees with the #MeToo movement and praised it for bringing awareness to violence against women around the world.After the allegations against Sapcey, Scott decided to reshoot a number of scenes in nine days, with Plummer in the role of J. Paul Getty replacing Spacey. Plummer's performance earned him an Award nomination for his work and Scott was widely hailed for removing Spacey from his film.
