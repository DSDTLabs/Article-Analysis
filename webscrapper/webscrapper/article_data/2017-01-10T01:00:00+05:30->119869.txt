Posing for Dabboo Ratnani’s calendar is almost like an annual routine for the who’s who of Bollywood. This year too, the ace photographer has united B-Town’s biggest names for the venture. He says, “There’s a lot of ideation that goes behind creating each image.” BT brings you four exclusive photographs from his calendar this year: 

 About Sonakshi Sinha’s action-packed look Dabboo says, “Last year, she had gone tribal with colours on her face and this time, she will remind you of Hilary Swank in Million Dollar Baby.” Varun Dhawan’s look, the photographer explains, is a tribute to George Michael. “We styled Varun like George in the 80s, with the denims, the hair and the cross...,” Dabboo says. 
 
 
 
 
  
 “While in Germany, I saw a biker with a dog in his side car. I sent Bachchan sir a similar image as a reference point. The next day, he was ready with a biker jacket and his entire get-up on!” Dabboo says.
 
 
 
 
 
  
 Dabboo recalls, “I saw some worn-out tyres at a shop and decided to do something with them. I set them up at the studio, created window light, and decided to go black-and-white with the image. This pic is synonymous with the professional space he is in right now.”
