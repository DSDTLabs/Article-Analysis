Your garden   are getting arty and fancy. Hanging   and holders; tea cups to grow terrariums (aka bottle gardens) are the ultimate low-maintenance way of growing indoor plants. While traditional terracotta remains the most popular choice for plant holders, everyday items like shoes, plastic bottles and crockery are being repurposed to grow your greens. 

 
 
 
 When picking a pot, make sure it complements the plant inside it and the room you keep it in. This season, get some eclectic blues or oranges or go for a green-blue Mediterranean look – especially if you are putting together a group of plants. Think of colours and shapes that work well together and be bold with design. One of the key trends for this season is about unusual combinations of patterns and textures. Pick eclectic mid-century ceramic pots and vases. If you want to get funky, use some old bottles, tea cups and plastic shoe planters. 
 
 This is the best time of the year to try some plant-scaping before the summer sets in. For cheerful containers, you can do some DIY with powdered pigments in different hues. Bowl planters look good kept in the kitchen or bathroom. Macramé plant hangers are made from rope or woven yarn and act as a decorative sling for pots. Even fashion a fancy herb garden with some funky small pots. You can keep a big concrete pot with light-coloured plant to highlight crisp white accents of your patio, which helps lighten your outdoor space..
