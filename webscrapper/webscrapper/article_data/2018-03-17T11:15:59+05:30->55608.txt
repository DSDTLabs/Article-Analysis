BATHINDA: The truck operators in the district are up in arms against the state government’s policy of not allowing truck unions to file tenders for loading and transportation of wheat during the upcoming procurement season.

 The truck operators under the banner of the district truck operators union, held a protest outside the   district administrative complex and burnt the copy of the policy on Friday. The wheat procurement season starts from April 1.
 
 They alleged that as per the new policy framed by the   government about loading and transportation of wheat, only the societies formed under the societies act with at least 10 year experience could file tenders.
 
 Terming the police as anti-operators, they have decided not to file tenders for loading and transportation of wheat. The last date for filling tenders is March 21.
 
 Before being disbanded,   had 134 truck unions with 93,000 trucks registered with the now defunct bodies.
 
 Tehal Singh Buttar, who claimed to be the president of the district truck union, said, “The wheat-loading policy framed only recently is anti-truck operators and detrimental to their financial interests. We strongly oppose it and have decided not to file the tenders till truck unions are allowed to fill tenders. We have expressed our anger by burning the copy of the policy and will keep on protesting against it”.
 
 Scores of truck operators raised slogans against the state government and claimed that truck unions were still working but the government wants them to starve.
 
 Bathinda deputy commissioner   said, “We have asked the operators to fill the tenders but if they not come forward, we have made alternate arrangements and the procurement season will run smoothly”.
