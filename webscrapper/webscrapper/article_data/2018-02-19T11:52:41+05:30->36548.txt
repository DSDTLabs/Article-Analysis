  : An   of approximately Rs 1.2 crore was approved at the Davorlim-Dicarpale gram sabha held on Sunday. 

 The panchayat secretary   told TOI that "the annual budget of Rs 1.2 crore and the audit report were approved by the gram sabha members. The proposals submitted by the village development committee (VDC) approved during the panchayat meeting were taken up for discussion. These pertained to the construction of a new panchayat ghar, health centre and a police station. Gram sabha members felt that the existing panchayat ghar be demolished and the new one be built at the same site. 
 
 It was also proposed to have a market auction of the sopo collection wherein the local traditional fish and vegetable vendors will not be charged." 
 
 "The garbage issue also came up for discussion wherein the sarpanch informed that there would be change in the timings of the garbage collection and assured the villagers that the black spots would be cleared. Another issue discussed was the letter received by the panchayat from chief minister  's office and the captain of ports (CoP) clarifying that the river nationalisation was only intended for river navigation and assured the villagers that this project would not affect the livelihood of the Goan traditional fishermen. The gram sabha had passed a resolution firmly opposing both coal handling and river nationalisation," said the panchayat secretary. Only eight members in this 11-member panchayat attended the meeting.
