MUMBAI: The   has penalised 19   almost Rs 35 lakh, in all, for shoddy barricading of various civic projects in the city. Most of the projects were in the eastern suburbs.

 There were 28 spots where the penalized contractors were carrying out work. Also, to make projects easily detectable to motorists and pedestrians, the BMC has now come up with a solution: Putting in place colour-coded   to inform people of the nature of civic work ahead. Thus: Blue will be for hydraulic engineering; yellow for roads, traffic, and bridges; green for sewage operations; and red for storm water drains. According to the BMC’s rules, barricading of infrastructure work is mandatory to ensure the safety of pedestrians and motorists. Also, the cost of installing barricades must be borne by the contractor.
 
 While inviting tenders for a project, the BMC mentions the clause that during its execution if it is noticed that the contractor has not provided adequate barricades, a penalty of Rs 1,000 per metre per day will be imposed.
 
 The amount is supposed to be deducted from the bill due to the contractor. Also, if an accident occurs due to the non-installation of barricades at work sites, leading to injury or loss of life, the contractor’s engineer incharge is liable for police action. “The Rs 35-lakh penalty was imposed for all kinds of work undertaken in the city since October, after last year’s monsoon. 
 
 We are now looking at contractors who haven’t placed barricades around civic projects in the western suburbs,” said a BMC official.
