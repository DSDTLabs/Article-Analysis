BHUBANESWAR: While the state government is getting ready to present its annual  , many of its departments could only manage to spend around 55 per cent of the funds allocated to them for the 2017-18 fiscal by December end.

 "By December-end, programme (planned budget) expenditure under agriculture and allied sector is pegged at 56.24 per cent, while it is 55.62 per cent in infrastructure and 52.05 per cent in social sector," a source in the finance department said.
 
 Asked about the reason for non-utilisation of funds, the source said there was over 20 per cent increase in annual budget allocation for programme expenditure. "Because of higher allocation of funds as compared to previous year and low expenditure incurred in respect to some new schemes owing to administrative hurdles, the expenditure has come down," said a finance department official.
 
 Talking to TOI, finance minister   said spending in infrastructure sector was low as there was initial destabilization for some months when the goods and services tax (GST) was implemented in July.
 
 "As the contractors and executing agencies were not acquainted with the  , construction activities were hampered for some months after July. Since things have become stabilized now, we are hopeful that volume of spending will be expedited by various departments,"   said.
 
 The minister added that spending by various departments would be taken into account while allocating budget for the 2018-19 financial year.
