HYDERABAD: A new   —   — is the new buzzword in   across the world with discussions raging over how to adopt the model locally. In this method, a teacher breaks down concepts and goes ahead with other chapters only after every child has grasped the idea.

 The Shanghai method shot into spotlight a couple of years ago after 15-year-olds from the Chinese city performed better than counterparts from other parts of the world in the triennial Programme for International Students' Assessment (PISA) test.
 
  say the theory focuses on equality. “If this method is about progressing to next lesson after every one understands, that means it’s talking about equity in understanding. This can be suitable for classes with less than 16 students, In India, a middle-path between Shanghai method and local methods is better,” said  , educationist.
 
 The method cuts Math teaching time in school. There is continuous assessment of students as they solve sums. The method also requires teachers to undergo specialised training for at least five years to get command over the technique. There should be continuous assessment of students if anyone lacks in performance and they need to be trained separately, we don’t have this continuous assessment, he said.
 
 Some experts say while the idea also caters to needs of poor students, local conditions may not adapt. “Our students are from different cultural and regional backgrounds. In this context, it is not possible to adopt one particular direction,” said Ramabraham, owner of an educational institute. He said the method would be more effective in support classes where teachers could identify gaps that needed focused practice.
 
 However, there is also criticism that this method puts additional pressure on students and teachers and results of PSA test are not really impactful.
