Last week, fans reeled from the shocking news that the   Film Chamber of Commerce (KFCC) had decided to ban the release of superstar Rajinikanth-starrer ‘
 ’ in Karnataka in the interest of the state. 

 According to reports, the chamber stated that Rajinikanth’s opinion on the Cauvery issue has reportedly hurted the sentiments of Kannadigas. Now, actor  , who has been vocal about several issues lately, has raised some important questions regarding the ban imposed on ‘Kaala’ in Karnataka.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Taking to Twitter, Prakash Raj wrote, “What’s film #kaalagot to do with Kaveri issue..?why is film fraternity targeted always..?Will Jds/congress government let fringe elements take law into their hands ...like bjp did with #Padmavat ..or ..will you step in to assure common man ..his right for choice.”
 
 It must be noted that the Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy has also reacted to this issue. Addressing the media last week, Kumaraswamy stated that the people of Karnataka and KFCC were against the release of ‘Kaala’. He said that few pro-Kannadiga outfits have also sought a ban against the film and that he would take a decision based on this.
 
 Reports also suggested that the President of 
  Producers’ Council Vishal and Prakash Raj have initiated talks with the KFCC regarding the release. 
 
 Prior to this,   reacted to the issue and said, “The Karnataka chamber is part of the South Indian Film Chamber (of Commerce). Definitely, they will intervene and solve it amicably.”
 
 Directed by Pa Ranjith, ‘Kaala’ is produced by Dhanush’s Wunderbar Films and is slated to release on June 7, 2018.
