Actor   and his son   were spotted at producer Sajid Nadiadwala’s Juhu residence earlier this week. The father-son duo had a closed-door meeting with the filmmaker, understandably about Ahan’s debut venture, which will be backed by him. The discussion, we’re told, lasted a few hours and plenty was exchanged between the trio. A lot has been speculated about Ahan’s first film and his preparations for it. After this meeting, we hope an official announcement is underway.
