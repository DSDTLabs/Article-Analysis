NAVI MUMBAI: The civic body has finally woken up to the  . NMMC has started filling   on the 4km  , parallel to the   along the Parsik range, between Mukand junction and Rabale.

  NMMC officials said they have carried out the repair work. 
 
 Executive engineer Sanjay Desai said, “We have deployed our men and machinery to carry out the pothole-filling work with grit and metal besides asphalt wherever possible as the ground has not dried up completely. We will finish the work in the next couple of days. As this patch will be concretised after the rains, we are doing temporary patch work.” 
 
 The Public Works Department too has kicked off the paver block laying work at various places in Turbhe, Shirwane, Vashi and Kopra flyover, following a comparatively dry spell on Tuesday. 
 
 With rains playing truant, Public Works Departmen has adopted the conventional method of laying paver blocks at battered spots, including Turbhe, Shirwane, Vashi and the low-lying Kopra area, along Sion-Panvel highway which has been giving motorists a back-breaking ride. 
 
 As asphalting work has been a failed attempt due to the rains, paver blocks seem to be the viable option, said Public Works Department sources.
 
 “Intermittent showers have hampered the repair work. However, our men are on their toes to fix paver blocks in the pockmarked spots,” said one of the Public Works Departmen engineers. 
 
 Meanwhile, members of the Panvel Sangharsh Samiti have threatened to stage a dharna if the potholes on the Sion-Panvel highway are not immediately fixed.
