Actor   said she has lots of aspirations like a 12-year-old child and one of the things that top her long list is doing a movie with which she can 'take a bow'.

  
  
 Sen, who was last seen in the acclaimed 2015 Bengali film   (Speechless), said she owes it to her fans who continue to shower her with love and admiration. 
 
 "I have many things to do. I have to do a film with which I can take a bow. I would like to give back all the love... 
 
 "I owe it to the people who love me. It doesn't matter if they are five or five thousand. I have to do a film for them and make sure that it's a huge hit. I'm taking my time but I'll do it," Sen said. 
 
 "I want to learn skiing and parallel bar gymnastics. I want to go back to diving," she added. 
 
 The actor was talking on the sidelines of the ongoing 'fashion show. 
 
 She said she feels blessed to be still asked about her next film, as there is a norm that the career of an actor is over 'when they reach a certain age'.
