Ahmedabad: After a graft case was registered by the state anti-corruption bureau (ACB) against a ‘gram sevak’ and a computer operator working at Kuvarla village, the agency has extended its probe to other villages situated nearby to ascertain whether the accused were involved in similar crimes elsewhere. ACB on Saturday got two-day remand of the accused.

 ACB’s team in Banaskantha had nabbed gram sevak Lata Prajapati and computer operator Ramesh Chaudhari on Friday, when they had collected Rs 20,000 from a group of farmers to send relief forms filled by them to higher authorities. A total of 65 farmers had approached Prajapati and she had allegedly demanded Rs2,000 from each.
 
 ACB sources said that the investigation so far have found evidence that similar modus operandi was employed at nearby Jivana and Magarva villages. Prajapati was working in a cluster of five villages and thus each village will be probed. Investigators have also found audio recordings where the accused talk about their cut in a project, and name of a few farmers who had paid them money.
 
 “It is still early to say whether the scope of the case has increased from current demand of Rs1.3 lakh and the accused receiving Rs75,000. It is possible that similar demands might have been made to other farmer groups as well. Prajapati is still on probation and had joined the job four months ago,” said an official. After the ACB trap, the state government had removed Chaudhari, a contract employee, and had sought report from ACB to take action against Prajapati.
