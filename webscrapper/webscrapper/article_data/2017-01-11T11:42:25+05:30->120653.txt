PANAJI: Hundreds of government employees are joining citizens in the queue at the inward section of the   with requests to cancel their posting for   on February 4.

 North Goa collectorate has received over a thousand requests in the past three days, leaving elections officials in a quandary. By Tuesday afternoon, the request forms at the collectorate were exhausted.
 
 A disabled government employee was standing in queue at the counter for a request form to cancel her assigned duty. “I won’t do overnight duty with my condition,” she said, furious that the collectorate had run out of request forms.
 
 There was another case of a middle-aged teacher, who was given two postings and was at the collectorate to request the cancellation of one of the two duties. “How can I report at two places,” he said. He was appointed as polling officer and also included in the flying squad.
 
 Additional collector I (North Goa)   said that they would “consider the requests and decide on case-to-case basis, and only genuine requests will be granted”.
