NEW DELHI: The Election Commission has virtually set a sixmonth deadline for the   to decide on its next president, refusing any further extension beyond June 30 for the party to complete its organisational elections.
 
  In effect, this means the Congress must settle the   question by then, unless it decides to contest the EC in the matter. While the EC cannot just force an election down the Congress system, the party will also have to weigh the worth of confronting the EC on this issue.
  
    has accessed the EC’s last communication to the Congress dated January 5 which was a response to the party’s request for an extension of the current working committee. “In this regard… the commission has considered your request and has directed that the party may complete organisational elections of the party by June 30, 2017.
  
  It is further informed that no further extension may be granted.”   has been at the helm of the party since March 1998 and is the longest serving head of the grand old party.   Gandhi was made the party V-P in January 2013 at the Jaipur Chintan Shivir.
  
  Sonia’s term ended on December 31, 2015, but the party kept her on an extension, delaying organisational   ostensibly waiting for Rahul to make up his mind. On December 16, 2016, the Congress decided on an another extension and sent a letter to the EC explaining the reasons for the delay in conducting party elections.
  
  But the Commission seems to have taken a firm view this time. “Your party is directed to complete the organisational elections of the party and submit the complete list of office-bearers, members of committees… latest by July 15, 2017.”
