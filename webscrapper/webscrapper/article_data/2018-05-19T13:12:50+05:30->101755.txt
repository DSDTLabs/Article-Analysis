He gave a written letter to the samiti members inviting them for a meeting with experts from the department of law at Jaipur on Saturday. "Chief minister Vasundhara Raje had insisted for Chaplot's presence in the meeting and hence trusting the minister's words, the samiti members gave their consent and the hunger strike was withdrawn," said  , vice president of  . However, a faction of lawyers who were unaware of the late night development were annoyed about the culmination of hunger strike and tore posters of Chaplot and even blackened his face in pictures put up at the dharna sthal. "People have their right to express their views in a democratic setup and everyone needs not necessarily agree with any decision. We have not stepped back, however a chance has to be given to the government to listen to their views.

 Bar officials said that if talks don't bring any positive result, samiti would continue its protest and hunger strike would resume.
