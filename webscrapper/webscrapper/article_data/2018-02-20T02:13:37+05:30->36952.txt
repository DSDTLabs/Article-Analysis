KOLKATA:   by Enforcement Directorate on shops of   and brands owned by the Mehul Choksi-run company continued for the third consecutive day with the agency seizing jewellery and documents related to stocks. ED sources on Monday hinted that fresh raids will continue.

 ED officials searched the premises of   Jewels and its brands at five malls in the city. While the company has downed its shutters at showrooms in the state, it kept open the shop-in-shops inside some malls in Kolkata.
 
 Rajib  , one of the owners of a Gitanjali Jewels franchisee in  , claimed that the company still owes him money. After he opened the showroom in 2008 and invested Rs 1.5 crore towards the stocks, he started receiving jewellery. While it went on smoothly in initial years, trouble started from 2011. “The trouble was mainly with the payments,” he said.
 
 Gitanjali Jewels could not be contacted for a reaction.
