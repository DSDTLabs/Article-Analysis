NEW DELHI: The   order in June last year which refused to drop office-of-profit proceedings against 20   MLAs, saying it was of the “considered opinion” that the legislators did hold “de facto the office of parliamentary secretaries from March 13, 2015 to September 8, 2016”, was critical to deciding the case.

 Even as AAP MLAs argued that they had derived no financial or other benefits as parliamentary secretaries until the   quashed their appointment, the   government’s decision to push a bill declaring posts of parliamentary secretaries to be outside the ambit of 'office of profit' with retrospective effect may have weakened their case. 
 
 The attempt to put in place a legal shield failed as the President declined assent to the bill. According to a home ministry official, any exemption of a post from the purview of 'office of profit' has to be pre-defined and cannot be enforced with retrospective effect. 
 
 Also, the rather extensive submission by the Delhi chief secretary before the EC detailing expenses incurred on discharge of duties by the 20 AAP MLAs as parliamentary secretaries, even though they did not draw any salary or use an official vehicle, may have hurt AAP's case. 
 
 The MLAs took more than a year to respond to the Delhi chief secretary’s contentions while the EC too did not insist on a deadline.
 
 An 'office of profit' petition must be moved before the President who then forwards it to the EC for its opinion. The EC, being a quasi-judicial body, seeks written responses of the respondent and allows hearings after which it conveys its opinion to the President on whether the post held by the MP/MLA constitutes an office of profit. 
 
 The advice of the poll panel is binding on the President.
