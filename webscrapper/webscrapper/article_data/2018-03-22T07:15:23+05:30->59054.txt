 Eminent tax consultant, Mukesh Patel, along with principal chief commissioner of income tax – Gujarat, A K Jaiswal, and other senior DGIT officials and representatives and heads of various tax professionals’ associations, were present at the event.
 
 Praising e-assessment, Jaiswal said, “It was PM Modi who introduced the idea of a faceless assessment system. It is from there on that the department has given a commitment to make it possible. Taxpayers and tax professionals have to work together. The department will not hold back, once the system is created in each and every aspect.”
 
 While delivering the keynote address, Kumar said, “E-assessment aims to eliminate the human interface between taxpayers and tax collectors. The new processes will increasingly bring transparency and efficiency. Stakeholders have welcomed the initiative as it would be a win-win situation for everyone.”
 
 “There would be e-verification of information before commencement of scrutiny process to ensure only deserving cases that are noncompliant go through the scrutiny process and the genuine taxpayer is not inconvenienced,” Kumar said.
 
 Most importantly, said Kumar, “E-assessment will also aim at eliminating the concept of fixed jurisdiction. There will be no fixed jurisdiction and it would be decided dynamically depending on the function to be performed.”
