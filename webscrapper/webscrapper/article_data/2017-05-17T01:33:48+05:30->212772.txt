MUMBAI: In a reprieve to residents of a premium highrise in Parel, the   in an interim order halted BMC’s plan to demolish illegal structures on the society premises, including a gym, movie theatre and party hall. A vacation division bench of Justice Ajay Gadkari and Justice Chandrakant Bhadang asked   to maintain status quo till the next hearing on July 13. 

 The court was hearing a petition filed by   Aria cooperative housing society that represents the 28 members who own 55 flats in the residential tower, challenging the demolition notice issued by BMC. An order pasted on the   on May 9, asked the residents to demolish the illegal constructions on the first and second podium floors in one week or the corporation would pull them down.
 
 The society members said that they had invested substantial money for the purchase of the flats after going through approvals by various authorities. The commencement certificate was issued to the builder Lodha Crown   in 2008. The construction of the tower, including the amenities were completed and following an inspection, BMC issued an occupation certificate in 2011. The residents formed the housing society in 2012 and had not carried out any construction thereafter. In 2014, for the first time, BMC issued notices about illegal construction, followed by another one in 2015. A plea to regularise the illegal structures was rejected by BMC earlier this year.
 
 “The society members were under a bonafide belief and understanding that the structures were legal and had no reason to doubt the authenticity of the documents,” said advocate  , counsel for the society.
