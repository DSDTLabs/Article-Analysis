Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Tuesday directed the state government to submit a report on the alleged violation of human rights of police personnel during the BRICS summit in 2016. Chief secretary and director general of police filed a petition in the high court challenging the jurisdiction of the Goa Human Rights Commission (GHRC) to order an inquiry into the case. The commision had passed the order following a complaint lodged by Aires Rodrigues regarding violation of human rights of police personnel deployed during the 2016 BRICS summit in South Goa. Rodrigues, in his complaint, had stated that the government neglected to cater to the basic fundamental human rights where police were expected to work for long hours and where food for them was cooked in unhygienic conditions. The court directed the commission not to insist on the report from the chief secretary. The court will go through the report and if it finds relevant material for inquiry, it will forward this to the commission for its consideration, Justice N M Jamdar stated. The court can look into what went wrong and if, in fact, police were deployed for 10 hours, during the BRICS summit and whether there are any suggestions for the future, he stated. Advocate general Dattaprasad Lawande argued that the commission has recommendatory powers and had no powers to direct the chief secretary of the government to conduct an inquiry into the matter. GHRC should conduct the inquiry and submit a report to the government for consideration, Lawande stated, adding that there was no clarity on whether GHRC is asking for an inquiry or an investigation into the matter.
