 The event started after special prayers were offered to the village deity, Sivan Nayagi, following which the temple bull was released into arena as the first animal marking the start of event. After the rituals, jallikattu started with about 700 bulls brought from Madurai and neighbouring districts being released into the arena. More than 400 tamers who were divided into 50 member teams with time slots tried to tame them. Successful tamers and bull owners collected their goodies ranging from silver ornaments to brass items, cycles and other gifts. 
 
 According to villagers, the present vadivasal (entrance through which bulls rage into arena) was established in 1957 and the arena was still big enough for all the animals and tamers. They expressed their joy and satisfaction at the return of jallikattu this year.
