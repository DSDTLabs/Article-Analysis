NEW DELHI: A day after news broke that the BJP ally   said the saffron party must learn from the Congress how to build an inclusive society, Twitter's innumerable political mavens began to call him India's "most-accurate weather forecaster".

 
 Why? Because they believe Paswan has in the past correctly predicted the direction of electoral winds. And with the 2019 Lok Sabha elections looming, a negative comment about the BJP from an ally like Paswan must mean something, said people on Twitter.
 
 
 
 Paswan, who heads the Lok Janshakti Party ( ), is known to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds, as it were, acknowledged people on Twitter. That's precisely what makes him, "India's most accurate political expert,   with (the) best prediction track record", said many on the microblogging site.
 
  
  
  
 Many were fulsome in their praise for Paswan's accuracy in predicting the direction of poll winds.
 
  
  
 
 The LJP chief is the best psephologist in the business, people on Twitter said. Psephology is a branch of political science which deals with the study and scientific analysis of elections.
 
  
  
 
 Apparently, quipmaster-in-chief, the RJD's   Yadav, might have been the one to describe Paswan as India's best psephologist.
 
  
  
 
 'Is PM Narendra Modi paying attention?', wondered some.
 
  
  
 Some others on Twitter gave equal credit to the Telugu Desam Party chief Chandrababu Naidu, who last week exited the BJP-led NDA.
 
  
  
 
 Two days ago, Paswan said the BJP needs to follow its 'sabka saath sabka vikas' slogan in letter and spirit. He also held up the BJP's arch-rival, the Congress, as an exemplar of governance.
 
 "The NDA needs to take along all sections of the society. The Congress also ruled the country for several decades by building an inclusive society," said Paswan to reporters on Saturday.
 
 The LJP chief also said the defeat of the BJP in Phulpur and Gorakphur Lok Sabha by elections in UP was a cause for concern.
