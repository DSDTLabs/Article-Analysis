MARGAO: The Curchorem police on Wednesday raided an illegal wood polish-manufacturing unit at   and seized finished goods and raw material worth Rs 4 lakh. The owner of the unit, Baleshwar ‘Raju’  , was arrested. 

 Police sources said when a team raided the premises, no approvals from any of the licensing authorities concerned to operate such a unit were found.
 
 Razak, police said, was earlier employed in a unit manufacturing wood polish in the Cacora industrial estate. When the unit folded three years ago, he hired a room located near the industrial estate and began manufacturing wood polish without obtaining the statutory approvals and licences. He is also believed to have indulged in marketing his product under the brand of the company that had already stopped functioning.
 
 Curchorem police booked an offence against Razak under provisions of the IPC.
