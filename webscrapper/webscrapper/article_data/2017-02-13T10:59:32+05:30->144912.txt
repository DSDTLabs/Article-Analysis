MUMBAI: The railways will use   using a chopper -to speed up work on India's first high-speed train corridor between Mumbai and Ahmedabad as this technology gives accurate data on contours of the land even below vegetation.

 The use of LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) will allow survey of the 508-km corridor to be completed in 9-10 weeks against the normal 6-8 months. It will help the national transporter start ground work on the Modi government's dream project by 2018.
 
 As per plan, the entire cor ridor will be on elevated track except 21 km which will be underground, of which 7 km will pass under the sea.
 
 The survey will be done with a helicopter which carries equipment, including high-resolution digital camera (100 mega pixel), laser scanner and data recorder among others.An official said LiDAR is a remote-sensing technology that measures distance by illuminating a target with a laser and analyzing the reflected light.The GPS unit interacts with GPS satellites to finalize ground control points. “Total flying time for covering the full corridor will be 30 hours. The preparatory work and time taken in processing of data is quite high, still the process allows actual survey of the full 508 km in 9-10 weeks instead of 6-8 months,“ Mukul Mathur, executive director (PPP), railway board, said.
 
 “The advantage of LiDAR is that it penetrates through vegetation to identify the accurate level and contour of land.Cross-section of land can be seen without any foliage which will help plan for bridges etc,“ he added.
 
 Estimated to cost about Rs 97,636 crore, 81% of the funding for this project will come by way of a loan from Japan.
