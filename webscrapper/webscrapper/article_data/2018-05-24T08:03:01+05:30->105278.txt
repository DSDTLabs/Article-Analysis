MANALI: Snow at the 13,050-foot-high   is melting fast and could disappear much by June, according hoteliers and cabbies in this tourist town.

 Lakhs of tourists visit Himachal Pradesh to escape the scorching heat of the plains in May and June, and snow at the high-altitude mountain pass is one of top pulls for them. However, this time around, a thin layer of snow remains at the snow destination, according to locals. "The plateau of   has no snow. Now, tourists are finding snow near zero point, where avalanches took place recently. The cover will disappear in few days. Then, we will take tourists to the northern face of Rohtang, towards  ," a taxi driver, Thakur Dass, said. "It could disappear by June."
 
 Rohtang Pass is the foundation of tourism in Manali. Tourists are ready to pay any amount to see it. As hundreds of tourists do not get a permit to visit Rohtang, they throng tourism and other government offices for help.
 
 The director of Shimla Meteorological Centre, Manmohan Singh, said a heat wave was sweeping the low hills of Himachal Pradesh, and minimum and maximum temperatures were likely to increase in next few days. "The increase in temperature will accelerate the rate at which snow is melting on the peaks. Temperature has increased by about 2°C in the past 24 hours. In Manali, it is 26.4°C," he said.
