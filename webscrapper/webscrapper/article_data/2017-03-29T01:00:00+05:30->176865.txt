 You want your eyes to look noticeable, but not overdone. Donâ€™t let the lashes jump out. Just roll the mascara once and leave it at that. 
 
 
 The office is the last place where you need to show that dramatic smoky eyed look. It will just end up looking like you came to work straight from a party.
 
 
 
  
  
 It may not be the fresh blush that you get after a round of exercise, but this will have to do. For the cheeks, go for a blush in a natural rosy shade. Overdoing the colour is a big no-no.
 
 
 
 Keep the lips matte. Frosty lips do not belong in a subtle   setting. Also, avoid those brick and berry reds. Apart from leaving stains on the   cup, they can also can be distracting.
 
 
  
  
 Pointy talons with nail art are okay for a night out, but inappropriate at the workplace. Keep your nails neat and either go for a French mani or just nail enamel in peach and other soft pastel shades.
