Zee TV’s latest show, ' ', produced by Sooraj R Barjatya’s Rajshri Productions, is a modern-day interpretation of the classic   love story. 

 The male protagonist, Naren ( ) , is on the path of spirituality, seeking answers to questions about life and beyond. Cut off from the world, he is a poor little rich boy. Pooja ( ), the female lead, is a second year BCom student. Outgoing, warm and confident, she is a karate champ, who can also dance like a dream. One day, Naren and Pooja’s worlds meet when his parents are convinced that it would take a girl like her to rouse him from his spiritual slumber and wake him up to the practicalities of the real world. What unfolds forms the storyline of the show. 
 
 Sooraj R. Barjatya says, “The concept of a sage in meditation and a temptress attempting to break his penance is a very limited view of the Vishwamitra-Menaka story. Very few people know of their love story. Our show is set in contemporary times with real, relatable characters. It has elements, however, that can be compared to the classic. We are pleased to have found the ideal Naren and Pooja in Akshay and Sheen. The show is set in Dehradun and Hrishikesh.” Sheen says, “I am a lot like Pooja and so, it’s easier to portray her. Every day, I learn a lot from Soorajji — he helps us understand our characters better.” 
 
 Akshay says he has worked hard on his character. He elaborates, “I worked for eight months to get into the skin of this character. I lost eight kilos and also learnt to ride a bike. While Naren is an animal lover, I am really scared of them. So, I had to develop a fondness for animals, too, to portray this role convincingly. I even stopped watching television and films to be like Naren.”
 
 'Piyaa Albela' premieres tonight and will air every Monday to Friday at 8.30 pm on Zee TV.
