GURGAON: The   has appointed an agency to catch monkeys in a humane way and rehabilitate them to a safe habitat after receiving several complaints alleging attacks by monkeys in residential areas across the city.

 The agency appointed is from Mathura in  . The whole process of catching and rehabilitating the monkeys will be videographed to ensure that no cruel methods are being used.
 
 “A health check-up of the monkeys will be done after they are caught and then they will be moved into the wild in the presence of officials from MCG,” said  , executive engineer, MCG.
 
 Anyone involved in inflicting cruelty on monkeys while rehabilitating or catching them will be penalised. The MCG along with the appointed agency will set up a complaint centre where residents can call and report   menace in their areas. 
 
 On one hand, city residents have been complaining about the increasing number of monkeys, but on the other, animal rights activists have been criticising the MCG for its ways of catching them.
 
 In April last year, a city-based NGO filed a police complaint against the MCG-appointed agency for sedating monkeys with drugged bananas. Earlier, the corporation had tied up with agencies and NGOs for catching monkeys but it has not helped in containing the monkey menace in the city.
 
  In December last year, a 25-year-old man had fallen to his death in a drain after being scared by monkeys. Multiple cases of monkey bites are reported from across the city every year, especially from areas such as DLF phase I & III,  , sectors 23, 55 & 56 and areas near  . 
 
 “Since these areas are located closer to the Aravalis, the number of monkeys there is higher. We get a lot of complaints from these areas and we will start our drive from there,” said an official.
