BATHINDA: A local court on Monday sentenced a converted baptised Sikh religious preacher to 7-year imprisonment in a rape case.

His two accomplices have been sentenced to three years’ jail term each.

 The court of additional sessions judge Parminder Pal Singh also sentenced   to three-year jail term for abduction. Both the sentences will run concurrently.

 Prosecution counsel Harpinder Singh Sidhu said, “Gurpreet Kaur and her mother   of Bathinda has lured the girl into accompanying Kedarnath. He took the girl to Abohar on May 4, 2015, and thereafter to many other places. He raped her for days. The girl’s father made a complaint on May 12 (2015) about her abduction. An abduction case was registered at the Bathinda thermal plant police station. On May 25 (2015), Kedarnath was arrested from Bathinda. After the girl recorded her statement, the rape charges were added to the case along with that of abduction.”
