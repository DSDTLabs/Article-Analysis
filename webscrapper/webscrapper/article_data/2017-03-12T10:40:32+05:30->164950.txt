HYDERABAD: The TRS government will pass a   bill in the ongoing budget session. This was disclosed by chief minister   on Saturday while speaking in the Assembly. He also announced that the state government would urge the Centre to include it in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution (as in the case of Tamil Nadu). 

 In a clear assurance to the Muslim community, the chief minister said the bill was prepared on the basis of inputs from the Sachar and Sudhir Committees. The Backward Castes Commission is examining the nitty-gritty of the bill and legal experts are giving final touches to the bill, he said.
 
 "The TRS government has appointed the Sudhir committee which has studied the backwardness of Muslim communities. As the Constitution does not allow reservations based on religion, we have requested the Sudhir committee to examine the backwardness of these communities. Basing on the Sachar and Sudhir committee reports, the legal experts have prepared a draft bill which will be introduced very soon and passed in the ongoing session," said the chief minister. During the YS Rajasekhar Reddy regime, Muslims were granted 4% reservation in government jobs and education based on their economic conditions.
 
 He said the TRS MPs will bring pressure on the Centre to include the legislation in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution so that it would not get challenged in courts. 
 
 He said that the Scheduled Tribes (ST) reservation bill that is aimed at increasing their reservations to 12% from the present 7.5% will also be passed.   has also promised inclusion of several other castes in the ST category. At present, 9.9% population in   reportedly belong to the ST category which after the inclusion of few other castes is likely to touch 12%.
