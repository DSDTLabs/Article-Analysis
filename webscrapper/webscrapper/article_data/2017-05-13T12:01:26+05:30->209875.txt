 “The departments concerned, along with police, are trying their best to curb human trafficking in Bihar. In June 2016, the state government announced Rs25,000 from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund for every rescued child. The money directly goes to their bank accounts,” he said and added, “The government would surely consider any plan and proposal of the US consulate general, Kolkata and  , an NGO, with regards to human trafficking.”
 
 Talking about prohibition, the CM said, “Many people criticize prohibition and told me it will affect the growth of the state and tourism. I want to ask whether Buddhist or people across the world came to Bihar to booze. From 2015-2016, there has been 68% increase in tourists arrival.
