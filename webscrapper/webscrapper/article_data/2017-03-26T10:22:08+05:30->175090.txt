GUWAHATI: The  , during a central executive meeting on Saturday, sought the creation of a separate autonomous council to safeguard members of the   tribe living outside the Bodoland Territorial Areas District(BTAD). 

 The BTAD was created under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution in 2003 following an accord signed between the Centre, the Assam government and the now-disbanded armed outfit,  . It covers Kokrajhar, Chirang, Baska and Udalguri districts and comprises around 30 lakh people belonging to different ethnic groups.
 
 The Sangha explained that a separate autonomous council would give constitutional protection to the large Bodo-Kachari population living outside BTAD. "Their land and political rights need protection. Their cultural and social identities are threatened because they are deprived of constitutional safeguards provided by the Sixth Schedule. An autonomous council is the only solution," Sangha general secretary   said.
 
 He added that there were about nine lakh Bodo-Kachari people residing along the north and south banks of the Brahmaputra. Khaklari said these scattered settlements should be administered by satellite councils while the main autonomous council would take care of the administration of the large and contiguous settlement of the community outside BTAD.
 
 It was also decided at the meeting that the Sangha would strongly oppose six communities' demand for ST status. These communities are Koch Rajbongshi, Tai Ahom, Moran, Motok, Sootea and adivasi.
