KOLKATA: A biker was arrested for allegedly assaulting a   civic police volunteer and the OC traffic (Bidhannagar) after the accused along with another rider were stopped by the civic cop for riding a two-wheeler without helmets and speeding in  .

 The incident happened late on Friday afternoon. The arrested youth and the pillion rider were passing through AL-BL Block crossing on a motorcycle without helmet and speeding. The civic volunteer on duty signalled them to stop. This apparently enraged the biker and he attacked the civic volunteer. As the OC (traffic) reached the spot, he too was assaulted by the youth. The pillion rider fled the spot as the senior cop sought backup by calling up the control room. A police van rushed to the spot and took control of the situation and the accused was arrested. A case was lodged with the Bidhannagar (East) police and the youth would be produced in court on Saturday.
