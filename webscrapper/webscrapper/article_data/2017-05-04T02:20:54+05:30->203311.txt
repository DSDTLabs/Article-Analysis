MUMBAI: Two   on Tuesday filed a   before the   seeking directions to the Mumbai University to declare the   within 45 days from the date of application. The students even requested that the next exam (Allowed-To-Keep-Term exam or ATKT), in which they had failed, be held at least 15 days after the declaration of the revaluation results. 

 The student duo, Priyanka Mhatre and Machchindranath Patil, also sought 50% concession in the revaluation fees for OBC and SBC students.
 
 Mhatre said students apply for revaluation within 10 days of the declaration of results. “I had sought revaluation of all four subjects in my course and paid Rs 500 for each paper,” she said. “My money was wasted as the revaluation results were not announced on time. In fact, the result of one of my papers was declared on the day of my ATKT exam.”
 
  The lawyer representing the students claimed that it seems a money-minting process as the MU never announces revaluati-on results on time, forcing stude-nts to apply for re-examination.
 
 Director of examinations (in-charge) Deepak Wasave said they have not yet received the court notice on the issue. “This year, law admissions concluded in November and the varsity was forced to hold the examination in January. By the time results were declared in March, students had to appear for their repeaters’ exam,” he said. “This year, the admission process was delayed for the law exam.” But the petitioners claimed the problem is not restricted to law students. tnn
