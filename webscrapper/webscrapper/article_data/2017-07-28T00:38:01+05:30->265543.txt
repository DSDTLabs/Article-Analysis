Jaipur: Rajasthan   has directed additional chief secretary of panchayati raj, commissioner, panchayati raj to be present in the court on August 21 if it fails to comply with its order to give appointment to lower divisional clerks (LDCs) selected in 2013.

 The single bench of Justice M N Bhandari issued the order on a contempt petition by Madanlal Jat and others.
 
 The litigation regarding the recruitment of 11,286 posts of LDCs in 2013 in the panchayati raj department was over the bonus marks to the experienced candidates. The government decision to award of 30 bonus marks towards experience was challenged in the court and the division bench at high court principal seat, Jodhpur found bonus marks to be excessive. It had thus a directed to keep bonus marks limited to 15 only.
 
 The state government challenged the decision of the high court in the Supreme Court through an SLP. The Supreme Court on November 29 last year decided the case in favour of the government decision to grant 30 bonus marks and disposed of the petition.
 
 R K Gautam, counsel for the petitioner said, even after the apex courtâ€™s decision the department has been delaying giving appointment to the selected candidates. The petitioners then approached the court and the court had issued notice. The department in an earlier affidavit had assured the court that those selected would be given appointment by July 15 but has not yet complied with.
 
 The court said it is a serious contempt by the department. Either the department complies with the order or the concerned officials be present in the court.
