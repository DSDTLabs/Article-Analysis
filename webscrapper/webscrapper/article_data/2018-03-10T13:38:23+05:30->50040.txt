PATNA: A delegation of   and Hospital ( ) junior doctors’ association (JDA) met the hospital superintendent on Friday and demanded better medical facilities on the campus.

 “Although an oxygen supply pipeline runs through the emergency ward, it should be available near all the 50 beds there. Considering the flow of patients in the emergency ward, at least 70% of the beds should be provided with oxygen cylinders,”   president Dr   said. 
 
 The junior doctors also demanded the echocardiography facility at the hospital. “Echocardiography is one of the widely used diagnostic tests in cardiology. We often have to refer patients, who require echocardiography, to other government hospitals. This poses danger to the patients with need for immediate diagnosis,” Dr Raman added.
 
 JDA had also made similar demands to CM   during his visit to the hospital to inaugurate centre for excellence (diagnostics) on February 3 this year. The centre has been developed at the cost of Rs47 crore.
 
 Dr Raman said several instruments like cardiac monitor, working monitor and pulse oximeter (instrument to monitor oxygen-level in the body) among others are required to ensure proper healthcare at a hospital.
 
 NMCH superintendent Dr A P   said the emergency ward has adequate oxygen supply. “We also keep 50 cylinders in reserve. Their other demands will be considered,” Dr Singh said.
