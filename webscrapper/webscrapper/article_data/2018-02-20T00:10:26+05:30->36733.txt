Indore: Taking inspiration from the private schools, the state education department has come up with a concept of student exchange   for the government school students. 

 The officials of the state education department have planned this programme to give exposure to the students. 
 
 In the private schools of the city, the students from Indore visit different countries under students   programme and vice versa the students from other countries visit Indore learning about the culture and tradition of India. Taking a cue from the private schools, the state education department has invited over 200 students from government schools of Jammu and Kashmir to visit Madhya Pradesh. 
 
 According to the original concept of the programme, the students live with the host families to get the feel of local food, festivals and other traditions. The exchange programme by education department will not see the involvement of host families instead the students will be lodged at the hostel of Govt Malhar Ashram Higher Secondary School and community hall near Rajmohalla. 
 
  “Student exchange programme has been a concept in the private schools this is the first time students from other state will be visiting MP under an exchange programme for   kids,” said state education department Indore division joint director JK Sharma. 
 
 A control room has also been set up for the same at the joint director’s office to coordinate the visit. The students will start their tour with their visit to local monuments like Rajwada, museum, Lal Bagh palace etc. The education department has also planned to take the students out for a movie on the first day. The district education department has also planned to organise a friendly cricket match for the students along with some cultural programme. 
 
 On the second day, the students will visit Mandu followed by Ujjain on the third day. On the second last day of their tour the students will be taken to IIT and IIM.
