 Bhagyashree, 26, said their   had helped them prepare for the expedition. “We would start at 5am and cycle till 9pm. We interacted with students of 300 government schools,” she said.
 
 The duo covered 18 states and five Union territories and pedalled an average of 100-130km per day. They made up their own secret sign language symbols to communicate on the road.
 
 Recalling their visit a place in West Bengal, Pavan, 26, said: “We met a community of beedi rollers there, whose lives had been ravaged due to soil erosion on the banks of the Ganga. A few days ago, I read that they had opened skill development centres in that village.”
