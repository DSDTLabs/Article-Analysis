BENGALURU: The   ( ), a group of eminent citizens, on Friday released its ratings for 27 MLAs, including five ministers, with   ranking as best minister, and   the best MLA.

 
 B Pac vice-president   said: "This is not a value-based judgment, but an academic study based on data available for the eight parameters we have chosen."
 
 The parameters B Pac had chosen for the ranking are attendance in assembly, starred questions, unstarred questions, percentage of MLALAD fund utilization, perception survey, educational qualification, criminal record and social media.
 
 Of the 27 MLAs (Anekal has been excluded), nine scored more than 75%, 10 scored between 50% and 75% and eight scored less than 50%.
 
 On the issue of Haris' son being in jail for assaulting a man, Pai said: "People will remember the incident and take a call while voting." B Pac CEO Revathi Ashok said this certainly is no certificate of integrity or quality of work undertaken.
