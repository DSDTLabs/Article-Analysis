PONDA: Three days after   school students boycotted classes citing unfit, temporary classrooms, the directorate of education made the school building available to the students.

 The 300-odd students, from classes I to X, were shifted to the renovated school building on Monday. The education department had taken up the renovation work of the   since May 2016 and the students had provided temporary arrangements for the classes. While the primary school students had shifted to a   premise and a rented room near local cinema theater, the middle and secondary school students of classes V to X were accommodated in two, rented, double-bedroom flats at Kelini in the village.
 
 As the six rooms of the Kelini flats were lacking proper ventilation and as the students had to face difficulty due to soaring temperatures, the students boycotted classes last Thursday. A delegation of school parent teachers’ association had also met the director of the education where the director had assured them that some classrooms would be provided within a week’s time, but the department made the classrooms available within three days.  , former chairman and existing member of the PTA, said that there was very less work in the classrooms that was pending which the contractor completed within two days.
 
 Shetye also said that the building houses both the primary and middle-secondary school in the morning session, which is a little difficult for accommodation of all students. Two classes are being conducted in the verandah. The primary section is being asked to conduct their classes in the afternoon session, so as to give proper classrooms to all students.
