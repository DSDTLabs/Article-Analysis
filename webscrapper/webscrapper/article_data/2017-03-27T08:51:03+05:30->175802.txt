MUMBAI: More than three years after a boy ,   (10), got crushed between the lift door and shaft of his building, the Bombay high court ruled the the managing committee members could not be criminally prosecuted for it.

 A division bench of Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Anuja Prabhudessai ordered the quashing of the FIR against the office bearers of Saidham Tower in Nalasopara.The committee had been booked for the offence of section 304 part A of the Indian Penal Code for rash and negligent act causing death, which is punishable with a jail term of up to two years.
 
 “One of the essential in gredients of Section 304A is that the rash and negligent act on part of the accused must result in causing death.The said ingredient is completely absent in the present case as far as the office-bearers and members of the managing committee of the society are concerned,“ said the bench. Though the investigation papers indicate that there was a resolution passed to replace the lift and that repairs of the lift were carried out, even taking the statement of the (the boy's father) as correct, it is apparent that as far as the office bearers and members of the managing committee of the society are concerned, at the highest, the allegation against them is that they failed to replace the lift or that they failed to ensure that the contractor appointed by the society properly maintained the lift. Even assuming that the allegations of omission on their part constitute the acts of negligence, the said omission on the part of the members of the managing committee and the office bearers has no direct connection with the unfortunate incident, which took place in the lift as a result of which the son of the complainant lost his life,“ said the judges. The court added that the investigation would continue against the lift contractor.
 
 The incident goes back to November 19, 2013, when Mohammed Shaikh's minor son took the lift in the B wing of the tower to go to his home.An accident resulted in Shaikh's son getting caught between the ceiling of the first floor and lift.
 
 The court referred to the probe documents and the reports by the electrical inspector (lifts), Mumbai). The report revealed that the lift was in proper condition.
