NAGPUR: MLC Anil   raised a wide range of queries regarding the plight of   (ITIs) in the legislative council on Wednesday.

 Referring to a meeting of education minister with   and   director and officials in December last year, the MLC stated that there is no clarity on the issues discussed and their implementation.
 
 Sole asked how many of the 13 demands put up then have so far been fulfilled and how many committees were set up for them.
 
 Highlighting the issue of vacancies, Sole said the government was talking about skill development but 30% posts were lying vacant in ITIs across the state. “There are 6,000 posts but 2000 are lying vacant. This will have an adverse effect on students,” he said.
 
 On the shortage of seats, Sole said around 5.5 lakh students apply but only 1.5 lakh are able to get ITI admissions. “Whether new ITIs would be set-up or the intake capacity of existing ones would be increased,” he asked.
 
 He also sought to know if the government was planning to make any changes in service rules that have been in place for over 35 to 40 years, promotion policy, wardens at hostels, librarians and the status of materials purchased under the centre of excellence scheme.
 
 Considering the high number of questions, the chairman asked the minister to hold a meeting and resolve the issues.
