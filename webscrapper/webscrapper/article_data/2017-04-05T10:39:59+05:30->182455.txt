NEW DELHI: In terms of fitness, there doesn't seem to be any issue with Delhi Daredevils ace fast bowler  , who attended his second practice sessions with his   team at the Ferozeshah Kotla here on Tuesday .

 The pacer has followed the rehabilitation programme religiously even as the Indian team management monitored his recovery process.
 
 Shami, who is keen to bowl at full steam, showed glimpses of his old self on Monday while bowling a few stock deliveries that climbed up to the batsmen. However, on his first appearance for his franchisee on Monday , he wasn't quite in his elements.
 
 He bowled four overs and gave away 40 runs while taking the wickets of Karun Nair and Englands Sam Billings. He bowled straight, wicket-to-wicket, the odd deliveries moving away from the bat, but it wasn't quite a Shami performance.
 
 However, Shami looked a different bowler on Tuesday . He gave away fewer runs and was in control while bowling against Billings, who was in full flow. On a Kotla pitch that didn't offer much help to the fast bowlers, Shami ran in without showing any sign of tiredness, which must have pleased the Daredevils camp.
 
 “I am feeling good with today's session,“ Shami said while refusing to comment further on his preparation. “The more you bowl, the better you will get,“ is how captain Zaheer Khan put it and Shami certainly needs to bowl more to get back to his elements. To his delight, his team is backing him to the hilt. “Shami is already getting better and our team is confident to see him in full flow,“ GMR's TA Sekar added.
 
 On Tuesday , Australia's Pat Cummins attended the practice session both as a batsman and a fielder but didn't bowl a single delivery . On the spin front, Shahbaz Nadeem continued to impress and so did wicket-keeper batsman Sanju Samson.
