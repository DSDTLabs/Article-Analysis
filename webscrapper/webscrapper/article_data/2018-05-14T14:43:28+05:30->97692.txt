PATNA:   and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party ( ) national chief   on Sunday described the higher judiciary as a closed system and pleaded for additional arrangements in the existing collegium system to give greater representation to SC/ST and other deprived sections of the society in the appointment of Supreme Court judges.

 “It seems there is no opportunity open for those from deprived sections of society in the appointment of judges in the country’s higher judiciary. The collegium system has failed to fulfil the desires of the deprived sections,” Kushwaha said and added, “The perception is that senior judges use the existing collegium system to appoint their inheritors. There is much in the collegium system that requires change to accommodate other sections in the appointment of judges to the apex court.”
 
 Kushwaha said similar concerns have also been expressed by the country’s President, among several other people.
 
 Recently, the appointment of judges in the Supreme Court raised controversy, as the central government returned the name of Uttarakhand high court chief justice K M Joseph that was sent to it by the collegium for his elevation to the apex court. In returning Justice Joseph’s name, the central government had also requested the collegium to take into account other considerations, like giving representation to other regions of the country.
 
 Given the backdrop, the RLSP has decided to organize discussions on the overall situation prevailing in the higher judiciary in ten state capitals, beginning with Delhi on May 20, followed by Patna on June 5 and later Lucknow. “It will mark the first phase of our campaign for reforms in the higher judiciary,” Kushwaha said.
 
 Among the speakers would be experts and informed people. The Patna meet would be held at  . “The aim is to inform people concerned about the problem and the situation so that they appreciate the need for reforms in higher judiciary,” Kushwaha said.
