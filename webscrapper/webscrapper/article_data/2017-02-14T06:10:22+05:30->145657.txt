MUMBAI: As the last date to submit   of a   of   Chhatrapati Shivaji closed on Monday , the state government extended it for a second time, pushing it to February 22.

 The initial deadline for submission of bids was January 13, but it was extended to February 13. Officials said that so far 13 bidders have come forward and have submitted applications.
 
 However, many more have expressed interest and have sought time to submit their bids for this complicated, first-of-itskind project.
 
 The state government had invited tenders to build the Rs 3,600-crore memorial of Shivaji in the Arabian Sea. An official from the public works department said it is a global tender.“We got many inquiries from companies interested in undertaking the project. We decided to extend the deadline so as to give them time,“ said the official.
 
 Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had earlier announced that the first phase of the midsea statue project is slated for completion by 2019 and the second phase by 2022.
