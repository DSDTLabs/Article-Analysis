JODHPUR: A bride-to-be and five members of her family, including four women, were   when their car rammed into a truck  . All six of them died on the spot. The car was mangled in the   and victims’ bodies were stuck in it.

 The deceased included a bride-to-be who was going to Jodhpur with her family members to purchase clothes for her wedding, which was scheduled for next month.
 
 According to police, the victims belonged to Falki village in Nagaur district near Merta and had left for Jodhpur early on Saturday morning in two cars.
 
 “The ill-fated car that met with the accident was carrying women of the family. After crossing Bilara, when they reached village Bhavi around 10 am, the car collided head-on with a truck in an attempt of overtaking,” police said.
 
 The collision was so intense that the car turned into a mangled mass killing all six persons on the spot. Hearing the loud noise of crash, the villagers from nearby areas rushed to the spot and informed the police.
 
 “The victims have been identified as Sharda (23), Chuki Devi (40), Annu (35),   (35), Geeta (35) and Mohan Ram (40), who was driving the car, died in the collision,” said police, adding that the driver of the truck fled from the spot.
 
 Family members travelling in another car reached the spot in no time. With their help police identified the victims. They also informed the family back home.
 
 Ironically, Sharda, the bride-to-be, had shifted to the car which met with the accident barely a few minutes before the mishap as she preferred to sit with the women of the family.
