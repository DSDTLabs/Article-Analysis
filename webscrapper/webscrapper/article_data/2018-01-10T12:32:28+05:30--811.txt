Barwani:   of election symbols to six independent candidates of   municipal council in Dhar district on Tuesday has left them worried. 

 On January 6, symbols were allotted to six independent candidates in the fray of councillor in Dhamnod municipal council’s ward number 5, 7, 10 and 14. But due to technical snag they were allotted another symbol. 
 
 The candidates, who were allotted the election symbol again, are worried since they have already campaigned with the old election symbol and have got printed lots of election material. Independent candidate of ward number 10, Uma Vijay Singhal, said that she is planning to raise the issue before State   and approach high court. She had got election symbol 'tent' on January 6 and now her election symbol is 'camera'.
 
 “I have already campaigned with the symbol tent. Now, since my symbol has changed, the person who has got it will be benefited instead of me,” said Uma.
 
  Pawan Girwal, whose wife is contesting the election as independent candidate from ward number 14, said “We got printed the election material by mortgaging our jewellery. Now it has become useless. I don’t know how the Election Commission will calculate our expenditure because now we will have to shed more money due to the new election symbol.”
 
 Some candidates appealed the returning officer that their symbol should be put on EVMs and it should not be changed. “It was a technical fault due to which the series of symbols on EVMs did not match with the electoral manual handbook so with the permission of state election commission the symbols were re-allotted to the candidates on Tuesday,” returning officer PN Parmar told TOI.
 
 Alleging a foul play in the matter, another candidate Sunita Patel fighting from ward number 7, has complaint about the issue to Chief Election Commissioner.
