 “The crisis concerning the appointment of the external examiner for the promotion of the three JRFs began when one of the recommendations to choose an external examiner was rejected without providing any rational reasons.

 He added that as per the   guidelines, this threemember bench including an external examiner is recommended by the supervisor of the respective research scholar. However, in the present case, these norms were violated, and the supervisor had got no authority in the matter.
 
 However, after the meeting was convened, the authorities agreed to the demand of the students and resolved that the supervisor should be advised to give a panel of six experts for promoting the three PhD scholars to SRF.
 
 It was also decided in the meeting that the chairperson of the department will forward the names of the experts chosen by supervisor to the vice-chancellor, who will then give the final approval. Moreover, it was said in the meeting that the dean of faculty of science will be made the member of the expert panel to decide on the promotion of the JRFs.
