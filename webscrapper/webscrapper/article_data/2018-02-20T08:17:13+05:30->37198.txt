AMRITSAR: With Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh meeting Canadian Prime Minister   here on Wednesday, surroundings of the Golden Temple are being cleaned day and night.

 Amarinder on Monday directed the district administration to roll out red carpet for Trudeau and his delegation during their Amritsar visit. He also directed the administration to ensure that the Canadian PM and his family were extended all courtesies befitting their status and asked the officials to ensure the best of facilities to make their visit to the holy city a pleasant and memorable one. 
 
 With the meeting of two leaders, political observers here are of the view that it would baffle the Sikh separatist elements, who had unleashed a malicious propaganda on social media against the Punjab government, especially after Amarinder had refused to meet the Canadian defence minister   in April 2017 by calling him a Khalistani sympathizer.
 
 On the other hand, SAD spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema said that party president Sukhbir Badal would also welcome Trudeau during his Amritsar visit. “He has done a lot for Punjabis, especially for Sikhs, and we want to express our gratitude towards him,” said Cheema.
 
 Meanwhile, the district administration and SGPC task force carried out a security rehearsal ahead of Trudeau’s visit. Chief secretary of the SGPC Roop Singh said committee president   would receive Trudeau, his family and rest of the Canadian delegation at the   side, from where they would be taken to the sanctum sanctorum of the Golden Temple in a security cordon. Trudeau would spend about an hour in the Golden Temple and would also visit Sri Guru Ramdas Langar hall. After paying obeisance, the SGPC would honour Trudeau and his family at the information centre of the Golden Temple.
 
 The SGPC will also gift books on the lives of the four Sahibzaadas to the children of the Canadian PM and shawls to the Trudeaus.
