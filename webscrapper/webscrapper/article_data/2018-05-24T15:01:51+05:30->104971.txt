Model-turned-DJ Barkha Kaul, who was recently in Jaipur to perform at a private club, spoke to us about the challenges that she faced while switching her career and her long association with Jaipur. Barkha says, “I have a strong connect with Jaipur as I used to travel once 
  for some or the other fashion show. In 2001, I used to visit the city for professional commitments but due to my frequent visits, gradually it became my second home. I have made so many friends here, few of which have become like extended family members. I have done endless fashion shows here. And the association still continues; now, I come to Jaipur as a DJ, twice a month for musical gigs.”

  Barkha switched her career from being a model to become a DJ in 2008. Talking about it, she says, “There is no denying the fact that modelling is a very short-lived career. And one cannot look young, have a perfect body and a fresh face all the time. Getting old is an inevitable part of our lives and the sooner you realise it, easier it is to accept. It was not an overnight decision but I realised that I should look for an alternate career as its better to retire gracefully. While taking up modelling assignments in 2008, I started taking projects as a DJ, as I always wanted to do something related to music.”
  
  
  Barkha, who did a course in music production and has also started grooming classes to train youngsters, says, “Today when I meet models who started their career with me and are still doing some small assignments to sustain themselves, I feel I took a right decision at the right time.”
