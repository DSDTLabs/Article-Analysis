BUXAR: Social activists, intellectuals, litterateurs and students took out a candlelight march in   on Sunday evening in protest against the acquittal of accused in the case of murder of advocate Prem Prakash Sinha. The processionists were led by Sinha’s widow  . 

 Sinha’s colleagues also staged protests on the civil court premises on Monday. “We will boycott the court work from Tuesday in protest,”   secretary Ganesh Thakur told newsmen.
 
 The advocates said Sinha was shot at in November 2015 by miscreants who had earlier tried to molest his daughter. He later succumbed to his injuries. An FIR was lodged against six people, including a driver of the civil court.
 
 In protest against the murder, the local civil court advocates had boycotted the courts, including the lok adalat, for a fortnight to press for the arrest of the culprits.
 
 Family sources alleged the miscreants murdered Sinha because he had refused to withdraw the FIR lodged against them for their molestation bid on his daughter.
 
 All the six accused were, however, acquitted by the additional district judge-VI on March 31 as the prosecution failed to prove their guilt.
 
 Urmila Devi, however, alleged it was “gross miscarriage of justice”. “My daughter and I have the right to know who killed her father and my husband,” she said.
