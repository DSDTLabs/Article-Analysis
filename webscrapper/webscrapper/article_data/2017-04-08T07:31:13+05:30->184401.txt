RANCHI:  , considered a state rich in mineral resources but plagued by law and order problems, pulled out a surprise on Friday afternoon when it bagged a special award for the most   in India in 2016.

 The jury for the   on Friday named Jharkhand, alongside Uttar Pradesh, in the category for the most film-friendly state for its new film policy “that promises to give incentives to film-makers across India and provides growth opportunities for local film-making talent within the state”. 
 
 When contacted, state public relations department secretary Sanjay Kumar said it was a proud moment for the state. “We feel proud to see that our endeavours to promote film-making in the state through a policy which is just a year old has got a recognition,” Kumar added. 
 
 Drafted and implemented in 2016, the state film policy was mired in controversies when it laid down hefty charges for shooting in the state. Amid an outcry over several home-grown directors, including the ‘Gangs of Wasseypur’ fame Zeeshan Quadri, the Raghubar Das government rolled back its policy and replaced it with a fresh one promising heavy grants to film-makers. 
 
 The PRD on Friday said it has released over Rs 5 crore to various film-makers as incentives under the film policy for shooting in the state. ‘Begum Jaan’, the first major Bollywood film to be shot in Jharkhand, has been given a sum of Rs 2 crore as part of the policy. 
 
 Notably, the award comes a day before the producer, director and actor of ‘Begum Jaan’ are to meet chief minister Raghubar Das in Ranchi. Das has thrown for a gala dinner for the cast and crew of the film.
