BENGALURU: The February 4 Bengaluru bandh call by Kannada activists demanding Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention in the Mahadayi water dispute has left the farming community divided.

 While Kannada activist   says Bengaluru will witness adawn-to-dusk bandh if Modi doesn’t solve the Mahadayi issue by February 3, farmers’ leader and   president   said his group will not support the bandh as it has a personal motive. “Vatal Nagaraj has not contacted us or taken our opinion. We have different plans for that day,” Chandrashekar told TOI.
 
 
 
 
 On January 25, Karnataka had observed a bandh on the same issue and Nagaraj had said his supporters will protest in Bengaluru on February 4 when Modi is scheduled to address a public rally. “An assurance by the Prime Minister will stop us from going ahead with the bandh,” Nagaraj told TOI.
 
 When asked how he expects Modi to respond to him, Nagaraj said: “It’s not necessary that Modi himself speaks on the issue. We have many   MPs from the state and Modi can send the happy news through them.”
 
 When asked on organizations supporting the bandh on February 4, Nagaraj said, “We are in touch with other organizations and the right decision will be taken at the right time,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, Kalasa Banduru Nala Mahadayi Raitha Horata Samiti president Lokanatha G Hebsuru said: “We have given a February 3 ultimatum to PM Modi before which he has to intervene in the matter. If he does not, around 2,000 farmers will come from Dharwad and surrounding areas to Bengaluru and try to gherao him and display black flags.”
