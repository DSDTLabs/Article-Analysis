COIMBATORE: After a three-decade struggle,   on Friday demolished 28 houses built on railway land at Kadalaikara Sandhu in Coimbatore and reclaimed 375sqft of land.

 Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel evacuated the families from the buildings located parallel to the railway tracks near the   before the demolition drive.
 
 Railway officials said the initial deadline was January 12, which was extended to January 26. The date was again extended after another request. “We have been trying to evacuate the encroachers for several years. Their initial demand was to provide them with alternate housing. The state government took up the cause and constructed houses for them at Vellalore. The dwellings constructed by the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board were ready to occupy, but the residents refused to shift to the houses. Even on January 12, when we tried to evacuate them, some politicians intervened and asked us for a month’s time,” said an official.
 
 The railway department had issued several notices and even blocked the sewage and drainage canals of the houses to prompt the residents to shift from the place. However, the residents, most of whom were daily wage labourers, refused to budge.
 
 It prompted the assistant engineer of the   to seek the help of RPF on Friday.
 
 “The residents were given a prior notice and none raised any objection. They vacated the place and shifted to homes at Vellalore,” said a railway official.
 
 Before moving, the residents said that many of them make a living by doing small businesses set up around the railway station. They wanted houses allotted close to the location and said Vellalore is very far.
