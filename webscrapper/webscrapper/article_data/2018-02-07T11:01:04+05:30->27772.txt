BHUBANESWAR: Ahead of February 24 by-election at   assembly constituency in Bargarh district, the election commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday ordered removal of the district SP Jugal Kishore Banoth. On January 30, a delegation of BJP led by   minister   had lodged a complaint with ECI that the district SP, collector and some other government officers were acting like a political agent of ruling BJD.

 TOI possesses a letter, sent on Tuesday by chief electoral officer   to the state home department, seeking recommendation of a panel of three names of IPS officers, one of whom can be posted as Bargarh SP to ensure free and fair conduct of the by-poll. The home department has immediately asked the DGP R P   to recommend the names of IPS officers, report of which will be sent to ECI for approval.
