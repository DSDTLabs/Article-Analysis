PUNE: A government nursing college student lost her life as her head banged against a road divider after her scooter skidded off the road at   in   on Monday afternoon.

 The helmet of the victim, Shital Pavan Said (22), was found locked to her scooter. “Had Said been wearing the helmet, her life could have been saved,” said assistant inspector   of the Bhosari police.
 
 Jagdale said newly-wed Said was a third-year student of the nursing college. “She was living with her parents at   in Moshi for pursuing her course,”   said, adding that her husband worked in Mumbai.

 He said Said’s head banged against the divider. “She fainted at the spot and started bleeding from ears and nose. Some people rushed her to a nearby hospital, where Said was declared dead,” Jagdale said.
 
 He said Said died because of head injuries. There were no injuries on her other body parts. “We found her helmet locked to the scooter. We did not find any scratches on it. She was not wearing the helmet while riding the scooter,” Jagdale said.
 
 He said Said was married about six months ago.
