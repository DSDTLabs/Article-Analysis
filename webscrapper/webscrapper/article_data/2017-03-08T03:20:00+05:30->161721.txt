Panaji: The Corporation of City of Panaji (CCP), on Tuesday, constituted two separate teams – one to clear the backlog of tax defaulters and the other to clear the city’s footpaths from encroachment.  Taking notice of the growing menace of encroachment by hawkers and shopkeepers, the CCP constituted a 10-member team led by taxation officer Paulo A Rodrigues to clear the footpaths.  “The team will be responsible for clearing the footpaths within the city limits,” the notice read. The body also constituted a separate team to tackle tax defaulters by appointing deputy commissioner Geeta S Nagvenkar as the in-charge of a 10-member team.  “Citizens are not paying regular taxes to CCP and huge amounts are pending. Various steps have been taken to recover the dues,” the notice, undersigned by commissioner Dipak Desai read.
