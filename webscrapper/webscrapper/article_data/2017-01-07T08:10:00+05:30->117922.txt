Ghaziabad: Mayawati’s   on Thursday released its final list of candidates for Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad, sounding the war bugle for arch-rival and faction-ridden  , whose leaders’ open bickering have apparently left the ruling outfit’s rank and file confused. 

 While the contradictory lists released by the SP top guns have only added to the confusion, the rival parties have only added fuel to the prevailing confusion.
 
 The SP has released three lists since March 2016 for the twin districts, which are going to polls on February 11 in the first phase . The first list of candidates for eight seats in the two districts released in March last year included Ashok Chauhan from Noida, Congress turncoat Vikram Bhati from Dadri, and Bavan Naagar, a woman candidate, from Jewar. However, Vikram Bhati (50) passed away in May 2016 during treatment at AIIMS following protracted illness. In the last week of December, Mulayam Singh’s younger brother Shivpal Yadav announced another list of candidates for the entire state in two instalments — 325 names on December 28 and the remaining 78 names on December 30. UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, who has been at loggerheads with Shivpal, released his own list of 235 candidates on December 29. In all the three lists, which have been declared so far, there have been reshuffles and changes only for Loni and Sahibabad seats of Ghaziabad district. 
 
 Local party workers believe a clearer picture will emerge only after the party takes a final call on whether it wants to enter into a pre-poll alliance or go it alone in UP. But the delay, party workers fear, may cost the SP dearly, leaving little time for campaigning.
