Bathinda: Moga police have placed five cops, including a station house officer (SHO), under suspension after accusations of extorting money from a relative of the owner of a hotel near Singhewala village on Moga-Kotkapura road. On May 1 evening, police had raided the hotel and found a couple in a compromising position.

 Sources said the couple was let off after extorting money and police took along one Sukhpreet Singh (20) of Umriana village, who is related to the hotel’s owner and was sitting there at the time of the raid. Policemen allegedly assaulted him up at the police station. He was let off after the cops were allegedly paid Rs 70,000. Sukhpreet had to be admitted to Moga civil hospital.
 
 Police suspended Charrik SHO Harry Boparai, assistant sub-inspector Harwinder Singh and constables Gurjit Singh, Onkar Singh and Jagmohan Singh after it was found that they had extorted money and kept the youth in illegal confinement. Sources said police had also picked up the entry register and collected CCTV footage from the hotel. Sukhpreet’s father, Ranjit Singh, had complained to Moga deputy superintendent of police (DSP), who informed the senior superintendent of police (SSP) about the matter.
 
 Moga SSP Rajjit Singh Hundal said, “The cops were found guilty of misbehaviour and taking money from the relative of the hotel owner. An inquiry has been marked to Moga DSP.”
