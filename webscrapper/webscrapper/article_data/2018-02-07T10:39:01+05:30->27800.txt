LUDHIANA: A 1984 Sikh riot victim’s family from a village in Moga has levelled allegations at a press meet here on Tuesday against the   (LIP) MLA Simarjit Singh Bains for helping a woman grab their flat in Dugri Phase-3. The family has also accused Bains of forcing them to give their flat on rent, or sell it at half the market rate.

 Parminder Singh (a family member of the 1984 riot victim) — who was accompanied by   spokesperson   — exclaimed that his family was allotted a flat in Dugri Phase-3 in 2013 by the then government under the red card holder scheme for 1984 riot victims.
 
 However, two months ago, it came to his knowledge that some women had taken illegal possession of his flat. But when he raised an objection, they showed him a slip by MLA Bains to justify their stand. “After being denied justice from several departments, we approached local Congress leader  , who gave us an assurance that he would put pressure on the local administration officials to provide us justice at the earliest. I also approached  , but no avail. In fact, I even apprised MLA Bains about the illegal possession, but instead of helping me, he forced me to give my flat on rent, or sell the property at half the rate,” said Parminder.
 
 Meanwhile, Brar has slammed Bains for helping land-grabbers. He also played an audio recording between Parminder and the lady staying in the flat. Bains denied the allegation, and said: “I have asked Parminder to adopt the legal procedure to get the flat vacated, if it belongs to him.”
