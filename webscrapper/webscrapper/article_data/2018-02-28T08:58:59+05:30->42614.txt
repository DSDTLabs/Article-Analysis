BENGALURU: Jai   alias  , 38, was initially a truck driver in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka and known to target single women, especially highway sex workers.

 A resident of Konasamudram village of   taluk, Salem district (Tamil Nadu) and father of three daughters, he was first arrested by Tirupur police in 2009 for allegedly raping and murdering a woman police constable.
 
 Investigation revealed that he had earlier raped and murdered at least three women. He was lodged in Coimbatore prison as details of more heinous rapes and murders came to light. Most of his victims were from Salem, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri, Tirupur and Namakkal, all in Tamil Nadu.
 
 In 2011, Shankar managed to give a slip to Coimbatore prison police when he was being taken to a local court. Later that year, he attempted to rape a woman in a Chitradurga village but her husband and other villagers caught him and handed him to the cops.
 
 Chitradurga police shifted him to Central Prison, Parappana Agrahara. Investigation showed he was involved in two other rape and murder cases in Karnataka. He was convicted in three cases of robbery, rape and dacoity in Tamil Nadu. The maximum prison term awarded ran up to 10 years. 
 
 Trial was under way in nine cases in Tamil Nadu and three in Karantaka. He was accused of raping and murdering two women in Bengaluru Rural district.
 
 Shankar, convict number 5483, escaped from Parappana Agrahara in the wee hours of September 1, 2013 when he was lodged in the prison hospital. He managed to reach the terrace, leap off the building and jump off a 30-foot high compound wall. The jump left him with spinal injuries, hindering his getaway.
 
 When he was picked up five days later from a hut in Kudlu Gate, less than 3km from the jail, Shankar was in a police uniform he had stolen from prison.
