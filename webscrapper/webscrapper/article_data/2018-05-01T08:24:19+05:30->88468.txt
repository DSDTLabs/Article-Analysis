LUCKNOW: Around 100   have found themselves   after   was merged with the   in UP last week.

 
 Sources said that while all other officers and staff had retained their designations while being shifted to the commercial tax department, the inspectors had no role in the new office and without a designation, they would not be entitled to a salary.
 
 “A cabinet decision was taken to merge the two departments in the wake of GST implementation, under which the work of both departments came under the common head. Under this decision, around 600 employees of the entertainment tax department would be transferred to commercial tax on the same designation. However, there is no post of inspector in commercial tax which is why the department was suddenly stuck with some 100-odd people who it couldn’t decide what to do with. The cabinet did not take cognizance of this fact when it cleared the proposal to merge the two departments,” said a senior official.
 
 Sources said that the posts of the inspectors would be converted to ‘dying posts’ under which they could at least draw their salary.
 
 “Once their salary issue is taken care of, a long-term solution to the problem will have to be thought of. These officials will have to be given some post so that they are able to work,” said an official.
 
 A senior officer in the commercial tax department said that it used to have inspectors several years back but with changing tax regimes, they were converted to commercial tax officers.
 
 “A dying post is one which will end with the retirement of the particular official. This, however, cannot be a final solution to this problem as these officers will also be required to do work and unless they have a post, how can they work,” said the officer.
