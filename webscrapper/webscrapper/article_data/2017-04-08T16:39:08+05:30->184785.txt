Filmmaker   says he is disappointed after ' ' didn't win at the National Awards, but says that his feeling was personal and not directed at any particular person. After the announcement yesterday, Mehta had taken to Twitter to express his disappointment over his film's snub, which invited criticism from some sections, who felt that the director shouldn't have posted it online. 

 However, Mehta, whose film ' ' won him the National award for best director in 2014, has clarified that he was not complaining. "When I expressed disappointment about the National Awards it was personal and not directed at anybody. I would like to believe that the jury has done its best within their understanding and framework," Mehta tweeted on Saturday.
 
 
  
 'Aligarh' was not considered worthy in that framework by the appointed juries just like 'Lunchbox' was ignored in the year that 'Shahid' won two National Awards. I didn't complain then and I'm not complaining now either. I've got to respect the decision and move on." 
 
  
  
 
 Mehta's film 'Aligarh' is based on the life of an AMU professor who was sacked on charges of homosexuality, received a lot appreciation. 
 
 The 48-year-old director says what hurt him most was National Film Awards chairperson Priyadarshan's comment that most   movies this year were themed around homosexuality and did not highlight social problems, unlike some regional movies. 
 
 "This statement is disturbing and insensitive. It makes you wonder and worry about LGBTQ rights and their absence in the current mindsets as social problems," Mehta posted. 
 
 He said, "Priyadarshan sir 'Aligarh' did not meet the standards set by you and your jury I accept that but your views on homosexuality not figuring as a fantastic social issue rankles."
