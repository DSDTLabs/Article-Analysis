MUMBAI: The Islamic festival of   which falls on Saturday is when Muslims send   for Prophet Mohammed. It is believed that archangel Gabriel escorted him to heaven through a dream this night after which the holy messenger received the honour of leading the other prophets in prayer. The acme of Meraj is his meeting with Allah. 

 Shab e’ Meraj is believed to occur on the 27th night of the holy month of Rajab, although there are divergent views. This year it falls on April 14.
 
 It was this day that Allah ordained the obligatory namaz upon Muslims. The stipulation was 50 daily prayers at first, but Allah on his Prophet’s request, reduced the number to five.
 
 On Friday, Maulana Akram, who officiates at the Andheri Kabrastan Masjid received several queries about whether people should observe a fast. “A good way to honour the occasion is to follow the ways of the Prophet. Do as he did, and avoid doing things that displeased him. Isn’t that what we do for anyone whom we truly love?” 
 
 Sayed Mohammad Ikramul Haque Qadri Misbahi, principal of the   madarsa at Kurla, said several mosques relate the story of the Prophet’s holy ascension to heaven. “These gatherings are usually held after isha or night namaz. We will host a majlis also.” —Bella Jaisinghani
