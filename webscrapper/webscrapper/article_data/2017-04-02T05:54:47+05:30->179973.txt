BENGALURU: Ten days after   residents stopped garbage trucks from entering the Karnataka Compost Development Corporation ( ) plant, about 50 residents from the locality came together to bring another   to the fore. They met joint commissioner of BBMP (  zone) to apprise him about the deplorable condition of roads, which is a result of frequent digging by companies like GAIL and OFC. 

  They said rampant   for laying of underground cables has left 60% of the sector's streets in a mess. H E Chandrasekhar, general secretary, HSR Layout Sector 2  , said: "The companies don't bother to repair the damaged stretches or clear the rubble. The roads pose a threat to senior citizens and kids," he added. 
 
  Srikanth Karapanahalli, RWA member, said: "The roads have not been asphalted for 7-8 years. Neither have potholes been fixed in some zones. Desilting of drains has also not been done; which can lead to flooding during monsoon." Curbing the stray dog menace, clearing vacant sites, removing encroachments from roads and sidewalks, updating change of address in revenue records, forming a panel for playgrounds and removing hoardings were among the other demands. 
 
  Sathish Reddy, MLA, Bommanahalli, said: "We will try to address theissues in six months and instruct BBMP engineers to check frequent digging of roads." BBMP officials said they will look into the issue.
