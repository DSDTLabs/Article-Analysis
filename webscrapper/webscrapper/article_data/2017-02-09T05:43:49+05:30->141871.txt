MUMBAI: More than 100 street hawkers, most of them vegetable vendors, went missing from the usually crowded RRT Road and the adjoining stretches on the west side of   railway station on Wednesday morning. The police and municipal authorities ensured not a single   was in sight as chief minister Devendra Fadnavis was to address a   there in the evening.

 The rallly managed to address one of the biggest concerns of the ward, that is, congestion on RRT Road and other places outside the station area, albeit for just a day. 
 
 “There was a plan to make this road two-way, but it never happened because more than half the stretch on both sides is occupied by hawkers selling everything from vegetables to clothes, hairpins, plastic bottles and bags,” a local shopkeeper said.
 
 A plan for a skywalk on RRT Road also could not make headway because of the increasing hawker population.
 
 Congress activist Sunil Gangwani said station area congestion was the biggest issue in the electoral ward.
 
 “While some of the hawkers may have a licence, there is serious encroachment by scores of others illegally on the road,” Gangwani said.
 
 Mulund resident Mandakini Kadam, who was the CM’s rally, said the municipal administration should remove the hawkers permanently.
 
 Another resident, Sunil Chavan, said authorities should never allow the hawkers back if they really wanted to redress their grievances.
