Actor   who played Abu, a goon from Mattancherry in the film  , will once again essay the role of a Mattancherrykkaran in Soubin Shahir’s Parava. 

  Shine is elated to be part of his buddy Soubin’s directorial debut. He says, “I play Rauf, a typical Mattanchery guy in his 30s. He doesn’t have any similarities with Abu of Annayum Rasoolum but has his own gang and activities. Rauf is someone whom people can easily relate to. He loves kite flying, pigeon rearing and contesting in pigeon flying competitions.”
 
  The film will also have Srinda, playing a pivotal role in the movie, while   will be seen in a cameo. On acting with Srinda again, Shine says, “We are good friends in real life. So far we have done three films —Annayum Rasoolum, Masala Republic and Popcorn together.” 
 
  Shine’s other projects include   and Tiyaan. “I am also working on Kammattipaadam fame Vijayakumar’s maiden directorial,” 
 he says.
