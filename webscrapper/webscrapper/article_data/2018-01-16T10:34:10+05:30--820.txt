SURAT: A day after his car was stoned in Rajpipla, minister for tribal development Ganpat   claimed that the incident was pre-planned.

 Addressing media persons in the city on Monday, Vasava said, “It was an act by some people who are anti-development. It all looked pre-planned. No one suffered injuries and glass of my car got damaged.”
 
 The incident happened at the three-day Advivasi   in Rajpipla, where tribals from states like Maharashtra and   had converged. When Vasava went to the dais, a group of tribals started hooting him. So he got down from the dais and started walking towards his car. Soon, stones were pelted at his car. In the videos that went viral, a group of people are seen hooting while Vasava hurriedly reaches his car with some security personnel keeping him safe. The crowd is seen following and hooting at Vasava from close distance. They even chased Vasava, who was quickly driven out to safety.
 
 “Some tribals are protesting against government for issuing identity cards to other communities like   and Bharwad living in three talukas of Gir. Government has already taken action in this issue. But if anyone is found having got a job on these tribal cards, he/she will be sacked. This was started by the   government in 1956 and the present government is in support of tribals,” Vasava added.
 
 The minister said he is yet to decide on lodging a police compliant.
