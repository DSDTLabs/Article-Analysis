Noida: A 24-year-old woman was found   from a ceiling fan at her rented accommodation in Sector 12 on Saturday. The woman,  , hailed from Mathura. Police are investigating if she committed suicide or was murdered as the door was not locked from inside.

 Police said the woman had married one Mohit from   five years ago. The couple lived in Bulandshahr and have a three-year-old son. However, in the last one year, their relationship turned sour and Neha shifted to Noida six months ago.
 
 The woman lived alone in the one-room set rented accomodation on the second floor of the two-storey building. She worked with a private company in Sector 12 while Mohit remained in Bulandshahr with their son.
 
 According to police, locals on Saturday morning informed them about a stench emanating from the room. Neha’s mother Nutan, who lived in the neighbourhood, reached the spot after getting information.
 
 Ashok Kumar, senior sub-inspector (SSI) at Sector 24 police station, said that it seems she died two or three days ago as the body had started decomposing. 
 
 “The woman’s family members said she had a dispute with her husband. Her mother said Neha wanted custody of her son and was stressed due to the marital problems,” he said.
 
 The other rooms on the second floor were found locked as the occupants were out of town to attend a wedding. Police have not found any suicide note from the spot. 
 
 Kumar said the body was sent for postmortem and reports are awaited. “We are investigating the matter and will question her husband. The family has not filed a complaint in this regard,” said police.
