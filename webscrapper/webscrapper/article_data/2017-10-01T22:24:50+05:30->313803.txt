HARIDWAR: Just 15 days after the disappearance of Mohan Das, spokesperson of Akhara Parishad, another saint, Mahant Kailash Muni of Bada Akhara Udaseen went missing from Agra. He was last seen at Agra toll plaza on September 27 where he had taken a lift from a car to go to Delhi.   Police said that neither did he reach Delhi even after three days nor Haridwar where he lived in small ashram located at Sati Ghat in Kankhal. However, no missing complaint has been filed by the akhara so far.    SHO of Kankahl police station, Anuj Singh, said, “We are yet to receive a missing complaint in the case. He was last seen at a toll plaza in Agra by guards, who said he took a lift to go to Delhi. Once we receive an FIR, we will take action in the case.”    Meanwhile, saints at the akhara said that it’s not the first time that the seer has left without informing anybody and that he will come back.    “Kailash Muni is an officer bearer and neither has he abandoned money or property. There cannot be any conspiracy against him as he lived a very simple life. Villagers gave him food and other things for daily use. We have not filed a complaint so far as he has left the ashram before too without informing anybody,” said Mahant Sukhdev Muni Maharaj, spokesperson of Bada Akhara Udaseen.
