MUMBAI: The BEST workers plan a major protest against delays in payment of salaries for January. They will take out a   at   depot on Monday and this could be a show of strength of bus drivers and conductors, an union activist said.

 TOI had recently reported on the BEST administration, under pressure from BMC, deducting salaries for January to recover the Divali bonus. "We have deducted Rs 550 which is 10% of the   bonus given to each staffer from January salary. This will be reflected in the payslips once the salaries are disbursed,'' said a senior official, who did not wish to be named. The   is taking back the bonus payment as BEST has reportedly failed to implement a slew of reforms suggested for financial revival, sources said. 
 
 Said a BEST Workers' Union activist: "We strongly protest the cut in salary. Besides, we will also oppose any move to cut dearness allowance and other perks given to staffers." Another union member said, "Even thought February 10 has lapsed, the underslung has not paid salaries to the workers. 
 
 A massive morcha is planned to give warning to the administration against the delay in disbursing salaries."
