PANAJI/POINGUINIM: The drop in mercury over the last few weeks has boosted the cashew crop this season, but farmers are hoping for warmer day temperatures as the flowering stage is about to end.

 Farmers are upbeat about the prospects of a good cashew crop, though cloudy skies raised apprehensions. And now, with the weather changing and getting brighter, farmers are keeping their fingers crossed.

In  , more than 5,000 farmers and their families are dependent on the cashew crop. 
 
 An estimated area of 56,735 hectares is covered under cashew cultivation in Goa, with South Goa accounting for 19,132 hectares and North Goa, 37,603 hectares.
