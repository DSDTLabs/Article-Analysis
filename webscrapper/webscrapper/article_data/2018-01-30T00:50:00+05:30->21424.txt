Chennai: Visitors to the Rail Museum on New Avadi Road will be able to spot a 13-foot long, nine-foot high, bull from next week. Made of metal, not flesh and blood, it is a creation of artist P Elanchezhiyan, 37, who carved it out of tonnes of metallic scrap from the Integral Coach Factory (ICF), the country’s premier railway coach manufacturing unit.

 The work symbolises the strength of the ICF and its workforce, which churns out thousands of railway coaches every year. “ICF is a gigantic organisation and the metal bull signifies that,” Elanchezhiyan said.
 
 Sculptors and other artists like Jacob Jebaraj, AV Illango and Asma Menon have been invited by railway officials at ICF to reimagine the space in a fresh manner, which is unprecedented in the Indian Railways, said top officials.
 
 The initiative was undertaken by ICF general manager S Mani after he saw big piles of scrap metal lying on the shop floor during inspections. Instead of throwing it away or auctioning it for money, he decided to offer the metal to artists. And to their credit, they have transformed the Rail Museum into a thriving space for modern art.
 
 The museum is now a spot for weekend getaways, school trips and learning sessions for budding engineers. It displays photographs showing the transformation of Indian Railways since independence, models of coaches and engines, including vintage ones and a toy-train ride for kids. Inside, an air-conditioned art gallery has been created, where painters have created abstract art portraits of the bond shared by the Railways with India’s citizens.
