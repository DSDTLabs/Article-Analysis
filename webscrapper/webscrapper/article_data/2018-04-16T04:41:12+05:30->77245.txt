LUCKNOW: The CBI is likely to conduct narco and polygraph test on   MLA  , accused of raping a 17-year-old girl in  , after it has found discrepancies in his statements during interrogation.

 
 Senior officials, privy to the probe, said on Sunday that the Bangermau MLA was given a similar set of questions after a gap of one hour by interrogating officers. Some of the answers given by him were found to be contradictory, they said. “As a result, we will be going for narco and polygraph tests after taking the accused to the crime spot,” the officials said.
 
 The CBI team is likely to take Sengar to Unnao for spot identification and then conduct a face-off with the survivor, probably on Monday or Tuesday. The CBI will then seek the court’s permission for a go-ahead with the tests. 
 
 Earlier in the day, the MLA’s lawyers had visited the CBI office. Only the main counsel was allowed to go inside the office after securing permission from the CBI SP. The MLA is confident as he is innocent, the counsel, who didn’t wish to be named, claimed.
 
 In the evening, co-accused Shashi Singh was sent to four-day CBI custody after being produced before special remand court of additional chief judicial magistrate (VII) Sunil Kumar. The CBI pleaded for her remand stating it needed it to collect evidence. It said the team questioning the MLA had got information from him which they need to cross-check with Shashi. 
 
 Shashi was arrested on Saturday for allegedly luring the survivor and taking her to Sengar on June 4, 2017 and keeping watch outside the room when the BJP legislator allegedly raped her.
 
 The uncle of the survivor alleged that MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar’s brother Atul, lodged in Unnao jail, had sent his henchmen to the village, threatening villagers not to speak against him or his brother. “On Saturday night, about a dozen men reached the village and asked villagers to keep mum,” he alleged.
