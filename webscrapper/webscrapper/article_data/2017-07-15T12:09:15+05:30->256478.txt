AGRA: Farmers in Agra region, which is a major producer of potato, are upset with the state government as, they claim, there is nothing in the budget to address their issues, even after assurances by ministers. 

 Potato farmers of the region claim that they are not even able to recover input costs and many are staring at losses. They say that they will go on protest if the government fails to provide any relief to them.
 
 District head of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh   Chahar said, "The minimum support price determined by the government for procurement of potato at Rs 487 a quintal is very less."
