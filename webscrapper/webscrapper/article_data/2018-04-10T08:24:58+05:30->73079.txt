BENGALURU: The high court on Monday ordered notice to the   in a   challenging the   and additional pension to information commissioners.

 A division bench headed by chief justice Dinesh Maheshwari also asked the government under what provision of law were the pension and additional pension being paid.
 
 In his petition, Wing Commander G B Athri (retd) claimed the authorities are illegally granting additional pension of Rs 96,000 per month for information commissioners who had rendered three years of government service without any statutory law.
 
 According to the petitioner, K S Thippeswamy, T Rama Naik, Dr Shekar Sajjanar, D Thangaraj, M R Pujar, K K Mishra, AKM Naik, H N Krishna and Virupakshaiah were availing pension without legal sanction.
 
 The petitioner said the authorities had committed an error in fixing the pension, especially in the case of Naik, Sajjanar and Krishna, who were non-official appointees and had never rendered government service before they were appointed information commissioners.
 
 He stated pension could be paidonly after 10 years of government service. “While the RTI Act passed by the Centre only provides for pay, allowances and service conditions of information commissioners, the Act and rules passed by Parliament do not provide for payment of pension,” the petitioner added.
