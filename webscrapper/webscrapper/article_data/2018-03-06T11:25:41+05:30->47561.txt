Google on Tuesday celebrated the work and life of one of Columbia's most prominent authors  , whose work was appreciated all over the world, on his 91st birth anniversary.

 Described as one of the most popular Spanish-language writers, Gabriel García Marque was born on March 06, 1927.
 
 Marque was considered as one of the most significant authors of the 20th century.
 
 He was awarded the 1972 Neustadt International Prize for Literature and the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature. He pursued a self-directed education that resulted in his leaving law school for a career in journalism.
 
 In addition to his work as a novelist, Marquez was also a poet, short-story writer, screen writer and journalist.
 
 In 1982, Marque became the first Colombian and only the fourth Latin American author to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.
 
 García Marquez wrote many acclaimed non-fiction works and short stories, but is best known for his novels, such as 
  (1967), 
  (1975), and
  (1985). His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularising a literary style known as magic realism, which uses magical elements and events in otherwise ordinary and realistic situations.
 
 García Marquez was a "committed Leftist" throughout his life, adhering to socialist beliefs.
 
 Critics often describe the language that García Marquez's imagination produces as visual or graphic, and he himself explains each of his stories is inspired by "a visual image".
