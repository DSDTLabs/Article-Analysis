BENGALURU: The  's decision to provide equal employment opportunity to all its race-day workers backfired as a group of its tote operators went on a flash strike on Thursday demanding double wages for the dual race day. 

 The protesters, who were on duty for the Chennai races in the morning wanted to extend their working hours for Thursday evening’s Mumbai races and earn double wages for the day. As a result, the off-course betting for Chennai races was cancelled. 
 
 The protest was finally called off just before the start of the evening's Mumbai off-course betting after the BTC revoked its original decision to assign the Mumbai races to the second batch of tote operators. 
 
 "The daily wage employees have not had the opportunity to work on 10 Bengaluru race days and 131 off-course days. Therefore, the managing committee decided to accord equal employment opportunity to all its race day staff," said a senior member of the BTC’s managing committee. 
 
 Meanwhile, another top-level official said they had to relent to the demands of the striking employees in the best interest of racing. "We didn't want to disappoint our racing patrons who were waiting for the races all day long. We made two groups of employees for the day but we had to withdraw the decision to start the betting operations."
 
 The official further added: "The idea to form groups is to provide every worker an opportunity to earn his or her wages. If we allow one group to work on dual shifts, we are denying the other batch of employees an opportunity to earn their wages." 
 
 The BTC has over 1000 race-day employees with each earning Rs 500 per day apart from other benefits like PF, ESI, medical insurance and gratuity. 
 
 Meanwhile, a police officer said no case was registered against the agitators. "Our police personnel were present around the premises during the hours of protest to prevent any untoward incidents," he said.
