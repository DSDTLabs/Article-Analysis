AHMEDABAD: Siblings   (8) and   (6) developed a rare condition due to which their hunger wasn’t satiated despite eating enormous quantities of food. Consequently, their weight shot up as high as 59kg and 82kg, respectively. For  , their father, it was difficult to make ends meet, to feed and nurture his daughters, each of whom consumed twice the amount of diet of an adult and he was in desperate conditions. Recently, after the morbidly obese sisters underwent a restrictive surgery, each of them shed nearly 10kg.

 
  
 
 Three years ago, the siblings had been treated at Civil Hospital, Asarwa. Back then, Yogita weighed 33.5kg at the age of five, while Amisha weighed 47kg at the age of three. Despite this, there was little improvement in their condition. “Both the sisters were found to be suffering from Leptin Receptor Mutation, which is the deficiency of satiety hormone,” said Dr  , the bariatric surgeon who performed the surgery.
 
 Absence of this hormone makes one always feel hungry and never satiated, and thus makes patients consume more food than their capacity. “We took a call to operate upon the sisters at our hospital in Ahmedabad to reduce the hunger hormone – Ghrelin. Most ghrelin is secreted from the fundus of the stomach, which has been removed. Within a month of the operation, Yogita has lost around 9 kg and Amisha has lost 10kg,” added Narwaria.
 
 The sister duo underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, which is a restrictive surgery that reduces the stomach pouch by 60-70%.
