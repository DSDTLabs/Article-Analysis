BENGALURU: Ahead of the cabinet meeting on Wednesday which will decide on minority status for the   community or forward it to the Centre as recommended by an expert panel, there was hectic discussion in political and religious circles.

 In Kudalasangama, Bagalkot, pontiffs of several Lingayat mutts chalked out the future course of action while Congress senior MLA and All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha (AIVM) president Shamanur Shivashankarappa and met Lingayat strongman and BJP state unit president BS Yeddyurappa as both share the view that   and Veerashaivas are one and the same.
 
 The meeting on Sunday night at the Siddaganga Mutt, Tumakuru was seen as a religious divide triumphing over party lines. “It’s well known that Yeddyurappa is banking on Shivashankarappa and his son Mallikarjun (cabinet minister) to thwart any effort of the Siddaramaiah government to accord minority status to the Lingayats,” said a BJP party worker.
 
 It’s expected that Shivashankarappa’s stance, which he reiterated after the meeting with Yeddyurappa, of not allowing the division into Veerashaivas and Lingayats will get the support of two ministers, Eshwar Khandre and Mallikarjun. 
 
 “Whatever be the final decision, the candidates and parties who supported the separate status for Lingayats will be able to garner a sizeable traction in select constituencies of north Karnataka where Lingayats are in a majority as against the Veerashaivas,” said JD(S) MLC and leader Basavaraj Horratti, who is part of the Lingayat movement.
