NOIDA: District magistrate NP Singh on Sunday met the representatives of several RWAs in the city at the Federation of   Residents Welfare Associations office in Sector 52 and apprised them on the election-related measures and preparations for the upcoming Vidhan Sabha polls.

 Singh maintained that compared to less literate districts like Saharanpur, Shamli and Moradabad, which recorded 70% voter turnout in the past, the more literate Gautam Budh Nagar and Noida have recorded only 55 to 58% voter turnout. “This has to change to a mininum turnout of 78%. To ensure increased voter turnout, a slew of measures have been taken by the district administration under the guidelines of the   (EC),” Singh said.
 
 This include regular camps in the district for new voter registrations and correction in voterslists and the inauguration of mVoter app by the EC, which will be operational from Monday. 
 
 “Voters can enter their voter card number in the app, which will then display their polling booth details,” Singh said. 
 
 He added that block level officers will begin distributing voter slips on February 6.
