Kolkata: With his bail plea likely to be heard by the Odisha high court in May first week, Trinamool MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay who spent 100 days in custody on Wednesday, has a few legal options to explore till then.

 Bandopadhyay, the ruling party’s Lok Sabha leader, was arrested by CBI in January in their apex court mandated Rose Valley probe. Bandyopadhyay’s custody ensured his absence from the lower house in its all-crucial budget session which ended on Wednesday. His role was fulfilled by senior party MPs Saugata Roy and Kalyan Banerjee.
 
 “We will await the outcome of his bail plea and then decide on the next course. The matter is sub judice and I would not like to speak on the matter. But he is innocent,” the MP’s wife Naina, herself an MLA, said.
 
 CBI has already indicated it will oppose the bail and instead plead for Bandyopadhyay’s continued custody.
 
 On Wednesday, the BJP stepped up their Narada heat staging a protest-rally demanding immediate resignation and arrest of Trinamool ministers allegedly shown in the controversial tapes.
