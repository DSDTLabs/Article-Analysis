 The monsoon session of the assembly started on a stormy note on Tuesday with Congress evoking three adjournments as it pressed for an adjournment motion on the  .
 
 “Take us into consideration when decisions affecting all the MLAs are taken. Take the opposition MLAs into confidence instead of coming out with circulars or decisions in haste,”   and opposition leader Chandrakant Kavlekar said. Ahead of Wednesday’s session, Parrikar called all the MLAs for a meeting to hear their thoughts on the circular. The MLAs expressed their difficulty in getting development and emergency works completed in their constituencies due to the circular.
 
 “In view of the difficulties expressed by the MLAs, the circular will be modified to exempt MLAs and MPs. There is no need of any fear or anxiety in the minds of any one,” Parrikar said, going on to add that the purpose of the circular was not to create difficulties but to allow the government to function. While promising to amend the circular, Parrikar laid two conditions before the MLAs.
 
 “This facility cannot be abused or used to harass officers by calling them every day at the last moment. And no matter what, it is not appropriate to call government officers to personal residences. It is ok if the office is attached to the home,” Parrikar said.
