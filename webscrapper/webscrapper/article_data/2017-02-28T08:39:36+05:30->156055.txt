BENGALURU: The next time you try to call the   to report any emergency, language won't be a barrier. For, the control room personnel will converse with you in three languages: Kannada, Hindi and English. The moment you dial 100, the   system will ask you to choose the language of your convenience. 

  Kannada used to be the language of communication in the control room, and usage of any other language was subject to the personnel's felicity. Given   as a metro with global linkages, the grouse of most non-Kannadigas calling the control room used to be the language problem. 
 
  Police commissioner Praveen Sood said the language option facility will be installed by April and staff will be trained to converse in Hindi and English. "Bengaluru is a cosmopolitan city with a huge floating population from different parts of the world. Foreigners living in the city should not face any difficulty," Sood said. 
 
 The move is part of an extensive upgradation plan for the control room. The number of telephone lines will be increased from the current 15 to 100. "It's a Rs 30-crore project and the number of telephone lines will also be increased by April. At present, callers have to hold on the call for some time as the lines will be busy, particularly during the day. The 100-line will work round the clock," he added.
