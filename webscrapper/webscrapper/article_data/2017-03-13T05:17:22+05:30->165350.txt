NEW DELHI: Buoyed by BJP’s successes in the assembly polls, party chief   said on Sunday that the saffron party’s win in the next Lok Sabha elections would surpass its performance of 2014.

 Addressing   workers who had gathered at the party headquarters to felicitate him and Prime Minister   for BJP’s massive win in   and Uttarakhand, Shah described the party’s performance in these assembly polls as having surpassed its achievement in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. “The win in the five state assembly elections is bigger than our victory in 2014 Lok Sabha polls. We will get a bigger mandate in 2019,” said Shah, who has masterminded BJP’s successful campaigns in Maharashtra and Haryana.
 
 Terming the massive win in UP as popular endorsement of the BJP-led NDA government’s “pro-poor” policies, Shah said the party’s victory was unprecedented.
 
 He claimed the party’s victory march would continue in upcoming polls in Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat as well in the the eastern and southern parts of the country.
 
 “The results of these five states will take the party forward from its historic win in 2014 general elections,” Shah said, adding that the expansion in the south and east would be the next agenda.
 
 “Our next goal is east and south,” said Shah, making it clear that he was not content with growth in north and west and would now focus on the regions where the party had little footprint. Shah even had a veiled warning for West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, who has been the most vocal against BJP and campaigned against demonetisation.
 
 Stating that people have expressed complete faith in Modi’s leadership, Shah attributed the victory to demonetisation and pro-poor measures taken by the   government.
