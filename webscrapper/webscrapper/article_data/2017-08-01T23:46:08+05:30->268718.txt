Panaji: There is an urgent need for urbanism in Goa today, especially with the Smart City project under way, said Los Angeles-based urban designer and architect, Vinayak Bharne. He insisted town planners engage various disciplines while planning urban spaces to ensure that we live in a smart world. He was speaking on Humanism and Urbanism at Kala Academy on Tuesday. Urbanism is a design movement which promotes environmentally friendly habits by creating walkable neighbourhoods containing a wide range of living spaces. “An architect’s expertise is related to open spaces, buildings and infrastructure. The difference between an architect and urbanist is that we have a huge team of economists, transportation engineers and other disciplines on board while planning the city,” he said. He added that architects cannot leave the battle of environmental reform to environmentalists alone. They have to fight to reform the building and architecture system as well.  He said, “Panaji is less like a city and more like a town with small streets. It is very intimate, unlike a metropolis. Which is why the efforts put in Smart City Delhi or Bangaluru cannot be applied in Panaji. We need to figure out how to prioritize issues and work in that direction,” he said.
