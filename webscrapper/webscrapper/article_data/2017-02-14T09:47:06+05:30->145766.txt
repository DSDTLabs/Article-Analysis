SHIMLA: A civil society group in Shimla has threatened to “gherao” councillors of the town’s municipal corporation (MC) over poor infrastructure.

  secretary   said the infrastructure of some parts of Shimla was so bad that six people had gotten injured after falling down from the stairs near Sanjauli’s “gurdwara area”. He said the stairs were in disrepair, but nothing had been done by the local councillor.
 
 He added that the condition of wards Krishna Nagar, Kaithu, Totu, and Maliyana was no different. “Engine Ghar councillor Sushant Kaprate had given us time for a meeting on Monday, but he did not show up. His office was also locked,” he added.
 
 Shimla resident Suresh said the SMC was lackadaisical about civic amenities in the town that it had problems in giving approval to even repair of a footpath. “We are not expecting anything big from SMC. We just want the basics to be right. We are not asking for a four-lane road, but decent  ,” he said.
 
 Engine Ghar councillor Sushant Kaprate said he had not fixed any meeting with the civil group on Monday. “As far as the paths are concerned, I have already prepared estimates for footpaths and stairs that are in disrepair. There is a problem in getting the no-objection certificate. That is why the work is getting delayed,” he said.
