SRINAGAR:   finance minister   has sought a postponement in rolling out goods and services tax ( ) from July, citing lack of preparedness, even as several other states said that a delayed rollout may not be beneficial. Sources indicated that West   plea may not find many takers.

 In a letter to Union finance minister Arun Jaitley, Mitra, who has been repeatedly raising issues related to GST implementation, cited CII data to suggest that 70% of small businesses are yet to adopt technology resulting in traders — who form the last link in the chain —being under-prepared.
 
 Other state FMs, however, said that they were bracing for a July rollout. “I am sure over the next few weeks we will be able to complete the requirements for a rollout. As with any initiative there may be hiccups and we should be prepared to deal with them,” said Haryana finance minister Captain Abhimanyu.
 
 Punjab finance minister Manpreet Badal said businesses and traders were getting ready for the rollout. “Punjab is a consumption state and we will gain from it,” he said.
