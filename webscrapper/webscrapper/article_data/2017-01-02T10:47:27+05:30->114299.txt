MADURAI: The   passed off without any incidents in Madurai city. Not even a single accident resulting in death was reported from the city and rural police limits. 

 Police had made elaboration security arrangements to avert any untoward incident. They booked a large number of two-wheeler commuters for traffic violations like overspeeding, drink and drive and rash driving.
 
 The celebration this year was rather a muted affair in the city. Most of the hotels in the city did not organise the usual galas. An hotelier said, "New Year celebration has never been a big affair in Madurai. Even the usual celebration was not in place this year in many of the hotels for reasons such as demonetisation and the recent death of the former chief minister  ."
 
 Madurai rural police registered 86 drink and drive cases during the night. In addition, 1,688 cases against those driving without helmets, 82 against those without driving licence and 649 cases, including rash driving and over speeding were also registered. 
 
 City police on their part registered a large number cases under various heads including 20 rash driving cases and 15 cases for overspending.
 
 In an effort to ensure a safe celebration, police had made elaborate security arrangements. "There was not even a single fatal accident in the city police limits. All the important junctions were manned by an inspector-level officer. In addition, police personnel were deployed everywhere. Compared to the previous years, the celebration spirit was rather muted," said  , assistant commissioner of police, Tallakulam traffic.
 
 Residential associations too stayed away from organising big celebrations. Events organised by a few of the associations were also a low-key affair, compared to the celebrations of the previous years. 
 
 However, crowds thronged places of worship such as temples and churches. A large number of people thronged the  's Cathedral. All the churches had organised special prayers to welcome the New Year.
