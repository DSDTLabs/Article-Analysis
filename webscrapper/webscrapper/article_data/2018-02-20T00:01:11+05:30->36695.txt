NAVI MUMBAI: The   ( )’s   for the next financial year will be presented before the standing committee on Tuesday. Residents are expecting that the budget talks more about implementation projects and policies and note just allocation of funds.

  “Budgetary provisions is merely on paper as many projects seldom take off for various reasons like lack of political backing or administration inability. The plan to construct a veterinary hospital is stressed upon every year in the budget, but till date the plot has also not been demarcated. The civic body has not even started a helpline to provide medical aide for strays. Even simple work like fixing iron grills around newly planted saplings, which was presented over the years, has not yet been done by the tree authority,” said   resident and social activist Arati Chauhan.
 
 Another resident and BJP party worker   said that multi- crore projects without proper planning is just wasting public funds. “Crores are being spent on constructing walkways around Jewel of Navi Mumbai- holding pond in Nerul, but the sewerage water is getting mixed in it, resulting in stench in the area. This dissuades citizen from using the facility. The budget should include changing of streetlights to LEDs so that even if they remain on during day there will be less wastage of electricity. A substantial amount must also be allocated to revamp the railway station complex area which is recently handed over by CIDCO,” he said.
 
 Some residents also want the administration to look into the quality of education. With private schools continuing to charge hefty fees, residents are expecting the NMMC to upgrade its primary education level.
