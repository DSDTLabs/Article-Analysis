PUNE: The Bombay high court ( ) on Wednesday granted an   anticipatory   to Maharashtra Navnirman Sena ( )   Sainath   in a case registered under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act by the Kondhwa police.

 Babar had moved a criminal appeal in the HC after a sessions court in Pune had rejected his anticipatory bail plea on July 10.
 
 Following a hearing, the high court division bench of Justice V K Tahilramani and Justice S K Shinde ordered that in the event of arrest, Babar be released on bail against a personal release bond of Rs 35,000 and one or two sureties in the like amount. The bench posted the matter for next hearing on July 31.
 
 Kondhwa resident Keru Dinkar Jagtap had lodged an FIR on June 17 alleging that Babar threatened him despite knowing well that he belonged to the scheduled caste community, and insisted that he should sell his 47 guntha ancestral land near Khadi Machine Chowk. 
 
 The police then registered an offence under a relevant section of the Atrocities Act. Later, Babar moved the sessions court for the anticipatory bail.
 
 Jagtap claimed in the FIR that he had approached Babar with a request to play a mediator in the settlement of a dispute over his ancestral land. On Babar’s suggestion, Jagtap and his cousins gathered at the land but Jagtap alleged that Babar got seven to eight of his aides to visit the site. Later, he asked the complainant and his cousins to sell the land or else they would be dealt with dire consequences, the complainant alleged. 
 
 Additional sessions judge A S Mahatme had observed in the impugned (under challenge) order, “At this stage, I do not find any reason to brush aside all the averments made in the FIR for the purpose of granting (anticipatory bail) relief. The investigation officer needs presence of the applicant for custodial interrogation because prima facie the averments in the FIR are well founded.”
