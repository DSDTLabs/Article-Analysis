The team seized 42 vehicles, which includes 3 tracer boats, one JCB and 38 trucks, along with 100 cubic metres sand from Watkhed — I. The contactor of the sand dune here is one Mahendra   of Amravati.
 
 The cops have also seized six vehicles; 4 tracer boats, one poclain machine, and one tractor, and 150 cubic metres sand from Watkhed-II. The sand dune contractor is one Gajanan   of Amravati.
 
 According to Nitin Hingole, six trucks and one tractor managed to flee from the site, and the remaining vehicles have been seized by the Babhulgaon tehsildar.
 
 SP M Rajkumar has confirmed the action by the SDO and said that Babhulgaon police have registered two separate criminal offences under various sections of IPC, Environment Protection Act and Maharashtra Land Revenue Code against the sand mafia after receiving a complaint from the tehsildar of Babhulgaon on Friday.
