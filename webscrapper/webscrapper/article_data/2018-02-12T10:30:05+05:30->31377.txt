JAIPUR: The appalling healthcare facilities in district   can be gauged by the fact that 45% posts of specialist doctors are lying vacant in the state. This was revealed by the recently released   report on ‘Healthy States, Progressive India’.

 Besides, Rajasthan is one among the larger states where the vacancy of staff nurses in primary health centres (PHCs) and   (CHCs) is more than 40%. As per the report, vacancies came to 43% in Haryana, Rajasthan (47%), Bihar (50%) and Jharkhand (75%).
 
  
  
 
 In a district hospital, there should be specialists in medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology, paediatrics, anaesthesia, ophthalmology, radiology, pathology, ear-nose-throat, dental and psychiatry. But, many district hospitals have not filled up all specialist doctors.
 
 A major cause of concern is that the shortage of specialist doctors is continuously increasing. According to the report, in 2014-15, the vacancies of specialist doctors in public health facilities stood at 41% as against total sanctioned posts. But, this has further increased to 45%.
 
 The report says that several larger states have a high proportion of vacant specialist positions in district hospitals, particularly Chhattisgarh (78%), Bihar (61%), Uttarakhand (60%), Gujarat (56%), Telangana (55%), Madhya Pradesh (51%), Jharkhand (50%) and Punjab (48%) and Rajasthan (45%).
 
 Most states have made limited progress (less than 5%) in reducing the vacancies of specialists at district hospitals from base to reference year, except Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Jharkhand and Telangana. At the same time, Maharashtra, Punjab and Uttarakhand have shown substantial increase in specialists, ranging between 11to 26%.
 
 But, Rajasthan has not made any progress in filling posts and on the contrary, the number of vacant posts of specialists has increased significantly from the base year (2014-15) to the reference year (2015-16).
