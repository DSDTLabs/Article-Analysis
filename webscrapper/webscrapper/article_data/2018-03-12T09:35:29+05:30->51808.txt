Bengaluru: Led by a sublime   hat-trick, Bengaluru pipped   3-1 at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium on Sunday to book their place in the final of the   in their debut season.

 
 
 The Bengaluru skipper first threaded the Pune defence with a header in the 15th minute, then followed it up with a Panenka after the break. The visitors clawed their way back through substitute Jonathan Lucca’s 30-yard free-kick in the 82nd minute but Chhetri calmed nerves with a stunning solo run and finish a minute from injury time to give Bengaluru their 14th straight win across all competitions. The Blues next face the winner of Tuesday’s Chennaiyin FC-FC Goa semifinal at the Kanteerava here on March 17.
 
 Bengaluru began showing the attacking intent that they are most feared for. Udanta Singh stole a move down the right to set up Sunil Chhetri at the far post, but the skipper’s shot wobbles out. But Pune were quick to reply two minutes later, Diego Carlos’ effort from outside the box took a deflection off Bengaluru’s John Johnson and veered dangerously towards the top corner. But ‘keeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu’s split-second reaction saw him punch the ball over.
