Visakhapatnam: Vizag city came to a grinding halt on Thursday as a   call given by Left parties in protest against the Centre’s meagre allocation of funds for the state in this Budget found support from all opposition parties including the YSR Congress, Congress, Jana Sena and even the BJP.

 The bandh passed off peacefully in the North Andhra districts as all government and private transport services came to a grinding halt and commercial establishments, educational institutions and others remained closed for the day on Thursday. Many people’s organisations and trade unions took part in the bandh.
 
 Interestingly, the ruling Telugu Desam Party’s (TDP’s) representatives also swung into the action and staged protests and rallies. Petrol bunks, theatres, banks and other establishments also remained closed. People of all walks of lives extended support to the bandh as there is a widespread sentiment among the public of being wronged by the Centre by way of a meagre allocation of funds to the state in the 2018-19 Budget.
 
 Police forces were deployed in large numbers at strategic locations across the district and in neighbouring districts to prevent untoward incidents. People travelling to other places suffered the most due to a complete halt in transport services.
 
 Even weekly vegetable markets in faraway Agency areas remained closed due to the bandh. 
 
 Transport services slowly began crawling back to normal after 2 pm. Over 50,000 auto-rickshaws in North Andhra are believed to have stayed off roads.
