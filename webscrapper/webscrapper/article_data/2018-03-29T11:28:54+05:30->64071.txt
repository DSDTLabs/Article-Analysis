AHMEDABAD: The   of Gujarat cancelled polling at the Bhadra court polling booth after complaints of bogus voting during the elections for 25 representatives. 

 According to BCGâ€™s joint returning officer R C Jani, the polling that was going on at Bhadra had to be cancelled because advocates indulged in bogus voting after stealing voter slips. 
 
 The Bar waited for more than an hour during noon, but the chaos continued and poll stationery was snatched by some lawyers from the election officials and allegedly indulged in bogus voting.
 
 BCG officials said that the polling at other centres across the state remained peaceful and voting at the Bhadra court only had to be stalled and cancelled. Advocate Jani said that the tribunal set up by the   (BCI) will take a call on when the polling will take place again at Bhadra.
 
 The polling booth at Bhadra is the biggest booth with nearly 12,500 voters expected to cast their votes here. The trouble occurred due to overcrowding of voters. Four tables provided for identification of voters were not enough to meet the rush. The place at the   where polling booths were set up too was found very small and remained overcrowded leading to the chaos in two hours after the polling began.
 
 Since a huge rush was expected at Bhadra court polling station, the time of voting was also extended by the BCG. But this was not enough.
 
 Earlier, advocates practicing at Gujarat high court had successfully filed a petition for installing a separate polling booth on the   campus so that they could avoid the difficulty in voting at Bhadra and save time. 
 
 There were 99 candidates in the fray for 25 positions, and number of voters across the state is little over 50,000.
