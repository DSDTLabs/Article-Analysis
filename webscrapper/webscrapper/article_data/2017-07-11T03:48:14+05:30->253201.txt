NEW DELHI: The health ministry is set to take to the Union cabinet the new bill seeking to replace the apex medical education regulator,   (MCI), with a new body -   (NMC). 

 The new bill also proposes an exit exam which all MBBS graduates will have to clear to get practising licence. The exit exam may also serve as National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for aspiring candidates for post-graduate studies, official sources said. 
 
 Once cleared by Parliament, the proposed NMC Bill, 2017 will replace the existing Indian Medical Council (IMC) Act, 1956 which governs doctors through the Medical Council of India.
 
 The Commission under the proposed law will have four autonomous boards tasked with conducting undergraduate and postgraduate education; assessing and rating medical institutions; registering practitioners; and enforcing medical ethics. 
 
 The idea is to bring in transparency and accountability through the Commission while regulating medical education to end corruption.
 
 The bill, originally drafted by an inter-ministerial committee under Niti Aayog, has been evaluated and recently cleared by a Group of Ministers, headed by finance minister Arun Jaitley. 
 
 While the Niti Aayog committee had pressed for selection of members of the Commission, the GoM is learnt to have made a key change regarding the constitution of the Commission by increasing the number of members and introducing a part election process. As per the new proposal, some members of the Commission will be selected while others will be placed through election.
 
 The new bill aims to reform the medical education sector which has been under scrutiny for corruption and unethical practices.
