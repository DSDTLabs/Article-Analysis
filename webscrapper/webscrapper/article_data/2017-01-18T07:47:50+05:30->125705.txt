HYDERABAD: Perturbed by the rising cases of violence against medical practitioners, the Telangana chapter of   (IMA) wore black badges to work besides giving representation to police officials for their safety as part of a nationwide call to observe ‘National Solidarity Day’ on Tuesday.

 Their protest comes four days after Dr  , 62, a leading Allahabad based surgeon was shot dead by unidentified assailants at   hospital.
 
 “The highest number of cases of violence against doctors ever reported was 300 in the undivided state during 2014. But post bifurcation, there have been 115 incidents of assaults, dharnas causing obstruction, intimidation, property damage in hospital and other instances of attacks were registered by doctors against patients and their attendants between June 2015 to June 2016,” said Dr T Narasinga Reddy, president, Telangana chapter of Indian Medical Association.
 
 Incidentally, Dr Narasinga Reddy led delegation of doctors to submit a memorandum to city police commissioner   on Tuesday, appealing for strict instructions to all station house officers (SHOs) to ensure safety of medical professionals at their workplace.
 
 Though First Information Reports (FIRs) were registered in 29 cases by doctors in the above 115 cases but senior office bearers of Telangana Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (THANA) rued that the fact that the attackers come out on bail hours after the incident.
 
 “The   Medicare Service Persons and Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and damage to property) Act, 2008 has become toothless,” said Dr  , president, Hyderabad chapter of THANA.
 
 In the past, all cases registered under Andhra Pradesh Medicare Service Persons and Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and damage to property) Act, 2008 were treated as non-bailable offences, requiring accused to approach the court to seek regular bail after arrest.
 
 This changed after Criminal Law amendment Act, 2013 that empowered accused booked for offences to obtain bail from police stations.
