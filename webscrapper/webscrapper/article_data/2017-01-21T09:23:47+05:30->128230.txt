DHARAMSALA: After Himachal Pradesh chief minister Virbhadra Singh’s Thursday announcement of   being the second capital of state, the   (BJP) said that the   government has failed to preserve Shimla as capital of the state. BJP also termed the declaration as a mere political rhetoric by the CM. 

 Former chief minister  , said this while addressing the rally of booth-level workers at Chambi near here. Member of parliament Shanta Kumar too added to it terming it as merely one of the announcements being made in different parts of the state.
 
 Narrating an anecdote, Dhumal said the CM’s announcements are like that of “Gapor Sankh” (local slang for a person who makes fictional talks). “Singh had been making announcements all over the state which cannot be implemented,” he said. He further said that during the stint of the present Congress government, state capital Shimla had deteriorated as 32 people were killed in the town due to jaundice and thousands fell ill. “Now, the people of the capital are reeling under the problems of heavy snow and the chief minister is touring to Kangra district. The present government was not able to maintain one capital but was talking of making another capital,” Dhumal said.
 
 Shanta Kumar said, “The government is not able to contribute to the smart city project while the Centre has issued its grant for execution of project of about hundreds of crores,” he said. The way the announcements are being made, it might not be a wonder if soon Mandi was declared as the third capital of the state, he mocked. He criticized the state government for failing to give its share in smart city scheme due to which it had failed to take off. He claimed the state government till date had given just Rs 20 lakh for the smart city project of Dharamshala.
