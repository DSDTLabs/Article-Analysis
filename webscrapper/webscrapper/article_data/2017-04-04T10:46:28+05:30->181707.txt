BENGALURU: A   from a   where she was employed as a   near   on Sunday night. 

 Police have filed a case of unnatural death based on a complaint from her employers who claimed she was 20-year-old. But armed with statement from a neighbour, who said the girl was only 15, activists are now demanding the case be registered under sections of   Justice Act. 
 
 The girl was from Assam and was found dead at Gopalan Grandeur Apartment, off Hoodi Circle, between 9pm and 10pm on Sunday night. She was working as a stay-at-home help in the residence of a software engineer.
 
 As per the police complaint, the girl was found dead when her employers returned after shopping. The employer’s mother, a senior citizen, had stepped out to buy curd at the time and the girl was at home taking care of the couple’s 18-month-old daughter. It remains unclear whether the girl jumped from the 9th floor or whether she fell accidentally. “We have registered a case of unnatural death and are investigating. We are contacting the girl’s mother who is in New Delhi for more information,” said M Narayana, deputy commissioner of police, Whitefield. 
 
 The girl was hired by the software engineer through a Delhi-based agency. She came to Bengaluru a year-and-a-half ago with her mother.
 
 Geetha Menon, activist from  , contested the claim that the girl was 20-years-old. “Going by her stature and what the neighbour said, she appears to be just 15 which makes this a case of girlchild trafficking and violation of Juvenile Justice Act. The FIR must be booked on these grounds,” she said.
 
 Police said they’ll be able to verify the girl’s age only after her mother arrives from New Delhi. “Right now we are going by the documents available with us. If the facts of the case change, the sections too will change,” said Narayana.
