Chandigarh: The UT education department has filed a written request with the deputy commissioner (DC) to issue the pending 155 income certificates for which receipts were issued in January and February to parents but the certificates have not been issued yet. The wards of these parents have already been admitted under right to education quota in private schools.

 DC in a letter to education department had denied to issue income certificates for the purpose of admission after March 31. However, in response to the letter, education department informed that a mechanism for developing income certificates was in process, including self-certification for 2019-20 and requested them to issue pending certificates for the session of 2018-19.
 
 The students have already been admitted by private schools after the district education officer had directed all schools to consider the EWS candidates in draw of lots on the basis of receipts issued by the DC office.
 
 “The parents had been approaching the district education office as the schools were demanding for income certificates in case of admissions while the DC office was not issuing the same,” an official said.
 
 The registrar education (schools) issued a letter to director school education stating, “As per information received from district education officer of Chandigarh, around 155 students who were successful in draw of lots in private schools could not be admitted due to non-availability of income  .”
 
 “It is informed that as per provision of RTE Act, children cannot be denied admission during the entire academic session. A large number of EWS students had submitted application form along with the receipt, which was issued by your office at the time of submission of applications for the issue of the income certificate.”
