NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition,  , in a press conference on Wednesday said that the legislative assembly session, which ended on Tuesday, has not only become the one of the longest sessions in its history but has also been one wherein the chief minister, deputy CM, ministers and AAP MLAs exhibited the most undignified and irresponsible behaviour.

 Gupta said that the government seemed to be running away from burning   of short supply of water, polluted water, and absence of basic amenities to JJ dwellers. “Instead of giving financial assistance to the safai karamcharies of municipal corporations, it continued to shed crocodile tears on their miserable conditions,” he said.
 
 He claimed that the   government had left no stone unturned in suppressing the voice of opposition. “Whenever BJP MLAs tried to raise public issues, they were forced out of the house with the help of marshals. When they resisted and pressed for discussion they were not heard. Hence they had no option but to walk out of the house 8 times,” said Gupta.
 
 “Despite AAP’s despotic behaviour, the opposition succeeded in raising 225 issues of public importance. The government was compelled to rethink on issues such as those pertaining to shortage of water, collapse of sewerage system in many areas, failure to check pollution, failure of ration system, shortcomings in door step delivery of ration items, inability to provide one stop delivery of women victims of domestic violence and rape,” he added.
