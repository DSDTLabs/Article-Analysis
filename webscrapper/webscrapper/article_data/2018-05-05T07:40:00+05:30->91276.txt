Amritsar: Residents of as many as three municipal wards of Amritsar have warned the state government of resuming their agitation if the pre-poll promise of shifting of Bhagatanwala garbage dump was not fulfilled immediately.

 “We have to attract the government’s attention through agitation. Despite rain, the smoke is continuously billowing from garbage dump at various places. We are constantly scared of outbreak of different deadly diseases,” said president of Joint Action Committee (JAC) Sandeep Kurl, on Friday.
 
 Afraid that they had become victims of poll politics, Kurl said the Congress had included the issue of shifting of garbage dump from Bhagatanwala. However, after coming to power their leaders had forgotten the promises, he alleged.
 
 They had also invited Amaritsar MP Gurjit Aujla to visit the dump and see the conditions under which the residents of as many as three wards were living.
 
 The residents of municipal corporation ward number 37, 38 and 39 are the worst suffers due their proximity to the garbage dump. Residents of these wards are of view that there were three garbage dumps each at Bhagatanwala, Fatehpur and Bharariwal, and the garbage should be equally dumped in all the three dump sites.
 
 JAC general secretary Naval Chawla wondered as to why none of the governments seriously took up their issue despite the fact that they and their children were acquiring various diseases due to thick layer of smoke that engulf the area every day.
 
 Meanwhile, employees of Amritsar MSW Limited, which has partnered with Amritsar Municipal Corporation for the solid waste management programme, has gone on strike due to non-payment of their salaries for past two months and have stopped collecting and dumping garbage from the city.
 
 An official of the company, who didn’t wish to be quoted, said that they were awaiting Rs 14 crore from the civic body due to which they were unable to pay the salaries.
