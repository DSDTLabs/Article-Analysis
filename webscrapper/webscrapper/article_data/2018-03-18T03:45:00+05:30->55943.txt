Amaravati: Chief minister Chandrababu Naidu asked his party MPs to remain alert for the next two days. Speaking to the MPs during a teleconference on Saturday, the chief minister instructed them to keep in touch with the leaders of various regional and national parties that are sympathetic to the AP’s concerns. 

 He also directed them to expose the ‘corrupted politics’ of the YSR Congress, particularly its MP V Vijayasai Reddy who is paying regular visits to the Prime Ministers’ Office. Naidu wanted the MPs to expose YSR Congress – BJP relationship developed in the recent past. He expressed concern over the courts clearing cases against Jaganmohan Reddy and Vijayasai Reddy and wanted the MPs to convey this message to the leaders of other parties.
 
  Naidu also asked the TDP MPs to expose the back-door deals of the YSRC with the BJP, and keep the protest alive both inside and outside the Parliament on the main demand of special category status for the State. “There is no compromise on the state issues and there is no scope for the YSRC to take political mileage,” he said. Meanwhile, TDP AP state unit president and minister for energy, K Kalavenkata Rao also held a teleconference with the party MLAs and MLCs.
