NAGPUR: Former deputy PM and   veteran L K   will be attending RSS’s Vijayadashami rally after a gap of a few years. Advani would visit the home of Chandrakantbhai Thakar, the senior   patron at Wardhaman Nagar, where he will stay the night. Advani’s daughter Pratibha and secretary Deepak Chopra are accompanying him.

 Sangh observers are curious about the visit, as Advani is coming to the city after a long gap. A diehard Sanghi all his life, Advani has taken with equanimity the RSS’s suggestion that he should play an advisory role given his seniority.
 
 RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s annual address at the Vijayadashami rally, keenly watched for its political message, would also likely provide an assessment of how RSS views the ongoing discourse on the economy.
 
 It will also be interesting to see if Bhagwat holds a separate meeting with Advani after the rally. The chances look remote because of time constraint as the BJP stalwart has a plane to catch around 12 noon. Union minister  , CM   and other top politicians are expected to attend the rally.
