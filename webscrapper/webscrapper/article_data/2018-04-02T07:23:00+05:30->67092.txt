Noida: Around 200   marched for over 2.5km from TGIP Mall in Sector 38A to the district magistrate’s office in Sector 27, demanding that the government roll back a three-fold hike in fees in four inter-colleges in Gautam Budh Nagar.

 The parents handed over a memorandum to the city magistrate Mahendra Singh who said that their demands will be forwarded to the CM.
 
 “Yogiji ap batayein, school me fee badhi 300 per cent. Kaise padhayen hamare maa-baap? (Yogiji, when the school fee has been raised by 300%, how can our parents make us study?),” read a placard held by the protesters.
 
 “The government is repeatedly raising the slogan of ‘beti bachao, beti padhao’. How can we teach our daughters when the school fee has been hiked three-fold?” asked Rampal Gadariya, one of the parents.
 
 The memorandum by the parents sought that the hiked fee be either rolled back or the schools be taken over by the UP government under the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya model.
 
 DM BN Singh said he would convey the parents’ demands to the chief secretary and the education society would take a call on the matter.
