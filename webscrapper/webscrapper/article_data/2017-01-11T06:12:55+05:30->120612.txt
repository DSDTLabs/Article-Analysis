CHENNAI:   working president M K   on Tuesday justified the social welfare measures undertaken by Dravidian parties, especially during the DMK regimes, saying it was necessary for the development of the state. 

 “We are ready to bear the burden of welfare measures even if some people call them  ,” said Stalin, who was speaking on the topic ‘Growth or Freebies’ at the India Today conclave in the city. 
 
 “Can anyone criticise distribution of rice at a subsidised rate, provision of noon meals to schoolchildren, and distribution of old age pensions? More than 85 lakh households benefited under the 1kg for Re 1 rice scheme. Our government ameliorated the hunger of numerous households living below the poverty line by provision of rice at a subsidised rate,” said Stalin.
 
 “During the DMK regime, there were several welfare measures taken, and at the same time investment growth in the state grew by 3.48% and nearly Rs 46,091 crore worth investments were received,” said Stalin. 
 
 It was during this period that the state launched the   project, desalination projects were completed, and an ultra-modern library was constructed at a cost of Rs 171 crore, he said. “It was after looking at our performance that   said Tamil Nadu is the best state in the country for investment,” added Stalin.
