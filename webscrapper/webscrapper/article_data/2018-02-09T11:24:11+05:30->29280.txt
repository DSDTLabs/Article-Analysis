BENGALURU: Scientists at the   (IISc)'s Centre for Neuroscience and   on Thursday claimed to have identified a key protein in the brain that can help pre-empt   even before short-term memory loss sets in. 

 One of the first clear signs of the onset of Alzheimer's is the loss of short-term memory. However, scientists believe changes in the brain begin decades before clinicians notice such signs. The identified protein in the brain is broken down early in Alzheimer's disease, affecting communication between nerve cells that is important for memory formation. 
 
 "The protein, called F-actin (fibrillar actin, a polymer of the protein G-actin), is responsible for maintaining the shape of mushroom-shaped projections called dendritic spines on the surface of a nerve cell. These spines protrude into synapses, the junctions between nerve cells, and act as docking spots for other neurons to connect and transmit signals. Researchers found for the first time that F-actin is broken down very early on in Alzheimer's disease, affecting the shape and number of spines, which in turn disrupts synaptic communication and leads to memory deficits," a statement issued here read.
 
 The results were published in the Journal of Neuroscience. Alzheimer's disease is thought to affect 60%-70% of 50 million people worldwide who suffer from some form of dementia. "Thus, identifying key molecules involved in the initial stages may help detect it early and develop drugs that delay its onset or slow it down, allowing patients to lead a better quality of life. Research has shown one of the key early events is disruption of synapses caused by loss or defects in dendritic spines, which interrupts flow of information between nerve cells. However, what causes this disruption has remained unclear," it added.
 
 The IISc team includes Reddy Kommaddi, Smitha Karunakaran and Vijayalakshmi Ravindranath. They collaborated with   from Rush Alzheimer's Disease Centre in Chicago.
