NAWADA: The district police on Sunday claimed to have busted a gang involved in helping the examinees appearing at   (BSSC) examination across the state. They arrested 28 ‘scholars’ and recovered sophisticated electronic devices from their possession in a raid on an examination centre in a private school near   under the Warisaliganj police station area in the district.
 
  Following a tip-off that a gang at Warisaliganj was active in helping examinees in the BSSC exams across the state, Nawada SP  , along with Warisaliganj police, conducted the raid and nabbed the 28 ‘scholars/experts’. Original answer books as well as various electronic devices used in helping the examinees were also seized.
  
  The SP said one Sunil from Sonbarsa in Saharsa district was the gang leader. He was being assisted by a local,   from Warisaliganj market. The same group was involved in a similar exercise on earlier occasions as well. This year they charged 5.75 lakh from each candidate, the SP said.
  
  The SP said the Warisaliganj centre was a random selection by the authorities followed by the raid by Patna police on Saturday in which three persons were arrested from a rented house at   under the Agamkuan police station in the state capital. The questions were leaked on WhatsApp to the ‘experts’ who transmitted the corresponding answers via bluetooth to the examinees. The items seized included a laptop, 2 printers, 36 mobile phones, 5 motorcycles besides original certificates and admit cards.
