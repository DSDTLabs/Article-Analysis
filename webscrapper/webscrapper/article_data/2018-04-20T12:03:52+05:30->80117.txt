PATNA: The   ( )’s fire safety staff conducted a mock emergency evacuation drill at the city’s Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport on Thursday to test their preparedness. 

 This was part of the Fire Safety Week being observed by them since April 14.
 
 The AAI’s fire safety personnel demonstrated various equipment and techniques used for rescue and fire fighting in case of any incident of a fire in the aircraft, navigational aids, terminal building or any part at airport.   vice-chairman Vyasji was the chief guest.
 
 According to Patna airport director Rajender Singh Lahauria, the airport is equipped with one of the best crash fire tenders. “The objective of the week-long programme is to check the preparedness of the airport’s staff concerned in handling a fire incident and rescuing the passengers within the shortest possible time,” he said.
 
 Fighting fire in an aircraft involving inflammable fuel is always different from fighting a fire incident in the terminal building or any other such place, Lahauria pointed out.
 
 In June last year, a Delhi-bound IndiGo flight (6E 415) carrying 174 passengers caught fire at the time of takeoff from the Patna airport. Airport officials successfully evacuated the passengers and crew members on board.
