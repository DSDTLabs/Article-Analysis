Actress America   says it would be 'amazing' to film the third part of the 'Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants' whenever it happens. 

 The 32-year-old actress says it would be great to reunite with her co-stars   Lively,   and Amber Tamblyn for a third part. 
 
  
  
 "It's an idea and a conversation. I think it would be amazing. The sisterhood is still well and alive. I love my girls. We're very much a part of each other's lives and if the movie happens it would be a great thing," says Ferrera.
