CHANDIGARH: A   court has sentenced five members of a family, including the victim’s mother, to life imprisonment in an   case. The court of additional sessions judge Sunita Grover gave the ruling after they were convicted of killing a 17-year-old girl in September 2016. The court also slapped a fine of Rs 50,000 on each convict.

 “Since the incidents of honour killings are on the rise, hence the accused don’t deserve any leniency,” the judge remarked while announcing the quantum of sentence on Friday.
 
 The case dates back to September 5, 2016, when the girl, Preeti, was poisoned at her house in Bighal village of Sonipat district. Preeti’s family members decided to kill her after they found her with a boy of another village. Initially, police had booked her brothers Mukesh, Sonu and Sandeep for murder. However, after their interrogation, they arrested Preeti’s mother Rajbala and cousin Krishan Kumar. Police interrogation revealed that the killers had strangled Preeti after giving her poison. Once dead, they cremated her quietly in the village.
 
 The next day, the then sarpanch of Bighal, Om Parkash, informed the police. Acting swiftly, cops took the half burnt body from the pyre into custody. After inquest proceedings, once the body was identified as that of Preeti, her were brothers arrested and a murder case registered against them at Gohana Sadar police station. Later, Rajbala and Krishan were also arrested. Since then, they were facing the trial in the case.
