MANALI: With   turning favourable in Rohtang, two   were established on either side of   on Saturday to ensure pedestriansâ€™ safety.

 Rohtang Pass is covered with five to 10ft of snow. Although it is dangerous to cross the pass, many people risk a crossing on foot in cases of emergency. Rescue teams in Marhi and   will keep an eye on activities here and allow or stop people from going towards Rohtang, depending on weather conditions.
 
 All pedestrians will have to get themselves registered with both the posts before and after crossing Rohtang to make sure people are safe and no one is stuck in blizzards. If a person is registered at one post but not at the second by the end of the day, the rescue team will leave for the pass to search for him.
 
 The rescue team includes mountaineers, police, radio operator, medical expert, cook and helper. Camps remain operational only when people cross Rohtang. Last year, they were removed on December 25 after the heavy snowfall made a crossing impossible. Teams will be stationed here till the   highway opens for vehicular traffic.
