MANGALURU: "After working for nearly 20 hours and taking care of my employer’s 28 children, I was allowed to eat the leftover food, if any," recalls   Mendonca.

 Jacintha, 47, who was trafficked to Saudi Arabia in June 2016, returned home safely on September 22.
 
 Narrating her horror in the   country, Jacintha says that 60-year-old Kafil Abdullah Mohammad Aoun Allah Almutairi had three wives. The first wife has 16 children, second 11 and the third wife, a 28-year-old, had a year-old baby. "They all stayed in adjacent mansions and I was the only maid taking care of all them," said Jacintha.
 
 "My day began at 6am. One of the wives used kick me to wake me up. I worked in all three mansions till 2am. Sometimes, the children used to wake me up in the middle of the night. They would pour water on my face or yank my hair, if I took time to wake up. My health started to deteriorate with no sleep and food. I refused to eat the leftover food and survived only on water, biscuit, tea and canned juices. They showed no mercy when I pleaded that I was too ill to work," recalled Jacintha of her ordeal.
 
 Jacintha fled from the house on November 28. To her bad luck, a neighbour on the pretext of directing her to the Indian embassy took her to the police station. Police took her back to her employer.
 
 The worse was to come after Jacintha’s attempt to escape. The abuse got brutal now. "Four men beat me up black and blue, slammed my head against the wall. One of them caught my jaw while another pulled my hair from behind. I injured my jaw. They then threw me on the bed. For four days, I couldn’t speak a word or swallow. My face was swollen," recalled a shocked Jacintha.
 
 Jacintha never got her salary on time and had to beg for it. They never entertained any calls from her children and saw to it that she never had a cellphone.
