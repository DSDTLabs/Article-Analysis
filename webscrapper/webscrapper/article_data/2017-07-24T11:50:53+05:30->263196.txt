AURANGABAD: Two people jumped before a goods train at a railway over bridge in the Cantonment area on Sunday. The 23-year-old man died on the spot, but the 19-year-old girl was left seriously injured.

 The deceased has been identified as Akash Pawar. He and the girl were both residents of the city’s Jai Bhavani Nagar area.
 
 Primary investigations in the case have revealed that on Sunday afternoon, the duo jumped from the railway over bridge, only to land before a goods train arriving at   from   junction.
 
  Akash, the only son to a labourer couple, was   to death. 
 
 Soon the driver of the goods train alerted the railway staffers, who helped reach her to the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH).
 
 A police official said that a few days ago, Akash had left home saying that he was leaving to Pune in search of a job. 
 
 He contacted his parents around eight days ago, telling them that he had got the job and would soon be coming to meet them. However, his parents and relatives got worried for the past couple of days, after several attempts to reach him over phone turned futile. 
 
 On Sunday, the labourer couple received a call from the police summoning them to identify the deceased youth. It was only then that his parents learnt about their son’s death.
 
 The police official said that the girl is battling for life at GMCH and is still unconscious. “Only after she regains consciousness, will we be able to know what prompted them to take the extreme step,” he said.
