 The luxury vehicle division of Toyota,  , on Monday launched its   saloon in India with a starting price tag of Rs 1.77 crore (ex-showroom). The car will be available from April 2018 in three trim options -- Luxury, Ultra Luxury and the Distinct -- with price going up to Rs 1.94 crore (ex-showroom).

 
 Like most of the company's offering in the country, it is also a hybrid model that will be imported as CBUs (Completely Built Units). It will compete with the flagship luxury sedans like the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, BMW 7-Series, Audi A8 L and the Jaguar XJ L.
 
  
  
 
 The new   is based on Toyota's new ultra-rigid Global Architecture - Luxury (GA-L) platform which is shared with the Lexus LC as well. The car gets a sleek design that accommodates the signature Lexus spindle grille at the front. The sharp headlamps provide the car with a modern look and the chrome garnishing further enhances the premium feel.
 
 The interior of the car is top-notch too, claiming to provide one of the most luxurious feels that one can get inside a sedan. It is a large car, over 5,200mm long with a wheelbase of 3,100mm, providing a lot of space for both the front and the rear passengers. The front passengers get 28-way electronically adjustable seats with heating cooling and massage functions while the rear seats receive a 48-degree recline for the backrests. Besides that, the LS 500h features a high-tech infotainment system along with a four-zone auto climate control.
 
  
  
 
 
 Powering the luxury sedan is a 3.5-litre V6 petrol engine that works together with two electric motors and churns out a combined output of 350PS. With the help of a 10-speed automatic transmission, the motor makes the LS 500h capable of doing a 0-100kmph sprint in just 5.2 seconds.
 
 
 
 
 Lexus has been on a roll in India for a while as the LS 500h is its fifth luxury model in the country and the fourth one -- which is the NX 300h -- was launched last month.
