MYSURU: The development projects atop   will soon reach the apex court with the city-based   ( ) deciding to approach the Supreme Court seeking a stay on the ongoing controversial projects.

 This follows the high court ruling asking MGP to approach the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change.
 
 MGP on Monday said that it will file a special leave petition (SPL) against the HC ruling in the SC. MGP’s Bhamy V Shenoy and Ashvini Ranjan said that they are hopeful that the SC will rule in their favour and save Chamundi Hills.
 
 They accused the district administration and the state government of not making public the environmental management plan (EMP) for the conservation of the shrine-housing hill, which is located at the summit of the reserve forest in the heart of the city.
 
 The crux of the problem is the project to construct multi-level parking lot and shopping complex on the hilltop. Green activists are against widening of the road, which is also being opposed by the forest department.
 
 Following protests by the public, the district administration had in mid-2016 asked for the EMP and stopped the work. “However after a few months, a cursory EMP was developed and approved. PWD started the works on the hill without taking the public into confidence and sharing the EMP report,” they claimed.
 
 According to MGP, its demand for an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is ignored even when it is prerequisite.
 
 “Since Sri Chamundeswari Temple generates huge funds and has accumulated over Rs 80 crore, politicians are always ready to dream of projects and spend in the name of development and to provide facilities to the increasing number of pilgrims. Politicians are fully aware that such projects will harm the delicate ecology and affect the beauty of the site. The greed of money is uncontrollable,” they alleged.
 
 Chief minister Siddaramaiah had in April 2016 launched projects, and they led to a series of protests, and they were supported by noted novelist S L Bhyrappa and Mysuru royal family members Pramoda Devi Wadiyar and Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar.
