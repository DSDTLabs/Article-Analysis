AHMEDABAD: While there were   for few days after the   was announced on November 8, 2016, the subsequent   appears to have hit the bullion trade hard. This could be gauged from the steep decline in   in December. Data from the   shows that import of the yellow metal in Gujarat tumbled by 92.4% to 1.40 metric tonnes in December, a six-month low, from 18.65 MT in November. 

 The massive fall in gold imports indicates the adverse impact of demonetization on the bullion and gold jewellery markets, say industry players.
 
 "The business was down by more than 70% in December, primarily because of the cash crunch and weakened purchasing power of consumers and investors. Many don't still invest in gold except for by cash transactions. Besides, the liquidity crunch is also impacting trade," said Shanti Patel, president, Gems and Jewellery Trade Council.
 
 The ongoing wedding season hasn't also been able to revive gold demand. Imports of the precious metal declined by 88.6% in December, compared to 12.32 MT in December 2015.
 
 "Following demonetization, business is limited to 20-25% because the gold trade is largely cash driven. Even wedding shopping isn't seen in full swing and instead, people trade old gold for new jewellery for such occasions," said Manoj Soni, a city-based jeweller.
 
 Barring the initial few days after demonetization was announced, the gold trade has largely remained subdued throughout 2016. Gold imports declined by 50.68% to 49.104 MT during January-December 2016 from 100.782 MT during the same period in 2015. Interestingly, gold imports have not gone beyond 2.11 MT for a given month from February to September this year.
 
 "The hefty import of 9.20 MT gold in October was driven by auspicious buying during the festive season. Similarly, 18.65 MT gold was imported in November, triggered by frenzied investments post demonetization. Before that, there was hardly any demand," said Piyush Bhansali, president, Manek Chowk Bullion Traders Association. "The demand for gold weakened throughout the year, especially from February to September 2016 because the returns on investment were not significant," he added.
