MUMBAI: The  's landmark order to close all   and bars within 500 metres of national and state highways has had a sobering effect on Maharashtra. 

 A monthly comparison of figures for April 2016 and 2017 shows consumption of all alcoholic beverages has dipped across the state, except in the Mumbai and Thane regions, following the court ruling. Areas posting sharpest declines include the Pune, Nashik and Kolhapur regions.
 
 Alarmed by the high accident rate owing to drunken driving, the SC had on March 31 asked all states to close liquor shops and bars adjoining highways.
 
 "Of the 25,560 liquor shops, permit rooms and bars on national and state highways, 15,306 were closed after the apex court order," a senior bureaucrat told TOI on Monday.
