The software enables users to not just upload their planning permission, but also access orders for approvals online. It also helps users to check the land use at the click of a button.

 The software has been designed at a cost of Rs 2.60 crore, said a government release on Saturday. After applications are submitted through www.tn.gov.in/tcp, users will get a unique number, which can be used for accessing the progress of the applications. The software facilitates submission of any application to any subordinate offices of DTCP, updates users on site inspection details and helps download planning permission orders besides approved drawing plans. Moreover, steps have been taken to inform applicants the date of inspection, seeking additional details and personal appointment with officials over SMS and emails.
 
 It may be recalled that DTCP had mandated submission of plans online in September 2016 ending the procedure of manual filing of drawing plans across the state excluding the Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA). However, it faced teething problems with land surveyors complaining of preparing plans as per the specifications of the online application software was tedious leading to delays in obtaining approvals. This apart, supporting documents including patta, No Objection Certificate (NOC) from various government agencies should be provided manually. Following, the software launch, the government is also contemplating to extend the online initiative to the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA).
