Chandigarh: Punjab Bureau of Investment Promotion launched a Startup Portal here on Tuesday. Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh said it was for the facilitation of industry and connecting all the stakeholders.

 The Punjab government has developed this portal as a platform for new enterprises to connect and collaborate with all elements of the startup ecosystem. This platform will provide them with comprehensive information and incentives embedded in the state’s start-up policy. The portal includes detail of the Punjab start-up hub, which will be a single point of contact for the entire startup ecosystem for incubation and mentorship.
 
 This portal will carry a list of partner incubators, accelerators, mentors, and investors. The CM gave away a laptop computer along with Rs 15,000 to a physically challenged orphan girl, Jyotika Sharma of Kharar, who had sought help from the government to be able to work from home. Those who attended the event included CM’s media adviser Raveen Thukral, Mohali legislator Balbir Singh Sidhu, industries and commerce secretary Rakesh Verma, STPI director general Dr Omkar Rai, Mohali Infosys centre head Dr Sameer Goyal, Cellular Association national president Pankaj Mohindroo, and GBP Group sales director Anupam Gupta.
