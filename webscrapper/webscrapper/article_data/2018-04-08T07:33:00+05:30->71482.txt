SHIMLA: On the issue of illegal felling of hundred of trees for construction of road through Nachan forest division of   district, the   high court has appointed advocate   as amicus curiae and told him to file a report in this regard on April 10, which is the next date of hearing, after visiting the spot and getting entire area videographed. The court has also directed the conservator of forests, Mandi to file a short affidavit before the next date of hearing.

 A division Bench comprising acting Chief Justice   and Justice   passed these orders on Saturday on a petition taken up suo moto on an application moved by one Mohan Singh of Jiuni block in Chachiot tehsil of Mandi district. 
 
 The petitioner had invited court attention towards illegal felling of hundreds of trees for the construction of road through Nachan forest division. Photographs showing destruction of forest and ecology was annexed along with the petition.
 
 It was also alleged in the plea that such illegal action could not have taken place without the knowledge, consent or collusion of the officials of the forest department, district administration and the elected public representatives of the area.
 
 “If allegations made by the petitioner turn out to be correct, then obviously, the activity of felling of trees and construction of road in a forest area is in gross violation of the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980; the Environmental Laws; and the law laid down by the apex court in a judgment commonly referred to as TN Godavarman case,” the court observed.
 
 While requesting the amicus curiae to visit the spot and have the entire area videographed, the court also directed the Mandi deputy commissioner to provide a professional, who can videograph and photograph the entire stretch of the road and the forest where the trees stand felled and the road constructed. 
 
 It has also directed the chairman of the district legal services authority, Mandi; subdivisional magistrate, Gohar; and DSP, Gohar, to accompany the amicus curiae and render all assistance to him.
