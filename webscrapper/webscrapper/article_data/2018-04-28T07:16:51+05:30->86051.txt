HYDERABAD: The   (AIU) sleuths of the   department seized 445 grams of smuggled gold at   (RGIA) in   on Thursday night. The gold was concealed inside the battery of a LED lantern. Based on passenger profiling, the   sleuths intercepted a passenger who arrived from Dubai at   in an Indigo flight.

 Police found a LED lamp in the passenger’s luggage. AIU team opened the lamp and found nothing suspicious. However, to be completely sure that nothing was concealed inside the lamp, they opened the battery of the LED lamp and found eight plates covered in black powder. When the powder was removed, AIU team found eight plates made of gold.
 
 The weight of the seized gold plates is 445 grams and its market value is ₹14.3 lakh. AIU sleuths said the passenger carrying the lamp was unaware of gold plates concealed inside the lamp. “A gold smuggler handed over the lamp to the passenger at Dubai airport, requesting him to hand it over to another person at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport ,” said a Customs official.
 
 The smuggler sent the passenger’s photo to the receiver through whatsapp. “The passenger does not know the details of the smuggling gang members. The receiver would have collected the lamp from the passenger after he exits the customs check area. This appears to be new modus operandi by gold smuggling gangs,” added the Customs official.
