NAGPUR:  , president of   ( ), failed to decide the leader of opposition in   ( ), on Thursday in spite of a long discussion with city Congress president Vikas Thakre.

 The city chief told TOI that the decision would be taken on Friday. 
 
 Congress must finalize its party leader in NMC, who will be the leader of opposition, by morning of March 5. If it fails to do that, it may lose three seats in the NMC standing committee. As per NMC norms it is the party leader who submits the name of standing committee to the mayor. The date for doing this for the standing committee of 2017-18 is March 5. In case of delay, it will solely depend on the mayor to accept the names or not.
 
 Interestingly, former ministers Nitin Raut, Anees Ahmed and Satish Chaturvedi, were not present in the meeting to decide the party leader. Raut said that he was not aware of any such meeting as he had not been intimated about it.
 
 Sources in Congress said that senior corporator Praful Gudadhe was the front-runner for the post of leader of opposition. However, Gudadhe does not get on well with Thakre and his mentor Vilas Muttemwar. The two want to appoint someone else.
 
 MPCC chief Chavan is in a fix as several Congress leaders in the city are demanding that Thakre’s resignation be accepted. They hold Thakre and Muttemwar for the party’s dismal performance in NMC elections. Sidelining a senior corporator on Thakre’s advice may lead to open revolt in the party.
