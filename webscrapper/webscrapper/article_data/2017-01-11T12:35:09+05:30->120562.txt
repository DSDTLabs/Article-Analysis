NEW DELHI:   and Congress on Tuesday targeted   over his alleged Punjab chief ministerial ambitions, reminding the Delhi CM of “promises made at Ramlila grounds”. The Yogendra Yadav-led Swaraj India, meanwhile, said that AAP shouldn’t use Delhi as a “stepney” and officially declare Kejriwal as its CM candidate for Punjab.

 Delhi BJP chief   said: “They (AAP) misled people of Delhi with their election song ‘Panch saal Kejriwal’. Today, even before completing two years in office, Kejriwal is preparing to leave the city. This just shows his greed for power.”
 
 At a rally in Punjab, deputy CM Manish Sisodia said: “You vote as if you are voting to make Kejriwal the CM of Punjab. Your vote is in the name of Kejriwal.” While AAP said that rivals were reading too much into the statement, BJP and Congress pounced upon the opportunity to corner Kejriwal.
 
 “Delhi will stop suffering once Kejriwal goes… He has gone back on all his promises,” said Ajay Maken, Delhi Congress chief. “He promised not to leave Delhi for five years. But now, he is leaving for Punjab,” he added. BJP MLA Vijender Gupta said: “The CM has left Delhi in lurch. Development has come to a halt as he is either missing or blaming the Centre for his failures.” Yadav said Kejriwal should decide which state he wanted to serve as the CM.
