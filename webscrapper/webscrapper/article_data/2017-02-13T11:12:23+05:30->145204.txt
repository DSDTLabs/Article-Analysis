VIJAYAWADA: The   government is in a piquant situation over handing over of the keys of the vacated secretariat building blocks in Hyderabad to the  .

 With the TRS government is intensifying its lobbying through  , its AP counterpart was left to keep the precious asset in its pocket after making a hurried exit to Amaravati. Although moving the administration to the new capital city has greatly eased the governance on home ground, the Naidu government, experts say, has failed to follow plan B while vacating  . Instead of moving some of the institutions whose assets are yet to be distributed between the two states to the Hyderabad secretariat blocks allocated to it, the AP government has completely checked out giving an opportunity to the Telangana government to up the ante. The issue has beco me a big headache for chief minister Chandrababu Naidu as governor Narasimhan himself kept on prodding him to hand over the buildings to the KCR government as the latter wanted to put it to better use.
 
 Narasimhan, who was here to attend the National Women's Parliament (NWP), is said to have raised the issue again with the CM asking him to take an early call. Naidu is expected to put the matter before the cabinet meeting to be held on Tuesday. The Naidu government was completely clueless as to how to defend its case of having the buildings in its control af ter getting them locked. “It is a clear example of of lack of strategy. While shifting the wings attached to the secretariat to the newly-constructed secretariat in Velagapudi, the AP government should have quickly moved some of the head offices of corporations, which are yet to be divided, into the Hyderabad buildings to avoid handing them over to the Telangana government,“ said an economics professor LSN Prasad.
 
 On the other hand, the Telangana government has readied a perfect plan to move the AP government out of Hyderabad inch by inch, he said.
