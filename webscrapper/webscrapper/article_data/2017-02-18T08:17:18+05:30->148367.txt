PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: A nine-feet golden trophy is up for grabs for housing societies whose members turn out in large numbers to cast votes in the upcoming   in Pune and  .

 PI Varghese, chairman and managing director of  , has specially come up with this trophy to encourage people to caste vote, thus, improving the turnout this elections. 
 
 “Since the last few years, it has been seen that urban voters go out for a holiday on the voting day. This is the reason behind low voting percentage of about 50% in cities. The government is trying to boost the voting percentage by creating public awareness, exhorting people to exercise their constitutional right,” Varghese told TOI.
 
 He said it is not just the government’s job to take efforts to increase the voter turnout, but citizens should also understand their responsibility. “I thought of giving the trophy to the housing society which records the highest voting percentage in the civic elections. It will be a rolling trophy and the contest will be held every election,” Varghese said.
 
 The trophy will be displayed at important locations in various parts of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, for which the locations will be decided soon.
 
 Varghese said the housing societies interested in participating in the contest can download the application form from the website of Suvarna Fibrotech Pvt Ltd and fill up the details. A five to six member panel of eminent people will be constituted to scrutinize the applications. The committee will also take into account the number of registered voters among the participating societies while checking how many members actually exercised their right to vote. “Evetually, the panel will shortlist 50 housing societies that will be further reduce to 10. The winner will be chosen from the final 10,” Varghese added.
