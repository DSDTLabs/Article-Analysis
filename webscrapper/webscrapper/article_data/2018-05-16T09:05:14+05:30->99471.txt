 Subramanium has stated in his submission to the Supreme Court that an increase in the number of selectors would be proper. “Having regard to the number of selectors required, the Amicus respectfully submits that the current number of 3 selectors can be increased to 5 subject to following the criteria… The Constitution may be amended as indicated in item 12-15 of Annexure A,” he stated.
 
 
 
 He also said that full membership for Railways can be accepted as an “exception”. “Railways fields at least 90percent of the members of the Women's Cricket Team, i.e. who play for India in the national team. A question therefore arises whether Railways must be given a full membership. In view of the security of employment of the players from Railways as well as the ability to demonstrate playing skills and having regard to women's cricket as an integral part of Indian Cricket, it appears necessary to consider this as an exception.
 
 Subramanium has also said in written that the representative from Railways who exercises the voting power must be amongst one of the former cricketers who belongs to Railways and “not a person nominated by the government”.
 
 Subramanium said that Services, Indian Universities, National Cricket Club and Cricket Club of India do not qualify for status as full members. In his submission, Subramanium has put aside all other objections raised by the BCCI officials over key issues like one-state-one-vote, cooling off period etc.
