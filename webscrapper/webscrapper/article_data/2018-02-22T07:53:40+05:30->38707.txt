AMRITSAR: Canadian Prime Minister   did not go to   to pay homage to the martyrs of the Indian freedom struggle during his visit here on Wednesday. His itinerary did not include a visit to the memorial even though the national monument is situated just a few hundreds of yards from the Golden Temple.

 Instead, Trudeau preferred to visit the Partition museum, set up by NGO The Arts and Cultural Heritage Trust in Heritage Street where he spent about 10-15 minutes. “This has never happened in the past that a state head ignored the Jallianwala Bagh during their visit. We are heart broken,” said general secretary of   Nanish Behal.
