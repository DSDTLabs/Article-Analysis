Former Miss Universe,   has been away from the big screen for quite some time. Recently the diva did a 
  in a black off-shoulder gown, where she looked stunning from every angle. The velvet gown was cinched at her waist with a golden belt, which she pulled off like a true fashionista. 

 
 
 We were not even over this look and her second outing got our attention. After mesmerising us with her sexy gown, she got us in the festive mood with her ethnic look. She was spotted in Hyderabad for an event. Here, she was seen wearing a powder-blue lehenga and choli by designer Sashi Vangapalli. The lehenga set had intricate gold embroidery. What caught our attention was the styling and we're taking notes.
 
  
  
 
 Instead of sporting heavy jewellery, she styled this look with a mini nath only. We also liked her subtle make-up which was all about thick lashes and glossy pink lips. She even sported a red bindi with this look and we just can't keep our eyes off her.
 
 The nath trend is one thing you need to try this festive season. If you don't want to go all-out with ethnic looks, then this minimal take on accessory is just perfect, isn't it? So, next time you're confused how to style your traditional outfits, take a cue from Sushmita's nath swag and you're sorted.
