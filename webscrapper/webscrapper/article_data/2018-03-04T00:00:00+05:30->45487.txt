Director   has roped in actor   and cinematographer-turned-actor   for his maiden project, which is touted to be a thriller. The yet-to-be-titled film, the story of which is about a slew of incidents that happen on a single day, is set against the backdrop of Chennai. Talking about his role in the film, Rahman says, “The film is a thriller — it handles a sensitive issue and has complex emotions, too. The director told me that the roles played by Natty and I have contrasting characters — like that of a lion and a goat. How both of them struggle to achieve their goals forms the basic plot. The movie has a sensible storyline, which attracted me to this project, but I can’t reveal much about it now.”   has been signed up as the music composer for the project, which is expected to go on floors from April.
