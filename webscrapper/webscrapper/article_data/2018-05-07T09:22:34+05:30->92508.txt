CHENNAI: A thief who decided that he deserved a rest after breaking into a house to steal valuables, falling asleep on a platform in  , now has a very secure place to rest: behind bars.

 When   personnel on patrol duty roused Prem, of Udayarpalayam in Ariyalur, at 6.15am on Sunday, his first instinct was to flee. The policemen nabbed him after a brief chase and discovered a gold ring and a pair of ear studs in his trousers, an officer said.
 
 “The man said he was carrying his wife’s gold jewellery, which he planned to pledge at a pawnbroker’s shop,” the officer said. “But he could not explain why he tried to flee from the policemen. When the policemen questioned Prem further, he admitted that he had stolen the gold jewellery in Saidapet.”
 
 GRP officers handed over Prem to the Saidapet police, who asked him to identify the house that he had broken into.
 
 “The occupants of the house were not aware of the theft till the policemen knocked on the door,” the officer said. “Gayathri, 40, a resident of First Street, Cauvery Nagar, Saidapet, later found her jewellery missing.”
 
 A magistrate remanded Prem in prison.
