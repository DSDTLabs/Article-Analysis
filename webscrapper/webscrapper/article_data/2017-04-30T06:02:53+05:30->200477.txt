AGRA:   mayor Shakuntala Bharti and  , Sanjeev Raja, both of the BJP have stirred up yet another controversy by demanding a ban on carrying of mobiles by school girls.
 
  Bharti and Raja, who were at an event at  , said young girls did not need mobile phones and they should be prohibited from possessing the devices. The BJP leaders went on to claim that excessive use of mobile phones was one of the reasons why "Aligarh girls were going in the wrong direction".
  
  Though the two did not elaborate on their statement, they also raised objections about girls covering their faces while travelling in scooters and walking on the street. “What is the need for girls to cover their faces,” Bharti said, adding that parents should ensure that their daughters refrain from such acts.
  
  Raja also advised parents not to give mobile phones to their daughters, as it was not needed. "They have to go to school and then back home so what is the need of a mobile phone,” the MLA said.
  
  The issue of ban on mobile phones for girls was raised by the MLA and the mayor seconded it while addressing the gathering. Bharti urged parents and school authorities to ban carrying of mobiles by girls.
  
  A local school girl, who requested anonymity, said this is again a case of gender bias. "How can mobiles be bad for us and good for boys,” she asked.
