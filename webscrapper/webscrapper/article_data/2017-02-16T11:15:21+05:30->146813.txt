NAGPUR: A 21-year-old youth allegedly raped his landlord’s daughter (15) at knife point inside the toilet of her place in   on January 8. The matter came to light when the survivor, a student of Std IX, narrated the episode to her mother on Monday.

 The survivor claimed that the accused, identified as  , had threatened her to kill his father if she disclosed it to others.
 
 Police sent the girl to Mayo hospital for medical check-up, but surprisingly she denied. The survivor was counselled by experts, but in vain.
 
 The Jaripatka police registered an offence of rape under the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act against Thakre, a native of Balaghat in  . The accused was produced before the court on Tuesday, which remanded him in police custody till Thursday.
 
 “According to the survivor’s statement, she went to the toilet on the day of the incident. Thakre, a labourer, followed her with a small knife in his hand. He knocked the door of the toilet and threatened her to kill her father if she didn’t allow him to enter,” PSI AY Bakal told TOI.
 
 As she opened the latch, he barged inside and again shut it down. Thakre put the sharp knife on her throat and   exploited her, the PSI added.
 
 Meanwhile, a section of police have raised some doubts as they said that the girl could have screamed for help if he threatened her. There could be a possibility of the survivor and the accused having a relationship. Police said as they were allegedly caught, she might have been forced to lodge a complaint.
 
 Cops said survivor didn’t inform her parents as she was under trauma. She shared her plight with her mother who approached police to lodge an FIR on Monday.
