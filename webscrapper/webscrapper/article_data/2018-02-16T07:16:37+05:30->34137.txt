CHENNAI: It's been two years since   introduced   with safety features to prevent misuse if lost, but they are yet to gain traction among passengers. While CMRL officials maintain that they have been taking efforts to promote the cards, many commuters say they are unaware of such a facility. 

 "We have only around 500 commuters using personalised smart cards despite our efforts to publicise them," said a metro rail official.
 
 CMRL introduced personalised smart cards in 2015, about a month after the launch of its service between   and Alandur, in an attempt to encourage commuters to use the network on a regular basis.
 
 To get a personalised smart card, commuters have to provide a  , proof of address and fill up a form at any metro rail station. CMRL does not ask for personal information for issuing regular smart cards. "Unlike regular smart cards which can be issued immediately at the counter, it will take a few days for us to process and issue these cards," the official said. Commuters are eligible to get discounts similar to regular smart cards.
 
 Officials say it is worth the wait to get a personalised card. If misplaced or stolen, commuters can block them by reporting the loss at any ticket counter. 
 
 "We can also track such cards if they are used by someone else," the official said. "This facility is not available for regular smart cards which can be exchanged and used by anyone."
 
 "I have been using metro trains for more than a year to go to work, but I didn't know about such a facility. For a regular commuter like me, a personalised card will be more useful because I recharge my card for a sizable amount to use it for a month," said D  , an IT employee from Koyambedu working in Ekkattuthangal.
