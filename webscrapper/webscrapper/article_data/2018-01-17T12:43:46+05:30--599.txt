MOHALI: A Mohali woman was allegedly waylaid and robbed, and her car vandalised, by a group of men who chased her down in two cars here on Monday night. 

 A case has been registered at Phase I police station, but the police are yet to identify the accused. 
 
 Sector 91 resident   alleged that she was heading back home when she noticed that two cars, filled with men, were chasing her. Sensing trouble, she tried to speed away, but the accused intercepted her near Judicial Complex, Sector 76. She alleged that the men brought out iron rods and first asked her to give them her mobile phone. They then proceeded to break the windshield of her car with iron rods. 
 
 A case under sections 341 (wrongful restraint) and 379 (theft) has been registered. 
 
 She said she was too traumatised after the incident and informed her mother and brothers about the incident. The woman alleged that the group had gotten into an altercation with her brother in Sector 35, Chandigarh, a few days ago. Though the matter was settled at that time, she claimed that the latest incident was to avenge that. The woman alleged that the men also took away her passport and Rs 2,500 kept in the car. The woman said she was too traumatised to note down the registration numbers of the cars. Police are trying to procure CCTV footage of the area to identify the accused.
