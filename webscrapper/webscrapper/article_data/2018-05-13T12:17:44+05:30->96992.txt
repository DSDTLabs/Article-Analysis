NAGPUR:   is planning to lay 4,200 kms of optical fibre network in the Maharashtra and Goa circles. This will help the service provider cover 25% additional geographical area in the two circles. 

 Apart from it, 18,000 new sites will also be set up. The Maharasthra circle excludes Mumbai which is a separate circle in itself, said the company’s CEO for (Maharasthra and Goa), Rohit Marwha. As much as 70% of the network has already been fiberised in the two circles, he said. 
 
 Responding to questions over poor voice quality and data connectivity, Marwha said laying of the additional optic cables will help in improving the services. It will also address the problem of call-drops and strengthen indoor and infill network connections.
 
 Marwha added that Airtel’s merger with Tata Teleservices and Telenor will also boost its network.
