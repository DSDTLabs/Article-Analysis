PATNA: State rural development department (RDD) minister Shrawan Kumar said in the state assembly on Thursday that all the DMs concerned have been asked to prepare the list of families which have been left out of the   (PMAY), so that their claims under rural housing programme could be taken up with the Centre.

 In the Socio Economic and Caste Census (SECC) of 2011, 65.68 lakh families had been enlisted for the then   (now PMAY), but the Centre said it could support the housing scheme only for 39.76 lakh families.
 
 While the list of 39.76 lakh families have been endorsed by the Gram Sabhas and their houses are being constructed under PMAY, the state government will plead with the Centre that the housing claims of the remaining families are also taken up.
 
 The RDD minister was giving the government’s reply to the House debate on his department’s budgetary demand of Rs 15,471.04 crore for 2018-19. The House passed the budget, even as the opposition members from RJD, Congress and CPI (ML) staged a walkout.
 
 Earlier, rural works minister Shailesh Kumar, while presenting his department’s budget, said the state government’s target is to give road connectivity to all the human habitations in the state by 2020. His department’s budgetary demand for 2018-19 was Rs 10,508.54 crore.
 
 Meanwhile, minister for revenue and land reforms   said in the state assembly in the pre-lunch session that the ‘tapu’ (diara land of rivers like Ganga, Kosi and Gandak) are government land and the ‘ryots’ or any private person cannot lay claim of ownership on them.
 
 Giving the government’s reply to the short notice question of BJP member   and supplementary questions of other members, including Prahlad Yadav of the RJD, the minister said the government was in the process surveying diara land. “The rules are being framed in the light of the existing laws and ruling of the courts, including that of the apex court,” the minister added.
