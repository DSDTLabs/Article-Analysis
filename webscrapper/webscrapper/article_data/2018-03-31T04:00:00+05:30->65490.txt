Chennai: This summer,   and marketing professionals are in demand. With increased buying confidenceamong consumers, companies are hiring 15-20% more sales and marketing professionals compared to the same period last year.

 “It is different from the October-December season where more temp jobbers were hired. Now, with companies laying out long term plans, permanent sales and marketing folks are being hired. Last year, there were blips in consumer buying which led to lower demand for the profession,” said BN Thammaiah, managing director, Kelly Services
 
 Most of the hiring is happening in the retail and FMCG sectors, HR professionals add. Rural e-commerce company Boonbox looks to double the number of sales professionals working on the ground. “The rural demand is increasing and we need more professionals on the ground who can travel to the tune of 25 kilometres and sell products as sales professionals or territory managers in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, West Bengal and Orissa,” said R Ramanathan, co-founder, Boonbox. The overall average experience levels are around 5 years, he added.
 
 Recruiters add that demand far exceeds supply, with the modification of the traditional sales roles to meet the tech-related demands.
 
 Data from recruitment firm Team Lease show that there is a year on year growth of 18-20% this year for sales roles, as opposed to a 12% growth on an average. “GST has had a positive impact for sales roles and has contributed to the growth in their demand. However, the same kind of persuasive roles are not in demand. The new sales personnel have to be tech savvy and a substantial amount of reskilling is needed to make them suited to the role,” said Sudeep Kumar, assistant vice president, Team Lease. A report from the company also shows that 4 to 10% of the additional jobs ( from 2018 to 2021) would be attributed to GST and 50% more jobs can be expected from FDI in retail.
