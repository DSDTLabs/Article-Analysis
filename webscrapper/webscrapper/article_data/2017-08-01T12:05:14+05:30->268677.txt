PATNA: Five days after breaking ties with Grand Alliance, Bihar CM   on Monday heaped praise on PM  , saying no political party or individual has the capability to trounce Modi in the  .
 
  Addressing his first press conference after forming the new government with BJP, Nitish said he has complete faith in the PM’s intentions to crack down on benami assets across the country.
  
  Nitish, who headed the JD(U)-RJD-Congress government till last week, ridiculed Rahul Gandhi for his statement that he had come to know about Nitish’s intentions to join hands with BJP three months back. “Why didn’t the Congress vice-president tell me when I met him in Delhi recently before parting ways with his party?” the JD (U) president asked.
  
  Nitish explained his decision to walk out of the Grand Alliance, saying continuing in it would have meant compromising with corruption.
  
  “Questions were being raised on my commitment to ‘zero tolerance on corruption’. Corruption charges were levelled by   (against Lalu family). I asked them to give point-wise explanation before people, but they made fun of our party and spokespersons. They asked whether JD (U) spokespersons were CBI or police despite the fact that we had not asked them to give explanation to my party or me. Instead of giving explanation, RJD said it would give explanation when authorities would ask for,” Nitish said.
  
  The CM said the RJD after its legislature party meeting on July 26 said Tejashwi would not resign, come what may. “We discussed all this at the JD (U) legislature party meet the same day later, and the meet approved my proposal to resign,” he said and added he then went to the   and submitted his resignation letter.
  
  Nitish said he ignored the media’s extensive reporting on the corruption case. “I thought such things happen in an alliance, but people started questioning my policy of zero tolerance on corruption,” he said and added it was then that he decided to quit.
