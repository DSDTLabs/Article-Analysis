 The main runway will be shut from 10am to 5pm on all days, except Wednesdays—February 7 and 14. During this period, flight operations will be moved to the  , but as it is not equipped to handle flights as efficiently as the main one, flight delays are expected to creep into airline schedules. On Wednesdays, though, the main runway will be operational through the day. 
 
 On Day One of the main runway closure, that is on Thursday, arrivals and departures post noon were delayed by an average of 20 minutes. Later in the evening till about 7 pm, quite a few arrivals were delayed by 30-40 minutes.
 
 Airlines have braced for delays. Jet Airways, which currently has the worst punctuality among all airlines, tweeted on Thursday about the closure: “..our flights to and from Mumbai may get affected. Guests are advised to check flight status.”
