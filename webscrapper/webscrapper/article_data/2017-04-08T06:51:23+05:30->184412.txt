NAGPUR: In a first-of-its-kind event in the city, the 2nd International Kids Yoga Day was celebrated by the department of paediatric dentistry, VPSM’s Dental College and Research Centre. Over 30 students of Std V and VI of Jawaharlal Nehru School, Wadi, and the patients of the department were invited for a brief session of yoga which was conducted by Dr  , director of Padmayoga Sadhana Sanstha, Mumbai. 

 The event was part of the international movement helmed by Teresa Anne Power, author of The ABCs of Yoga For Kids Around The World, to be observed in 29 countries worldwide this year.
 
 “I’ll be teaching exercises that are convenient and can be performed within classrooms. There’s no need of yoga mats. Yoga is necessary for the growth and development of kids. Even kids have stress today. Yoga helps to focus more, concentrate, improve imagination and increase memory. It also loosens muscles,” said Deshpande.
 
 “We’re conducting this workshop to catch them young,” said NJ Chandranee, professor at the college.
 
 Last year, 25 countries participated in the worldwide movement, and this year, about 29,000 children were collectively expected to practice yoga at the same time, the same way as during International Yoga Day.
 
 The tiny tots were shown 10 easy standing exercises in a creative and entertaining way, by making kids remember the poses she named as ‘doll, chair and duck’. Deshpande also taught them the right way to meditate.‘Y’ is for yoga, she said, and asked the children to practice it every day at their homes.
 
 Former patients and little yoga masters themselves, sisters   and  , enthralled the children with a gamut of exercises choreographed on an instrumental musical tune.
 
 The programme concluded with a small skit titled ‘Pinky ke daaton ki kahaani’ staged by the interns of the department. It narrated the story of a girl who experiences tooth decay and finally finds out the right food items in order to maintain good health of her teeth and self.
