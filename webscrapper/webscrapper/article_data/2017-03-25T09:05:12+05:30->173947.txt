JAIPUR: Central government has sanctioned Rs 80 crore for   government under National Food Security Act (NFSA) for the year 2016-17. The amount was released after state government submitted utilization certificate (UC) on March 15. 

 Out of the total amount the state, however, will receive only Rs 76 crore at present while remaining amount will be adjusted in the next financial year. Sources claim that ministry is facing paucity of funds and releasing funds in instalments. 
 
  has also faltered in following the provisions of the act by not giving state 75% of the funds as advance. Act says that 75% of the central assistance shall be released as first installment in the beginning of the financial year. The balance 25% is to be released in next financial year. The released amount though falls way below the assistance earmarked for Rajasthan. 
 
 Earlier on March 17 in Rajya Sabha, CR Chaudhary union minister for state for food and public distribution replied that his ministry has not released the financial assistance as state has not provided the UC for the period 2013-14 to 2015-16. Officials claim that UC was dispatched on March 15 itself.
