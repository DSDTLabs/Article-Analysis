NEW DELHI. A video circulating on social media shows   (MP) governor   asking the BJP workers in   to adopt poor and malnourished kids if they want to get votes for the saffron party in elections.

  “Go to every village. Sit with poor kids, take them in your lap, be affectionate towards them, adopt them and fulfil their needs if you want to get votes. You don’t get votes just like that,” the former   CM can be heard exhorting her party leaders in the undated video.
 
  Furthering the electoral cause of the ruling BJP in MP, Anandiben then asks party workers to work hard to realize PM Modi’s dreams.
 
  “Run a campaign for children’s welfare. It is not that tough. Do this if you want to fulfil PM Modi’s 2022 vision,” she adds.
 
  Anandiben can be then seen telling officers surrounding her that they may not have any political incentives to work for children, but she does.
 
  “You don’t need votes, we do,” she says.
