CHENNAI: For Chennaiyin,   has been a revelation this season. The talented midfielder has produced solid performances and showed tremendous consistency. Coach Gregory said Ganesh has adjusted to his system well. “He (Dhanpal) has been thrust into the limelight by his performances. He is a local boy of Chennai, and he has had a lot thrown at him this season. His life really has changed a lot since last November. So, he has coped very well this season,” Gregory said after Chennaiyin’s 0-0 draw against Kerala Blasters on Friday.

 
 But the Briton warned that Ganesh shouldn’t go overboard with his success and needs to keep his feet on the ground. “He still has a big part to play in the remainder of our games. He has made tremendous progress, but obviously I need to make sure he keeps his feet on the floor. He gave it everything tonight, and I am pleased with his contribution this season,” Gregory said.
 
 Chennaiyin missed   in defence on Friday. But thanks to goalkeeper Karanjit Singh’s superlative performance, they were able to come back with a point. “Kerala are out and out trying to get into the top four and they gave it everything. We were obviously without Mailson, so we had to adjust with our set-up. But it was really tough coming here, so I must say I am particularly happy keeping a clean sheet. And our goalkeeper should take a lot of credit for that. At the end of the game, I was happy to have got something from the game,” Gregory said.
