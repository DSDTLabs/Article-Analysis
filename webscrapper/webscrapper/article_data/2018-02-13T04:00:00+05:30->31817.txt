Religare’s latest shareholding disclosure on the   also shows that IFC, the private investment arm of the World Bank, holds about 7% while Axis Bank holds nearly 9%.  , an offshore investment entity controlled by Indian financial services house IIFL, holds another 10% in Religare.
 
 An emailed response from Religare said that it would not comment on speculation while Siddharth Mehta, founder of Bay Capital, did not respond to a message from TOI on this deal.
 
 According to sources, Religare’s three major business verticals: Religare Securities (the stocks & commodities broking arm), Religare Health Insurance and Religare Finvest (lending arm), have strong presence in their respective business areas. 
 
 While Religare Health Insurance is being sold to True North, troubles that originated at the holding company level, Religare Enterprises, have been impacting business at the other two verticals.
 
 For example, in 2016, the RBI had pulled up Religare Finvest, the lending arm of Religare Enterprises, for advancing loans without following proper rules and due diligence. One of the main reasons was its loans worth about Rs 1,200 crore were advanced to entities purely based on the personal relations of the promoters. Over the years, several of its former directors quit the company, including a new chairman and an independent director, both of whom were with the company for less than three months.
 
 On Monday, Religare’s stock on the BSE closed at the 5% upper-circuit limit at Rs 52.
