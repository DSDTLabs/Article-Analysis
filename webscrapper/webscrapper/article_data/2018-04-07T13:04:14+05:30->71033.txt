 
 NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court has taken suo motu cognizance of a video being circulated on WhatsApp in which a man is seen alleging that sewers and drains are directly emptied into the Ganga while striking visuals show filth and waste floating in the river in Rishikesh. A single bench of justice   directed that the matter be treated as a public interest litigation and asked the state government to submit its reply in the matter.
  
  The court also issued notices to Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board, district magistrates of Haridwar and Nainital among others to file a reply by May 2.
  
  In the two-minute video, a man who identifies himself as  , tells people not to carry water from the sacred river as sewers and drains were being emptied into it.
  
  “People and the government of the state both are acting ignorant on the issue,” says the man and goes on to urge viewers to share the video widely so that the authorities are forced to take action.
  
  The bench also observed that despite various schemes, projects and directions from courts and tribunals to keep Ganga clean, the state and authorities concerned have done nothing.
  
  TOI had reported last month that residents in Haridwar have alleged that over a dozen nullahs carrying the city’s sewage were flowing into the river in full public view every day. According to a 2017 report prepared by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), around 54.2 MLD of untreated sewage was being channelised into Ganga in Haridwar and Rishikesh.
