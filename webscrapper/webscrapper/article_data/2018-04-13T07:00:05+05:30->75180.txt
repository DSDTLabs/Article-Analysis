BENGALURU: A 25-year-old   after killing her daughters aged five and two years, at her residence in   near Nelamangala, Bengaluru rural district on Wednesday. Police said Radha S, had hanged her daughters, Chinmayee S, and Chintana S before committing suicide. Police say the reason appears to be health issues. She also appeared to be depressed over not having a son.

 Police said Radha’s husband, Srinivas, found the trio hanging from the ceiling fan at around 1pm on Wednesday. By the time he summoned help, his daughters had died. Radha was still breathing and she was immediately rushed to a private hospital in Nelamangala, but she was declared brought dead.
 
 Police said Radha had written ‘sorry ree’ in Kannada on the wall before she committed suicide. “We suspect she took the extreme step due to depression, health problems and other personal reasons,” a police officer said.
 
 Nelamangala police have registered a case of murder against Radha based on a complaint filed by her mother, Jayamma. On Radha’s suicide, police have registered a case of unnatural death and a probe is underway.
 
 Police say Jayamma, in her complaint, had stated that Radha had married Srinivas, an employee of a hardware shop in Nelamangala, six years ago. The couple stayed with Jayamma for a year before they moved to their village.
 
 “Radha was upset at not having a son and constantly discussed the issue with her mother,” police said. “She was also suffering from stomach ailments and had had appendix surgery a few months ago.”
 
 An autopsy was conducted and the bodies were handed over to Srinivas on Thursday.
