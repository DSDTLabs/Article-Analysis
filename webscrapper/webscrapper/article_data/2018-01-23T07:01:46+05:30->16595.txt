HYDERABAD : State intelligence machinery’s plan to refurbish chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s convoy with a Mercedes Benz fleet remained frozen on paper with the CM himself spiking the idea.

 Some months ago, intelligence officials explored highend SUV brands to upgrade KCR’s fleet and zeroed in on the Benz. The blueprint was tabled before the chief minister, but sources told TOI the CM said he was comfortable with the existing fleet.
 
 Currently,   has a 10-vehicle convoy comprising Toyota-make vehicles, Fortuner and landmine-resistant Prado. “The CM will continue to use the existing fleet and is not keen on replacement. The decision was taken weeks ago,” an official told TOI. Replenishing the fleet with mine-proof Mercs would have scraped coffers by at least Rs 2 crore per vehicle.
 
  
 Sources said, the decision was taken with an ear to the ground and not giving a handle to Opposition parties to cite flamboyance by the TRS regime in the run-up to Assembly polls. Already, construction of the CM’s Begumpet camp office, Pragathi Bhavan, has drawn much flak from the Opposition.
 
 The intelligence apparatus wanted to upgrade the CM’s convoy as they felt the fleet had worn out after extensive use for more than three-and-half years. They also wanted to upgrade existing security in lieu of the general Maoist threat. Security officials, including   police consider Prado a reliable vehicle and had fortified the fleet with advanced features.
 
 Six months ago, KCR’s personal security was upgraded by giving him a 12-member commando security roped in from Greyhounds and Octopus units.
 
 Besides KCR, other CMs who have been using Prado in their convoy include   CM. Even the late J Jayalalithaa preferred Prado. Occasionally, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s convoy has a Prado in the fleet, but he primarily uses a  , which he inherited from his predecessor  . Rajasthan Chief Minister   too drives a Benz.
