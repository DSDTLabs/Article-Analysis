KOLKATA: An Alipore magistrate on Friday issued an arrest warrant against Union minister   after a police chargehseet mentioned that he was “absconding”. The case next comes up for hearing on May 8.

 The minister can now surrender in court and seek bail. He can also challenge the order either in session’s court or high court. Babul, who referred to the chargesheet several times in his Twitter-handle on Friday, however, refused to comment on the legal recourse he intends to seek.
 
 In one tweet, he claimed, “Chargesheet filed against me for asking Mohua Maitra ‘Mohua r u on Mohua’ while she was spewing venom against me and NaMo (Prime Minister  ).”
 
 
 
 The minister was chargesheeted under Section 509 IPC (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) which has a simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or both. This penal section is triable by a magistrate.
 
  MLA and party general secretary   had lodged an FIR against the Union minister on January 4.
 
 Alipore’s chief judicial magistrate Saugata Roy Chowdhury issued the warrant. The magistrate had taken cognizance of the police chargesheet a day earlier.
 
 Senior criminal lawyer Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee said, “It may sound very unusual that a Union minister is absconding, but this is a common police practice. Since the charges are bailable, usually one surrenders in court to seek bail. This is unless they want to challenge the trial court order in higher judicial forums.”
 
 Police claimed they were forced to mention the Union minister as “absconding” since he didn’t respond to three notices under 41CrPC. 
 
 The complainant, police said, had deposed in-camera before the 7th judicial magistrate, Alipore on January 7. “When he did not show up for investigation, we went ahead and filed the chargesheet. We had enough evidence,” an officer said.
