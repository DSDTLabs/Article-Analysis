Trichy: State BJP President   Soudararajan while replying to questions on whether it is the saffron party operating from behind actor Rajnikanth, who has finally decided to take political plunge said, “There is no need for the BJP to operate from behind.”

 Speaking at Trichy airport on her way to Pudukkottai for party meeting, Tamilisai termed the black flag protest by DMK cadres in Thanjavur, opposing governor Banwarilal Purohit visit, as uncivilized.
 
 “We do not have to operate from behind as we are progressively moving ahead by strengthening the party in the grassroots level,” she said.
 
 “Now that Rajnikanth has decided to enter politics, let him come and do the field work. We are working in the field from front to consolidate BJP’s presence in the state,” said Tamilisai adding that earlier it was speculated that BJP is behind AIADMK government and also 2G verdict. “But those spreading such lies are those who fear BJP’s growth in the state,” she said.
 
 The governor is only carrying inspection and not trying to rule the state, as some claim. Good work has to be appreciated, she said.
