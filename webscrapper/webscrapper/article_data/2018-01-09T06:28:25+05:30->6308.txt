HYDERABAD: A scientist working on important   is now staring at the prospect of having to return to India. He did his MS in the United States and also completed his PhD there. He currently works in a leading position in a cancer research project in Boston. He has a house in the US. The man from   was hoping that he would get a green card soon. And now suddenly, if the US government decides to implement the new law on H1B visas, it will affect him.

 A doctor from Hyderabad too is now in a situation that she did not imagine she would be in. She, along with her husband, a doctor from  , had lived in London for some years. They moved to the US some years ago. They also bought a house worth one million dollars there. The couple also have a college going son.

 Take another case of an IT professional from Chittoor who lives in Baltimore, Maryland in the US. His wife also works there and they have a seven-year-old baby girl. Having been in the US for 12 years, the family had settled in the US, hoping that one day they would get a green card to become US citizens. Their dreams have now turned into uncertainty.
 
 There are thousands of individuals and families like that in the US and they are confused. But some US majors are lobbying with the government against pursuing the policy and also talking to senators on prevailing upon the administration not to take drastic step.
