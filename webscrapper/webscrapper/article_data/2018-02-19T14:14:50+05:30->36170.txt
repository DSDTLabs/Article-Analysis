NAGPUR: The state board has launched its helpline centre for counselling students and parents as the board exams seasons kicks off from February 21 with HSC (Std XII). 

 In Nagpur division, all six districts have a dedicated counsellor to handle queries from students. The queries can be related to mental stress or even about the   itself (marking system etc). 
 
 Shriram Chavhan, Nagpur divisional board secretary, said, “Students can call in with their queries from 8am to 8pm. The helplines will be functional till the examinations end in March.” Board officials said it is natural for students to feel anxiety but it should not affect their academic performance. “It is quite common for students to have various questions in the mind and sometimes it can be bothersome. We want that students should keep their minds absolutely free from every worry and focus only on the exams. To create that stressfree environment every year the board starts the helpline project,” said Chavhan.
 
 Since every district has been given a dedicated helpline number, students and parents have been urged to contact them specifically. Both SSC and HSC exams will wind up by March 20 and results are expected in June. 
 
 The board has initiated strong anti-copying measures to make sure that malpractices do not spoil the exam mood. Flying squads have been prepared to crack down on cheaters and the board has been taking stern action against them.
