MUMBAI: Amit Hazra, arrested for the murder of emcee Arpita Tiwari, is said to have been interested in her, but she wasn’t reciprocating his feelings. Investigators believe this was the motive behind the killing.   was in a longstanding relationship with animator Pankaj Jadhav. Jadhav has not been given a clean chit yet, said officials.

 
 Tiwari’s body was found in the duct on the second floor of Manavsthal Society in   on December 11, 2017. Hazra lived on the 15th floor of this building with his roommates and a house help. Tiwari, Jadhav and Hazra had visited two restobars the previous night and returned to Hazra’s house around 3am.
 
 Police suspect Tiwari was pushed out of the window, but they are yet to ascertain sequence of events leading to the crime.
 
 Jadhav was called to the   police station for questioning through Tuesday. “Only those present in the apartment that night are aware of what exactly happened. Hazra is being confronted with information gleaned from Jadhav. We have his custody till Saturday and we hope to get a clearer picture by then,” said a senior police official.
 
 On Tuesday, the Malwani police also summoned  , a common friend of Tiwari and Jadhav. Kadam had sprung up in Tiwari’s support when she got into a Facebook spat with Hazra six days before her death.
 
 Meanwhile, Tiwari’s family members met investigators on Tuesday. “We were told Hazra was nabbed after his responses to a polygraph appeared deceptive. But it is important for us to know what exactly happened that night,” her sister,  , said.
 
 She added that the sill of the bathroom window, from where Tiwari was allegedly pushed off, had bottles of shampoos and lotions which were in a mess following the incident. “The bottles were back in their place when the family visited the apartment. This means the crime scene had been tampered with and the police need to look into it,” Shweta said.
