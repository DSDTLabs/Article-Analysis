CHENNAI: All is not well in the sports recruitment process of  , which has many international champions, including two-time Commonwealth Games weightlifting champion   on its rolls. 

 
 Acting on a complaint, the vigilance department last week began a probe on the selections done for filling 25 posts for 2017-18. 
 
 Files pertaining to the recruitment were taken from the sports office. A top official said the vigilance department may also look into the recruitment processes conducted over the last few years.
 
 Southern Railway has not recruited a single sportsperson since 2014, as files have been stuck in red-tape. Since the process is time-bound and has to be completed before April 1 every year, recruitments have lapsed. Railway Board, in a letter dated February 2, 2017, had rapped Southern Railway for not making any recruitment under the quota. On May 2 the same year, the   (RPSB) pulled up SR for not recruiting any sportsperson, despite demanding quotas. 
 
 The vigilance check follows complaints that the selection trials for women's volleyball team and men's basketball team were rigged. Sources said there was a change in the marks of a few candidates in the former. There are also allegations that outsiders, unrelated to the   ( ) which conducts the recruitment, were brought in to do some paperwork during the process and that applications were taken to an outsider's house on way to trial ground. 
 
 There are two committees that oversee recruitment. A trial committee consisting of senior players, sports officers and the coach and the other comprising top officials, including the departmental heads of vigilance, commercial, personnel and other branches. Sports officers of SR, who were top sportspersons in their heyday, are under scanner for the alleged irregularities, sources said.
