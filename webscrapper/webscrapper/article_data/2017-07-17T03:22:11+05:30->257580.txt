Ghaziabad: A city-based  ,  , who was the complainant in the case against   and Sandesh Verma of Webwork Trade Links of Noida, has alleged that he had received death threats through Facebook. Jain alleged that a woman, who identified herself as Yogita Bansal of Indirapuram, threatened him via a Facebook post on June 19.

 Jain has filed complaints thereafter with senior police officers against the woman. He has alleged that the threat to his life has multiplied, particularly after Garg and Verma, who were arrested in February, were granted bail by the Allahabad high court.
 
 Garg and Verma have been accused of duping people through an online Ponzi scheme along the lines of Ablaze Info Solutions Private Limited whose director Anubhav Mittal too was arrested.
 
 “The woman posted a threatening message on my Facebook page on June 19 saying that I will die a dog’s death. She has asked me to withdraw a certain   application that I have filed. She has further mentioned in the post that any government department is not liable to share RTI information after the death of the applicant which is again a veiled threat. She also said that I shouldn’t be taking up cudgels against anyone because the Webwork people are also miffed with me,” Jain told TOI.
 
 Jain had filed a complaint against Webwork directors, Garg and Verma, on February 12 on the basis of which Noida police had registered an FIR in Sector 20 police station. The duo was arrested on February 17 and sent to judicial custody.
