PUDUCHERRY: AIADMK unit secretary   supported party general secretary   and warned of   who protest against   as the chief minister.

 Former Rajya Sabha MP P Kannan, who joined AIADMK before 2016 assembly polls, quit the party on Sunday hinting at his displeasure over the recent developments. Former AIADMK MLA Om Sakthi Sekar went a step further and burst crackers and distributed sweets after the outgoing Tamil Nadu chief minister O Panneerselvam blamed Sasikala for his resignation.
 
 "OPS has the blessing of our leader Amma. His daring statement will rest our leader's soul in peace," said Sekar, who revealed that he will call on Panneerselvam and will extend support to him.
 
 Purushothaman said the party will initiate disciplinary action against Sekar for indulging in anti-party activities. "Puducherry unit stands united and backs Chinnamma for the chief minister's post. A former MLA's opinion will not affect our stance. We will initiate action against him (Sekar). Chinnamma alone can fill the vacuum left by our Amma. She stood by our leader at all difficult times. Amma's soul will never forgive OPS for betraying the party," Purushothaman said.
 
 Kannan said he was moved by Panneerselvam's decision of going by his conscience and speaking out in open. "I cannot stop myself for appreciating his bold decision. I bow my head for the stand he has taken. He had already proved his loyalty to the party. She (Sasikala) has hidden agendas and she used Panneerselvam's popularity in tiding over difficult times and sidelined him later to occupy the position," said Kannan.
 
 MLA brothers A Anbalagan and A Baskar, who had earlier openly extended support to Sasikala and urged her to assume charge as the party's general secretary after Jayalalithaa's demise, have now preferred to play a wait and watch game. "I don't want to comment on the issue at present," said Anbalagan.
