THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The   has approached the   against an order issued by the   barring the government from denying permission to start new   in private sector. 

 It was in June last that the HC had quashed the ‘policy’ of the   government and asked the education department to stop opposing new   in self-financing sector. If the apex body,  , gives approval for setting up new polytechnic colleges in private sector, the state government was in no position to deny them permission to function. The state government should also not discriminate against such colleges when it comes to admission to polytechnic colleges, through centralized allotment of seats, the HC division bench order had said. 
 
 AICTE recently approved the state government stand against permission for new engineering colleges in self-financing sector. However, it refused to consider the request for such moratorium on polytechnic colleges as well since the government request was not on the basis of any data or report.
 
 According to sources, the state government approached the SC on February 12 after the HC asked the higher education principal secretary and director of technical education to appear before the court in a contempt petition filed by a private polytechnic management challenging their exclusion in the new prospectus for admission to polytechnic colleges in the coming academic year. The director of technical education did not consider the three polytechnics which obtained AICTE permission last year and started functioning on the basis of the HC verdict. 
 
 Meanwhile,   denied permission to three self-financing college managements that sought permission to convert the colleges into polytechnics. Interestingly, the state government has sought permission to start two new polytechnic colleges in government sector. The application was rejected by AICTE on last two occasions, for want of infrastructure and academic facilities.
