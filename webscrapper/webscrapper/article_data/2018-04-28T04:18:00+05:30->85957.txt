Vadodara: Alarmed at the repeated incidents of thefts of two-wheelers from the Bhayli area of the city, Dabhoi BJP MLA Shailesh Mehta alias Sotta has demanded that a police outpost be set up in the area.

 Sotta, under whose constituency the area falls, has written a letter to minister of state Pradipsinh Jadeja stating that the city was expanding towards Bhayli and several new residential societies had come up there. Mehta added that the Vadodara taluka police station is about 17 to 18 kilometres away from Bhayli. Mehta has stated that the police may be finding it difficult to manage the area due to the distance. He has sought that an outpost should be set up in Bhayli to take care of the issue.
 
 The Vadodara taluka police station under which the area falls is located far away in Bhadra locality near Panigate.
 
 As many as 22 two-wheelers have been stolen within a month from the Bhayli area in the jurisdiction of the Vadodara taluka police station of Vadodara rural police and five others were lifted from the VUDA flats located nearby in the adjoining J P Road police station of the city police. The theft of 27 vehicles from nearby localities has raised concerns particularly because the area does not have any streetlights.
 
 The latest offence regarding the thefts was registered by Rajendra Punjabi, a bank executive living in Ashoka Flats, with the Vadodara taluka police station. Punjabi said that on April 23 morning when he was going out, he could not find his bike in the parking of all towers of the complex. After few hours, five other residents – Amit Singh, Shailesh Jethwa, Pavan Bindacharya, Bipin Dhaduk and Sandeep Singh – also learnt that their bikes were also missing.
 
 The bikes were also stolen in a similar way like others in the previous incidents had gone missing. They found that fence on the compound wall was cut and the thieves had stolen the bikes by lifting them and passing it across the wall.
