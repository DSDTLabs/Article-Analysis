PANAJI: Denying that BJP promoted casinos in Goa, Chief Minister   on Sunday said the number of off-shore casinos was restricted to six due to BJP's stand.

 "Casino has been a gift of Congress government, none of these casinos entered river Mandovi during BJP regime. When it (Congress) tried to bring casinos, we strongly opposed, due to which number was restricted to only six," Parsekar said after releasing BJP's manifesto for Assembly polls.
 
 "Now the question arises why we did not shift them. We could not, as casinos were working within legal framework. We are bound by the law. Casinos could have challenged the order of the government in the court. It could have been a slap on the face of government," he said.
 
 The CM further said the BJP government imposed several restrictions on off-shore casinos and ensured that Mandovi was not polluted. "We are trying hard to find alternative site, if possible in the interior, to shift the casinos," he added.
 
 On the recent Supreme Court order banning liquor shops within 500 metres of highways, he said the government was studying the issue. "Survey is being done to see how many liquor outlets would be affected," he said.
 
 "First and foremost we are a tourist state. In Goa it is not just liquor shops, most of the restaurants serve liquor. Over 2,500 restaurants are affected due to the order. We are exploring all possible measures to give protection to these outlets," Parsekar said.
 
 On his government's alleged failure to recover the revenue lost to illegal mining, Parsekar said a special investigation team was looking into the issue.
 
 On the medium of instruction controversy, Parsekar said elementary education in the mother-tongue was a universal norm which his government had accepted. "In the last five years we have been consistent on our stand. We gave permission to all the schools which have Konkani or Marathi as medium of instruction," he said.
