HYDERABAD: A 27-year-old housewife was stabbed to death and her body was later set ablaze with sesame oil at her flat at   on Tuesday. At the time of the incident, the victim’s husband was reportedly at his workplace and only their 16-month-old son was at home. After killing the woman, the assailant latched the main door from outside and coolly walked away from the location. Police suspect the assailant could be known to the victim.

 The victim,  , was wife of Nagabhushanam, a civil engineer with L&T Metro Rail (Hyderabad). At 8.15pm on Monday,   left his flat (#104) at   apartment at Nanda Nagar, Erragadda and went to his office at Madhura Nagar.
 
 At 12.45am, neighbours noticed smoke billowing from the flat and knocked the door. As there was no response, they opened the main door which was latched from outside. “They found Soumya’s body in flames and her son,  , crying beside it. They immediately picked up the boy before he could suffer any burns,” SR Nagar inspector Waheeduddin said.
