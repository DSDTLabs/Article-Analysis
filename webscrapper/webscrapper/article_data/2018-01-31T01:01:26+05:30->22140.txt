 A bench of justices Siddharth Mridul and Deepa Sharma questioned Sisodia, who was present in court, about why his department wants to give extra weightage for guest teachers.
 
 During the hearing, Sisodia submitted that guest teachers have played an important role in transforming government schools and have improved the state of education and their removal will hurt the system. He also claimed that despite addressing several letters on the issue to the LG, there has been no response.
 
 “There’s a difference of opinion between LG and education minister. Why can’t you resolve it? Why bring it to court?,” the court asked.

 The court then asked the LG to meet and sort out differences of opinion. It was hearing an appeal by the Delhi government’s Department of Education challenging a single bench’s order staying the Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board (DSSSB) notice withdrawing the process for the appointment of 9,000 teachers in government-run schools.
 
 Advocate Ashok Agarwal, appearing for NGO Social Jurist, questioned the locus of the deputy chief minister in filing the appeal saying he was not personally affected with the single judge’s order of December last year.
