CHENNAI: The operational lines of Phase 1 are yet to be properly linked with other modes of transport, but   rail is already thinking of intermodal connectivity for Phase 2. It has assessed that it may need as many as 400 feeder buses and more than 1,100 bicycles for the 107.55km three-corridor project that will provided access to the city for residents of far-flung areas. 

 By 2026, when a part of the second phase is expected to become operational,   (CMRL) estimates it will need around 92 feeder buses.   managing director Pankaj Kumar Bansal had recently said the line connecting Siruseri SIPCOT on OMR with Madhavaram, which will be built first and cover localities like Nungambakkam, Anna Salai, Mylapore, Adyar, will be ready in about six years. 
 
 The number of feeder buses required is expected to go up to 129 in 2035 and to 400 in 25 year. To provide last mile connectivity, CMRL will have to coordinate with   services and the city corporation.
 
 A total of 104 stations will connect three corridors from Madhavaram to Siruseri (46.1km), Madhavaram to Sholinganallur (45.2km) and CMBT to Light House (17.1km). The project, which is awaiting Centre's approval, is estimated to cost 85,049 crore. 
 
 CMRL officials estimate they would need 715 bicycles to cater to the growing footfalls in another eight years. The requirement will go up in 10 years when 951 bicycles will be needed in 2035 and by 2045, around 1117 bicycles would be required to cater to the growing footfalls across all stations.
 
 "A proper road map for last mile connectivity was drawn up for Phase 1 also, but we cannot expect everything to be place at this stage because phase-1 is not completely operational," a CMRL official said.
