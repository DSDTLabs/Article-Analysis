Actress   is back on small screen, at least for some days. The ‘Bou Kotha Kao’ actress is excited to be back on television. Presently, she can be seen in a few episodes of popular serial ‘Jamai Raja’, which has Arjun Chakrabarty and   as lead actors.

 Manali’s character ‘Paramita’ has just been introduced in the show. She said, “I am excited to be back after one year. It is a small role and I will be seen for one week or so. Last time I did a similar role in the serial ‘Jhumur’. The story which revolved around the character played by me was also aired for 7 days.”
 
 Manali is portraying the character of ‘Paramita’ who is abused by her in-laws for dowry. She is depressed due to unfavourable circumstances and in a desperate move ‘Paramita’ tries to commit suicide. ‘Ishan’ saves her and solves the domestic problem.
 
 So does she have any plan to make her fans happy by doing a mega serial again? “I love television. It has made me popular. But right now I want to concentrate on films. Mega serial demands time. I said yes to this serial since the story revolves around the character of Paramita for the next seven days. I can’t commit more days right now,” she said. Presently Manali has two films in her kitty, ‘Kuasha Jokhon’ and ‘Amar Bhoy’.
 
 When asked about the response from her fans, Manali said, “I am getting a good response from the viewers,” the actress signs off.
