THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The government has decided to set up surgical oncology departments in five medical college hospitals in the state, said health minister K K  . 

 The surgical oncology departments are being set up in the medical colleges in Thiruvananthapuram, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Thrissur and Kozhikode.
 
 The government has created 105 new posts for establishing these wings in these hospitals. The posts have been created in surgical oncology, medical oncology and onco-pathology units.
 
 The move was part of strengthening cancer treatment in government medical college hospitals, said the minister.
 
 It is for the first time that surgical oncology departments were being set up in the medical college hospitals. Till date, the general surgery departments used to conduct the surgery of cancer patients. With the strengthening of the oncology departments at the medical college hospitals, the government aims to offer cancer treatment in all districts.
 
 In districts which do not have medical college hospitals, similar oncology departments will be set up in district or general hospitals.
 
 The government had been aiming to offer the kind of treatment offered by the Regional Cancer Centre and the Malabar Cancer Centre in all the districts, said the minister.
 
 The government had already sanctioned Rs 48 crore for purchasing linear accelerators to offer modern radiation technology to patients in Thiruvananthapuram, Kottayam and Thrissur medical college hospitals, Shailaja added.
