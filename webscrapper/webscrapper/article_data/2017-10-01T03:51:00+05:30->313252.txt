Ahmedabad: A 42-year-old man died after he was hit by a car in   on Saturday morning. The car didn’t have a registration number. On the basis of sales records, police are investigating whether or not the vehicle was purchased on Dusshera itself.

 Vasna police said Gemar Desai, 48, a resident of Visat Krupa on Vasna Barrage Road, works as a car driver for private firms. His younger brother, Naran Desai, 42, lived with him and was associated with cattle rearing.
 
 “Desai was near Dharnidhar Derasar at 11:18 am when he got a call informing him that Naran had been injured,” a police officer said. “Desai rushed to the spot at Ratanba Upashray on the road from Southwest School to Rampur. He found Naran’s body on the front of the car with multiple injuries on head and body. Naran had died on the spot,” the police officer said.
 
 Police said that the incident took place when Naran was sitting on the footpath near the boundary wall of Upashray. “The driver might have lost control of the car and hit Naran, giving him no time to move,” the police officer said. “The car driver fled from the spot immediately. Police have roped in FSL experts to ascertain whether there was any mechanical fault with the car.”
 
 The car has no registration number. The police officer said they were probing to find out whether the car was purchased on Saturday morning. “On the basis of the car’s brand and other characteristics, we have approached multiple showrooms to get more details and identify the car driver,” the police official said.
