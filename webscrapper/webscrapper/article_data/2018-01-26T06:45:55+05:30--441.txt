NOIDA: In a haste to inaugurate the Sector 18 multi-level   facility on Uttar Pradesh Diwas, the facility was thrown open on Wednesday with work still continuing on all the floors of the building. With lifts, fire-fighting equipment and   yet to be installed, the facility hardly has had any visitors yet.

 According to Noida Authority officials, the ground, lower and upper basement floors are open for parking, while the first to fifth floors would be opened to public on February 1. However, when TOI visited the parking facility on Thursday evening, several vehicles were parked on the road outside it, but there was not a single vehicle inside. Marble-laying work was going on most of the floors, including the upper basement. 
 
 While the outer walls of the multi-level facility were freshly white-washed and decorated with flowers for its launch on Wednesday, inside, heaps of construction material could be seen piled up on all the floors.
 
 No fire-fighting equipment, automatic barriers to check vehicle theft and CCTV cameras have been set up in any of the floors. Labourers could be seen drilling on the upper basement, second and third floors, and a staircase was being completed on the fourth floor.
 
 “The demarcation for two- and four-wheelers is yet to be done on all the floors, and eight lifts are yet to be installed. Marble-laying work is yet to be completed on some of the floors. It will take about a month,” a labourer said.
 
 Meanwhile, Noida Authority officials said most of the equipment, including CCTV cameras, would be installed within three months after DLF, which has been given the new contract for maintaining parking both in Sector 18 and the facility, takes charge on February 1.
 
 “The installation of CCTV cameras and other equipment will be done by the DLF management within three months of opening the parking lot,” project enginner SC Mishra told TOI.
