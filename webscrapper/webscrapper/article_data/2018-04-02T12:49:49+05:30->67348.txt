JAIPUR: The Jaipur police seized seven trucks illegally transporting banned sand (Bajri) on Sunday evening.

 Muhana SHO   informed TOI, those five persons who were escorting these dumper trucks have been taken into detention and would be interrogated.
 
 “We spotted some vehicles passing through our area. We set-up a check point and the vehicles were intercepted,” Singh said, adding that a search was conducted after which it was found that trucks were carrying sand which has been banned as per the directions of the apex court.
 
 “We have taken action as per the motor vehicle act, the rest of the procedure will be done by the mining department which is authorized to take action in such matters,” Singh said.
 
 The Jaipur police officials said that it is perhaps for the first time after the SC’s ban that so many trucks carrying illegal sand were found in the city following the SC’s ban.
 
 “This is certainly an alarming cause, that   still continues in the state and also has its presence in the city,” an official said, adding that the mining department will ascertain the source of the sand and where it was to be transported.
 
 According to one estimate, the state has suffered an approximate revenue loss of over Rs 150 crore in the last few months, according to mining department sources.
 
 As per estimates, the mafia excavates sand from the river bed in Tonk and   districts and transports 800 to 1,000 trucks daily in violation of the apex court order.
 
 As sand commands an exorbitant price in the grey market, these trucks are overloaded beyond capacity. The incidents of violence have been reported across Sawai Madhopur, Dausa, and   where locals staged protest against the mining Mafia which continues to transport sand during night time.
