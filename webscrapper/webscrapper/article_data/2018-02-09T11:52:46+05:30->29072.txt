CHANDIGARH: A residential-area park on the   near the   ( ) road has turned into a stinking pond because of a punctured underground sewerage line. The sewage has been collecting for almost two days.

 The slush has transformed a large portion of the park into a marshland. Nearby residents have started avoiding the park where they used to go for morning and evening strolls. They are now fearful of slipping over the mucky ground. “The park smells awful. The sewage has been gathering for almost two days. I don't know where to go for walks now,” said Shilpi Gupta, who lives close by. 
 
 The wastewater has risen and filled the park’s puddles, so it is now also a breeding ground for mosquitoes. The impact of this swamping has been the hardest on a large number of visitors to the nearby Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, who used to sunbathe, eat, and sleep in the park. “There’s water everywhere, even next to the entrance, and we have no place to sit ” says Shyam, who came to the   from Ambala.
