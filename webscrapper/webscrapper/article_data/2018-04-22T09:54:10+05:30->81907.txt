BHOPAL: Political analyst   said the crisis of joblessness would deepen further after the   government extended age limit for retirement in the state. He said the decision would shatter dreams of youth.

 Yadav was speaking to the media at   park where   is holding an indefinite agitation against the state government’s decision of extending the age limit to 62 years.
 
 He visited the park to extend his support to the agitation. A large number of youth were present.   said the government found it more convenient to simply extend the age limit instead of generating job avenues for a large number of educated unemployed. Answering a query whether the government would listen to the voice of such agitation, he said “ No”. “Those in power do not hear such voices as they are power-drunk. However, agitation is the strongest medium in the democracy to raise an issue,” he explained.
 
 Berozgar Sena chief  , who is spearheading the movement said, youth in MP were disappointed over the government’s decision. He demanded a SIT probe into irregularities in MP Public Service Commission exam.
 
 He said exams are held, but youth wait for results and are disappointed.
 
 Later, an SDM reached site. Sena members submitted a memorandum, addressed to the CM, to him highlighting their demand to roll back retirement age from 62 to 60. Later, Yadav offered Hunka juice, who ended his agitation with the ultimatum if their demand was not conceded, agitation would be launched in two months.
