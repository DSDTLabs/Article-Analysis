CHANDIGARH: The Haryana government will soon enact a stringent law to punish those found abandoning their milch cows, chief minister   said on Sunday. 

  The chief minister appealed to the people not to abandon their cattle and keep them in their houses, saying it was not easy for the government alone to protect them. 
 
 Khattar told the media here that the state government has already enacted the "  and Gausamvardhan" Act for the protection of cows. "The government has tagged cattle in the gaushalas as it would help in knowing their location.   kept in the houses would also be carried out so that these are not abandoned in any situation,"   said.
 
 While seeking the support of the people in effective implementation of the drive to protect the livestock, the chief minister appealed to them not to abandon their cattle and keep them in their houses as it was not easy for the government alone to protect them.
 
  The BJP government in the state has taken a number of steps for the protection of cows. The Khattar government imposed a ban on beef in 2015, followed by a ban on cow slaughter in the state. From setting up of creches for cows to sterilizing and rounding up stray bulls, setting up an e-portal for livestock, setting up "gaushalas", announcing a cattle insurance scheme and even appointing a senior police officer to exclusively monitor smuggling of cows in the state - the BJP government in Haryana has done it all. Khattar, a former   (RSS) activist, took over as chief minister on October 26, 2014.
 
 Earlier in March 2015, for "protection and upkeep" of cows, Haryana enacted a law which clamps a complete ban on cow slaughter in the state and provides for a rigorous imprisonment ranging from three to 10 years for killing the animal.
