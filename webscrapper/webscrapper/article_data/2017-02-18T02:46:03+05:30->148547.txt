NOIDA:   of Noida are plagued with strewn garbage, an issue that continues to plague the areas. This in a sharp contrast to the posh   of Noida, where the roadside   pile-up issue has been contained to a certain extent.

 Roadsides of sectors 57, 58 and 62, where most of Noida’s BPO, e-Commerce and export related companies are set up, are inundated with piles of garbage. A haven for rag pickers, dogs and cattle, the garbage dumps are an eyesore for employees who work here and their companies. A drive around the sectors showed pile ups at over four to five spots with an overpowering stench. Plastic bags, waste from nearby restaurants, dhabas and office canteens have been dumped here.
 
 According to the Noida Entrepreneurs Association (NEA), repeated complaints were made to the Noida Authority but are yet to draw a response. The situation has become worse with encroachments springing up along the arterial roads.
 
 “We have complained to the Noida Authority several times and repeatdely brought the issue up. Noida is primarily an industrial city and its   should be given attention. We feel neglected. There is a budget for all of this, then why is it not effectively put to use,” Vipin Kumar Malhan, president of NEA said.
 
 Noida Authority has an annual budget of over Rs 9,000 crore for the development of Noida in Gautam Budh Nagar. It is also in charge of the health, hygiene and sanitation conditions.
 
 The garbage collection system of Noida is still to be streamlined as the piles collected from door to door is still dumped at various points of the city.
 
 In response to the situation, GB Nagar district magistrate N P Singh said, “Noida Authority needs to take action to preserve the health and sanitation condition of the city. We hope it takes effective action before the situation gets out of proportion.” 
 
 Noida Authority officers were unavailable for comment.
