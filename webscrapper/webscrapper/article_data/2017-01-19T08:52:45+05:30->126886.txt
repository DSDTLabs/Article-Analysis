MUMBAI: Air pollution was responsible for 23 million cases of restricted activity days (RAD) - either less productive days or days off work for individuals - in the commercial capital in 2015.

 Worsening quality of air in the city also led to 64,037 emergency room visits in 2015 by those stricken by respiratory ailments, up 35.4 percent from 1995, according to findings from a study by researchers at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.
 
 In comparison, in Delhi, there were 29 million cases of RAD and 0.12 million emergency room visits in 2015.
 
 The study's lead author,  , said impact of air pollution on health and productivity was evident in that the increase in cases and cost due to loss of productivity after 2005 was in line with overall trends in pollution. “Up to 2005, PM10 levels (which indicates presence of particulate matter in air) saw a drop. But after 2005, they were again on the rise,“ said Maji.
 
 Economic cost of PM10 exposure rose around 60% in Mumbai from $2.68 billion in 1995 to $4.26 billion in 2015.Cost to Delhi jumped 135% in the same period to hit $6.39 billion, the study said. (Economic toll was calculated using cost of treating illness, loss of work days and an indi vidual's willingness to pay for reduction in risk of death.) One measure of health and longevity is called “disability-adjusted life years“, representing years lost due to illness. This measure for illnesses caused by air pollution doubled in Delhi between 1995 and 2015 from 0.34 million to 0.75 million disabilityadjusted life years (DALY). In Mumbai, that number rose from 0.34 million to 0.51 million DALYs in the same period. To keep to current health outcomes in 2030, PM10 levels would have to decline by 44% in Mumbai and 67% in Delhi, the study said.
 
 These estimates are likely to be an undercount of actual costs, mortality and morbidity , said researchers, since the study looked only at the impact of PM10 and to a lesser extent PM2.5. If the effect of PM 1a finer, more toxic particulate size -ozone and other pollutants were included, numbers would be much higher, said Maji.
 
 The IIT study was published recently in the Environmental Science and Pollution Research Journal, and authored by research scholar Maji, IIT Bombay profes sor Anil Dikshit and   from the Berkeley Initiative in Soft Computing, USA.
 
 In India, air pollution causes more than half a million premature deaths annually and 20 million DALYs, according to the  . A recent   report pegged the cost of air pollution to India at 8.5% of its GDP in 2013.
