SINGUR: Five months after the   ordered the Singur land must be returned to its owners, the first of the summer rice,  , were planted by farmers in a 200 acre plot in Gopalnagar on Wednesday. The   (SRI) method was used.

 Ever since the land-return order, concerns had remained whether the concrete mesh setup in the now dismantled Tata Nano factory has permanently damaged the multicrop land character in these parts.   on October 30 last year kicked off the process of cultivation in a symbolic gesture by sowing mustard seed, which is faster and easier to grow in winter.
 
 On Wednesday, when   was the first to plant the Boro seedlings in his 12 decimal plot in Gopalnagar, he was elated. “I was sent to prison for refusing to part with my land. I had insisted our land is very fertile and we often end up growing three crops round-the-year in the same plot. Today, I stand vindicated. The factory had turned this land into a concrete mass.Yet the land beneath remained fertile,“ Ghosh said.
 
 But the state agriculture department remains cautious. The SRI method which they are advocating here is different from the conventional rice cultivation methods. Experts say this involves planting single, young seedlings at optimal wide spaces, keeping the soil moist but well-drained and aerated and adding compost or other organic materials to the soil.
