NEW DELHI: Pass percentages for the Class X exams have been falling since 2015 and the return of the compulsory board exam after eight years has done nothing to arrest the trend. From 90.95% last year for the combined board and schoolbased exams, it has slipped to 86.7% this year.

 The fall is more precipitous when compared with the pass percentage of 97.32% in 2015 and 96.21% the following year. The good news, however, is the spike in the number of high scorers and toppers this year.
 
 
  
  
 The top rank was shared by four students, all scoring 499 out of 500 — missing the perfect score by a single mark, just as in the CBSE Class XII boards. Around 8% of all students — 1.31lakh — scored 90% and above. Over 27,000 of these had scores of 95% and more.
 
 Although no Delhi student figures among the top 25 students with scores of 497 to 499, 15 of them are from NCR. Nine of them are small-town success stories, led by   from   and   from   who shared the top spot with   of Gurgaon and Sreelakshmi G of Kochi.
 
 Seven scored one mark less — 498 out of 500 — to occupy the second spot, and 14 notched up 497 to come third. Some of these students are from places like Durg, Hapur, Almora and Bilaspur.
 
 The board exams had been made optional from 2010, primarily on the initiative of the then human resource development minister, Kapil Sibal. The purpose of this radical move was to reduce stress and let children enjoy their childhood. That year, CBSE introduced a grading system along with Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE). This was aimed at addressing a child’s holistic development and assessing her performance through tests and grades throughout the year. The outcome of this reduced pressure seemed to be positive with the pass percentage staying above 90%.
 
 CCE was, however, discontinued last year with the decision being taken to reintroduce the board exams. This was in response to feedback from states and representative organisations of parents and teachers that doing away with the exam along with the no-detention policy was affecting academic standards. The board exam was seen by those arguing for its reintroduction as a means of preparing students for the more important school leaving Class XII test. 
 
 
 Class X: JNVs maintain pole position, girls outshine boys
 
 The number of students who have scored above 90% this year across India is 1,31,493. In 2009, the number of students who had scored above 90% was significantly less — just 5.8% of the total examinees.
 
 Delhi’s picture is not all that rosy with the pass percentage being 78.6% this year, dipping gradually over the past three years. It was 96% in 2015 and had slid to 78.1% last year from 91.8% in 2016. Among regions, Thiruvananthapuram has the best result with a pass percentage of 99.6%, followed by Chennai at 97.4% and Ajmer at 91.9%.
 
 Overall, boys trailed girls by 3.3 percentage points. Their pass percentage is 85.3% as against 88.7% for girls.
 
 The differently-abled students have proved their spirit and mettle with 92.5% of them passing. The number of such students who have scored above 90% is 135, comprising 3% of the total in this category. The first rankers here are from NCR — Anushka Panda from Suncity School in Gurgaon and Sanya Gandhi from Uttam School in Ghaziabad, both with a score of 489 out of 500. Somya Deep Pradhan of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Dhanpur (Orissa), has taken the second position with 484.
 
 Among government schools, the Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas have maintained their pole position for more than a decade with a pass percentage of 97.31% this year, followed by 95.96% of the students of Kendriya Vidyalayas. Private and government schools across India have fallen behind them.
