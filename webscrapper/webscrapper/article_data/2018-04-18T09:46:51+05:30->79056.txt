HYDERABAD: Dry as dry it could be in Hyderabad. This is exactly MIM chief and Hyderabad   meant when he talked about the massive cash crunch in ATMs. Asserting that he has been talking about it for the last 15 days and how people are getting restive, he said the problem is worse in the Old City.

 “Sanghis and   supporters do not want to accept the truth. But, it’s worse in the south of Hyderabad,” he tweeted, pointing to casless ATMs in Old City. He also shared IT minister KT Rama Rao’s concerns on the shortage and said FM   cannot sidestep the issue.
 
 Not just Owaisi, commoners like Mohd   and Faiz Ahmed are increasingly becoming picky. Shafi of Mahbubnagar said the situation in villages is far worse. Faiz Ahmed of the Old City said there’s no cash in 90% of the ATMs he had visited. .
