 As we observe World Greenery Day today, TT spots the top three green space in Trivandrum.
 
 
 
 Away from the dust and din, the Napier Museum compound abounds with with small shrubs, exotic plants and decades-old trees. The premises together with the public garden have always charmed those looking for a spot of green. The place is most preferred by denizens for their evening and morning walks. “Walking through the premises with green stretches on either side gives you a fresh feel in the morning. I walk regularly here before starting my day. Strolling through the greenery is a nice way to start the day,” says Sulekha Sreekumar, a government employee. On a sunny day, the premises have ample tree shades from mighty old trees s relief. 
 
 
 
 The lush green grounds surrounding the   is another green spot in the city. The thick carpet of green grass spread under the tree shades continue to be ‘cool hangout spots’ for city folks of every generation. The picturesque setting on the crest of a small hill lush with meadows, groves and flowering shrubs adds to the greenery quotient of the city. The best thing about the place is that one can just relax here for hours by just lying on nature’s carpet. 
 
 
 
 The city is blessed with beautiful stretches with foliage on both sides of most of the national highways. Unlike other roads in Trivandrum, the Kowdiar-Museum path presents a serene view with blooming trees on both sides. Since it starts from the Kowdiar Palace, the grandest palace of the Travancore Royal Family, the stretch is called as Royal Road or Raja Patha. The ageless canopy of trees on both sides of the road are well maintained and act as breathing lungs of the city.
