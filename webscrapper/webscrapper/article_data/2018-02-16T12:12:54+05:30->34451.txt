RANCHI: RJD president and former Bihar chief minister   on Thursday said the Congress-led UPA, which RJD is a part of, will be united for the byelections in Bihar. He said RJD will field its candidate from the Araria   seat and the Jehanabad assembly seat. 

 "Congress wanted to contest the Bhabua seat and we have agreed to this proposal," Lalu said while talking to mediapersons outside the Ranchi civil court, where he appeared in the hearing of two fodder scam-related cases.
 
 Lalu said CBI is facing difficulties in producing its witnesses in the case related to fraudulent withdrawal of funds from the Doranda treasury. "It is somehow managing to get hold of witnesses from anywhere and producing them in court," he alleged. Lalu added: "I have prayed to the court for speedy completion of hearing of the prosecution witness," he said. 
 
 During the proceeding Lalu appealed to Justice Shiv Pal Singh to announce a verdict in the case as soon as possible so that he could celebrate Holi with his family and well-wishers at home. In a lighthearted banter with the judge, he said that the judge has become very popular since he has been hearing the   case. When the judge replied that it was due to the high profile of the accused in the case, Lalu said the judge should show some mercy on him.
 
 CBI produced three witnesses posted at the transport department in Andhra Pradesh. The officers were deputy transport officer in-charge (Eluru) BRK Peddi Raju, joint transport commissioner J Pandurang Naik and regional transport officer B Gope Naik.
 
 Senior CBI lawyer BMP Singh said all three identified the letter, which mentions details of commercial and non-commercial vehicles used in fodder scam, written to the then CBI SP by his senior officer. The defence lawyers also cross-examined the witnesses.
 
 In another case, related to fraudulent withdrawal of money from the Dumka treasury, Lalu's lawyers continued their argument for the second day.
