 "...clause 10 of the Telecommunication Tariff Order, 1999 provides that no service provider shall, in any manner, discriminate between subscribers of the same class and such classification of subscribers shall not be arbitrary. Provided that different tariffs in the nature of 'Vertical Price  ' shall be a case of discriminatory tariff," Trai said in a direction issued to telecom operators.
 
 The   (Trai) said it has received complaint that some telecom operators are launching tariffs without filing it with the regulator and "offering discriminatory tariff to individual customers within the same class".
