NEW DELHI: Keeping up the focus on relations with its western neighbourhood, India will host Jordanian King   from Tuesday. PM Narendra Modi and King Abdullah will hold official talks on Thursday. 

  The king, who occupies a special place in Islam by virtue of being a direct descendant of Prophet Muhammad and the custodian of the holy sites in Jerusalem, will deliver a lecture on moderation and understanding being important aspects of Islamic heritage at an event in the city. Sources said the government was giving this event a lot of importance. Modi, who dropped in to see King Abdullah early this month, had invited him to deliver this address. 
 
 India is putting in significant diplomatic capital by engaging key Islamic countries on de-radicalisation and counter-radicalisation programmes. During Modi's recent visit to the UAE, the two countries decided to join forces between their Hedayah and Sawab centres and Indian entities to promote de-radicalisation programmes. King Abdullah has been known to be a leading voice on moderation and de-radicalisation in Islam.
 
  A new area India wants to explore with Jordan is defence cooperation. India and Jordan are currently in the process of negotiating a defence framework agreement. India also wants to deepen security ties with Jordan to leverage its unique strategic location in the Levant, with access to the Red Sea and the eastern Mediterranean. For King Abdullah, economic and business outcomes will probably be just as important since the Jordanian economy is going through a particularly poor spell. 
 
  He will be accompanied by a large business delegation.
