Mumbai: The benchmark yield on the 10-year   rose to a three-year high in Tuesday’s market as the rupee’s recent weakness against the dollar continued to force foreign funds to sell in the Indian market. The rise in inflation numbers for April, rising crude oil prices and hardening global yield also had their impact on the government securities (G-sec) prices, debt market players said. 

 In Tuesday’s market, the benchmark yield closed at 7.90%, with market players expecting it to rise above the psychologically important 8% level before the end of the week.
 
 “Rise in headline   and   number breaching expectations, coupled with significant jump in policy sensitive core inflation does not augur well for the fixed income market,” said Ram Kamal Samanta, VP — Investment, Star Union Daiichi Life Insurance.
 
 “In an environment represented by four consecutive back-to-back   in G-sec auctions, rising crude price, hardening global yield and depreciating domestic currency, this (hardening of yield) indicates more discomfort going forward. Hence, in spite of the RBI’s announcement of liquidity injection through purchase of government bond, the 10-year benchmark G-sec yield hardened by 20 basis points ( 1 percentage point = 100 basis points) from Monday’s low to close above the 7.90% level, last seen about three years back,” Samanta said.
