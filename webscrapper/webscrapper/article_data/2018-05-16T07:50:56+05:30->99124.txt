PATNA: A security guards at   (PMCH) on Tuesday nabbed a tout, Rajiv Kumar, when he was taking blood sample from patients in the hospital’s gynaecological ward. Sources said the tout runs an illegal pathological lab in front of the   main gate.

 Rajiv was taking blood sample of a patient in the gynaecology ward at around 1:30pm when the health manager of the department spotted him and called the security guards posted there. The tout was taken to the deputy superintendent’s office. Later, he was handed over to the police. 
 
 Munni Poddaar, the patient, and her husband Ganesh Poddaar alleged the man had taken her blood sample a few days ago and charged Rs1300 from them. On being asked how they knew the tout, Munni said a nurse working in the ward had introduced them to Rajiv. 
 
 “Touts are in large numbers at PMCH. I carry out regular inspections around the hospital. But I am told that as soon as I turn up for inspections, the touts disappear. Fifteen days back, I was informed by the gynaecology department’s health manager that the very same tout was found taking a blood sample from a patient. I had advised her at the time to take immediate action when she spotted the man again,” PMCH deputy superintendent Dr R K Jamaiar said.
 
 “I have asked all the 16 health managers in the hospital to be alert and take immediate action if they find or suspect a tout operating in their respective wards,” he added.
 
 “The accused was handed over to PMCH police outpost in the presence of deputy superintendent Dr R K Jamaiar,” PMCH chief security officer Col Akhtar Ali said.
