JALANDHAR: A fresh war of words has erupted between Sikh seminary Damdami Taksal and Sikh preacher Ranjit Singh  , who had escaped an attempt on his life around two years ago. One of his aides Bhupinder Singh was killed in the assault allegedly planned by Taksal supporters.

 Dhadrianwale has alleged that Taksal spokesperson Charanjit Singh   had openly issued threats in a speech against him, a video of which is out. Dhadrianwale responded to that video through a video of his own on Tuesday. Both videos have gone viral on social media platforms.
 
 Calling these ‘threats’ a ‘dharmik goondagardi’ (religious hooliganism), Dhadrianwale questioned the silence of the Akal Takht Jathedar, stating that he has never spoken about ‘chhabeel’ (serving sweetened milk and water to people free). Incidentally, those who had attacked Dhadrianwale’s cavalcade on May 17, 2016 near Ludhiana, had organized a ‘chhabeel’ as a pretext to stop him and had then fired at him.
 
 In response to Jassowal’s speech wherein some explicit language has been used, Dhadrianwale said, “They twist the things for dharmik goondagardi and this should stop. They want dominance and are openly issuing threats,” Dhadrianwale stated in the video, while referring to the ‘warning’ of ‘spraying of bullets’ in Jassowal’s speech.
 
 “They wish people to bow before them and want to impose all their thoughts on them. They say that I spoke against sarovars, which is a lie. My words have been twisted for propaganda,” the preacher alleged.
 
 He also asked his critics to give specific instances if he had mentioned something wrong in his discourses.
 
 “We have never threatened anybody,” he said, while asking people to speak up, and stating that if he could be threatened (when he has security) then what could happen to others. “I know preparations are on to silence me,” he said.
