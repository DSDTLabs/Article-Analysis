Guwahati: The state registered 887 cases of suicide after heartbreak in 2015, the recent   ( ) report on suicides has revealed. This is the highest number of suicides due to disappointment in relationship in the country. 

 "Out of total 4401 suicides due to failure in love in the country, Assam alone registered 887 lovelorn suicides. Men were found to be more vulnerable as amongst them 608 were male and 279 were females," the report said. Tamil Nadu (556) and West Bengal (402) came second to Assam when it came to 'failed love' suicides.
 
 However, it's not the first time that the state had recorded such a large number of suicides because of failed love. Since 2013, the state has been continuously recording the highest number of such suicides in the country. While in 2014, there were 519 lovelorn youths committed suicides, the numbers were 650 in 2013.
 
 "There were 494 such cases in the state in 2011, followed by 401 the next year. The figure shot up in 2013 with 650 such deaths," cited the records. Police sources here added that most of the deceased were in the age group of 15-29.
 
 Rishov Barua, a researcher in applied behavioural science, pressed for concrete step from the authority. "Like an emergency service, there should be a toll-free helpline number for free counselling to help people in distress. This mechanism, run by various NGOs in other states has been successful. Looking at the high numbers, Assam needs a similar service immediately," he said.
