NEW DELHI: The government has extended by three months to June 30 the deadline for linking of   with welfare schemes, where the benefits are funded from the Consolidated Fund of India.

 The earlier deadline was March 31, 2018, which meant that from April 1, all those who wanted to get government subsidies or entitlements had to have the 12-digit identification number or proof of enrolment for Aadhaar.
 
 The deadline for linking bank accounts and mobile phone numbers with Aadhaar has already been extended indefinitely, till the fivejudge Constitution bench delivers its judgment on petitions challenging the validity of the biometric scheme and its enabling law.
 
 An official source clarified that while there is a threemonth breather for linking of the 12-digit biometric identifier with welfare schemes (which include PDS, MGNREGA and pension schemes, among others), availing of benefits will still require either the Aadhaar number, the enrolment slip or request for Aadhaar enrolment after March 31.
 
 The extension has been given as the government wanted to avoid any inconvenience and to ensure that genuine beneficiaries who do not have an Aadhaar number are not denied benefits for the lack of the biometric identifier, he added.
