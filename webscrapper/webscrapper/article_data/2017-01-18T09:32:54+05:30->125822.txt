PANAJI: After the   (NGT) quashed and set aside an exemption from holding a public consultation on the issue of capital dredging by   ( ), a public hearing has been scheduled on February 21. 

 While the   (GSPCB) will convene the public hearing at 10.30am at the MPT officers’ club in Sada, Vasco, two more hearings on the proposed terminal capacity enhancement at berths 5A, 6A, and work on re-development of berths 8, 9, and barge berths at the port has been scheduled on February 17 and 23 respectively, at the same venue.
 
 The NGT, in its order dated September 2, 2016, had quashed and set aside the MoEF communication dated September 23, 2015, exempting MPT from holding the public hearing. It ruled that the order was in violation of the provisions of the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006. 
 
 It had also quashed and set aside the environment clearance granted by MoEF, dated February 9, 2016, and reverted the matter to MoEF’s environment appraisal committee ( ) for further action.
 
 MPT had been adversely affected by the slump in ore exports due to the ban on mining in Goa. It had initiated capital dredging through a project worth Rs 193 crore in a bid to allow capesize vessels into the port, upgrade harbour activity and improve the region’s overall socio-economic development.

 By the time the NGT intervened, MPT had completed about 65% of the dredging. The  , which upheld the NGT order, received an assurance from the MPT that the public hearing would be held.
