BHOPAL: Nutritional rehabilitation centre (NRC) of   district hospital was flooded with malnourished kids on Thursday after district administration launched the biggest ever survey to identify malnourished children.

 Last year, death of more than 10 children was reported from the backward tribal dominated district bordering  . On Thursday, there were as many as 52 malnourished children in the 20-bedded NRC of the district hospital. As they were accompanied by their mothers, there was hardly any space in the ward, said hospital sources. After crop harvesting and before migration of Saharia tribals, the teams of administration have been carrying out a door-to-door survey. “20 severely malnourished children were identified after weighing 1500 children registered in 33 anganwadis,” said hospital sources. 
 
 These children required immediate medical intervention to save their lives. Karhal SDO Jitendra Tiwari said the NRC in Karhal has been upgraded from 20 to 40 beds. He said the process to identify more malnourished children is on. He said that efforts are also required to pursue the parents to admit their child to NRC.
 
 The most-affected places where deaths due to malnutrition took place last year were Vijaypur and Karhal blocks of Sheopur. The survey is usually conducted before the onset of monsoon.
