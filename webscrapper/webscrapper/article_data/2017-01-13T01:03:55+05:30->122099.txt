 “The   has opined that DoT can impose the penalty on telecom operators for violating quality of service rules,” a source said. There was no independent confirmation of the same.
 
 The matter, however, is also being looked at by a committee of the DoT, which is considering various facets related to Trai’s penalty recommendation. Any decision will also be based on what the committee works out, a source said.
