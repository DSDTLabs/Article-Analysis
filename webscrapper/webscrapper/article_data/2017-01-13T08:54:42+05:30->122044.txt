BENGALURU: Despite the escalating conflict with BJP state president  , former deputy chief minister and senior BJP leader   made it clear that he would not leave the party.

 Eshwarappa reaffirmed his commitment to strengthening the BJP, a day after reports surfaced of him being in talks with former PM   to join the JD(S). “I am not joining any other party. I will remain with the BJP forever,” Eshwarappa said.
 
 However, Eshwarappa vented his anger at some state party leaders, alleging double standards. “The leaders have no qualms about Yeddyurappa attending a Lingayat convention or Ananth Kumar attending a Brahmin community rally. But they take exception when I attend a Kuruba community rally. I don’t understand the logic,” Eshwarappa said.
 
 Opposition to holding the   Brigade rally in Kudala Sangama in Bagalkot by Yedyurappa and his supporters, reportedly did not go down well with Eshwarappa. “I have questioned the state leadership as to why I cannot attend the rally. I am yet to receive an answer,” he said.
 
 Eshwarappa pointed out that, while the BJP backed him, only Yeddyurappa was opposed to the idea.
 
 But a few BJP leaders said that the party’s national leadership had taken note of Eshwarappa’s activities, and would take action after the elections in five states. Union minister and former CM   said, “The national leaders will take appropriate action after the hustings.”
 
 BJP spokesperson G Madhusudhan echoed Gowda’s observations.
 
 On Thursday, Eshwarappa, leader of the opposition in the legislative council, was noticeably absent at the important BJP MLC meeting, which had been called to decide the party candidate for the only vacant seat in the council. The vacancy was created after YA Narayanswamy resigned his MLC seat to contest the Hebbal assembly bypoll in 2016.
 
 However, Eshwarappa said, “I couldn’t attend the meeting since I learnt of it very late.”
