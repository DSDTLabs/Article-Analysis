Chandigarh: The Punjab government has decided to start a smart ration card scheme from June. It will be the Aadhaar-enabled public distribution system to minimize diversion, leakage and pilferage.

 Punjab food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said on Monday the smart ration card scheme is being launched to bring transparency in the targeted public distribution system (TPDS). There are a total of 35.26 lakh families comprising nearly 1.37crore individuals covered under the TPDS.
 
 Till date 98.24% families and 95.26% individual beneficiaries on the state government portal have been seeded with their Aadhaar numbers to decimate the probability of bogus beneficiaries.
 
 The minister said the entire supply chain, from the wheat procurement from the grain markets to its transfer to godowns and thereafter its transportation to fair price shops and its distribution to the beneficiaries, will be tracked on the state transparency portal. The minister added the public distribution will be Aadhaar-enabled through ePoS (electronic point of sale) devices using biometrics. In case the finger biometric does not work due to any reason, the IRIS-enabled identification will be done.
 
 There are around 16,000 fair price shops across Punjab and under the end-to-end computerization, nearly 1,400 inspectors of the food and supplies department would use on rotation basis an e-PoS machine each, for approximately 10-12 fair price shops falling under their domain.
