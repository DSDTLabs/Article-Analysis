MARGAO: Issues of garbage, the dilapidated village football ground and a   being opposed by the villagers were raised during the gram sabha held at the   village panchayat on Sunday.

 
 Carmona sarpanch   told TOI that the gram sabha members approved the audit report and an approximate Rs 46 lakh budget proposal. A resolution was passed to commence a garbage collection drive in the village. “Villagers are objecting to the present dumping site located close to the community hall so land is being identified for an alternative site situated far away from residential houses,” said Mascarenhas.
 
 “Regarding repairs to the football ground that is under the Goa state infrastructure development corporation (GSIDC), the agency has informed the panchayat that the ground has been listed as a sports complex and it is at the project estimation stage. Another issue raised was a hotel project, wherein the panchayat has appealed against the order of the director of panchayats. I have received complaints from ward residents, especially women, who have expressed their concern about their security due to the taxi drivers loitering in the area. I have promised them that I will forward their complaints to the authorities concerned,” she added.
