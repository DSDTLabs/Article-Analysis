Vatal  , the veteran ‘bandh man’, believes people in the state should be more dedicated and committed when it comes to issues like a bandh.

 “Everyone should understand that bandhs are called for a common purpose,” Nagaraj said. “Karnataka has been neglected in several areas including drinking water projects. A strong and effective bandh will reach Parliament. Otherwise, bandhs which have a low or mixed response will only loose impact.”
 
 Asked whether bandhs are relevant, Nagaraj said he believes that bandhs have the power which they wielded in earlier days.
 
 “A bandh is a powerful tool in a democracy,” he said. “I still remember how president   was forced to fly down to Chennai (then Madras) to meet a bunch of protesters led by   and others. That is the power of a true bandh. Consistency in observing bandhs for several decades helped in the formation of Telangana. This is another example of how effective bandhs are.”
 
 However, Nagaraj feels that selfish acts and thoughts hit the spirit of a healthy bandh. “These days, people think that something will happen to them if they participate in one day or half- day bandh. A businessman fears loss if he closes his shop. Hoteliers are not ready to pull down shutters saying they too cannot risk losses. But tell me, for whose sake are these bandhs being observed?”
