NEW DELHI: CAG has rapped BJP-led civic bodies for failing to mount an effective response to the   despite having adequate funds, crores of which, the auditor said, were wasted.

 Municipal bodies spent Rs 109.43 crore between 2013 and 2015 on domestic breeding-checkers without any supervision of the work done or any assessment, the report said. The audit was conducted to assess whether steps taken by government agencies and municipal corporations to control dengue were adequate and effective, the CAG said.
 
 The watchdog also pulled up   for spending Rs 10.04 crore during 2013-15 on awareness campaigns for prevention of dengue after its outbreak, thereby “defeating” its purpose.
 
 In a separate audit, focusing on upgrade of healthcare facilities in the city, CAG said the directorate of Health Services took possession of 77,558.35 sqm of land during 2007-16 for setting up 30 new healthcare facilities at a cost of Rs 14.26 crore, but none of these plots were utilised as of August 2016.
 
 It also pointed out that the Maternal and Child Health and Diabetes, Endocrine and Metabloic blocks of Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, constructed at a cost of Rs 72.07 crore, remained underutilised even after 2-4 years of completion due to shortage of staff and delay in procurement of requisite equipment. 
 
 Besides, the Rajiv Gandhi Super-Specialty Hospital and Janakpuri Super-Specialty Hospital remained under-utilised even after 4-8 years of completion. The audit revealed acute shortage of staff in several hospitals as far as senior residents, junior residents, paramedical staff, staff nurses and technical staff were concerned.
 
 “The shortage ranged from 15 to 91%, impacting functioning of the hospitals,”   said.
 
 Delhi government had decided to set up “One-Stop Centre” in 11 city hospitals during financial year 2014-15 to provide multiple facilities and services under one roof to rape survivors. The report pointed out that none of these centres had a single counsellor to provide survivors the much-needed psychological assistance.
 
 Till August 2016, as many as 3,822 cases were reported to these centres from 2015, out of which 1,219 were that of sexual assault (32%). “Yet, no counsellor was posted in any of the OSCs...” the report said.
 
 The audit revealed that despite clear directions on recruitment of staff for proper functioning of OSCs, hospitals did not initiate steps for recruitment of required staff. The health minister could not be reached for comments on the findings.
