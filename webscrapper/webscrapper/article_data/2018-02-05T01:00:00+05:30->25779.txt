Tigmanshu Dhulia, who last shot the film 'Bullett Raja' in Lucknow in 2012, will be back soon in the city with another film of his. The National Award winning film 'Paan Singh Tomar' director, Dhulia, will begin shooting for his much-awaited   from next month onwards. Dhulia, who was in Lucknow recently, to conduct a recce for the film, says, "I will shoot the film in Mathura and Lucknow. Ab shooting kahan se shuru hogi, that is yet to be decided."
The Allahabad-born director wanted to shoot in his hometown but decided in favour of Lucknow. "Actually Allahabad has changed a lot since I used to live there, that’s why I am not shooting there now. Lucknow has seen so many film shootings that there’s a discipline in place here. It’s become more shooting friendly and is very peaceful which is very conducive for film shoots. Besides the food here is so good, that’s an added advantage," says Dhulia, as he tucked in kebabs at a popular Mughlai food joint in Lalbagh.

 While names of Varun Dhawan, Aditya Roy Kapur,  ,   did rounds as the male lead in the film, Dhulia has gone ahead and signed 'Fukrey' actor and Lucknowite,   for the role. "I wanted a Lucknow ka ladka who's familiar with the language and comfortable in the surroundings, that's why I've got Ali Fazal on board," says Dhulia, adding that he’s still searching for the lead actress of the film. 
 Dhulia plans to shoot the film at   and a few old cinema halls in the city. He's also seen a few monuments in Lucknow where he will be shooting the film. 
 Touted as Dhulia's most ambitious film – 'a pure love story' – 'Milan Talkies' was first announced in 2012 by the director. Actor Imran Khan had been signed for the film but the delay in it going on floors made him opt out of it. At one point Shahid Kapoor and   were also considered to play the leads in the film but they too called it quits.
