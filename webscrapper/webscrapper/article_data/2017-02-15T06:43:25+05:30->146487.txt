HUBBALLI: Summer is still a month away, but people in many villages in Hubballi are already facing the problem of acute  . With most of the lakes and other waterbodies dried up, villagers are forced to trudge 4-5km to fetch water.

 Confronted with such a bleak situation, the people have urged the district administration to make arrangements to supply water to parched villages till the onset of the monsoon. 
 
 “We are getting five pots of water once in two days, after we flash our identity cards. We have to visit the neighbouring village that is 3km away to get water for other purposes,” said Manjunath Nagammanavar, a resident of   village in   taluk.
 
 He also expressed fears of the conditions worsening in the summer. Nagammanavar said that it would be really hard to find enough water to fulfil the needs of the household and livestock.
 
 Shivalingamma Patil of Konkanakurahatti village too echoed similar concerns. “For the past one month, two members in each family have had to do little else but walk 3-5km to fetch water. The water tanker makes just four trips daily, and that is not sufficient for our needs,” she said.
 
  of Rottigawad village in Kundagol taluk reflected on the irony of being able to use 3G and 4G facilities in his village, while water remained scarce. “Our village has a population of 3,000. The water tanker makes five trips to our village and that is not adequate,” he said.
 
 Deputy commissioner S B Bommanahalli said, “The 17 villages in Kundagol and Hubballi taluks are faced with severe drinking water problems. We have deployed 32 water tankers to meet the drinking needs of these villages, and they are making 90 trips every day. If the need arises, we will increase the number of tankers.”
