AGRA: With elections looming on the state, banks in rural   have seen a sudden surge in funds. In Aligarh district, the 73 branches of Aryavrat  , the largest rural bank in the state, is now receiving almost Rs 2 crore a day and is expected to get over Rs 30 crore in January alone, as against a mere Rs 40 crore received in the first 50 days after  .

 While bank officials claimed that this increased inflow of cash is a sign of “normalisation” in the rural banking sector, opposition parties in the state alleged that money is being pumped into rural branches with an eye on the polls to counter the negative impact of demonetisation. 
 
 In a January 3 circular, the   had instructed banks to ensure that at least 40% of the currency notes supplied should reach rural areas. Talking to TOI,  , regional manager of the Aligarh bank, admitted that after January 1 the inflow of money has more than doubled.
 
 Rajeev Gupta, regional manager of Hathras and Mathura district which has 55 branches, also confirmed that the inflow had doubled.   in-charge in Agra, Vipul Purohit, dubbed the move “political”.
