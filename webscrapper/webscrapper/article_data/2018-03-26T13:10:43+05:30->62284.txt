Bollywood actress   mesmerised us yet again as a showstopper for the ace designer Manish Malhotra. The designer showcased his Summer Couture 2018 show in Singapore. The collection featured glittering gowns, dresses with details of pearls, feathers and fringes. The highlight of the collection was the 3D applique embroidery of flowers in vibrant hues. 

 
 Kareena was seen wearing a glittering lehenga paired with a plunging neckline blouse. We also loved the sheer dupatta, which was worn over her shoulders like a cape. On the ramp, she was joined by Bollywood's latest sensation,  . He was seen wearing an indo-western outfit which was a black bandhgala paired with pants.

 The designer is known for his Bollywood showstoppers and the unusual pairs he gets together on the ramp. Just a few weeks ago, he did a show in Pune with four celebrity showstoppersâ€” Aditi Rao Hydari, Radhika Apte, Sophie Choudry and Nushrat Bharucha. This time around, he surprised us yet again with his muses.

 While Kartik looked every bit dapper in the indo-western outfit, we can't stop looking at Kareena and her gorgeous outfit. The ivory-toned outfit featured floral designs in metallic hues. For this look, she went for a sleek ponytail and her make-up was glowing with shimmery silver eyes and glossy lips. The outfit is a perfect combination of modern and classic Indian lehenga and it seems to be the perfect pick for a summer wedding.
