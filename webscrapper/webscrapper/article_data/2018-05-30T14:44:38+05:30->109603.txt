VADODARA: Enraged residents of Fajalpur village set around 10 sand excavating machines and trucks on fire near the village on Tuesday morning after a truck carrying sand mowed down a 22-year-old man.

 
 Deceased Bharat  , who worked as a contract worker at   Refinery, was going to work on Tuesday morning when the truck ran him over on a narrow road approaching the village. The accused truck driver fled from the spot along with the vehicle from the spot. 
 
 On learning about the death of Gohil, his parents and villagers gathered at the spot and refused to take the body. Later some villagers went at the mining site to ransack the sand excavating machines and trucks and set them on fire.
 
 The villagers were claiming that three sand mines are being operated there, but the lessee has been excavating sand even from the area outside the lease site. Police sources said that the family members and villagers were demanding a compensation of Rs 75 lakh and ordering closure of all sand leases near the village.
 
 Senior police officials too reached Fajalpur and asked the family members of Gohil to accept the body, yet for several hours the body remained at the accident spot with family members refusing to go back on their demands.
 
 “They were demanding that a proper investigation is done in the accident case and a compensation be given to them. We told them that we can give assurance of a proper investigation, but we can order compensation because that is not our work,” said deputy commissioner of police  .
 
 The family members agreed to accept the body after they were given assurance of a neutral probe by senior police officials. Gohil’s body was then sent to SSG Hospital for post-mortem and a case of rash driving and causing death due to negligence was registered at   police station.
 
 According to police sources, they were approached to register a case in connection with setting the vehicles on fire, but no FIR was registered till late on Tuesday night.
