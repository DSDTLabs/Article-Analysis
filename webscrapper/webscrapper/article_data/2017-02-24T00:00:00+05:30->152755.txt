The family of national level wrestler  , who died on February 15, 2017, after breaking his thigh bone during the State Olympics in  , is struggling to cope up with the loss.

 “We are facing a lot of problems after losing Santosh. Ever since his death, my mother is bedridden. All of us wanted to see him as an international wrestler, so for the last 15 years, we struggled to nurture him. I am a private vehicle driver, and used to spend half of my earnings for his wrestling and his nutritional needs. We are not educated, but ensured he went to school for the upliftment of our family, but God cheated us. The government has assured Rs 10 lakh, and we are waiting for the compensation. However, we did not receive any help from the government while he was struggling for treatment in the hospital,” said Santosh’s brother  .
 
  
  
 Santosh’s coach  , is still in a state of shock. He said, “This incident has created fear in others about entering the wrestling arena.”
 
  
  
 Santosh, a resident of Chikmalligawad of Dharwad, was to participate at national competition in   earlier this week.
