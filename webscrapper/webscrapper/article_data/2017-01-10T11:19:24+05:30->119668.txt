MEERUT: In a bid to link Muzaffarnagar with Lucknow,   (UPSRTC) launched a new air conditioned bus service between the two cities on Sunday. This has come nearly two years after the very first sleepers bus to Lucknow was flagged off from Meerut bus terminal.
 
  Though the fare for the bus will be 1.5 times more than an ordinary bus, it will provide a comfortable ride for the passengers.  , UPSRTC assistant regional manager,   said, “It is a 44-seater air-conditioned bus and the journey will be completed in 12 hours. Though, as of now, 12 hours has been fixed as the journey’s time; we are trying our level best to reduce the span of journey to 11 and a half hours.”
  
  The bus will take a stoppage at Meerut too apart from the five stops it has, thereby making it the first AC bus from Meerut for Lucknow too. The ticket for the bus is priced at Rs 779, which is 1.5 times higher than the fare of the ordinary bus to Lucknow.
  
  “The seats are designed in such a manner that one can sit comfortably with enough leg space,” said Agarwal. The bus is scheduled to start from Muzaffarnagar at 6:30pm every day and will reach Lucknow by 6:30am. After a stoppage of half an hour, the bus will depart from Lucknow at 7am.
  
  “Each passenger will get one   inside the bus so as to ensure a comfortable 12-hour journey,” said Agarwal.
