BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh   Commission ( ) has observed that jail inmates are not being given proper health care facilities in the state.

 The commission pointed that there have been several incidents where jail officials could not gauge the seriousness of the poor health of prisoners that have led to their deaths.
 
 The conclusions were drawn after the commission took cognizance of the death of a 70-year-old prisoner by the name of Ghasita in June last year. The elderly man was brought to Bhopal for the treatment of a liver ailment on June 7.
 
 But he could not be saved and died on June 13. MPHRC has stated that there are many such incidents in state and the prison department should ensure that proper health care facilities are given to all undertrials.
 
 In its recommendations to the prisons department on Tuesday, the commission stated there should be a provision of daily check-up of ill prisoners and a doctor should be deputed for the same.
 
 The commission pointed out that only one doctor can visit the jail just ten times a month in the present scenario and wants the frequency to be increased for the wellness of prisoners.
 
 It stated that if a prisoner is not recovering or getting ill frequently, the jail department must take a note of it and ensure appropriate healthcare to the inmate.
 
 The commission recommended that the prisons headquarters should have a list of prisoners suffering from serious physical or mental disorders.
 
 The commission on its part has made such recommendations and warned jail officials to take heath of prisoners seriously in the past, but it has not been followed and jail officials did not take up the issue seriously.
