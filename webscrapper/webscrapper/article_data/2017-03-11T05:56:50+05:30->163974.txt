PUNE: An important meeting of the Pune airport advisory committee on Saturday is expected to make new announcements in connection with the   facility.

 Pune MP  , the head of the committee, told TOI that the perennial issue of traffic mess on the road — located right in front of the terminal building — will also be taken up and a permanent solution will be sought.
 
 “The expansion of the Pune airport is on our agenda with the   (AAI) serious about the issue. The defence authorities have provided land to the airport. The meeting of the advisory committee on Saturday will spell out the steps needed to be taken to make the airport more passenger friendly,” the MP said.
 
 Last week, the AAI announced some measures under ‘Project DISHA’ at the Pune airport which is a defence facility.
 
 “I am aware of the road issue. We are open to suggestions from the people on anything from introducing some charges for vehicles which were recently abolished,” the MP pointed out.
 
 R K Prajapati, a businessman and a frequent flier, said the widening of the road was the only option.
 
 “They (AAI) need to widen the road and bring out a lane parking system in the area. There is a lot of space towards the side where the airline counters are located and the road can easily be widened. The police need to look into the matter and ensure that vehicles are parked in the right way,” Prajapati said.
 
 New flights
 
 The airport was expected to have new flights to both domestic and international destinations.
 
 “The Pune airport operates 143 flights. However, the international flights are less with connectivity only with Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Frankfurt. With the new terminal building coming up, one can expect to see an increase in the number of flights. More than 15 new flights are presently on the wait list for proper slots,” an AAI official said.
