Panaji: District and sessions court on Friday granted conditional bail to businessman Imran Khan, who was arrested on Tuesday evening by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) in connection with the mining scam. Police had claimed that the accused was close to politicians.

 Irshad Agha, principal district and sessions judge, North Goa, allowed Khan’s bail plea moved through senior counsel Nitin Sardesai. 
 
 Bail conditions include that the applicant should appear before the investigation officer for the next 30 days between 10am and 5pm except Sundays. He should not leave the state and submit his passport to the investigation officer.
 
 The session judge also stated in his order that Khan “should not threaten other witnesses”. The prosecution had opposed the bail plea trying to make a strong case that the applicant had extracted ore from a mine in Sanguem, valued in crores of rupees, whose lease was held by Mario Figuereido.
 
 Public prosecutor G D Kirtani had argued that SIT wanted to interrogate Khan to unearth the deep rooted conspiracy and corruption angle into the case. Prosecution claimed Khan had illegally extracted and traded in ore valued at Rs 200 crore. While opposing the bail plea, the prosecution had also alleged that applicant had bribed government officials.
 
 Defense counsel countered the charges stating the prosecution had not placed on record any material evidence to prove their case. “In fact, prosecution had no case at all to arrest the applicant and demand police custody, four years after the case was registered” Sardesai argued.
