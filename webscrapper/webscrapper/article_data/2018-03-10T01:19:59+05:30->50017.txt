NEW DELHI:   allegedly committed suicide in the capital in the last 24 hours. 

 In the first incident, an   was found dead in a drain at Vinay Marg. He had a gunshot wound on the head. A passerby spotted the policeman lying face down and alerted the control room. 
 
 A team from Tughlaq Road police station went to the spot and identified the deceased as ASI P P Anirudh. His service pistol and a bag were found lying beside the body while his motorcycle was parked nearby. 
 
 Anirudh’s family members, who live at the Mehram Nagar police colony, said he didn’t return home on Thursday. He was from Kerala and had joined Delhi Police in 1986 as a constable. No suicide note was found, so the police were trying to find out why he took the extreme step. 
 
 But police suspect Anirudh chose a spot near Lutyens’ Delhi to make a statement. “We have initiated an inquest into the incident and have sent the body for autopsy. His friends and family are being asked about his professional and personal lives,” said DCP (New Delhi) Madhur Verma. 
 
 Anirudh is survived by a 12-year-old son. 
 
 The second incident occurred at   where an ASI posted with PCR shot himself after parking his patrol car. ASI Hanuman Sahay drove a damaged patrol car to a police workshop at Old Police Lines. He parked the vehicle at a garage, stepped out, and shot himself with his service pistol. 
 
 People nearby immediately alerted other policemen who rushed Sahay to the Civil Lines trauma centre where he died during treatment. He was from Burari and had been posted with PCR for the past five years.
