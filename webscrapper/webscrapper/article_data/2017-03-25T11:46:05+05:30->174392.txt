CHENNAI: Ahead of the April 12 byelection to the R K Nagar assembly constituency, the Election Commission of India on Saturday ordered the transfer of Chennai city police commissioner  . 

 Karan Singha, a 1987-batch IPS officer, is the new city police commissioner. 
 
 The ECI has taken the decision based on a memorandum submitted by   working president and leader of the opposition in Tamil Nadu assembly M K Stalin.
 
 Singha was holding the post of the CB-CID chief. He has also served as the Chennai city suburban police commissioner. Singha was the state intelligence chief for a brief period during the assembly election held in May 2016.
 
 During the last assembly elections too, the Election Commission had transferred George from the post of the Chennai city police commissioner. He was then replaced by Ashuthosh Shukla. After the election, the   government appointed him again as the Chennai city police commissioner.
