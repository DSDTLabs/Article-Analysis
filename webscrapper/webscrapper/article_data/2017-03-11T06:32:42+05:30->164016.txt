AHMEDABAD: City crime branch has obtained a transfer warrant for the custody of   (IM) operative  , alias Haddi, in the 2008   case. The blasts had killed more than 50 and left over 200 injured in the city.

  Haddi has already been sentenced to death, along with IM mastermind   and three others, in the February 2013 Dilsukhnagar blasts case. Haddi is accused of hatching a conspiracy to trigger the serial blasts in Ahmedabad.
 
 “The transfer warrant obtained from the local court will be produced in Delhi court,” a crime branch official said. “Haddi is currently lodged in Tihar Jail in a blast case being investigated by the NIA.” 
 
 The official further said that the crime branch will also obtain transfer warrants for Yasin Bhatkal to arrest him on the charges of conspiracy in the Ahmedabad serial blasts case.
 
 It may be recalled that Haddi and Yasin Bhatkal were nabbed from Indo-Nepal border in Bihar. “They along with two others, Tehsin Akhtar and Pakistani national Zia-ur-Reham alias Monu, were accused of triggering the Dilsukhnagar twin blasts in February 2013. The blasts had killed 18 and left 119 injured,” the crime branch official said. The four were sentenced to death by special NIA court at Cherlapally central prison in Hyderabad in December 2016. “While Haddi belongs to UP, Bhatkal is a native of Karnataka. Bhatkal is believed to be the kinpin along with Riyaz and Iqbal Bhatkal who are believed to be in Pakistan,” the police official said.
