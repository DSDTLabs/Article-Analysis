 Municipal chairperson   said the subject was taken for discussion as there are allegations that the multiplex was constructed on encroached land flouting building rules.
 
 Incidentally, the opposition had boycotted the meeting before the issue was taken up for discussion over another issue about giving an appeal in a case regarding the taking over of land for building stadium. The ruling LDF councilors alleged that the multiplex had given contributions towards the construction of the Town Hall and the then ruling party gave them undue favours in return. 
 
 However, the opposition, in a parliamentary party meeting of the Congress held following the council meeting, welcomed the decision to recommend vigilance probe into the issue. Opposition Leader V O Pailappan said that the transfer of registry was done for the land in 2006, when LDF was in power in the state and K P Rajendran was revenue minister.
