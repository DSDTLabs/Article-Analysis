 Commenting on Pratap and Harish's journey, Harish says " Our journey has been very rewarding and exciting. We have learnt a lot in the past 10 years. We both come from the opposite sides of India. Pratap is from South India and I am from North India. Fate, Destiny, Luck whatever you may call it..but something has called us together to Mumbai, where we met and we are thankful to that energy. We worked very hard , hence we have done some really good projects in the past. Now we are working on something which is very close to our hearts and we are very sure that everyone will be witnessing and experiencing a new side of ours. We have the best team working with us in every project which outruns all our healthy competitors. We are quite delighted to have a strong connection with our clients who believe in us completely. We are 10 years old today and very excited for many more to come"

 Asking Pratap on the challenges faced by him, he said "My sister pushed me to learn Indian classical dance. I never knew my potential until my guru's and family members saw me dancing. Their appreciation towards my dancing skills increased my liking towards dancing so much that very soon I was walking,eating & breathing dance. I loved dancing so much that I decided to pursue it as my career, and after so many years I can proudly say that I was born to dance."
 
 
 Harish added, " I always had an inclination towards performance's. I am a trained gymnast, Ariel, stunts and various western dance forms artist, the love for music was second to none. I always wanted to create something new of my own and express it to the world. But I couldn't find a way to express myself, and then I got exposed to the world of entertainment that made me realise all the right things I could do. It was all about dancing. We have faced fierce competition from our seniors and fellow choreographers. We had to prove ourselves everyday until our name was etched in everyone's mind. Just like every other person from the Entertainment Industry, we too felt the heat when there were less projects against the number of stomachs to be fed. But we have been blessed and are lucky. We always had a Plan B & because of that today we have entered all streams within our industry"
