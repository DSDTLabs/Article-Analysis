Indore: A 41-year-old man died in police custody under Lasudia police station on Tuesday morning. The deceased Karnaal Singh, son of Gyan Singh, a resident of Niranjanpur, was wanted in two cases of family dispute. A suicide note was also recovered from his possession. 

 Police said that he had consumed poison before he was taken into custody on Tuesday morning. Police were planning to produce him before a court when he complained of stomach ache and dizziness. He was rushed to a hospital, where he died during treatment. 
 
 The deceased Karnaal Singh was arrested in connection with two charges of domestic violence. Police had raided his house in the morning and arrested him, after initial probe substantiated the charges. 
 
 Singh was taken to the police station and kept in a lockup. While formalities were being completed to take him to the court, he complained of stomach ache and dizziness. 
 
 “He was immediately taken to a nearby hospital where he died during treatment at around 8.15am,” said Lasudia police station in-charge Rajendra Soni. He said that he had consumed something before he was taken into custody by police. 
 
 “The man was upset with family of his in-laws. We also recovered a suicide note from the deceased in which he had claimed to have taken the dire step owing to frustration. He also wrote in the suicide note that his family should not be blamed for his action,” added Soni. 
 
 His body was later sent for postmortem exam and police were further investigating the matter. This is not the first time when an accused had died in police custody. Earlier, a 20-year-old had ended life in police custody. He was found dead on the floor in the women barrack with a stripped bedsheet stuck around his neck and attached to iron rod protruding from a wall. Allegedly, the murder case for which he was detained was registered hours after he was found dead.
