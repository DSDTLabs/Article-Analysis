The art enthusiasts in the capital city were treated with a theatre performance titled Nirvanam Vasavadetham recently at the Vyloppilli Samskrithi Bhavan. The two-hour-long act was an independent representation of Mahakavi Kumaran Asan’s legendary work, Karuna. The play, penned and directed by PAM Rasheed was a production by Trivandrum-based Theatre of Good Hopes that traverses through the thought process of a writer who wishes to script a play to eliminate the dominance of Tamil folk dramas which prevailed two decades ago. Gireesh   portrayed a writer in the play, who sits in meditative stillness, embracing his thoughts, while the Buddhist monk   and the beautiful courtesan,   was brought alive by actors   and Malu S Lal respectively. Malu says, “The production had its premiere show where we showcased the story of the mistress who lived in old Madhura, adding elements of entertainment. It was an artistic expression of our director so we enacted the story through a variety of theatre tools including dance performances. Being a dancer I was able to give life to Vasavadatta to the fullest. The character was a mix of dance and abhinaya to me.” The audience assembled at Vyloppilli Samskrithi Bhavan were spellbound as Vasavadatta showcased splendid dance acts of four different genres apart from her dialogues in chaste Malayalam. The play also communicated the issue of the caste system in society. 
The play, with around 15 actors enthralled the spectators while staying true to their respective characters. It was lauded with loud cheers by the art aficionados in the city. Other supporting actors include Ayyappan, Sreena Sreekumar, Shyama, Anjana B S, Karamana Raghunath, Venkatesh, Jayan Thozhuvankode, Madhu, Anil and more.
