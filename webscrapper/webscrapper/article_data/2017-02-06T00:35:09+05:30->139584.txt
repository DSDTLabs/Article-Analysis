NEW DELHI: A man was arrested from   for posing as a lawyer. Police said he had been practising there for the past seven years.

 “A case of cheating was registered at Dwarka (south) police station after a client of the accused, Ajitkar, gave a complaint that he had taken Rs 50,000 on the assurance that he would get a case settled,” said DCP (southwest) Surender Kumar.
 
 The complainant told the police that he wanted to change the lawyer representing his cousin in a case at Dwarka court. When he noticed Ajitkar contesting a case, it attracted his attention. He was further impressed when the accused told him that he was an expert in criminal law and would represent them.
 
 “He took Rs 50,000 from me in cash and said he would charge another Rs 50,000 after the case was settled,” said the complainant.
 
 However, when he reached the court on Saturday, he saw Ajitkar surrounded by many lawyers, including bar council members. They claimed that he was not a lawyer and was merely posing as one to dupe innocent victims.
 
 When Ajitkar was taken to the police station and told to submit documents to prove that he was indeed a lawyer, he failed to do so.
 
 Sources said that the cases fought by Ajitkar without the legal qualification may be in dozens. It is also a matter of concern as to how the court staff failed to carry out proper scrutiny.
