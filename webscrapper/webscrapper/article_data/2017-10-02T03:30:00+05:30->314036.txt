Panaji: Retired justice R M S Khandeparkar recenlty praised late advocate Amrut Kansar for being “a politician who entered politics to perform selfless social work for the less privileged sections of the society instead of earning money for himself”.

A Konkani mogi (lover) despite being in the pro-Marathi MGP, Kansar was also remembered for being an educationist and social activist who fought for the rights of the dalits.
