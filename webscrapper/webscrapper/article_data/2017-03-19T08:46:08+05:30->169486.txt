Mangaluru: Alumni of a Bengaluru-based medical college have reunited for a good cause to fund cardiac procedures of children in Mangaluru. 

 In a heart warming gesture, the students of 1987 batch of  , Bengaluru, sponsored the funding of corrective cardiac procedures for two economically backward children in A J Hospital and Research Centre here.
 
 Alumni Dr  , also an interventional cardiologist at A J Hospital, said “It was a unanimous decision by our batchmates to use funds for a charitable cause to make our reunion which happened at Bengaluru on January, more meaningful and memorable.”
 
 Of the 150 members, 60 attended the alumni meet. “Our reunion was possible through a WhatsApp group. We discussed about the possible reunion through the group, which was formed a year ago. Accordingly, the first reunion was held in Bengaluru to commemorate the 30th anniversary and a decision was also taken then to extend support for a good cause,” he said.
 
 Funds were used towards procedures to correct congenital heart defects in two in Mangaluru. “A 16-year-old boy underwent surgical closure of ventricular septal defect and infundibular resection to relieve pulmonary stenosis. The other patient was a two-year-old girl, who had a non-surgical closure of a patent ductus arteriosus with a device. I along with Drs Gaurav Shetty, Gururaj Tantri and Dr Prem Alva performed these procedures,” he said.
 
 “The hospital gave us big discounts for the surgeries, which are very expensive. The first surgery would have cost about Rs 1.50 lakh – Rs 1.70 lakh in general ward, but the hospital charged only Rs 90,000. Meanwhile, another surgery cost us about Rs 80,000,” he added. Thanking medical director of A J Hospital and Research Centre Dr Prashanth Marla, Dr Purushotham said, “We have plans to keep doing such service in future too.”
