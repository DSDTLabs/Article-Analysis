KANNUR: Minister for Health KK Shailaja has said disposal of   is a major problem in  . The plant of the   (IMA) at Palakkad, to treat the biomedical waste produced in the hospitals in the State, is not sufficient, and hence we need similar plants in at least two-three regions, she said while inaugurating a workshop on the subject organised by   under the joint aegis of various central agencies here on Saturday.

 
 When that plant was under repair for a few days, the problem that the State faced was very serious, pointed out the minister.
 
 When there was a proposal to handover land at Palode in Thiruvananthapuram to build another plant by the IMA, and discussions were held in this connection, the local residents opposed, she said.
 
 Though waste disposal at source is the best way, wastes like biomedical waste have to be treated separately, for which plant is needed, said the minister.
 
 She also said civic sense has to be created among the people with regards to waste disposal. Instilling the civic sense with regards to waste management is as important as treating the solid waste scientifically, she asserted.
 
 The workshop organised under the joint aegis of various central agencies, is being held in 70 towns in the country and Kannur is the only town selected from Kerala.
