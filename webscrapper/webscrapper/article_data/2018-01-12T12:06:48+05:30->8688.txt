Having featured in over half a dozen films and being considered one of the most sought on-screen pair,   said working alongside   is always a pleasure as the superstar makes the experience easier. 

 Kajol and Shah Rukh shot for a special sequence for Aanand L Rai's next, 'Zero'. 
 
  
  
 While   and   will be seen in lead roles alongside Shah Rukh, Kajol and   shot for a special sequence. Rani had called the experience as 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai part two'. 
 
 Kajol, who last worked with Shah Rukh on  , praised the actor for his dedication to cinema. 
 
 We actually shot for half-an-hour but it was great. It's always fabulous to work with him. He is a really amazing man to work with because he is 300 per cent involved in whatever he is doing. 
 
 "It's great fun because he is such a fine actor that it comes very naturally to work with him and alongside him," said Kajol in an interview.
 
 The actor may have been around for close to three decades in the industry but said her dedication to give it all for work hasn't reduced. 
 
 "I've come from a time when we used to work from 7 in the morning till 9 in the night on a daily basis without the comforts of sitting in an AC room. Somewhere down the line, you realise that work is God. You have to take it seriously everyday, it's the most important thing," she said.
 
 Much of the discipline, Kajol said, comes from her mother who taught her early in childhood that no work is lesser or bigger. 
 
 As a kid my mother made me sweep the house and clean the bathroom. She said if at any point you don't have servants in your house, you should be able to look after the house. I did it. 
 
 "Somewhere it gives you amazing work ethics. Nobody's job is less, one should respect all. I've even made my kids broom the house so that they learn not to litter," she said.
