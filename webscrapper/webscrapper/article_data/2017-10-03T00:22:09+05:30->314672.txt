Bhopal: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan paid tributes to Mahatma Gandhi on his 148th birth anniversary by fulfilling two major promises. First, by declaring Hoshangabad district as open defecation free (ODF) and second by declaring that his government would make stringent laws against illicit liquor which could even be a death penalty.

 “Bapu used to say that cleanliness is next to godliness. Good health is possible only in good and clean environment. Today, our Prime Minister's dream has come true and we are declaring Hoshangabad district as ODF,” said Chouhan while addressing the public in Hoshangabad, on Monday.
 
 With the announcement, 424 district panchayats and 7 blocks of the district have become ODF. Chouhan said the government would provide Rs 155 crore for building sewage treatment plants in the district. He said Shajapur district has also been declared ODF and more than 300 municipal bodies have been declared ODF so far.
 
 Later, addressing a programme on deaddiction, the chief minister also announced that government would discourage alcohol abuse and take stringent action against illicit hooch. He said, apart from existing laws, the state government will recommend strict punishment which could be a death penalty, for selling illicit liquor.
 
 “The government has launched an awareness campaign against addiction and alcoholism. We will take strict measures to check hooch trade and make stringent laws to curb it. We will recommend stringent punishment including death penalty, against those involved in it,” he said.
 
 He said government has banned liquor sale along the banks of Narmada and decided to decrease the number of liquor shops in both rural and urban areas. The government has also banned sale of liquor near schools, hospitals and religious places, he reiterated.
