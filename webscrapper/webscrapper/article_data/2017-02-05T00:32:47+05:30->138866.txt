 The partially burnt body of Rajesh Kumar was found in a garbage dump near   on Monday night. During investigation, police found a tag on his trouser, which led them to a tailor in New Ashok Nagar in east Delhi.
 
 Kumar’s mobile number was traced from the tailoring shop. While verifying the location of the mobile phone, police found that it was registered under the name of another person and activated using a fake ID.
 
 “During technical analysis it was found that the victim had received a missed call from an unknown number hours before his body was found,” said Ajit Singla, DCP north-east.
 
 Officers traced the number from which the call was made and detained the phone owner, Sudhir. During interrogation, Sudhir confessed to the crime and also told police about his associate Rahul, who was arrested from the area.
 
 Sudhir, who had worked with Rajesh earlier, got involved in a relationship with Kumar’s wife. On Sunday evening, Sudhir, along with Rahul, called Kumar outside his house. When Kumar confronted Sudhir about the affair, Sudhir killed him with a knife and then burnt the body, with the help of Rahul.
