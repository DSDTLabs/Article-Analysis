AURANGABAD: While the rest of the city is struggling to follow the action plan for waste management,   in   N-5 ward, in its second phase of   production, gave 10 tonne compost to Paithan farmers on Saturday. 

 The farmers who grew   using the compost given earlier have begun to sell their produce through mobile shops in the ward.
 
 The households and commercial units in Gulmohar Colony started practising segregation of waste at source two-and-a-half years ago under the citywide ‘Majhi City Taka Tak’ campaign. The ward, led by corporator  , processed the wet organic waste at compost pits in an open space in the ward. Several tonnes of naturally produced compost have been given to farmers in the outskirts of the city for free.
 
 “Auround 150 such farmers sent their organic produce to be sold through mobile shops,” corporator Dandge said. These shops were inaugurated on Saturday by MLA Atul Save, BJP group leader Pramod Rathod and other leaders. 
 
 Dandge said that in the coming days, the ward will produce 80 tonnes of organic compost to farmers. An additional 150 farmers will send their organic vegetables and fruits to be sold in the city, he said. “There is a huge demand for these vegetables as they are hard to get in the city these days. We have already received 20 queries from other areas in the city like Gulmandi, asking when the mobile shop will visit their area,” the corporator added. 
 
 So far, the compost was given to farmers for free. However, it has been decided that in future the compost will be sold at Rs 10-20 per kg and the money will be used for the healthcare of the sanitary staff. 
 
 Incidentally, the urban development department of Maharashtra has launched the brand Harit Maha Compost to encourage housing societies to compost their own waste.
