NEW DELHI: Questioning the practice of separate training for commandos from   and  , the   ( ) director general SP Singh has ordered scrapping of the practice of holding separate   for trainee commandos to raise a more lethal and “composite” squad of elite soldiers.

 The commando force, also called ‘Black Cats’, will now see trainee commandos from Army and central paramilitary forces sweating and dining together during the gruelling training sessions. 
 
 Till now, the officers and subordinates from the two forces used to have separate three-month induction courses upon joining, with even their lodging arrangements and meals taken separate from each other.
 
 After the Army or the   (CAPFs) depute some of their best personnel to the NSG, they have to undergo a specially drafted and strenuous commando conversion course at its garrison in   before they are awarded the iconic commando badge to serve in the special force under the command of home ministry.
 
 “If they (commandos) can work together, they can be trained together as well. Indeed that would be a step in the right direction,” Singh reasoned in a communication sent to all his strike formations (hubs) and force commanders.
 
 These directions are meant to be “inculcated and implemented with immediate effect” as NSG’s charter requires its units to be on alert 24x7.
 
 It is foreseen, officials in NSG added, that in a situation where the NSG strike teams are required to respond at multiple places at one time during a terror attack, it will be essential to have a larger contingent of such strike and reserve commandos, and hence it was necessary to prepare the men with same set of capabilities.
