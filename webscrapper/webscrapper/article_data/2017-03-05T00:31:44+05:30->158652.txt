 Police sources said that Manikandan was irked over Nandhini, a dalit, insisting to marry her after she got pregnant with him.
 
 Nandhini stepped out of her house as it was difficult to hide her pregnancy from her parents. Manikandan, the prime accused in the case, who could not deny her over a certain period and could not marry her over caste issues, killed her with three of his accomplices.
