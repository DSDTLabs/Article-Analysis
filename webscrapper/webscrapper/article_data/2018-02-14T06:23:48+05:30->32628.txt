CHENNAI: In the continuing crackdown on money laundering and benami holding of assets, Income Tax department has attached the 4.3acre Firhaven Estate in the upmarket  , purchased by little known   from serial investor C Sivasankaran for Rs380 crore in 2015, sources said.

 The I-T department had earlier frozen a bank account of   Enterprises with Rs70 crore balance. Aadhi Enterprises is promoted by city-based Sunil   and Maneesh Parmar. The duo came under the I-T scanner after the Firhaven Estate acquisition which happened at a time when the Chennai real estate sector was under stress.
 
 
 Recently, I-T sleuths also searched the premises of   in which Khetpalia, as director, has invested Rs30 crore. One of the directors of Edison is a close associate of a prominent   leader.
 
 Aadhi was incorporated only a year before it acquired Sivasankaran’s property. But without any significant business track record, it managed to raise Rs250 crore FDI from Pacatolous Investments Ltd, a Mauritius firm, after obtaining RBI nod. The investment helped Aadhi acquire the expansive Chennai estate.
