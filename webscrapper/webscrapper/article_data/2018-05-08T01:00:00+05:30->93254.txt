It’s his getaway spot to reconnect with nature and spend a few moments away from the busy city life. The actor reveals, “As a kid, I always wanted a tree house. My friend has a place on the outskirts of Mumbai and I decided to realise my dream over there. I’ve started building this tree house a few weeks ago and I think it’ll be ready in the next 10 days.”

 He calls it an ode to Rudyard Kipling’s ' '. Says Harshvardhan, “I’ve always been fascinated with the sight of Bagheera (a character from the book) perched on top of a high branch and just gazing into the wilderness. With this machaan, I’ll be able to see how that feels in real life. This is my way to reboot and rejuvenate.”
