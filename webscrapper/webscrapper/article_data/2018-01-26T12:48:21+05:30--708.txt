 DEHRADUN:  , an advocate based in Tehri, has to frequently visit Dehradun for official purposes. The trip usually takes him five hours and a good share of his day is spent travelling. The aviation ministry’s move to provide regional connectivity at affordable rates under UDAN (ude desh ka aam nagrik) scheme is being hailed by people like Jain.
  
  Under the second round of the   government’s ambitious UDAN scheme, 325 new routes have been awarded across the country. Of these,   has got the maximum number of helicopter services, with fares capped at Rs 2,500 for a 30-minute journey.
  
  Talking to TOI, Jain said, “A chopper ride from Tehri to Dehradun is for Rs 2,480. This will save a lot of time and prove crucial, especially in cases of medical emergency.” He added that the initiative would vastly benefit locals as it reduces the travel time and save them from the hardship of driving long hours in hilly terrain.
  
  For instance, one-way air fare from   to Hindon would be Rs 1,570 per passenger while the same would be Rs 2,480 from Dehradun to Mussoorie. Similarly, air fare from Pithoragarh to Dehradun would be Rs 2,150 per passenger under the scheme and so on.
  
  Dehradun resident Alok Negi, who runs a school, has to commute between various cities often. Hailing the scheme, he said, “Road travel for long hours is a big challenge for me as my wife suffers from nausea. Now, we can easily reach the desired destinations. It’s a praiseworthy move and I hope it yields the best results.”
