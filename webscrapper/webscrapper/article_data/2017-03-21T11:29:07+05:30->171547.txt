Everyone comes to rescue Tina. Tina looks at Shraddha and Sankara and lies to everybody that she was playing hide and seek.
 
  Later, Thapki and Bihaan ask her why did she lie. She tells them she was scared. Thapki, Bani, Tina and Bihaan plot a plan for Sankara.
  
  Sankara is getting ready for marriage when Tina and Bani come there and laugh at her funny make up. She holds Tina tight and threatens her. Bihaan sees this. He tells Sankara that even he will give her the same kind of love.
  
  At the mandap, Bihaan starts acting crazy. Everyone thinks he has got some fit and they shouldn't marry right now but Bihaan insists.
  
  When Sankara gets scared, Bihaan lights up fire and tells her that they both should die together. Out of fear, Sankara tells the truth about giving wrong medicines to Bihaan so that he loses his memory and forget about Thapki. Everyone stands there shocked.
  
  Police arrives and records Sankara's statement. She gets arrested.
