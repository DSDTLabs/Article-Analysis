Margao:   villagers in Salcete taluka expressed their apprehensions about illegal hill cutting, conversion of forest lands and mega housing projects during the gram sabha held on Sunday.

 The gram sabha commenced at 10.30 am and the proposed administrative report was approved by the members. “The annual plan, comprising the village development plan and the gram panchayat development plan, was submitted during the meeting for the approval of sabha members,” Camurlim sarpanch Basilio Fernandes said. 
 
 “It was clarified to the villagers that the panchayat was not the authority issuing permissions for hill cutting, but the town and country planning (TCP) department. Hence, the panchayat can only write to the department inquiring if this is being done with appropriate approvals. The villagers were also informed that the TCP department and South Goa collector were granting approvals for conversion of forest lands and the panchayat was only receiving files that were approved by other government authorities. The law needs to be changed wherein the panchayat will have a say in these issues,” said Fernandes. 
 
 “The panchayat has no legal powers to say no to the mega housing projects that have obtained required permission and can only write to the authorities about the villagers’ objections,” the sarpanch added.
