MUMBAI: The state’s debt by the end of 2015-16 stood at Rs 3.51 lakh crore, up from Rs 3.19 lakh crore in 2014-15. While this is within fiscal limits, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report on the state’s finances 2015-16 has expressed concern about the ballooning funds used for debt servicing (the act of regularly repaying loans, including interest) over a longer term of 5 years.

 In 2015, the annual expense for servicing debt in   was Rs 31,313 crore, a slight reduction from Rs 34,679 crore the previous year. However, the average annual expenditure on debt servicing during 2011-16 was Rs 27,741 crore. “This accounted for 93.6% of average public debt receipts during the same period, implying that a larger percentage of debt was being used for debt servicing,” said the CAG report which was tabled on Friday. It also indicates that “a very insignificant portion of the debt was available for meeting developmental expenditure to promote growth,” the report said. The report also says that nearly 51.5% of the state’s debt is repayable in the next seven years. “The liability of the   to repay debt would be Rs 37,761.42 crore during 2019-21 and 49,261.42 crore during 2021-23 which would put a strain on the government budget during that period,” the report said. 
 
 The state’s interest payments increased by 47% over a five-year period from Rs 17,505 crore in 2011-12 to 25,771 crore in 2015-16, the CAG report said.
 
 Overall, the state had managed to reduce its revenue deficit dramatically over the previous year. The deficit fell from Rs 12,138 crore to Rs 5,338 crore because revenue receipts grew at 12%, way ahead of revenue expenditure which grew at 7%.
 
 However, the CAG report pointed out that the state’s fiscal liabilities at Rs 3.51 lakh crores were nearly twice the revenue receipts and more than twice the state’s own resources at the end of 2015-16. However, the ratio of debt to GSDP at 17.8% was lower than the limit of 21.9% set by the 14th  .
