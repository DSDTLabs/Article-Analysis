JAMSHEDPUR: City-based  , Jeevan, has issued guidelines to schools and parents to avoid undue pressure on their wards who will appear for the   and ICSE examinations next month.

 Keeping in mind the numerous cases of suicide by students in the   over the past few years, Jeevan has put up hoardings, distributed posters and pamphlets listing dos and don’ts for teachers and parents. 
 
 “The guidelines aim to convince teachers that increasing pressure on students to perform well at any cost will only increase unwarranted pressure on children. In 2010, the percentage of child suicides was at an alarming high level of 21.4%. However, it came down to 6.8% in 2015 but went up to 10% in 2016,” said Mahavir Ram, a senior officer of Jeevan. 
 
 The official informed that teachers have been urged not to put pressure on students with average academic capabilities to compete with high-scoring students in the exams. School administrators have also been requested not to ask children to adopt do-or-die mindset for the exams. 
 
 “Through our guidelines we are trying to influence the schools to promote group studies among students and conduct extra classes for those who have missed any important lessons,” said J R Jain, an official of Jeevan. 
 
 He also said the guidelines advice parents to keep the atmosphere at home easy and comfortable and guide them to prepare for the exams in a methodical manner. “Scolding children in front of their peers before the exams will do them no good,” said Jain.
