NEW DELHI: Will   skipper   have a rethink on his   career? Last year, Zaheer had apparently expressed desire to play for a year, so technically Sunday's match against   could be the last IPL game of his career.

 However, the way Zaheer bowled against the Rising Pune Supergiant on Friday night, he still looks good to play another season. In a format in which bowlers are facing huge challenges, with some of them even facing mental meltdowns after being mauled mercilessly by the batsmen, Zaheer has created a niche for himself.
 
 The fact that a 39-year old cricketer can still bowl seven dot balls and produce a perfect length delivery to dismiss a batsman of Ajinkya Rahane's caliber, and then follow it up with a 136kmhr delivery which surprised an emerging cricketer like Rahul Tripathi, speaks volumes of Zaheer's ability.
 
 Simply put, Zaheer surely has some steam left inside him. The best part is he is enjoying his captaincy on the field and perhaps won't mind if the Delhi team management tells him to continue for one more year.
 
 Having said that, market forces weigh heavy on team decisions and if the team isn't winning, nothing comes with a guarantee. Take the case of the Bangalore IPL outfit. They were the runners-up last year and will now finish with the wooden spoon Â­ whether they win or lose Sunday's match.
 
 Unlike Delhi, this team has failed collectively; a star performer over the years like Chris Gayle has flopped miserably while their captain   couldn't create the same impact with the bat like in earlier seasons.
 
 So, Bangalore vs Delhi is an insignificant game, a clash that will allow the spectators to view their favourite stars in action. Kohli fans will get a chance to cheer him in anticipation that he would come back to form and start doing well once again for India.
