Manoj Bajpayee, who was last seen with   in  , will share screen space with   in his next, Baaghi 2. While he appreciates the younger actors for their dedication towards their craft, he also believes they should know how to chill and unwind after a long day. 

 He told us, “Be it Sidharth, Raj (Rajkummar (Rao) or Tiger, they are very competitive. I’ve never been so competitive. We took our job seriously as well, but we knew how to chill. These guys are competing with themselves 24/7! Going to the gym, working out and things like that. Take Raj for instance; he doesn’t drink, is a vegetarian and a fitness fanatic. I can’t compete with these guys (laughs).” 
 
 Speaking of Sidharth, he adds, “It’s a task to coax Sidharth into sitting with you in the evening, over a glass of wine. It was difficult for us to get him to relax. You can ask Raj as well. I am always after his life to at least have a glass of red wine with me. These guys don’t drink! They are extremely disciplined and I can’t take it.” The actor concluded, “On a serious note, they inspire me and if you want to grow, you need to adapt and look at the younger generation’s work. They are changing the definition of performance. You have to redefine yourself, be awake and alert.”
