Panaji: Students have been displaced and are being put to inconvenience with Bal Bhavan being selected for counting in the state assembly elections, sources said.  Over 220 students of the pre-primary and primary section have had to temporarily relocate from Campal, almost 2kms away in the Entertainment Society of Goa complex for more than a month.  Their classrooms have been converted into strongrooms to store the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) from 19 constituencies in North Goa. School teachers have had to take relevant books, files and material, with no option of going back to the venue that is heavily guarded 24X7 with three tier security.  At the ESG complex, they have been provided six rooms and one large hall that has been partitioned into two makeshift classrooms. The classes of around 100 students who take harmonium, tabla, guitar, drawing, craft, computer, creative writing and dance lessons at Bal Bhavan in the evenings have also been shifted to the ESG complex.  “We have adjusted to the facilities and are continuing all our activities, but not in full swing,” programme officer Shashikant Punaji said. This is the second time that Bal Bhavan has been used to store EVMs and for counting. The first instance was during the 2014 Lok Sabha election. Election officials said Bal Bhavan was selected because it is spacious enough to accommodate 10 counting halls. In the past, counting for North Goa would take place at multiple locations including Pharmacy College and Home Science College.
