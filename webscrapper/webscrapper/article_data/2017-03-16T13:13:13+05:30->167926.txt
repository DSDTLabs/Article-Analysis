 A practicing lawyer, Ganesh, 42, is the party's   "He is people's choice," said DMK MLA and the party's district secretary of Chennai North S Sudharsanam. The party felt that it had a better chance of winning the constituency if it fielded a son-of-the-soil "known to every voter", he said. "Ganesh is simple man and easily accessible to everyone," said Sudharsanam. The R K Nagar seat has eluded DMK since the 2001 assembly election.
 
 "It was a surprise for me. In the morning, I got a call from the party headquarters asking me to come immediately. Even then I did not realise I will be the candidate," Ganesh told TOI. "I was one of the 17 aspirants for R K Nagar and I was interviewed by the party working president  , said Ganesh. His mother Parvathi Narayanasamy was a corporation councillor representing the party from 1996-2001. "I have been a member of the party for the past 17 years and have been working in the constituency," said Ganesh. 
 
 On his prospects, pitted as he is against AIADMK's Dinakaran, Ganesh said he had a better chance of winning as he was known in the constituency. "I am a resident in the constituency and not like other candidates who come from other parts of Chennai. I know the problems of people and they also know me well. I will win with the help of party leaders who will also campaign for me," said Ganesh.
