JAIPUR: An   a newborn girl child in a village near Chomu, almost 40 kms from here was thwarted by some onlookers who informed the police on Sunday evening. The girl is critical and has been kept on ventilator support at   in the city. 

 According to the police, two to three unidentified persons came in a jeep and were digging a pit at an isolated place near Chomu town. When they brought an infant and attempted to bury her alive, some people heard the baby crying. Initially, the villagers the baby's cry was some supernatural power, but finally mustering courage they went closer to the spot and started shouting.
 
 "Unidentified people left the infant and managed to flee from the scene. As soon as we were informed our team took the baby and got her admitted to the JK Lon Hospital," said a senior police officer on Monday.
 
 Police, quoting the hospital records, stated that the condition of the girl was stable when admitted. However, in the evening Dr  , superintendent of JK Lon Hosptial, said, "She is very critical for the next 72 hours. She was diagnosed with breathing difficulty when she was admitted to the hospital. Her weight is merely 1.4 kg, that is another concern. And, she is also under shock and hypothermia. We have put her on ventilator support to maintain her blood pressure."
 
 A senior police officer on the investigation so far, said, "Prima facie it appears to be an attempt either by the parents not intending to have a girl child or the family of some single mother. We are looking into the birth records of last three days of nearby nursing homes and hospitals. Whoever is behind the heinous act would be identified and booked under appropriate sections of IPC," the officer added.
