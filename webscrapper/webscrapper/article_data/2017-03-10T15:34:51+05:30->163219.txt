PANAJI:   (GSM), which went in alliance with   (MGP) with the objective of defeating   in the February 4 polls, said that the exit poll results would be far from reality.

 GSM president   said that the  , predicting that BJP would get 18-21 seats, will be off the mark as the polls have failed to take into consideration the silent voters.
 
 “Everyone knows about the silent vote factor this time. It has been analyzed to go against the BJP. They didn’t want to say openly because of politics of vengenance. So have you factored the silent voters?” Shirodkar said.
 
 He told TOI that GSM-MGP-Shiv Sena may not get majority but the ground reality was clear that the electorate would reject BJP.
 
 Moreover, he said the winning margins would be very thin this time for various reasons and this aspect had also not been taken into account by the agencies which conducted the exit polls.
 
 Stating that the exit polls have not said anything about the smaller parties, Shirodkar said that on the contrary, it would be the smaller parties which would play an important role in the government formation.
 
 The silent-voter effect will be known only on March 11, Shirodkar said adding that exit polls would be proven wrong.
 
 Shirodkar alleged that BJP had used the official machinery to influence the voters as they tried to make use of all the resources at their disposal to remain in power.
 
 He further said that during the elections, the BJP stood exposed on various counts. 
 
 “They couldn’t keep their word to the people after they got elected. They betrayed the people of Goa and the BJP cannot get the mandate of a simple majority to rule the state,” Shirodkar said.
