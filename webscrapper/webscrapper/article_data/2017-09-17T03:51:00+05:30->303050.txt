Panaji: High court of Bombay at Goa has declined from interfering in the national green tribunal (NGT) order that had directed the state government to complete a scientific exercise of demarcating private forests to ensure their protection.  The state had challenged two orders of NGT dated January 7, 2016, and July 13, 2016, and prayed for quashing and setting them aside, arguing that the exercise of demarcating the forest had been completed. In January 2016 order, NGT had issued an interim direction to the departments of forest and revenue and the directorate of settlement and land records to constitute a committee within four months and to evolve an internal mechanism to demarcate private forests in each of the lands recognized as full and private forests by the Sawant-Karapurkar committees.  This order was in connection with a writ petition filed by Goa Foundation before the high court and transferred before NGT in 2013, alleging that 3,500ha out of approximate 7,000ha (67 sq km) of privately-owned forest areas, identified by government-appointed Sawant and Karapurkar committees since 1997, had been excluded by the government.  The petition before NGT had prayed that 67sq km identified by the committee be physically demarcated on the ground to protect the forests. Goa along with other states has initiated the exercise of identifying private forest areas and even degraded lands since 1998, following a Supreme Court directive, but environmentalists are disappointed that the government has failed to initiate necessary steps to evolve a scientific method of demarcation of forest land.  The high court held that it was unable to find any cause for interference in the matter.  “Alternatively, the forest densities of 1997 should be ascertained. A joint exercise would conveniently enable the demarcation of private forest areas in each land,” justice G S Patel and Justice Nutan D Sardessai has directed the state government.
