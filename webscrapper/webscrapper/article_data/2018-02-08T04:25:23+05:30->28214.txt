NEW DELHI: A   here on Wednesday sent former media baron   to 14 days   in connection with a case related to INX Media.

 Mukerjea was presented before special judge Sunil Rana on the expiry of her two-day Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) custody.
 
 She was quizzed in a case allegedly involving Karti Chidambaram, son of former Union Minister P Chidambaram.
 
 On May 15 last year, the CBI had registered an FIR against Karti on charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating, accepting gratification by corrupt or illegal means, influencing public servants and criminal misconduct.
 
 Karti allegedly received Rs 3.5 crore from Mumbai-based INX Media, now 9X Media, for helping it get Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance, when it was run by Peter and Indrani Mukerjea, both accused in the   murder case.
 
 The FIR does not mention the senior Chidambaram, though it said he cleared the FIPB approval for Rs 4.62 crore foreign direct investment in the company at an FIPB meeting on May 18, 2007.
 
 So far, the accused have denied all the charges against them. Agencies
