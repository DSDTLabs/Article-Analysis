CHENNAI: The   to the post of chairman of the  , scheduled for Monday, was   by the Tamil Nadu government after some members of the board opposed it through secret ballot.

 On February 25, BC, MBC and minorities welfare department asked the chief executive officer (CEO) Darez Ahamed to adjourn the meeting of the board for election after former chairman A Tamilmahan Hussain and two others opposed secret ballot. The opposing members said the CEO’s plan to hold a secret ballot did not have precedence. Following this, the state wants to take a legal opinion.
 
 On the other hand, at least six members of the council, including AIADMK MP Anwhar Raajhaa, IUML MLA K A M Muhammed Abubacker and Gingee MLA K S Mastan submitted a petition supporting Raajhaa for the post of chairman. “We disapprove of the postponement of meeting convened by the secretary of the   board,” the letter said. 
 
 When the board members were elected last September, Anwhar Raajhaa, was the only Muslim MP to be nominated. “Although, the tenure of the board is five years, Raajahaa’s membership will come to an end with his tenure as MP in May 2018. If he is not elected, the board has to be reconstituted,” said a member, who did not want to named.
 
  Until now, the board has been unanimously electing the chairman, said an official, but when Raajhaa wanted to contest, the CEO decided to conduct a secret ballot. But due to internal resistance, the election has been postponed. “If the state wishes, Raajahaa can continue after his tenure,” he said.
