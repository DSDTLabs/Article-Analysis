Has our own body become a deadweight for us? So much so that we have ceased to love and enjoy our being. Shabari Rao’s latest dance-theatre performance, 
 , explores the tension between the experience of the body as a liability and as an abundance. “We are so preoccupied with the burden of being on a diet, sweating it out at the gym as well as using the right kind of health and beauty products that the whole process of looking good has come in the way of our life itself. For most of us, it’s about either hating or hiding our body,” explains Shabari, who is also an educator and a researcher.

  Talking about the relevance of the devised piece in contemporary times, she says, “Dependence on technology has somehow made us lose touch with our real physical self. Instead, we are more worried about body image and all the insecurities it leads to. The act strives to put across the message that we engage ourselves with the world through our body, so whatever we do to stay healthy and fit should be a celebration our body, rather than something done out of guilt.”
 
  Lata Mani’s poetry forms part of the performance, together with Hindustani classical music by  , while the sound design and production is done by  . The devised act is set to premiere at a city venue over the weekend.
 
  
 
 
  §The body is a fundamental, material constraint that each of us is born with. The current, dominant socio-cultural construction of the body encourages us to experience our bodies as a liability, as something that gets in the way of life. And as such colours our experience of our body.
 
  §The solo performance explores the abundance of possibility that the body holds, both for art and life. It incorporates abstract movement, text, scene work, character and music.
