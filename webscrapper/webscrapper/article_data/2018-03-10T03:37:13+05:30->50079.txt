MUMBAI: A Kandivli resident was shocked to finding   valuables worth nearly Rs 4 lakh missing from his   after collecting it from the carousel on reaching Mumbai’s international airport early on March 5.

 Jigar Morbia (40) noticed the theft when his baggage, which weighed 14kg at Ahmedabad airport, was 12.4kg in Mumbai. Morbia approached the CISF control room, which scanned through CCTV footage and found a truck driver holding his bag and keeping it on the belt manually, instead of the process being done automatically.
 
 Morbia, quality manager with an IT firm, returned to Mumbai with his family after attending a baby shower function of a relative in Ahmedabad. “Four days have passed but no action has been taken by Sahar police or the   to whom I complained by mail. I suspect the counter desk at the airport and   employees are hand-in-glove. The lock was broken when I got my bag on the belt at the airport, that came last,” Morbia told TOI.
 
 Morbia claimed that initially the desk attendant at Ahmedabad airport said he could take his bag on board. “But the attendant then glanced at my bag, checked with his colleague, and said it had to go into cargo. I declared while putting the bag in cargo that it had valuables. This was why the person at Ahmedabad airport changed his mind, claiming the bag weight was beyond the permissible limit,” he alleged.
 
 A case has been registered under Indian Penal Code section 379 (theft) against an unidentified person. Sahar police are scanning CCTV footage to get the identification of the person with whom, as per the complainant, the baggage was found at the cargo section after the flight landed in Mumbai.
