MUMBAI: A day after several first-year   students were given wrong question papers during the exams,   on Tuesday said the goof-up happened only at five colleges. Close to 650 students were allotted centres at these colleges and given the   question paper in the old pattern, which did not have the 15-mark objectives. The university said these students will not suffer any academic loss.

 Many students realised the goof-up only after they discussed it with their friends after the exam. The syllabus underwent a minor change. 
 
 The university claimed the colleges were expected to verify the question paper code before downloading it. However, the principal of one of the colleges where wrong paper was distributed, said there were no means to verify the paper code as the subject and syllabus were the same. “A majority of the students are not regular to class. So they were not aware of the change in pattern and were alarmed only after they saw a different question paper,” said the principal.
 
 The university, in a statement issued on Tuesday, said the board of studies will come up with a solution to ensure students do not lose out on marks due to the goof-up.
