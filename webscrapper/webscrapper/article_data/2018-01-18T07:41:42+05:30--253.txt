CHANDIGARH: Welcoming the   and   high court’s decision to set aside the appointment of the chief minister’s chief principal secretary   on Wednesday, the   (SAD) called for the review of all the cabinet decisions.

 Former minister and SAD spokesperson   said the decision has put a question mark on all cabinet decisions as Kumar’s presence in cabinet meetings was illegal. Cheema said the very fact that the officer had knowledge of all cabinet decisions and even had a role in influencing them made them (decisions) illegal.
 
 He added that Kumar should be asked to refund the money he had taken as pay and spent on maintaining his office and other perks enjoyed by him. “Despite objections from all right thinking quarters, that a retired officer like Kumar could not enjoy the powers of a cadre officer, the government bulldozed all opposition and appointed him to the post of chief principal secretary at a payscale of Union cabinet secretary. This was unprecedented in the history of the state and has been rightly struck down,” said Cheema. He added it was known to everyone that Kumar was the chief minister’s blue-eyed boy and all powers were concentrated in his hands.
