PATNA: RJD MLAs Saroj Yadav and Chandan Ram on Thursday filed a   in the   against the Bihar governor’s invite to the JD(U)-BJP combine, not the largest single party RJD, to form government.
 
  Petitioners’ counsel   told TOI the PIL would come up for hearing before the   government’s floor test slated for Friday.
  
  According to the PIL, the Supreme Court in the   versus Union of India case in 1996 and the   versus Union of India case in 2006 ruled that the single largest party should be invited first to form government.
  
  A separate PIL of the same nature has also been filed by one Jitendra Kumar.
