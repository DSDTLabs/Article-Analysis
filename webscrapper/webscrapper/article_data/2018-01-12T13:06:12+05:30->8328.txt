CHAMARAJANAGAR: A day after BJP national president Amit Shah sought ‘hisaab’ (accounts) of Rs 3 lakh crore central funds granted to Karnataka, chief minister   on Thursday said that he is only answerable to the people of Karnataka and state legislature. “Who is Amit Shah to demand state expenditure details? Is he a legislator or an MP from the state?” the CM questioned.

 Continuing his tirade against Shah, the CM asked whether the Gujarat government provided details to then PM   on how central funds were utilized by the state. “Amit Shah should know the basics of state and central finances,” he added.
 
 “The central government has no tax source except the money it collects from the states through taxes. Finance commission, an autonomous body created by the Constitution fixes the state’s share in the central tax. In the past 4 years, the Centre has not released state’s share of Rs 60,000 crore. Even in the natural calamity fund, the state has been given less compensation. Still Amit Shah is demanding accounts,” he said.
 
 The CM alleged that the Centre has neglected farmers. “For the past three years, the Prime Minister is speaking about increasing the income of farmers. But in reality, nothing has been done,” he said.
 
 Talking about the recent communal clashes in the state, he said: “The state government has no plans to ban the Popular Front of India. We will initiate stringent action against any organization, including, PFI, SDPI and Bajrang Dal if they try to create unrest in the society.”
 
 CM Siddaramaiah also stated that the state government has not requested the Election Commission to conduct the upcoming state assembly elections in two phases. He also declined to comment on the allegation leveled by Salu Marada Thimmakka that the state government is not supporting her health expenses.
