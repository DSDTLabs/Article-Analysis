PUNE: Superintendent of police Mohammed Suvez Haque, who took charge of the Pune rural police, on Saturday spoke of a “stick and carrot” approach to policing in his jurisdiction.

 “A policeman has a flower in one hand, and a stick in the other. Criminals will be dealt with using the stick, while common citizens will be greeted with flowers,” Haque said. 
 
 Haque took over after his predecessor Jay Jadhav got transferred to Mumbai police.
 
 An IPS officer of the 2005 batch, Haque is known for his work in the Naxal-affected district of Gadchiroli.
 
 Haque, a chemical engineer, vowed to make crimes against women and children his top priority, and also to improve the welfare and motivation of his constabulary. 
 
 “A constable is a hero and works efficiently if a good environment is provided,” he said.
 
 Pointing out that people generally approach top police officers only if their work or needs are not considered at the police station level, Haque said: “It is important that the basic police units — police stations — function properly and address the issues of the people on time.” 
 
 He was previously posted at   rural, Beed, Solapur rural, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, Palghar and Raigad districts as superintendent of police.
