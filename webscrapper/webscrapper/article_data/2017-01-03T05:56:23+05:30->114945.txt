GUWAHATI: As a year ends and a new year begins,  , a   from Sonari Chapori in  , wishes to pass his  . 

 He hopes that exams will no longer be a hurdle in the lives of specially-abled children. 
 
 Rupam, a Class X student, took the board exam for two consecutive years but failed due to lack of a scribe. The education authorities did not provide him one in spite of his repeated pleas. For this young boy, red tape has become the biggest worry now. "I am confident that I can pass the board exam if the education authorities provide me a scribe. I want to clear the exam like my classmates. I want to move forward in my life and fulfil my aspirations," said Rupam, the only private candidate from Sonari Chapori Tribal High School in Lakhimpur. 
 
 The young boy from Sonari Chapori wants to pursue higher studies and look after his family and his little sister who had supported him in spite of his failures. "My family still has high hopes and I want to do something for them," said Rupam, who is conscious of his responsibilities. His family members claimed that according to medical reports, Rupam is eligible to get a scribe to write for him in the board exams starting from February but the education authorities are reluctant. They did not treat his case with due urgency. Rupam's father who works at a bicycle repairing shop near Dhakhuakhana hopes that someday the district education authorities will listen to their prayers. 
 
 "The education authorities just need to check the papers issued by the health department confirming the disability of my son. He can write one sentence after a lot of effort and this cannot make him pass. That is why he needs a scribe to write for him but there is no positive feedback from anywhere," said Rupam's father, Deepak, who had visited the Seba office several times in the last few weeks.
