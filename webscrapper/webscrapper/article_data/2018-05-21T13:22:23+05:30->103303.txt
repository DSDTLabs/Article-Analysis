We hear of the camaraderie shared by actors on set working on the same movie but seldom do we hear of cordial relation shared by actors outside the film. In a similar rare instance,   apparently called on   during his   tussle with KriArj Entertainment over his upcoming film ‘Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran’.

 According to reports, John, who was then in the midst of his legal battle with KriArj over Parmanu: The Story Of Pokhran, advised Shahid to be careful about whatever moves he made in lieu of his upcoming film ‘Batti Gul Meter Chalu’. Besides talking about their respective films with the then   producer, Shahid appreciated the fact that John called on him.
 
 For the uninitiated, Shahid Kapoor starrer '  Meter Chalu' shooting came to a halt some weeks ago when the production house KriArj Entertainment sighted some financial issues.
