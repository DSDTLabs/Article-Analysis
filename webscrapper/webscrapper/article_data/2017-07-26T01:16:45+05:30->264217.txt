 They also said they would lock out all offices of the Noida Authority except for the main office located in Sector 6. The protesters plan to gherao the chief maintenance engineer's office located in Sector 5 starting 10am.
 
 Apart from 4,465 contranctual workers, there are about 1,800 permanent employees and 1,200 ‘job contractual’ employees in the Noida Authority.
 
 Noida Contractual Employees’ Association president Devender Kumar Sharma told TOI that they have been working on contract for the Noida Authority for the last 20-25 years. “However, the Noida Authority has never kept its promises,” Sharma said.
 
 “Fifteen days ago, a meeting was held with erstwhile deputy CEO Saumya Srivastava, who had said that a coordination committee would be put in place to address our issues and demands. But after he was transferred, no Authority official is willing to talk to us,” he said.
 
 Sharma outlined the Association’s demands, which he said have been pending for long. “Our demands include clearing issues related to our provident fund and also making our employment permanent, which has already been approved by the state government,” he said. “When employees are not given their due, it leaves them disconnected and demotivated,” he said.
 
 Currently, the Noida Authority employs 1,800 contractual employees in the health department, 1,600 in water and sewer, 315 in electrical and mechanical, 300 in horticulture and 450 in civil divisions. 
 
 “We will lock up Noida offices in sectors 19, 20, 37 and 39. All employees from the departments of health, horticulture, store and purchase, E&M, and civil divisions will assemble at
 
 Sector 39,” said Brijbhan Singh, another member of the Association.
 
 “The CME’s office in Sector 5 will be gheraoed. The plan is to continue our protest at the Sector 6 office on Thursday if our demands are not addressed,” he said.
