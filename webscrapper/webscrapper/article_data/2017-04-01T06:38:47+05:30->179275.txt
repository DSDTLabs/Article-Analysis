New Delhi: The unusual rise in mercury level has pushed the   to an all-time  . At 7.22pm on Friday, the capital’s maximum load touched 4,139MW—the highest ever recorded electricity demand for the month of March.

 Discoms have predicted that this year’s peak demand will be 6,600MW, but with early signs of unusually high electricity appetite from Delhiites, this prediction too might be surpassed, which could lead to faults in the supply system. “While there has been a gradual increase of 100-200MW in the demand in the past few years, never have we seen a demand of above 4,000MW in March,” said Rishi Raj Bhati, spokesperson for Delhi Transco Limited.
 
 In March 2013, the peak power consumption was 3,226 MW. The same was 3,444MW in 2014, 3,589MW in 2015 and 3,617MW last year. No wonder that Friday’s reading — it is 522MW higher than last year’s — has set the alarm bells ringing for the discoms, which will face a bigger challenge in the coming months.
 
 The power demand usually peaks around late evening when air conditioners and coolers are switched in all households. The rise in demand this time is being attributed to an early arrival of summer. Last Wednesday, the peak demand was 3,466 MW and it increased to 3,469MW and 3,666 MW in the next two days. However, the demand started decreasing towards the weekend—it came down to 3,224MW since offices remained closed. On Thursday, the maximum demand shot up to 4,116MW, breaking the 4,000MW record for March.
 
 “Delhi Transco’s system is adequately prepared to meet such demands,” said Bhati. The private discoms had earlier predicted that the demand in the summer months might breach the 6,600-MW mark, an increase of over 5% from last year’s. Besides, it’s an   high figure in terms of peak demand. Experts said that the chances of power system failures, snags and outages increase if the system is constantly overstressed. 
 
 Peak power demand in BRPL’s area of south and west Delhi, which had reached 2,669MW in the summer of 2016, is expected to touch around 2,800MW this year. In BYPL’s area of east and central Delhi, it had reached 1,493MW last year. Th`is year, it is expected to touch the 1,600-MW mark. Similarly, the areas managed by   in north and   are likely to see a peak demand of 1,900MW as against 1,791MW recorded last year. 
 
 Discoms have assured that adequate measures have been taken to meet the demand. A BSES spokesperson said, “We have invested substantial resources to strengthen the network. Most of the work to strengthen the distribution system has been completed; the rest is on track. This has made the distribution network more robust for taking additional load in the coming months.” 
 
 The two BSES discoms further claim that they have made power banking arrangements with other states to get additional supply for summer. A Tata Power spokesperson said, “The company has deployed 39 mobile distribution transformers to tackle breakdowns. Also, 53 maintenance vehicles are operating round the clock to attend breakdown complaints. New grids and lines have been added too.”
