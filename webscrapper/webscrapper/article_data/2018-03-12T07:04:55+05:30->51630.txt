KOLKATA: The health department is all set to improve attendance of doctors in state hospitals. In a missive issued a fortnight ago, Health secretary Anil   asked doctors to attend hospitals six days a week. “The duty roster of 48 hours per week means physical attendance in the hospital for six days a week. Beyond it, they might have to be on call,” Verma’s missive said.

 The missive said doctors are often present on call in the health centre or hospital for two days a week to ensure their 48 hours get logged. But Verma wants to end this practice because after the 48 hours get done, many doctors stay away from hospitals.
 
 Verma has asked to reschedule the duty hours in consultation with employees. “The roster will mention shift duties and the on-call period for each day. The total shift duty hours should not be less than 40 hours per week,” he said.
 
 An official said, “In rural hospitals, doctors attend to the outdoor department for a few hours three to four days a week. Their attendance is often less than 48 hours per week. Specialists in medical colleges attend to outdoor patients for a day or two and attend to the indoor patients for another two days, which add up to less than 48 hours per week.”
 
 However, Dr  , convenor, medical cell of  , said junior doctors often work over 72 hours per week. “How can they log 48 hours and then be on call?” he asked.
