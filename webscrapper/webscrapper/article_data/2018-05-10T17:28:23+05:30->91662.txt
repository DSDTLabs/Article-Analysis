It is not easy to release an entire   independently, but that didn’t stop singer and songwriter   from going against all odds at a time when most singers and performing artistes release just one track at a time. Her debut album,  , is extremely special in more ways than one. “I have always wanted to release my own music. Today, when people are releasing single tracks, I wanted to have an entire album of my own. For me, listening to an album is like reading a book. So, I went against all odds and did it,” she says, adding, “It’s a very eclectic album and is about life. It’s my first album as a composer and this validates my purpose.”
But that’s not it. Mili, who has worked with music composers like Amit Trivedi and AR Rahman, cannot stop raving about artistes like  ,  ,   and  , with whom she collaborated with for the album. “Working with these legends was quite an experience. Having veteran musicians like them on board was a huge thing. I had never thought that I would work with such great people. We had so much fun recording and one thing led to another. It was a miracle and seemed like it was written in the stars,” she says.
 The album comprises 10 tracks composed by Mili herself and recorded in Los Angeles. “The album took a couple of years and was a humongous effort. We were always clear about one thing — to record the tracks live. We wanted that because we believe that when you record a song live, that’s when the magic happens,” she says, adding, “I want listeners to perceive the album on their own. Let it be their journey.”
 Mili, who studied in Bengaluru and began her professional music career in the city, has made a mark for herself in Bollywood. So, what’s next? “As of now, I’m busy promoting the album. But you never know what will happen tomorrow,” she signs off.
