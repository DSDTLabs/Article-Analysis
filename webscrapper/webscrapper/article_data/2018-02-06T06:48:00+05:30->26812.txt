Kolkata: Released on bail after 13 months in a Bhubaneswar jail, Trinamool Congress MP   Paul on Sunday said he would continue with his acting career but was unclear about his plans for returning to politics.

 The Krishnagar Lok Sabha MP was released on Saturday evening after the Orissa High Court granted him bail on Thursday. He was also ordered to provide Rs 1 crore surety apart from Rs 2 lakh bail bonds. 
 
 “I am an actor and everybody knows Tapas Paul, the hero of ‘Dadar Kirti’. People have seen me on screen and in theatres. I cannot leave acting,” he said before leaving Bhubaneswar on a flight to Kolkata.
 
 Dressed in a white shirt and trousers, Paul looked distraught as he spoke. “I have not been well since 2014. I was wrong when I made a statement,” he said, referring to the hate speech of June 2014. The speech, in which he was found inciting violence against women, had gone viral. “I apologise for that. It was a big mistake,” he said.
 
 “I have full faith in the judiciary and salute them. I am also grateful to the people of Odisha for their support. I have spent 13 months in the state. It is time to go home,” he said.
 
 Visibly pallid owing to poor health, Paul was greeted by family members and friends after he walked out of the Jharpada correctional home. He had been jailed by a special CBI court in 2016 after CBI arrested him for his alleged involvement in the Rose Valley Ponzi scam.
 
 After his arrest, Paul had complained of multiple ailments and suffered a nervous breakdown. He needed counselling and was later shifted to hospital. “I was under continuous monitoring of doctors and will have to be under regular supervision. Doctors in Kolkata will take a call on my movements. It could take weeks, even months,” he said. The throng of supporters, seen when he was arrested and brought to Bhubaneswar, was missing on Sunday.
