Thanks to its hard-hitting storyline, television serial ‘Aamar Thikana Tai Briddhashram’ is creating a buzz among the audience. Like the title suggests, the popular television serial revolves around the struggle of elderly people.

 Sebanti Das, a 65-year-old lady who lives alone in the city said, “I love to watch the serial because I can relate to it. My only son lives in the USA. I have lived most of life in this house and don’t want to go elsewhere at this age. I can see the same kind of dilemma among the onscreen characters.” 
 
 Veteran actress   is playing the role of ‘Yashoda’, an elderly woman who is deprived of love. Eminent actors like   and   are also part of this show.
 
 “The USP of our serial is that you can relate to the characters. They don’t go to bed with makeup and wake up fresh like the characters do in other soaps. We tried to show things as they are,” said  , the director of the serial. He explained that in our society geriatric care (related to elderly people) is still a neglected area.
 
 “The primary focus was to initiate a debate among the viewers about the necessity of old homes. In most of the cases, these homes are treated as a dumping ground where the old parents can be left by their children. And therein lies our question,” the director said. 
 
 
 The serial is based on an old age home ‘Sesher Kobita’, where its inmates, characters of the serial, are seen starting afresh even after reaching the age of 70. The idea was to ignite the thought that life does exist after 60 years, informed the makers.
