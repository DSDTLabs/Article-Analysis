SRINAGAR: As soon as the news of terrorists attacking   broke on Monday, Jammu & Kashmir chief minister  , in an unusual display of solidarity, broke security protocol to travel from Jammu to Anantnag to lend moral support to the families of the victims. 

 Covering 50 km within an hour of the attack, Mehbooba reached the spot and spent the night at the district police lines along with the families of those killed and injured. “We condemn the   unequivocally. It was an attack on our brotherhood. After many years everyone in Kashmir is on the same page on something. We all believe this is not what Kashmir stands for,” the CM said. 
 
 Eyewitnesses, who Mehbooba spoke with, said the CM was full of anguish. Prakash Vijori, 53, of Maharashtra, who received multiple injuries in his head, told TOI, “The CM came to see us in the Anantnag district hospital. She said she was profoundly sorry that her guests were treated like this. She assured all help and directed the medical staff to take care of the injured pilgrims.” 
 
 Bus driver Salim Shaikh, whose heroic act of manoeuvring the 56-seater bus during the attack saved at least 50 innocent lives, said the CM’s humility and her fast response to the tragedy, instilled confidence in the people shaken by the night’s event. “The CM reached the spot soon after I parked the bus,” Shaikh said. “There were many injured and dead bodies laden in the bus, and she came to see everyone.”
