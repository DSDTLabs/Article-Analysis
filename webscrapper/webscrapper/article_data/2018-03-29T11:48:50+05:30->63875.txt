CHENNAI:   ( ) has sped up groundwork at  , Vellore and   airports to ready them for flight operations by year-end, a deadline set by the ministry of civil aviation.

 The ministry has already auctioned routes to these airports under the   scheme Udan. SpiceJet has bagged the Chennai-Thanjavur route, Turbo Aviation the Chennai-Vellore route and Air Odisha has been given rights to fly from Neyveli under phase 1 of the   scheme. The routes were awarded in January.
 
 A senior AAI official said runway re-carpeting work is going on at the Neyveli airport owned by Neyveli Lignite Corporation and a small building will be constructed to handle passengers and baggage. 
 
 “Discussions are going on with the state government to acquire around 30acres of land in Vellore to extend the runway. The runway at Vellore is only 2,400ft and is not enough for 60 to 70-seater planes like ATR to land. Only small nine-seater planes can use it. The airstrip was being used for flight training,” the official added.
 
 Salem airport has a small facility for a terminal but Neyveli, Thanjavur and Vellore need similar buildings. “Thanjavur was with AAI long ago but was not in use. The air force took over the strip when the Sri Lankan conflict was at its peak. The airstrip is 9000ft and ideal for Udan  . Some more land is needed to build a small terminal and parking area,” the AAI official said.
 
 The work can be completed soon because AAI is going to provide   which will resemble halls for passengers to wait and where security checks can be done. There will not be baggage conveyors and other mechanised facility. AAI has also started preparatory work at the Ramanathapuram airstrip which will be taken up under phase 2 of the Udan scheme.
 
 Of the regional routes, SpiceJet has started flights between Puducherry and Hyderabad, and Trujet has begun operations between Chennai and Salem.
