AMRITSAR: Advising the community members to not get confused by ‘directions’ and ‘summons’ issued by the informal Sarbat Khalsa-appointed jathedars,   Giani   Singh said he would soon convene a meeting of the high priests. They would contemplate over the report on Sikh leaders who had gone to Sirsa’s Dera Sacha Sauda to seek electoral support ahead of the assembly elections in Punjab, he added.

 While talking to TOI on Friday, Gurbachan said, “There is nothing to get confused over self-proclaimed jathedars’ direction or summons.” He was reacting to the summoning of 40 Sikh leaders, who had gone to the Sirsa dera seeking support for recently concluded assembly elections, at   on March 30.
 
 Stating that the whole Panth knows about ‘Sarbat Khalsa jathedars’, Gurbachan said he would soon convene a meeting of the Sikh clerics to contemplate over the report of the panel constituted by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) to look into the matter.
 
 “Jathedar of Takht Kesgarh Sahib Giani Mal Singh is not keeping well. As soon as he recovers, we will hold a meeting,” he said.
 
 On March 15, Sarbat Khalsa-appointed jathedars had held a meeting at the Akal Takht and summoned 40 Sikh leaders of different political parties, including Shiromani Akali Dal, Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress, to appear before them on March 30 and furnish explanation.
 
 On the other hand, Sarbat Khalsa-appointed jathedar of Takht Damdama Sahib Baljit Singh Daduwal said, “Those who are guilty of pardoning the guilty can’t give judgments.” He said it was for the first time that the Sikh Panth had stood against the current jathedars, which necessitated the need of organizing  . “They were appointed by the then SAD-BJP government whereas we are appointed by the Panth that too after following the set Patnhic traditions,” he claimed.
