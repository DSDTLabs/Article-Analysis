HYDERABAD:   crashed out of the All England Championship losing to   21-14, 21-10 in the quarterfinals of the Super Series Premier in Birmingham on Friday. The world No.1 needed just 34 minutes to knock out the Olympic silver medallist. But for the first few points in the first game Sindhu hardly matched the Taipei girl.

 Sindhu looked like controlling the first game when she led 9-5. She pushed Tai to the back of the court and did not allow her to play the drops. But the ploy did not work as Tai targeted the forehand of Sindhu and managed to stay closer to the net. She soon wiped off the deficit and went into the break at 11-10.
 
 After the break, Tai toyed with Sindhu. Known for her deceptive skills and creative work near the net, Tai's touch play bamboozled Sindhu. The lanky Indian found it difficult to pick the drop shots in the front side of the court. And when Sindhu managed to return them Tai pushed the bird back. The 22-year-old top seed dictated terms and it was only a matter of time before she surged ahead to a 17-12 lead and never looked back.
 
 Having lost the first game, Sindhu tried to play her trademark smashes in the second game. But Tai was in such form that she hardly allowed the Indian to free her arms. The Hyderabadi girl was unable to execute her gameplan and was confined to retrieve the shuttle at the forecourt.
 
 Tai zoomed ahead to 5-11 at the break and hardly broke any sweat in the second game as she wrapped up the second game with an 11-point margin at 21-10.
 
 Tai will now face the winner of the quarterfinal between   and   of Korea.
