 Madurai: The Madurai railway division has floated tenders to engage 110 ‘gate mitras’ or gate counsellors at unmanned level crossings identified as vulnerable in the division. This is the second time, the division is undertaking the initiative as 60 gate mitras were deployed in 2015 earlier.
 
 Normally, caution boards are kept on both sides of the unmanned level crossings to alert road users and speed breakers are also provided on both approaches. Loco pilots of passing trains are instructed to hoot the horn continuously while approaching these crossings. Despite all these precautions, it is seen that accidents do occur when road users fail to be alert while crossing the railway tracks at unmanned level crossings.
 
 Attaching utmost importance to safety at unmanned level crossing gates, the railway ministry has reiterated the need to provide gate counsellors at unmanned level crossing gates. The ‘gate mitras’ will alert road users about approaching trains at unmanned level crossings. They are primarily deployed to counsel the road users to be vigilant while crossing the crossings. The idea is to put in place a mechanism before all unmanned crossings are eventually converted into either manned gates, limited height subways or road over bridges depending on feasibility.
 
 The ‘gate mitra’ will also distribute safety instruction pamphlets to road users for safely crossing the gates and will be provided with flag to alert users. ‘Gate mitras’ are imparted training on how to handle unmanned level crossings. They are also suitably counselled before being deployed. “Tender notice has been floated on Tuesday and it is hopeful that we will be able to find persons to act as gate mitras,” an official from the division said.
