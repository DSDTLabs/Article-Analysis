NEW DELHI: Delhi University, in a first, conducted a preadmission interaction and orientation programme on Friday to familiarise aspirants with the process of online registration.

 “The idea is to reduce the risk of mistakes that aspirants often make while filling up their forms. While they can select as many courses they want, aspirants often make mistakes and are unable to change after submission,” DU officer on special duty for admissions Ashutosh   said.
 
 He said the university has updated the software so that aspirants can apply for both merit-based and entrance exams in the same form. Bharadwaj, however, cautioned the aspirants that once they submit their forms, they won’t be allowed to make changes. “Go through the bulletin of information and reach out to the dean of students’ welfare (DSW) office to clear your doubts while filling the forms,” he said. Bharadwaj also asked aspirants to apply for as many courses as they want in the merit-based category, but only limited numbers in the entrance category.
 
 Deputy DSW Gurpreet Singh Tuteja took queries of the aspirants and took them through the admission forms to apprise them of how to go about the process of filling in personal, academic and bank details. Tuteja also informed about the provisions for admission into the Non-Collegiate Women’s Education Board where girl students from Delhi will automatically get admission in BA and BCom programmes.
 
 Aakriti B Kumar, a student of DPS, Greater Noida, said, “I am a science student but want to apply for bachelor of mass communication and hope to get admission here as I am hopeful of getting more than 90% in my boards.”   of   said he wasn’t hopeful of scoring over 90% and wanted to know his options. The programme would continue on Saturday.
