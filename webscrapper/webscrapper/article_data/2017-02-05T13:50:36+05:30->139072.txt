SURLA: On Saturday, in Goa’s rooftop village, which sits perched high above in the   in the  , two people literally experienced a top-of-the-world feeling after casting their votes in person for the very first time. 

 Both army men, Sameer Gaonkar, 30, a Lance Naik in the Madras infantry based in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala and Punaji Gaonkar, 32, a soldier with the Corps of Signals based in Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, got the opportunity to cast their vote at the polling booth in their village for the first time. “Till now we have always voted through the postal ballot and are happy to have voted for the first time, in person, on the electronic voting machine (EVM),” they told STOI.
 
 Duty had taken Sameer to Poonch in Jammu as part of the patrolling team, and to Assam as part of the counter insurgency operations. On his part, Punaji has been posted in Dehradun, West Bengal and Chandigarh. “We tried to come to Goa to vote during earlier elections also, but due to our postings, we have always had to vote through postal ballots,” they said.
 
 Both hail from Surla, a village with a population of 650 and 397 voters, which lies in the Western Ghats, almost detached from Goa at more than 2,000 ft above sea level. More than 200 of these voters do not live in the village as they have migrated to various parts of the state for work. They, however, diligently return to their village on election day to perform their electoral duty.
 
 The only access to this village, which, figuratively speaking, sits in the middle of nowhere, is from the Karnataka side of the foothills of the Sahyadris. From Keri the road winds up the mountain range and enters Karnataka where it branches off to Surla from the Sakahli-Belagavi highway. All the charms and idylls of the Western Ghats are on ample offer in this remote settlement.
