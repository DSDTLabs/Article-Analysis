VIJAYAWADA: Minister for agriculture Somireddy Chandramohan Reddy on Sunday ridiculed the corruption charges of   president Y S   on chief minister N  .

 Speaking to mediapersons, Chandramohan Reddy took strong exception to the YSR Congress releasing a book on Chandrababu Naidu accusing him of indulging in corruption to the tune of Rs 3.75 lakh crore. He wondered where the YSR Congress leaders had collected the figures from when the state budget is just Rs 3.6 lakh crore.
 
 Referring to the corruption charge on Amaravati, the minister said that the farmers had given 33,000 acres of land to the government of which 11,000 acres were given back to the farmers while 10,000 acres were allocated for roads and infrastructure. The government now owns just 11,000 acres, he said and wondered where the corruption took place.
 
 He ridiculed Jaganmohan Reddy’s statement of bringing back YSR regime in the state and alleged that the regime was marked by corruption and exploitation. He said that several IAS officers were sent to jail holding them responsible for corruption. He wondered why Jaganmohan Reddy was promising to bring back the corrupt regime.
 
 Chandramohan Reddy further said that over 24,000 farmers had committed suicides during the Congress rule between 2004 and 2014. Of them, 14,000 had committed suicide only during the Rajasekhara Reddy’s tenure.
 
  He wanted to know if Jaganmohan Reddy was trying to bring back the same regime to force the farmers to commit suicide in the state and claimed that the TDP government, headed by Chandrababu Naidu, had provided Rs 24,000 crore relief to the farmers under the loan waiver scheme, while the Congress government was responsible for the death of 24,000 farmers.
 
 The minister accused the YSR Congress leaders of indulging in corruption in Visakhapatnam land scam. He maintained that the   (SIT), which is probing the issue, would expose the corrupt leaders soon.
