KOZHIKODE:   Pranoy's sister   joined her family's fight for justice by launching a   at their house at Valayam near here on Thursday, a day after her mother was   in Thiruvananthapuram.

 Avishna, who had just completed her SSLC examinations, told media that she was extremely pained that some from the party which her deceased brother believed in tried to justify the police action against her mother. Jishnu was a CPM sympathiser and an ardent admirer of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.
 
 Avishna, who is currently staying along with her grandmother, said that she would continue her hunger strike till her parents return. She also flayed Wednesday's police action against her mother and other family members. “They dragged my mother through the road. Why didn't the police show the same zest to arrest the accused in the case,“ Avishna said. Recounting Jishnu's admiration for Pinarayi Vijayan, she said that Jishnu had kept the photograph of Vijayan in the Vishukani set up at their house last year.
 
 Meanwhile, opposition leader   called Avishna over telephone in the morning and urged her to call off the hunger strike. She, however, stood firm in her decision.
