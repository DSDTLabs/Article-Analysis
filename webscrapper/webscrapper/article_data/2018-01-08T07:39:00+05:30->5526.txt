Chandigarh: The Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing into the violence that erupted following the conviction of Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh in rape cases on August 25, 2017, arrested his close aide Dr Mahinder Pal Singh alias Mahender Insan in Sirsa on Sunday.

 Mahender is a surgeon and his name had cropped up during investigations into the alleged castrations of Dera Sacha Sauda followers, who included the Sirsa dera chief’s security guards and personal staff. He was also a close associate of Aditya Insan, another prominent dera follower and the mastermind of violence along with Honeypreet Insan. Adiya has been on the run since registration of case and SIT has put a reward of Rs 2 lakh on his arrest.
 
 According to information, Mahender was among those seven persons who were booked in the case registered at Sector 5 police station in Panchkula. He was seen at the spot just before the violence and was also among those who attended the action plan meeting called by Honeypreet on August 17, ahead of the court verdict in rape cases against Gurmeet.
 
 SIT head ACP Mukesh Malhotra, whose team arrested Mahender, said he could be a crucial link which may lead to arrest of Aditya Insan.
 
 Mahender has been associated with the sect since 1995 and stayed at different places to escape being caught by police.
 
 “We are hopeful of getting crucial details about the whearabouts of Aditya Insan and two other accused in the case. He will be produced in the court on Monday. His role in other cases is subject to verification,’’ said Malhotra.
