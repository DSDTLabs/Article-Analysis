BENGALURU: Following an offer by the Vijay Mallya-owned United Breweries Holdings Ltd (UBHL) to offer more than 40 lakh shares of   (USL) as security to proceed with their appeal, the high court on Wednesday ordered a notice to the   (ED). The notice was ordered by a division bench headed by Chief Justice  , after the lawyer for the banks pointed out that the shares were attached to the case initiated by ED against Mallya under the Prevention of   Act, 2002.

 The lawyer for UBHL earlier informed the court that the company had deposited Rs 1,280 crore with the court, which had accrued an interest of Rs 108 crore. He further pointed out that the company was willing to sell shares worth more than Rs 900 crore through a promoter. But the court observed that the shares cannot be accepted since their value was not constant. The lawyer for the banks clarified that his clients were not responsible for the proceedings initiated by the ED. The division bench posted the hearing on the original side appeal filed by UBHL to April 17 to await the response from ED.
 
 UBHL had filed the appeal against an earlier order by a single bench dated February 7, wherein the company that was the guarantor for the loans extended to the now defunct   Ltd.
