GUWAHATI: Alleging foul play in allotting 50 kathas of government land to a construction firm illegally,   (APW) on Tuesday asked chief minister   to immediately order a probe into the matter. 

 The APW moved the special judges' court here in October last year. It has also alleged the involvement of three top IAS officers in illegally allotting the land located in Dispur to the firm.
 
 "According to   reports, the same plot of land was declared as government land under the Land Ceiling Act in 1975. However, in 2011, at least two IAS officers from   ( ) district administration and one top revenue department official from Dispur illegally allotted the land to one construction firm," Abhijeet Sharma, the president of the organisation, told the media here. The firm is building a multi-storey residential complex on the plot. The market value of each apartment is believed to be around Rs 1.5 crore, said the APW. 
 
 Sharma alleged that though they have requested the state government to sanction prosecution against the top officials, the Sonowal government is yet to respond. "The Sonowal government should not only order a probe into the matter but also send the accused on deputation till the investigation is over," he said. 
 
 At a time when thousands of landless people in the state have hit the streets demanding land, business groups from outside the state are illegally acquiring land in connivance with IAS officers, said the APW. It requested the people who had booked apartments in the residential complex to take back their money, saying that once an investigation is conducted, the entire project would come to a halt.
