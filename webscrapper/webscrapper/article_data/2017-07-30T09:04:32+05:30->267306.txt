KOCHI: The clock is ticking fast for   and her dream of competing in the   in London may remain just that - a dream.

 Despite getting a favourable order from the Kerala High Court on Friday that asked the   ( ) to ensure Chitra's participation in the World Championship and the Union Sports Minister   advising them to honour the directive, the doors to London haven't yet opened for Chitra.
 
 Chitra's event, the women's 1500m, is scheduled to be held on Friday (August 4) but the 22-year-old is still cooling her heels at her home in Palakkad. The AFI sent a mail to   on Saturday pleading Chitra's case but even its officials are not expecting a favourable response from the world athletics body. 
 
 “We respect the court order and that's why we have written to IAAF requesting an entry for Chitra in 1500m. But we're not sure whether the IAAF can help us in any way as they are unlikely to give entry to any athlete from any country after the completion of the deadline (July 24),” CK Valson, AFI secretary said.
 
 AFI's move came after the sports minister advised the national federation to honour the Kerala High Court directive on Chitra.
 
 Though the AFI has written to IAAF, Chitra doesn't have hopes left of making it to London and has almost resigned to the fact that she will now be forced to watch the proceedings of the World Championship on television. “I don't have much hope now. I am happy with the kind of support I have received but now only a miracle can see me racing in London,” Chitra said.
