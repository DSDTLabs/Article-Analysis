PUNE: The Nigdi Police on Wednesday arrested a couple on charges of   and cheating after they tried to extract Rs 5,000 from a car driver. The woman claimed she was a police officer.

 The suspect, Pradip Chavan, (34) of Chikhli had taken car driver Rizwan Chaudhari’s cellphone and told him that he would return it after getting the money. On Tuesday, Chavan and his wife Priti (25), who was dressed in a police uniform, came to meet Chaudhari to collect the money. Chaudhari alerted the police.
 
 Sub-inspector RM Bhoye told TOI that on September 23, Chavan’s motorcycle had brushed against Chaudhari’s car at Kudalwadi. “Chavan fought with Chaudhari (22) and demanded Rs 5,000 as compensation for damage to his vehicle,” he said.
 
 When Chaudhari refused to give him the money, Chavan told him his wife was a police officer and took away Chaudhari’s cellphone. After Chaudhari contacted Bhoye, the couple was summoned to the police station. “The woman told us she was posted at Hadpasar police station. I found no such officer working there,” Bhoye said, adding police took them into custody after realising that they were lying.
