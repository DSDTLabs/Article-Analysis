CHENNAI: The third edition of the   festival is scheduled for February 10 but local residents have expressed concern over the water body’s current, pitiful state, which they said, exposed official apathy.

 The   lake, spread over 57 acres, is maintained by the   and is one of the deepest water bodies in Chennai. 
 
 The area’s residents have organised lake festivals since 2016, to create awareness about the water body’s importance in sustaining the ground water table in the locality, and to prevent its degradation caused by waste dumping. According to  , a Perungudi resident, the protective fencing installed by the city corporation was torn down by miscreants, who have also broken open the boundary wall at few points. “This has helped cab and travels vehicle drivers, who use the lake’s water to wash their vehicles,” he said.
 
 In December 2017, TOI reported how the lake is being encroached upon by illegal temples that have sprung up. While the city corporation removed a temporary structure from within the water body, permanent, but illegal temples have been left untouched.
 
 “Hyacinth and weed cover the top layer of the lake. This is making it difficult for residents association members to hold a lake cleaning activity. It would help if the authorities take action,” said P  , another Perungudi resident.
 
 Kuppuswami, who is also the president of Perungudi Lake Area Neighbourhood Environmental Transformation (Planet), which hosts the lake festival, told TOI that they would invite a celebrity, and government officials, to be a part of the event. “Last year, actor Vivekh’s presence helped us massively. This year’s festival motto is ‘Clean, Green and Serene,” he said.
 
 Among the planned events are, a wall graffiti competition involving architecture students, a rally to be taken out by school students, rangoli and other interactive programmes. A photo exhibition to spread environmental awareness will also be hosted by one of the local residents.
