 In the end, however, it was Joshana who scripted history as she won 13-15, 12-10, 11-13, 11-4, 11-4 to become the first Indian ever to win the Asian event.  , meanwhile, fell short at the final hurdle as top seed Max Lee from Hong Kong notched up a 5-11, 11-4, 11-8, 11-7 victory to bring up his maiden Asian championship title.
 
 Joshana's hard-fought victory helped her overturn her recent run of losses against Dipika. The 14-time national champion had been at the wrong end of results in the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea, as well as during the national championship in July last year.
