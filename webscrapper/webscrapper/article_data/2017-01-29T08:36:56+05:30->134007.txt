PUNE: Drivers must not only just   while on the road, they also need to ensure their vehicle meets all the norms, or risk being pulled up by the traffic police. 

 Statistics of offenders caught by the traffic police in 2016 reveals interesting data of unusual rule breaks  , most of them just as common as in 2015, while a few registered a sizeable spike.
 
 Vehicles plying with their number plates invisible was the most common offence under illegal number plates, which surged over four times from 2015.
 
 Vehicles with inappropriate number plates that are against the prescribed norms were also pulled over by the hordes, including those that were too fancy, in Marathi or those which tried to show-off their affiliation to a political party. 
 
 Among other offences, not using the reflector was the most common such offence among commuters, with more than 4,800 challans. 
 
  not displaying the 'L' board was another commonly caught offence, as was the offence of not using side mirrors, especially in two-wheelers.
 
 Unauthorised use of the red beacon was also caught by the traffic police 17 times in the year gone by.
 
 Interestingly, commuters were also caught for other offences such as including non-use of the tail lamp, head lamp, wipers, mud-flap and mud-guard.
 
 Elaborating on the reasons of the traffic police going after such offenders, Kalpana Baravkar, deputy commissioner of police (traffic) said, "These may seem minor, but are critical for over-all road safety, especially at night."
