MUMBAI: Every time   boards a train, he becomes the butt of jokes. "People pass comments and think I am available for sex even when I am now a normal person working for an NGO," says Shinde, seated at Cancer Patients Aid Association's ( ) office at Mahalaxmi. 

 Shinde is among five transgenders who have quit   consumption and will be felicitated by CPAA on May 30. Recently, CPAA screened 500 transgenders for pre-cancer detection. "Most transgenders consume tobacco in some form-often bidi, gutkha, cigarette and paan. After counselling, we convinced five of them to quit tobacco. They are now our crusaders against tobacco use and fight against cancer," said CPAA's executive director Anita Peter. She said the community was a target group as they among the most deprived. "Hospitals are generally wary to admit them as they don't know which gender they should be put into. They don't have insurance and almost everyone is into commercial sex work," said Peter. 
 
 Madhuri Sharma who had a sex change and married a man in 2016 said she has not yet got a marriage certificate. "I earn my bread by selling imitation jewellery but most transgenders don't get work even if qualified as society refuses to accept them. -Mohammed.Wajihuddin
