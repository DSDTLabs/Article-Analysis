NEW DELHI:   dubbed the   as allround failure, and said it would launch a nationwide agitation to expose the Centre before the country’s voters.

 Congress vice-president   called it “three years of broken promises, non-performance and betrayal of a mandate”. “Youth are struggling to find jobs, farmers are committing suicide and soldiers are dying on the border. What exactly is the government celebrating?” he asked.
 
 At a press conference featuring its young leaders, Congress launched a scathing attack on the U-turns made by PM   from his stint in the opposition to his ascension to power at the Centre.
 
 It released a video ‘3 saal, 30 tikdam (tricks)’ focused on Modi’s “about-face” on policies and election promises.
 
 In the video, Congress cited “30 tricks” of   by juxtaposing his virulent criticism of Aadhaar, GST, MGNREGA, “pink revolution-meat export” and falling value of rupee with his embracing these key   schemes and his “silence” on currency devaluation. 
 
 It accused the Centre of failing to fulfil its flagship promises of cleaning the Ganga, ‘Make in India’, creation of two crore jobs every year, and ensuring a safe environment for women and Dalits.
 
 Congress said Modi repeatedly accused UPA of being soft on China and Pakistan over border intrusions and beheadings, and promised a strong stand against the neighbours.
