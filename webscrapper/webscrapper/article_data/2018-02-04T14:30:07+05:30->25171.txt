Panaji Goa has been an outlier when it comes to   prices. While residential real estate prices have inched lower countrywide, the state has bucked the national trend with some areas like Porvorim and Panaji showing a rise of 5-7%.

 Though the sales of residential units slowed down post-demonetisation in November 2016 that lasted till October 2017, the prices have shown an uptick with rates rising in urban outgrowths like Caranzalem, Pilerne, Assagao, Arpora, Kadamba Plateau and Dona Paula.
 
 Ability to weather the slowdown in revenue, along with absorbing a proportion of unsold inventory and an unchanged tax structure gave scope to real estate builders and brokers to stand by their asking rate for residential units, says a property consultant.
 
 “Prices have remained stagnant or in some cases have even gone up,” says Ashutosh Apte, the state registrar-cum-head of notary services.
 
 Property platform Magicbricks, shows that the price per square metre in Porvorim stood at an average of Rs 53,703 in April 2017. As on December 2017, the rate had risen to Rs 57,512 per square metre. In Panaji, the rate rose from Rs 74,541 per sqm in November 2017 to Rs 78,265 per sqm in January 2018.
 
 Real estate reports prepared by PropTiger, Knight Frank India and Cushman & Wakefield showed that overall sales in the top nine Indian cities dropped significantly, accompanied by a steep reduction in new launches.
 
 Citing a Knight Frank report, TOI had reported on January 11 that real estate prices fell by an average of 3% across cities, with Pune witnessing the highest decline of 7%, followed by Mumbai at 5% in 2017.
 
 “Unlike most places where banks are financing real estate projects, here it is the builders’ own money or close investors who put money and take inventory in lieu of the money. The builders have strong holding power as they have no need to make money through sales to service loans,” says Amit Chopra, director of Escala Realty.
 
 Vasco has seen a slight drop in real estate prices over the past five months, largely due to an increase in affordable housing projects and lack of a premium tag over the town.
 
 “In real terms if you ask me, that is correction in the market. Stagnation of prices is also a correction. The unreasonable prices demanded have been corrected,” says Chopra.
 
 A real estate builder from Panaji complained that the government made more money on real estate than developers through stamp duty, land conversion charges, infrastructure tax, construction licence fees, payment to planning and development authorities, panchayats, GST on contracts and GST on raw material.
 
 “On an average, a builder will pay Rs 6,200 per sqm in taxes for an S1 zone and Rs 7,500 per sqm in a commercial zone. Land prices, though they have not gone up, have not gone down either. So, where is the scope to reduce prices?” asks Jaganath ‘Desh’ Prabhudessai, president, CREDAI- Goa.
