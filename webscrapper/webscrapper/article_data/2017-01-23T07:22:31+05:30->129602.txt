AGRA: In a shocking incident coming months after the gang rape of a mother and her teenage daughter in July last year on NH 91 near Bulandshahr, a gang of six armed robbers barged into the house of a former deputy inspector general of police from Himachal Pradesh near Jikarpur village in Tappal, Aligarh, less than a kilometre away from the Yamuna expressway, and tortured two women caretakers of the house for over three hours. They later went out and robbed a private double-decker bus ferrying passengers to Lucknow from New Delhi on the e-way where they shot at two when passengers resisted. 

 According to Aligarh SSP Rajesh Kumar Pandey, "The incidents occurred late on Saturday night and the roles of one of the watchmen at the former DIG's house, who had joined just a couple of months ago, as well as the bus driver and conductor who had halted the bus at the spot to change a punctured tyre are being probed."
 
 Tappal station officer   told TOI, "The victims, a 32-year-old woman who is the wife of the  , and one of her younger relatives, were alone at the house when the assailants barged in. They were asking for some cash of the former cop which the women had no clue about. They assaulted them for over three hours leaving them injured and also causing burn injuries to one of the victims." Later, they targeted the bus passengers and robbed them, shooting at a couple of them who resisted.
 
  Pandey said a case under IPC's sections 395 and 397 has been registered against the unidentified miscreants and six men have been detained for questioning.
