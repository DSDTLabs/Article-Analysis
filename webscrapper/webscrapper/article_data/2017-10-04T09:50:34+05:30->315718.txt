AHMEDABAD: Sant Shri Asaramji Ashram Trust, situated in Motera, has approached   high court against the state government’s order to demolish construction in the ashram. The construction was made 35 years ago.

 The trust has challenged the orders passed by the deputy collector and the revenue secretary rejecting its applications to spare the construction as its application for regularization of construction was pending. Ultimately, it was regularized by the Ahmedabad municipal corporation.
 
 The trust and its trustees have claimed that the huge parcel of land was gifted to Asaram for charitable purposes by three owners through a trust formed by them. For various charitable activities and residential purposes, constructions were made in the ashram.
 
 In 1997, the revenue department had issued a show cause notice to the ashram for putting up construction on agriculture land. The litigation lasted for many years and the issue was remanded back to the revenue authority to decide it afresh. 
 
 Meanwhile, heirs of the land donors laid claim to the land. The trust told the high court that since the situation prevailing is against the ashram, the heirs of the donors aim at extortion because the land prices are very high nowadays.
 
 The ashram is now arguing that since the construction has been regularized, and the TP scheme has made the land ‘non-agricultural’, there was no cause for the government to insist on demolition of the construction in the ashram.
