Jaipur: The extension of Kisan Credit Card facility to fisheries and animal husbandry farmers in the Union Budget will help them to meet their working capital needs. It would be a boon for the desert state as animal husbandry is the second important occupation of the people here after agriculture.

 The measure would help small and marginal farmers to avail more credit for the sale and purchase of livestock.
 
 However, director of state animal husbandry department Dr Ajay Kumar Gupta said the devil was in the details as he could not comment on the benefit of the scheme till he had the details.
 
 Though Rajasthan is a land-locked state, it has 15,838 waterbodies of various sizes covering an area of 4,23,765 hectares (excluding 30,000ha of rivers and canals). The waterlogged area comes to 80,000ha at full tank level (FTL) in addition to it 1,80,000ha of salt-affected area.
 
 Rajasthan has also been promoting inland fisheries, especially in the ornamental category. The extension of this facility to the fisheries sector would definitely give a push to this sector with easy credit facilities, said an official.
 
 Announcing the initiative in the Budget, finance minister Arun Jaitely said, “Last year, I had announced setting up of micro irrigation fund (MIF) to facilitate the expansion of coverage under the micro irrigation and dairy processing infrastructure development fund (DPIDF). This will help finance investment for dairy infrastructure. It’s now time to expand focused investment funds.”
 
 In tune with the new thinking, the government plans to set up a fisheries and aquaculture infrastructure development fund (FAIDF) for the fisheries sector and an animal husbandry infrastructure development fund (AHIDF) for financing infrastructure requirement of animal husbandry sector. The total corpus for these two new funds will be Rs 10,000 crore.
