During Saarang, there’s that feeling of festivity at every nook and corner of the sprawling campus of IIT-Madras. Day 2 of the cultural fest was quite a happening one as expected with a plethora of events, ranging from Literary and Debating competitions to the prelims of the spotlight rock-band hunt Decibels. Our photog also spotted students taking part in street-dance contest and trying out hula hoop with so much zeal.   Silent Disco was an all-new experience for Chennai music lovers as they grooved to the numbers, listening to them through headphones. That wasn’t it for the day. The best ones were saved for the last as Naveen Richard took the audience on a laugh riot with his stand-up act, later in the day, and this was followed by performances of winners of the online EDM Mashup Contest, Polish DJ Nina Suerte and the Swedish sensation AronChupa. Each of them gave an unforgettable EDM night for the audience. Saarang 2018 is presented by The Times of India.
