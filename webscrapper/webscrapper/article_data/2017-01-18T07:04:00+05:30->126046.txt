CHANDIGARH: In a strange coincidence,   chief Captain   filed his nomination papers from Patiala assembly constituency on a day when he was to appear for a hearing before a Ludhiana court in the   (I-T) case regarding his alleged Swiss bank accounts.

 Amarinder in his affidavit filed before the Election Commission on Tuesday disclosed that the court hearing in the case was also scheduled on the same day. A candidate is required to reveal all cases of inquiries pending or FIRs registered against him in the affidavit. However, Amarinder did not appear before the court on Tuesday as he got relief from the judge.
 
 “As reported in the media, the income tax department has filed a criminal complaint dated December 2, 2016 under section 277 of the income tax, 1961 under section 277 of the Income Tax Act, titled I-T Department vs Amarinder Singh, in the court of Japinder Singh, PCS, chief judicial magistrate, Ludhiana and is fixed for January 17, 2017,” his affidavit disclosed.
 
 According to the affidavit, Amarinder’s posh   is now worth Rs 35 crore. The palace has apparently lost half its value since 2014 when the ex-CM was contesting the Lok Sabha polls and has declared it worth Rs 71.3 crore. However, the value was Rs 35 crore in 2012 affidavit. Amarinder also owns a Dubai flat worth Rs 80 lakh and a farmhouse in Kandiali, Shimla, worth Rs 2.06 crore.
 
 He has a total immoveable assets, including agricultural, commercial and residential properties across Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand and UAE, worth Rs 40.6 crore. His wife Preneet Kaur owns properties worth Rs 1.66 crore.
 
 Amarinder's immoveable assets, including 3.9 kg gold and cash in bank accounts, are worth Rs 3.25 crore while that of Kaur Rs 2.79 crore.
 
 The couple has shown jewellery including stones and studs of gold and diamond worth Rs 1.1 crore. Amarinder has a Toyota Fortuner and Toyota Innova while Kaur has a Toyota Innova. All put together, the couple is worth 49.82 crore.
