MUMBAI: An FIR has been lodged against an unknown drunken person for stabbing a   with a knife at Juhu. Animal rights NGO, Plant and Animals Welfarre Society ( ) has lodged the FIR at   station on Wednesday after receiving information that a drunken man had stabbed a dog at Ekta Chawl, Nehru Nagar, Vile Parle (west) on Tuesday evening.

 ``While at present, the FIR has been lodged against an unknown person, we have now come to know the identity of the accused and have accordingly informed the police about it for further action.

 Due to the knife attack, the dog got three injuries on his thigh and abdomen areas, and is being medically treated.
 Subramiam also informed that they have gathered that the name of the accused person is Shakti Muthu Devan. ``We are demanding strict police action against this cruel, drunken man, so that it serves a lesson for all not to harm mute animals,'' he added.
