That   is drop-dead handsome is old news. The actor, who was sported an oh-so-hot bearded look for  's Chaya o Chobi where he's paired opposite  , uploaded a picture with his director and captioned it "As promised to 
  "its" gone..feeling lighter but missing the 3 months long relationship too.."

  
  
  
 Fans were quick to retort...
 One wrote, "long term relationships r durable too! So getting back to 'em (aka, it) would be a good idea actually! " Another wrote, "So long... Until the next bearded or moustached role.."
 
 For the uninitiated, Abir had been sporting the bearded look for over 3 months and fans grew quite fond of it. His mustached look in   (2016) was also received well by fans. Now that, the beard is gone, the actor is feeling lighter, nonetheless, hotter! A little birdie tells us, Abir loves the beaded look because it's freeing and it's so much easier to not shave during winter months when he was shooting in Darjeeling. 
 
 We leave the decision to his fans! Which look do you like better?
