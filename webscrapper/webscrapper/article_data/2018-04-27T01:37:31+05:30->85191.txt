NEW DELHI:   on Thursday said the time had come for the judiciary to take a united stand against the BJP-led government's bid to pick and choose judges for elevation to the   and high courts, as it criticised the Centre's decision to return the  's recommendation to elevate Uttarakhand HC Chief Justice K M Joseph to the apex court.

 
 In 2016, a bench headed by Justice Joseph had overturned central rule imposed in Uttarakhand, embarrassing the Modi government. The HC had also upheld the disqualification of Congress MLAs who were bent on voting against the then government in a trust motion.
 
 Senior Congress lawyers   and Vivek Tankha dared the Centre to say outright that it would not appoint Justice Joseph to the top court instead of resorting to "spurious, ill-thought" arguments.
 
 Former Union minister P Chidambaram suggested motive to the government stand by tweeting, "What is holding up Justice K M Joseph's appointment? His state or his religion or his judgment in the Uttarakhand case?"
 
 In the backdrop of the opposition-BJP tussle over the removal motion against Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra, tempers flared on Thursday as Congress cited the government decision on Justice Joseph four months after the collegium's decision to claim vindication of its charge that "judiciary's independence was under threat".
 
 "Why should they (government) have waited for four months? Why has the judiciary not insisted that their recommendation should be accepted... The intent of the government is clear â€” if they do not like you, they will not appoint you," Sibal said.
