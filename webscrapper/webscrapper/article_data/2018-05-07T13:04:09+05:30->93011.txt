PUNE:   across   have commenced with a   demanding apt minimum support price (MSP) for milk. 

 
 For now, the farmers have decided to distribute milk for free, between May 3 and May 9, but if their demand is not met, they have threatened to stop supplying milk to the big cities, a release issued by  , national president of the Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha said. 
 
 Nine districts including Pune are participating in the protest.
 
 While the state has already fixed MSP for milk at Rs 27 per litre after similar protests in 2017, the farmers under the   said they were being short-changed by the wholesalers. The government sets the MSP to ensure a minimum profit for farmers.
 
 Devle, who heads the organisation and is also the state secretary of Left-affiliated Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha, slammed the BJP government over its failure to intervene and prevent the falling procurement price of milk.
 
 The organisation stated that the government declared the MSP around eight months ago, but farmers are still getting Rs 17 and incurring losses. "We have started this agitation and it has been successful,” he said.
 
 Devle said the farmers are, for now, distributing milk for free only in Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Pune, Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, Solapur and Parbhani districts. Devle was one of the organisers of the 2017 farmers’ strike, and the Long March by cultivators from Nasik to Mumbai in March this year.
 
 In June last year, dairy farmers poured thousands of litres of milk on the streets across the state, to protest against the Maharashtra government for not fixing procurement rates. The government said it was working out a mechanism to ensure farmers get the MSP.
 
 State animal husbandry minister Mahadev Jankar had issued a statement that he was helpless against private milk processing units as the 2003 rules had given them a free hand and nearly 60 per cent of them are private dairies.
