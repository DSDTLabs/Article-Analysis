NEW DELHI:   ( ) chief   was on Wednesday   by a special court to face trial in an alleged case of irregularities in appointments to the women’s rights panel.

 “I am of the opinion that there is sufficient material and evidence to take cognizance of offences under sections 13(1)(d) and 13(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act,” said special judge  .
 
 According to the prosecution, investigation carried out by ACB revealed that Maliwal, in connivance with others, abused her official position and deliberately ignored the procedure laid down in general finance rules and other rules to employ the associates and party workers beyond the authorised sanctioned strength of 26 posts, causing unauthorised benefits to them at the cost of the public exchequer. Further, ACB said its investigation also reflected that the appointments were made without inviting any applications by way of publication or constituting a selection board. 
 
 ACB informed the court that its investigation revealed that the remuneration amount was hiked in a “whimsical manner” thereby granting undue pecuniary benefits to close associates of   and those connected to AAP. 
 
 “However, from the material placed on record, it appears that the probe has not identified the other associates of Maliwal in whose connivance the illegal practices were adopted. It would be, therefore, in the interest of justice that the investigating officer (IO) be directed to investigate the matter further and identify the associates/aides of Maliwal who had connived with her,” the court said.
 
 Reacting to the summons, Maliwal said: “The first chairperson (of DCW) managed one case in eight years while we handled12,000 in one year.. Is working corruption? I have become an accused while fighting the system...”
