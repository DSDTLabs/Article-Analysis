Veteran actors   and   have a new mission at hand.   has roped in the husband-wife duo as the special ambassadors for ‘Swachh Coimbatore’ mission. The city corporation recently launched a website and logo for the mission at an event in Coimbatore, in which the actors took part and spoke about the importance of cleanliness.

 An excited   told us, “I am proud to be the ambassador of this mission as I strongly advocate the concept of cleanliness. The best way to spread this message across is to start small — by keeping our house clean and teaching our children about the benefits of cleanliness. It’s important to tell people to throw garbage in dustbins and not on the road. While commuting on the highway, I have seen people opening their car windows and throwing out trash. After all, no one will know who threw it on the road. But trash piles up and it can lead to a lot of health issues, too. If everyone starts following these simple steps like not littering the road, others will follow suit. It’s time we start being responsible so that the next generation will not have to face what we had to.”
 
 Bhagyaraj narrated his experiences shooting in countries like   and France at the event, and spoke about how clean the places were. “We need to learn certain things from them, like the emphasis they lay on hygiene. The concept of cleanliness should be embraced by all of us; and it should be from our heart, and not just because we are asked, advised or threatened to keep the premises clean. And, before I start asking others to be clean, I have to be clean and responsible.”
