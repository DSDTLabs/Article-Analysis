PUNE: The Pune investigation team of the income   department has found that six cooperative banks in six cities of the state did not disclose deposits as mandated. 

 An inspection revealed that Rs1,000 crore of cash deposits were under-reported by these banks in Pune, Aurangabad, Ahmednagar, Kolhapur, Nashik and Thane from March 2014. About Rs300 crore of this amount was announced after demonetisation.
 
 Banks are required to report cash deposits of Rs12.5 lakh and above in current accounts and Rs2 lakh and above in accounts like savings bank accounts and fixed deposits. The department did not reveal the names of the banks.
 
 “In the Pune region (including the western and southern parts of the state, excluding Mumbai), there were 350 banks — most of them cooperative banks — whose accounts were looked into. So far, we have found six banks which did not report the deposits properly,” a senior tax official involved with the investigation, said.
 
 The official said, in one case alone, almost all of Rs265 crore was found to be undisclosed after November 8, 2016.
 
 “They have been asked to revise their returns and we shall impose a penalty on such banks,” he said.
 
 Although large sums of money have come back to the banks, the tax department is having a hard time to distinguish between legal bank deposits and illegal money.
 
 Rs5,000 crore windfall under PMGKY?
 
 A senior income tax official told TOI that about Rs10,000 crore have been declared under the Pradhan Mantri   (PMGKY). This will translate into a tax gain of only Rs5,000 crore (at 50% flat tax rate under the scheme). The scheme closes on March 31, 2017 and is applicable to those who make a voluntary disclosure of unaccounted income. About Rs2,500 crore (at 25%) of this Rs10,000 crore will be kept in a separate bank account and will be returned to the assessee after four years, without interest. The balance can be taken home by the assessee.
