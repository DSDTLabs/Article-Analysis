KOLHAPUR: Due to a   in the   (RTE) admission web portal on Monday, many parents had to return home without getting their registrations done.

 Subhash Chougule, Primary education officer, Kolhapur, said, “The   (NIC) is resolving the technical problem which might take a day or two. The office will be operating from Wednesday onwards.”
 
 He added, “Due to uncertain technical problems, we could not begin the registration process from February 5. We will make sure that parents are able to register without any problem from Wednesday onwards.”
 
 “Despite extending the deadline of registration for schools, there were schools who did not register themselves. Their deadline was extended twice from January 16 to February 3 and then February 5. However, we are sure that once the situation will be back to normal, parents in huge number will register their wards online,” said Chougule.
 
 According to Chougule, as many as 326 schools were identified to be registered in the academic year 2017-18. However, only 306 schools have registered themselves by February 3.
 
 Chougule said, “After our officers carried out inspections at schools, five schools were ruled out from the admission process, as they were closed down. The remaining 15 schools were asked to fill their registration forms by February 4. As far as eligible schools which have registered themselves, we are hoping to get a better response this year.”
 
 Chougule mentioned that if designated schools do not turn up to register for the   process, in that case, the school will be de-recognised immediately.
 
 Adding to the information on seat quota, Chougule, said, “The number of seats for this year is yet to be finalised. Once our department will receive a clear idea, we will announce them in public domain.”
