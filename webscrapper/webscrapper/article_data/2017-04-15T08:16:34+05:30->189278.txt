PUNE: The   has initiated a full-fledged   campaign on the recent   along highways because it is feared to affect over one million jobs in the country.

 The association contended that while drunk driving is a menace and offenders should be strictly punished, connecting it with hotels was “untenable” and “unfair”.
 
 “We shall convey a few facts through the social media. The facts to be considered are alcoholism is a disease and a social evil; drunk driving is a crime and hotels and restaurants serve alcohol. What is of significance is that these facts are not co-related. The compulsive alcoholics will find ways and means for consuming alcohol and will continue to drive after drinking. Banning hotels from serving liquor cannot be a solution for ending the menace of drunk driving,” said Dilip Datwani, president, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI).
 
 HRAWI will run a series of hashtags on   explaining some of the common misconceptions.
 
 “Most of the affected hotels cater to city residents and not inter-state drivers. We are legally licensed establishments that contribute to the nation’s GDP and have played a pivotal role in the growth of the nation’s tourism. With a single stroke, the industry has been crippled. HRAWI has always promoted responsible drinking,” said Kamlesh Barot, past president,   and Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI).
 
 The digital media campaign organised by HRAWI will focus on taglines such as “Penalize Drunk Driving, Not People”, “Save Night Life, Save Tourism” and “Save Hotels, Save Jobs” among others.
