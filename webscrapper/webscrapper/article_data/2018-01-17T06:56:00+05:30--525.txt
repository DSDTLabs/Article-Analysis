Kolkata: All Bengal Minority Youth Federation and the committee of imams in West Bengal said on Tuesday they do not need special “favours” from the Centre and state governments. 

 They want the governments to revise rents of the 40,000-odd Wakf estates spread over Bengal so that Wakf Board can take care of imams and muezzins. 
 
 The speakers, though, addressed the audience on a dais set in white and blue — a mix that is to the liking of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee.
 
 “The monthly honorarium of Rs 1,000 to imams is of little value at current market prices. Instead, let governments update the rents of the Wakf estates. The Wakf Board can then take care of the imams and muezzins on its own,” said federation general secretary Kamaruzzaman. 
 
 “The government pays a paltry sum of Rs 600 as yearly rent for the Wakf property on which the West Bengal assembly stands now. The Union government had passed a bill for revision of rent of Wakf pr-operties when Indira Gandhi was Prime Minister. None of the states has enforced the bill,” the federation general secretary said. 
 
 The body doesn’t want “subsidy” for Haj pilgrims from the Narendra Modi government either. 
 
 “Most of the subsidy is spent to maintain Haj offices in states. The government also takes higher charges for organising flights by Air India. Private carriers take pilgrims at a much lower price. We would urge the Centre to leave this service in private hands. Haj pilgrims can go without subsidy,” Kamaruzzaman said.
