PUNE: The civic administration will hold a crucial meeting with the   board ( ) on Wednesday to discuss authorisation for the new garbage processing units proposed in the city.

 The   is already facing a tough task in dealing with daily garbage with ongoing impasse over dumping of trash at   depot.
 
 Villagers of Uruli and Phursungi have been opposing garbage dumping for the last 15 days, claiming that the state government and PMC have failed to keep promises to stop dumping of garbage there.
 
 While the administration has claimed that it has been processing over 1050 tonnes of garbage every day at the processing units, sources in the administration have said that more plants were needed to ensure 100% processing of the city’s garbage.
 
 A PMC official said that 48 processing units have been proposed in the city to scale up the capacity. The proposal has been sent to MPCB for authorisation in November 2016. The meeting will discuss the proposals and the issue of authorisation. The MPCB is likely to grant permission to the proposed units, the official said.
 
 Besides authorisation for new units, the civic administration is likely to seek MPCB’s nod for dumping of garbage at Uruli site. The civic administration will submit various steps it has taken till now to deal with the garbage issue, including its proposal to set up a processing plant of 750 tonne at Uruli to stop open dumping.
 
 “We are hoping some positive outcome from the meeting with MPCB, especially on authorisation of new processing plants,” said an official.
