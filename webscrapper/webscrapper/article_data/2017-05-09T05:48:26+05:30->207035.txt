NEW DELHI: Incumbent   chief ministers will be the party’s faces in   in the next two years before the 2019 general elections as the top brass has ruled out the possibility of any leadership change.

  and Himachal Pradesh will witness assembly polls later this year, whereas four prominent states — Karnataka, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and   — will go to polls next year.
 
 “Vijay Rupani is the chief minister and the party will contest assembly polls under him,” a senior BJP functionary said recently on the possibility of any leadership change in the home state of PM Modi and BJP president  .“We have not discussed changing leadership in any state. The current chief ministers will be the party faces in state polls, obviously with the PM and the successful central schemes as the main poll plank even in states,” the functionary said.
 
 Party sources claimed that   (Madhya Pradesh), Raman Singh (Chhattisgarh) and Vasundhara Raje (Rajasthan) would be projected as party faces in state polls.
 
 There have not been any murmurs against Chouhan or Raman Singh but a section in BJP has been lobbying against Raje. In Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh, where the Congress is in power, BJP may avoid announcing a chief ministerial candidate as it did in recent assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. “Prime minister has gained countrywide popularity, he is the best face to be projected.
 
 But in case of an incumbent chief minister, we can’t take away the credit,” a party leader said.
 
 Party sources said senior leader B S Yeddyurappa and Union minister Jaiprakash Nadda will play key roles in Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh respectively but they will not be formally announced as chief ministerial candidates.
 
 In Jharkhand, there were reports about MLAs lobbying against CM Raghubar Das, citing the party’s recent defeat in the Littipara assembly bypoll.
