 Sources in the BJP claimed that Bhardwaj was very close to CM Rupani and he takes all the decision for  . “Whatever he says has to be followed by the mayor and commissioner,” sources added.
 
 Rajkot mayor Jaiman Upadhyay said, “There is opposition from local residents against the night market on Dastur Marg and we fear it will create major traffic problem. So, we may develop night market on the outskirts of the city.”
 
 According to sources, members of a few big commercial complexes have made representation before BJP rulers against the night market project on Dastur Marg. 
 
 When asked, RMC commissioner Banchha Nidhi Pani, who had announced the night market project, said, “We are looking for alternate place because there is no sufficient parking space. We won’t be able to accommodate enough people. So, we are searching for other location in consultation with police.”
