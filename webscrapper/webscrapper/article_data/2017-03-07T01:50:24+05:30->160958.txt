NEW DELHI: Chief minister   has been summoned as an accused in a criminal defamation case filed by Rajya Sabha MP  .

 In a complaint filed on November 17, 2016, Chandra said that while addressing a press conference on November 11, Kejriwal had made “false, fabricated and defamatory allegations” against him in relation to demonetisation.
 
 The complaint “does satisfy the essential ingredients of Section 499/500 (defamation) of IPC. Since the accused spoke/made such imputations in front of the national television...thus has clearly published the said imputations...intending to harm the reputation of the complainant,” said metropolitan magistrate Snigdha Sarvaria. “There is sufficient material on record to summon Kejriwal for the offences under Section 500 of IPC,” the court said. 
 
 The allegations were made without any basis, the complaint claimed. Chandra’s lawyer,  , argued despite having reasons to believe that such imputations would harm the reputation of the complainant, Kejriwal “defamed” him.
