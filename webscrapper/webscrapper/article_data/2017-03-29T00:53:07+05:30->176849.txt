NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party on Tuesday said it was finalising its list of star campaigners who would likely address more than 1,000 ward sabhas in the coming week. AAP plans to step up its campaign, starting with the first public meeting of chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal from Burari on March 31. 

 Ashish Talwar, AAP’s Delhi in-charge, said: “Our campaign strategy is Delhi-centric: we know that the people of Delhi want to hear about solutions for Delhi’s problems from leaders of Delhi. Since corporation elections are highly localised, we will hold ward-wise meetings.”
 
 Talwar added: “Our campaign has already begun. AAP members, including deputy CM Manish Sisodia, senior functionary Sanjay Singh, Delhi convener Dilip Pandey, MLAs Rakhi Bidlan, Rajendra Gautam and others, have begun campaigning. CM Arvind Kejriwal will begin his campaign from Burari on March 31.” 
 
 AAP is expected to finalise and share the names of its star campaigners in a day or two. Kejriwal’s first public meeting in Burari will be critical as it will set the pitch for the campaign in the days ahead.
 
 Forming roughly a third of Delhi's total electorate, Poorvanchalis will play an important role in the elections. It is in this backdrop that Kejriwal will kickstart his campaigning from Burari, a constituency with a high percentage of Poorvanchali settlers.
 
 Since the 2015 assembly elections, AAP has enjoyed the support of Poorvanchalis, largely residing in JJ and unauthorised colonies. This time, there are other claimants to this segment, including JD(U), which is contesting all the 272 seats, and BJP, which is headed by Manoj Tiwari, a Poorvanchali himself. In fact, AAP leaders claim Tiwari was brought in precisely because BJP perceived their party as a threat. 
 
 “Poorvanchalis have supported the anti-corruption movement right from the beginning. The party also has the highest representation of Poorvanchalis,” said AAP’s Ashish Talwar.
