INDORE: Two of the 13   activists,   and Shami, who were arrested in Indore in 2008 were tried and were awarded five yearsâ€™ prison sentence for their involvement in terror activities in September 2012.

 They were among the six people who were tried in 2011-12. Others were Baliuddin, Mukimuddin,   and Nafesar.
 
 Balliuddin and Mukimuddin were arrested from Hyderabad and were accused of providing CDs and pendrives to Safdar Nagori. They were acquitted by the court due to lack of evidence.

They were caught based on information provided by Safdar, Kamruddin and Amil Parvez.
