The video grab shows that   arguing with Chaudhary to leave the place saying ‘App bhi bahar niklo yaha se (you should also leave). A moment later, amidst the heated argument, Devnani pushed him. Chaudhary was then gheroed by a group of people who appeared to be BJP supporters.

 Defending his move, Devnani said that while at the polling booth, I was greeting voters and some mediapersons who had come for the interview. “I was out of the polling booth giving bite to the media which was objected by the Congressman.

 TOI called up Chaudharu but was not available for the comment. However, Congress spokesperson Muzaffar Bharti said that the video grab clearly shows that minister is misbehaving our party worker. “Such a behaviour is not acceptable from a person who is holding a high constitutional post,’’ he added.
