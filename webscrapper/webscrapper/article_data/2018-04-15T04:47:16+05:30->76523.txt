NAVI MUMBAI: A marine survey firm will start digging work at two sites of the   creek bed on Tuesday to look for evidence in the murder case of assistant police inspector Ashwini Bidre-Gore. 

 Belapur-based   has zeroed down on the two locations where a gradiometer indicated presence of heavy metal objects. 
 
 A crime branch officer said, "The firm has confirmed presence of metallic objects at nine spots. Only two of them, located under the bridge within a diameter of 15 ft, seem to have heavy metallic objects. Weight plates were tied to Bidre-Gore's body parts, which were packed in a gunny bag and dumped in the creek."
 
 The officer said, "The other seven spots do not have many metal objects, hence they will be dug up later if required. It is not possible to say how deep we will have to dig in the creek bed."
