Surat: Thousands of runners from the Diamond City and towns across the country will participate in Surat Marathon-2018 to be organized on February 10.

 Chief minister Vijay Rupani will flag off the Surat Marathon from Raghuveer Party Plot on University Road on February 10. 
 
 The marathon, which is being organized by Surat Future Foundation (SFF) as a ‘Run for New India’, will have three categories - 21km, 10km and 5km run. For the first time, brand ambassadors had been appointed across the country for getting maximum registrations for the marathon. 
 
 Dr Pranav Desai of SFF said, “Last year we had organized Surat Marathon on the theme of ‘Run for Tapi’ to create awareness about cleanliness of river Tapi. Immediately after the marathon, Gujarat government allocated Rs 980 crore for Tapi cleanliness project. This time around we have organized the marathon on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘New India’ mission. Hope this marathon, too, will be a successful event.”
 
 Dr Desai said that for the first time the marathon will be an entertainment marathon for the runners. Delhi’s popular Mungfali Band artists have been invited to give live performance during the marathon.
