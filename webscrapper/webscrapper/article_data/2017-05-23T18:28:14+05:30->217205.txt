MUMBAI: A   man who had swallowed 12   and concealed six more in his rectum was caught at city   on Saturday. The accused,  , was taken to R N Cooper Hospital where doctors took over 48 hours to retreive all 18 gold pieces weighing a total 505gm and worth Rs 14.9 lakh. 

 Customs officials said drug smugglers often try to smuggle in contraband concealed in capsules by swallowing them, but it is rare for a carrier to try to smuggle in gold in this manner. 
 
 Customs officials said they intercepted Mohammed Ibrahim on suspicion after he arrived from Colombo as he frequently visited Mumbai. He was made to walk through a metal detector and it went off. Ibrahim admitted to concealing six gold pieces in his rectum and the officials told him to extract them. On a suspicion, they made him pass through the metal detector again and it went off. When the officials found nothing on his body, they questioned him and he confessed to having swallowed 12 pieces of gold.
 
 
 
 
 On the advice of the airport doctor, the Customs officials took Ibrahim to R N Cooper Hospital, where he was administered medicine to flush out the gold. The officials recorded his statement before admitting him to hospital as the process was risky and could have been fatal. 
 
 Ibrahim told the officials that a man named Ravi had given him the 18 gold pieces in Colombo and told him to call him after reaching Mumbai. He was promised Rs 10,000 to deliver the gold pieces to an unidentified person in Bhendi Bazaar.
 
 Ibrahim was booked forattempting to smuggle in gold and later released after Customs officials recorded his statement.
