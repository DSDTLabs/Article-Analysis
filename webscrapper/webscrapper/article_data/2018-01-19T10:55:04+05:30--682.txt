NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has carried out a ‘forensic   examination’, a relatively new mode of investigation, on Congress MP   and four of his associates in the death of  . Earlier, Delhi Police had conducted a lie-detector test on Tharoor’s aides.

 While sources confirmed that the tests were conducted between December 2017 and January at CBI’s central forensic science laboratory in Lodhi Colony, senior officers remained tight-lipped on the issue. Police are examining the results of the test. CBI has a forensic psychology wing to help in investigations.
 
 Forensic psychology is an emerging field now being used in some developed countries. It forms an integral part of criminal investigation, prison and profiling systems. A specialist applies psychological skills and matches the results with evidence for use in investigations. The investigator relies on third party information to determine the mental condition of the suspect at the time of crime.
 
 This tech was used on suspects in the murders of poetess Madhumita Shukla and Aarushi as well as the Nithari killings.
 
 In September, Delhi Police got eight more weeks from the high court to probe Pushkar’s death. A bench of Justices G S Sistani and Chander Shekhar had expressed anguish that even after three years the police investigation was still dragging on. HC reminded police that Pushkar’s son, Shiv Menon, is a party to the case. “He is a blood relation. He wants to know. His concern should be of paramount importance,” the bench said.
 
 In response, additional solicitor general Sanjay Jain told the court that police have investigated every possible angle, so the investigators want to explore the new methodology of forensic psychology.
 
 Pushkar was found dead in suite number 345 of Leela hotel in south Delhi on January 17, 2014. The suite was sealed that night itself for investigation and de-sealed last month. An FIR under IPC Section 302 (murder) was registered on January 1, 2015 against unknown persons.
