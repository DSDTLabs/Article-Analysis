PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Amidst high drama, the resolution to hike   was approved along with a supplementary proposal by   mayor Nitin Kalje. 
 
 Earlier,   corporator Vilas Madigeri had tabled a supplementary proposal for changes in the proposed water tax hike. As per the proposal, each family will get up to 6,000 litre of free drinking water. Water consumed in the range of 6,001 to 22,500 litre will be charged at Rs4/1,000 litre, while consumption in the range of 22,501 to 30,000 litre will be charged at Rs8 per/1,000 litre. Consumption above 30,000 litre will command Rs12 per/1,000 litre. Also, a minimum of Rs100 will be charged from each flat/family. 
  
 Though most BJP corporators approved of it Sandeep Kaspate and Tushar Kamthe expressed concerns. Opposition leader Yogesh Behl, NCP corporators Mangala Kadam and Bhausaheb Bhoir, Rahul Kalate, group leader of Shiv Sena corporators, and MNS corporator   wanted it to be cancelled. 
  
 Things heated up when two woman corporators — NCP’s Vinaya Tapkir and BJP’s Suvarna Borude — started a verbal duel over the proposal. After repeated attempts to pacify and warn them failed, the mayor announced that the resolution had been approved along with a supplementary proposal, even without asking the House if the supplementary proposal was approved. This angered the opposition and corporators from NCP, Shiv Sena and MNS rushed into the Well. While some tried to snatch the mayoral mace, others raised slogans against BJP, forcing the mayor to adjourn for 10 minutes. Later, the opposition demanded a vote on the proposal, but the mayor refused. The opposition then staged a walkout.
