NEW DELHI: Lieutenant governor Anil   has approved implementation of 7th   recommendations in Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), which is set to benefit 30,000 employees of the corporation.

 “Approved the proposal for implementing 7th Central Pay Commission in DTC. Urge DTC employees to make bus transport in Delhi the best,” Baijal tweeted on Wednesday.
 
 The move is expected to benefit DTC employees across categories and amounts to an average hike of about 25%. The fact that DTC was not making profits was one of the reasons delaying the implementation of the recommendations. Another roadblock was the rules governing the corporation. Though DTC is under the purview of the Delhi government, it is governed by central government rules.
