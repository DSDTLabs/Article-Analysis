 I feel it is necessary for students to understand that these results which they are about to receive is not the ultimate results in their lives. Life gives us   at every stage and students need to prepare for those challenges and those exams. Generally students think and rethink over what they have written in their answer sheets and get worried about whether it was correct or not.
 
 At such a time, when this suspense is about to take over for them, they need to be patient, keep calm and accept whatever result they have received. Children must keep in mind that they will soon in the next class where they can rework on subjects. A poor result does not mean failure in life.
 
 To parents as well, I suggest they do not shout at their children and must stand by their side in this testing time. Children have a very sensitive mind. Parents might scold them and forget, but children carry such reprimands in their hearts for a long time.
 
 Students too must divert their attention by doing something that interests them and should help their parents with household chores. Students can also write how they feel or go out with their parents on vacations to deal with stress.
 
 I advise students to relax by going for walks or spending time playing their favorite sports or video games.
