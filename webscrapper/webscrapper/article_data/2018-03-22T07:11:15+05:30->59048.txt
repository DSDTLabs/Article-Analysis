GANDHINAGAR: Satyanarayansinh Shivsinh Rathore (62),   of   (SSNNL), known as the “highway and canal man of Gujarat” received his   award from President of India Ramnath Kovind at a ceremony at the Rashtrapati Bhavan on Wednesday.

 The low profile former additional chief secretary (ACS) of the roads and buildings department of the Gujarat government, is credited with the development of the state’s excellent road network, especially the national and major state highways.
 
 Rathore introduced the BOT (Build Operate and Transfer) road development model in Gujarat, then a first in India. He also brought World Bank investments to the state’s road network project.
 
 Rathod, who joined the Gujarat service of engineers rose to the level of the principal secretary and was given a rare ACS promotion, before his retirement.
 
 His engineering and managerial expertise led to Rathore being appointed CMD of SSNNL, to complete the challenging Sardar Sarovar dam, canal network and Statue of Unity projects. Rathore not only completed the dam project before time but managed to complete 26,000km of canal work in the last three years. He is also leading the team for the Statue of Unity project, considered an engineering marvel. This project will likely be completed by March 2019. Rathore is also vice president of the World Federation of Engineering Organization, a former president of the Indian Road Congress and the Institute of Engineers, India.
