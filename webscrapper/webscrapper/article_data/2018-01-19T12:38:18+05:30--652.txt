MADURAI: Tension prevailed in   in Madurai as unidentified people damaged a name plaque on a 100-foot-tall flagpole which was installed in November to celebrate the retrieval of   party symbol.

 Chief minister   had inaugurated the flagpole by hoisting the party flag on it. However, the absence of deputy chief minister O   in this important party event and also the omission of his name on the name plate installed in the flag pole had sparked a controversy then.
 
 Apparently, a name plaque having the name of   was also installed on one side of the post on the same day, putting an end to the rumours that there was a rift between the two leaders.
 
 On Thursday morning, it was discovered that the plaque containing the deputy chief ministerâ€™s name had been smashed and broken into pieces while that with the photograph and name of the chief minister remained untouched.
 
 Empty bottles of liquor were also found strewn around the flag mast. The Austinpatti police registered a case and are investigating.
