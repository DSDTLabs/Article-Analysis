CHANDIGARH: A Panipat branch of a finance company was robbed of gold and silver jewellery worth Rs 2 crore and Rs 2.5 lakh in cash in a daring   on Monday morning.

 The robbery occurred within minutes of the manager, identified as  , and accountant   (who uses one name only), opening their office for the day. The branch did not have a security guard for the past two years and the office cleaner was sweeping the floor at the time.
 
 Three masked youths, speaking Haryanvi and Punjabi, barged into the office at 10 am. They first took the three employees of the firm hostage and snatched keys of the strong room. After locking up the employees in one room, the robbers made an attempt to open the strong room.
 
 “Soon after entering office, they asked for the keys of the strong room. As we resisted, they slapped me and other employees, dragged us to a room and threatened to kills us,” the accountant told the police.
 
 As they could not open the strong room, the robbers forced the manager to open it and escaped with all the jewellery and cash.
 
 Acting on a complaint, the Panipat police started its investigation after registering a case at   police station. The robbers also escaped with the DVRs of the   cameras and this has added to the police’s problems.
 
 DSP City Jagdeep Doon, who was at the crime spot, said an investigation is going on and a team of cyber-crime unit and crime investigation agency has been set up to solve the crime.
 
 “The officials of the company are yet to quantify the loss after assessing their documents. Our teams are on the job and we are working on various theories. We are also trying to ascertain the route of the robbers with the help of CCTV footage on the nearby buildings,” said Doon.
 
 The branch, which opened in 2012, had validity for a transaction of Rs 2.82 crore. The branch was largely dealing with the loans against Gold and silver jewellery and would also take the cash deposits for the gold bonds.
