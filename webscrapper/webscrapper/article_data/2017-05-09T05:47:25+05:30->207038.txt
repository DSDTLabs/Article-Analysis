SRINAGAR: With Kashmir continuing to simmer amid student protests, CM   tried to shift the blame from lapses on the part of her government to the media saying it was unnecessarily exaggerating the security situation in the Valley.

 At the reopening of the civil secretariat here after a sixmonth shift to Jammu, the winter capital of the state,   said, “Electronic media shouldn’t show discussions that promote hatred against Kashmiris. Kashmir has seen worse in the 1990s. The situation will improve soon as every issue has a solution.”
 
 Kashmir’s security situation worsened in the past three weeks, with the onset of protests against the use of forces on agitating students. The clashes escalated after April 15, when cops raided a degree college in Pulwama, in which 17 students were injured. She asked the media to refrain from portraying “all Kashmiri youth as stone-pelters”.
 
 “The youth are angry and disillusioned. Some are being provoked. We should all work to resolve this situation,” she said. Clashes between students and forces were reported in Pulwama and Kupwara districts on Monday.
