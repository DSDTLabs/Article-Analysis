LONDON:   isn't looking very far ahead, but he isn't thinking retirement either.

 "Health has definitely a role to play in my decision-making. As I move forward, I'll be very cautious of how much I will play, how much I think is healthy," the 35-year-old said.
 
 "I always have continuous discussions with my wife about the family, about my kids. Is everybody happy on Tour? Are we happy to pack up and go on tour for five-six-seven weeks? Are we willing to do that?"   said.
 
 "For the time being, it seems like absolutely no problem, which is wonderful. Then success to some extent is also a key for staying out there. This tournament (Wimbledon), helps me to stay on tour longer hopefully."
 
 Federer added, "I haven't made decisions moving forward. Am I looking at the Tokyo Olympics? I haven't. Since the injury (last year), everything has been reset.
 
 "I'm planning till the end of the year, then I know what I'm going to play at the beginning of next year. It's just important to stay on track with the plan."
