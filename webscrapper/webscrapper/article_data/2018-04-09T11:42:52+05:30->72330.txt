MOHALI: In a bid to discourage the incidents of mass copying, the   (PSEB) is all set to introduce aadhar-based allotment of examination centres.   chairman Manohar Kant Kolahia said the decision was taken keeping in view the incidents of alleged mass copying at remote centres.

 While talking about the alleged malpractice, Kolahia said as per the reports the school students falling prey to the touts have been paying hefty amounts ranging between Rs 60,000 to Rs 80,000 for cheating at a particular examination centre.
 
 It has been discovered that students from as far as Ambala and Mohali opt for examination centres at remote villages like Tarantaran, Faridkot, Budlada, Bathinda. This is because these centres lure the students into mass copying and cheating and charge hefty amounts from them.
 
 Kolahia said,“To curb this practice, we have now decided to allot examinations centres to the students as per their aadhar card details. The examnination centres would be allotted nearest to the address mentioned on an aadhar card. This strategy will work out and we will be able to break the alleged nexus of criminals, which is involved in duping innocent children.”
 
 He added that the board has been receiving complaints about mass copying being held at such centres and a network of such criminals is so strong that they get prior information about the flying squad visiting such centres for checking.
 
 He said that while submitting applications, it will be mandatory for the students to attach a copy of their aadhar card.
