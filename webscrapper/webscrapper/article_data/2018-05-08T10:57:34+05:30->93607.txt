HYDERABAD: Asserting that the role of official committees and high-power expert committees and their reports are only advisory and are not binding on the government, the   dismissed a   (PIL) which wanted it to direct Andhra Pradesh to take up Rajoli reservoir project instead of   irrigation scheme in Kadapa district.

 A bench of Acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice K   was hearing the PIL filed by Kakumani   of Kadapa district who, citing an expert committee report that termed KPLC a waste project, wanted the court to direct the government to instead commence construction of Rajoli reservoir. “It is not the job of the court. In fact, it has no expertise to analyse as to which of the two projects will be beneficial to the people,” the bench said.
 
 
 According to Jayasree’s counsel, experts had opined that KPLC was a waste because a part of the project would be submerged.
