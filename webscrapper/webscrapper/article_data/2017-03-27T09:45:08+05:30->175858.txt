DHARAMSHALA: After a sparse opening day attendance that worried that  , officials wore a smile of relief as they glanced through the stands on Day 2 of the series-deciding Test here. The 22,000-capacity ground was half-full on Sunday.

 The HPCA Stadium and Kuldeep Yadav made contrasting Test debuts on Saturday. Where the chinaman spinner Yadav left a mark with his 4/68, the stadium almost drew a blank with only approximately 2,500 fans inside the venue. But being a Sunday and the prospect of watching Indians batting helped people overcome the early disappointment of not   not figuring in the action here.
 
 “This Sunday crowd is challenging what we have seen in the three one-day internationals at this venue. We have been able to fill half of the stadium today with 10,000-plus fans coming in,” HPCA spokesperson Sanjay Sharma told TOI.
 
 “Of course, it being a Sunday helps but we are doing our best to fill it, including inviting schools to bring their students on the remaining three days of this Test,” he added.
 
 Sharma's admission found agreement in the words of someone who has contributed in every international played at this picturesque cricket venue. Devraj, the man in charge of the big manual scorecard here for the past eight years, said the stadium has rarely had fans in each of its stands during ODIs.
 
 “We have had better crowds in T20 internationals and IPL, but today there are around 11,000 people in the stadium, which easily matches an ODI attendance here,” he said.
 
 “The pavilion terrace (main stand) has hardly had people in it during ODIs, but today it's fairly populated. Only the east and west stands are full during ODIs,” Devraj added.
