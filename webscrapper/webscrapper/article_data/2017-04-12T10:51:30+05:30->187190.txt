NAGPUR: Water pollution being caused by a hardware shop behind Priyadarshini Engineering College on Umred Road is playing havoc with the health of people of the locality.

 The   (NMC) on Monday served notice to Iqra Hardware and recovered a fine of Rs10,000 after finding pollutants being discharged by the firm in a nullah passing through the locality.
 
 Confirming this, NMC’s zonal officer (health department) DE   said that acting on a series of complaints, a team of NMC’s health department visited the area on Monday. “After we found some chemicals being dumped in the nullah, we fined the firm Rs10,000 under Section 33A of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974,” said the NMC official.
 
 Residents of the locality told TOI that the hardware store ran an acid manufacturing unit since the past few years without licence and this effluent flows from the store and gets collected in the nullah nearby. Contamination in nullah led to the death of a few dogs in the area and nearby trees had dried up, they said.
 
 Fed up with this problem, residents of the locality approached NMC’s health department. But after the department ignored their complaints, they informed the police control room. Police swung into action and this led the NMC’s health department to act.
 
 TOI visited the locality and found that the nullah flowing through the locality was filled with coloured water that emanates just at the start of the hardware shop. NMC’s health officer (sanitation) Dr   maintained that nobody was allowed to discharge effluents in the nullah. The hardware shop was closed when TOI visited the shop.
 
 Residents said it is just a tip of the iceberg as many small-scale units operating alongside the nullah release chemicals in the nullah.
