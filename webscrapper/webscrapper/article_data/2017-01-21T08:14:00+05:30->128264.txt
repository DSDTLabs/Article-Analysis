AHMEDABAD:   got the shock of her life when Sunil and Kanchan — the   who worked as domestic help at her home at Century Tower behind the   — turned on her and robbed her household with help from an unidentified youth, on Friday afternoon.

  
  
 
 According to her complaint to Vastrapur police, the trio decamped with cash, gold and silver ornaments and other valuables, all worth Rs 9.42 lakh. Police have got CCTV footage of the trio leaving the premises with a bag in hand in an auto rickshaw.
 
  According to Vastrapur police, Ashwini Gupta, a financial consultant and his wife Rashmi, hired the duo two months ago to do domestic work. On Friday, the duo apparently asked for some money in advance from her, which Rashmi refused, saying they had got some money only a few days ago.
 
 “When they asked for Rs 200, she agreed and went to her bedroom to get the money. Soon, Kanchan followed her despite her warning her not to. Meanwhile, Sunil allegedly opened the main door to allow a youth unknown to her to enter. When Rashmi began shouting for help, she was tied up and gagged with duct tape as the trio rummaged through her belongings and threw valuables into a trolley bag also taken from the house,” said a police official.
 
 Rashmi could free herself only at around 12.45, about half an hour after the trio had left. She approached her neighbours for help and they in turn informed city police.
 
 “CCTV footage of the parking lot shows an auto leaving with the duo. Thus, we suspect that the auto driver may have been the couple’s accomplice. It may have been a well-planned robbery, as they had brought the rickshaw into the parking area. We are yet to gather more information on the couple. Teams were sent to the railway station and bus stands to prevent them from leaving the city,” said a police official.
