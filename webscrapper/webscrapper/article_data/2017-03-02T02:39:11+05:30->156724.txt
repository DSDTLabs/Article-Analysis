Gurgaon: Rural areas of 14 districts of Haryana, including Gurgaon, have become   (ODF), but the Millennium City is yet to achieve the distinction. This was revealed at a nation-wide campaign to eradicate the problem — Swachh   — which was launched in the city on Wednesday.

 The 14 districts of Haryana include Panchkula, Sirsa, Karnal, Bhiwani, Fatehabad, Hisar, Charkhi, Dadri, Kurukshetra, Yamunanagar, Ambala, Jhajjar, Faridabad and Gurgaon. “By Haryana Day this year, all villages in the state will become ODF. We give credit to the women as the rural areas are ahead of urban areas in terms of ODF,” said OP Dhankhar, minister for development and panchayats, who appealed to the people neither to defecate in the open nor allow anyone to do so.
 
  Narendra Singh Tomar said participation of women is essential for making the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) a success because women constitute half of the population of the country and they are the ones who face maximum difficulties because of “gandgi” (dirt).
 
 The   was launched at Tau Devi Lal Stadium in Gurgaon, in which women sarpanches, Anganwadi workers, ASHA workers and members of women self-help groups from all six divisions participated.
