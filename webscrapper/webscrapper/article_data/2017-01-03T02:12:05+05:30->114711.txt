NEW DELHI: The first day of   began on Monday with parents finding a few   in the entire process. While some complained about   asking for the Aadhaar card of applicants, even though the directorate of education (DoE) directive mentioned only parents’ card was needed, others said that figuring out which schools accepted forms online and which did not was painstaking.

 Sumit Awasthi, a parent, told TOI that one of the schools in his area required an Aadhaar card of his child.“I was just looking at what all documents were required when I saw space for Aadhaar card number of my child in the form. I asked around to find out what to do next, but a while later the link to the form stopped working. Maybe somebody pointed it out to the school,” he said.
 
 Non-functional links were a problem for several parents applying online. A parent, who did not wish to be identified, said the link stopped working when he wanted to submit the form. 
 
 “I filled up the form, and wanted to submit it, but it kept saying ‘cannot submit form, inconvenience regretted’. Later I shot a mail to the school, and got it rectified,” said the parent.
 
 Meanwhile, parents were also confused about the online and offline distribution of forms in schools. They said they wasted time finding out which schools accepted forms online, because that information was not given out on one platform. 
 
 “If only the authorities could make a column on whether the process is offline or online, it would save parents a lot of time,” said   of admissionsnursery.com.
