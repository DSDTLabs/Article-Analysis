 9 will see a special guest this Friday (September 15) and it is none other than Sr. Bachchan's son,  . The game show will not only have Abhishek, but also his Pro Kabaddi team Jaipur Pink Panthers. 

 In the recently released promo of the episode, father-son duo can be seen having a fun time, with both pulling each other's leg. There is also a role reversal as   takes his father's place and puts him in the hot seat instead. 
 
  
  
 The trailer shows him introducing his father as a contestant from Mumbai, who is an actor. He funnily tells the audience if Mr. Bachchan wins a good amount, then he will give it to his son. Here, Mr. Bachchan interrupts and asks Abhishek as to who told him that. The witty person that he is, Abhishek promptly replies that he has been taught that whatever he has, belongs to him.
 
 
  Even though the superstar refuses to pay heed to his son's demand, the two are surely set to entertain the audience with their camaraderie. 
 
 The season 9 of Kaun Banega Crorepati will see celebrities but only to raise awareness or support a special cause. It will not see unnecessary film promotions on the show and rather welcome heroes from different walks of life.
