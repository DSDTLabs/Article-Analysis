VISAKHAPATNAM:  , a scheme to supply 40 litres of purified potable water to the poor at just Rs 4, seems to have failed to take off.

 As per the scheme, which was introduced in the city on October 2, 2014, people below poverty line will be given two cans of potable water each of 20 litre capacity for Rs 4. In the market a 20-litre can of potable water costs Rs 40 to Rs 50 per can.
 
 However, many non-eligible people are misusing the scheme. This apart, many water plants were also not working well due to poor maintenance. Sources attribute the misuse to several reasons such as lack of a monitoring authority and vigil at the bottling units, increasing demand for bottled and purified water, high prices of bottled water and lack of awareness among the public about NTR Sujala scheme.
 
 CPM state secretariat member Ch Narasinga   said many plants were not functioning well due to insufficient water supply caused by dry borewells.
 
 Speaking to TOI, P  , superintending engineer of department of water supply,  , said the department developed the infrastructure including the water plant and provided the water for purification. Maintenance is done by individuals or self-help groups (SHGs).
 
 “Till now, 23 plants were sanctioned to our department. Of them, 19 were completed and 17 were handed over to the societies,” Ananda Rao said.
 
 Rao said the GVMC also supplied water through taps in plants where borewater problem existed.
