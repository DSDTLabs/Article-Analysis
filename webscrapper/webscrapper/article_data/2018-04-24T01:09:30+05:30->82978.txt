Alwar: The farmers, who bring their produce to the government procurement centres, are being cheated by middleman not only in weighing but also in charging Rs 6 per quintal as labour charges. 

 This was found at a surprise inspection held at some of the mandis in Alwar district on Monday.
 
 Since the Food Corporation of India (FCI) officials are not present on the site, the middlemen having a field day. Additional director of Krishi Upaj Madi in Alwar, Vishnu Sharma, on Monday made a surprise visit to the mandi at Malakheda exposing the irregularities adopted by the middlemen employed by the contractors under FCI.
 
 On weighing a sacksful of wheat of about 50 kg, he had found differences in weighing in excess by over 400 grams. While directing the officials to initiate strict action against the people responsible, he also served notices to them.
 
 Farmers who came to the mandi to sell their wheat complained to Sharma that per  , 40 quintals of wheat is being procured and on an average 20 kg of wheat per farmers in excess of the weight is taken by the middlemen. They alleged that the employees of the contractors are unwilling to listen to any of the grievances of the farmers.
 
 The farmers said the unseasonal rain in the area had made the wheat brought to the mandi wet and farmers tried to make it dry and yet they had refused to accept the wheat. The farmers had threatened agitation if the contractors continued to harass them.
 
 “Where will we go? Despite the wheat is dry, the FCI officials are refusing to buy our produce. We have left with no other option except to go for agitation,” said Kaluram, one of the farmers.
 
 Vishnu Sharma said, “At many places surprise inspections were conducted on Monday. Most of the places irregularities in weighing and additional charges in the name of labour were found to be charged. He said those who were found guilty will not be spared.”
