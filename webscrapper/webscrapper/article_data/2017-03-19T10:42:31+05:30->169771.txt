VISAKHAPATNAM: Vizagiites are aware that Mudasarlova reservoir is one of the major drinking water resources of   (GVMC). But not many know that it is also a place visited by those who get transferred to various parts of the world.

 Security officers at the reservoir said people who get transferred from the city come to the reservoir to offer ornamental fishes.
 
 “People come with ornamental aquarium fish to release into the fresh reservoir water. The reservoir is home to many ornamental fishes apart from general fishes, which can be consumed by people,” a security officer of the reservoir told TOI.
 
 “Some fishes survive and some die. Mostly, the ornamental shark fish survive and frequently float to the corner of the reservoir to have food,” the officer said.
 
 A bank official, P  , who was transferred to Hyderabad, told TOI, “My colleague suggested I go to the reservoir to release ornamental fish from my aquarium. I don’t want to kill the fish or give to someone else. I wanted to free my fish. So I released a dozen ornamental beautiful fishes here.” 
 
 Rao’s wife Sri Lakshmi said, “We were attached to the fishes for the last two years. We will come back to Vizag to this reservoir to see our beloved fish.”
 
 Speaking to TOI, Dr VV Rao, Visakhapatnam district’s joint director for  , said not all ornamental fish survive in the fresh water lakes or reservoirs. The survival rate of such ornamental fish in the reservoirs is minimal.
 
 “My suggestion to the people is to give these aquariums to others as a gift or sell them instead of releasing them into the reservoirs or lakes," Rao said.
 
 Mudasarlova reservoir is located 13 kms away from the core city. This catchment is located between Kailasa Konda, Kambalakonda and Simhachalam hills. It was built in 1902 by the British regime. The catchment area of the reservoir is roughly 15 square kilomtres, according to GVMC officials..
