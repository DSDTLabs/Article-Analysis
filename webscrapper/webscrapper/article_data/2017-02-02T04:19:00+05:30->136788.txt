Reactions of political leaders to the budget presented by finance minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday were along party lines. So, if CM Devendra Fadnavis praised it as “historic”, state Congress chief Ashok Chavan termed it as “rain of empty announcements”. NCP leader and ex-minister Anil Deshmukh was charitable enough to concede two good things in the Jaitley budget — the first-ever move to infuse transparency in political funding and income tax relief given to salaried middle class. However, even he slammed the failure to provide loan waiver to farmers or the promised increase in farm incomes. The statement released by leader of opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil’s office relied so heavily on Bollywood that it called the budget “only for Raees” and described Jaitley as not “Kaabil” enough to do any good for the poor. It also predicted that in the ensuing election ‘Dangal’ the BJP would fall flat for its failures. “Excellently balanced budget with emphasis on rural development, poverty alleviation and encouragement to the common man and medium and small entrepreneur,” were the ecstatic remarks of BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Ajay Sancheti. He also hailed infrastructure status to affordable housing, huge outlay for highways and the railway safety fund. Congress leader Nitin Raut termed the budget as “visionless” and a “missed opportunity to provide reprieve to the people”.  BJP MLA Ashish Deshmukh found the budget proposals good enough to pave the way for ‘Acche Din.’ But NCP leader Salil Deshmukh termed the budget as ‘anti-poor.’
