PATNA: Bihar assembly Speaker   on Tuesday called upon the legislators to play an active and constructive role in achieving the standards under the United Nation’s 17-point sustainable development goals (SDGs) in the state.

 Introducing the main points of the SDGs during a special debate on the concluding day of the budget session in the assembly, Choudhary asked the legislators to rise above the party lines for the cause of development and give constructive suggestions on how to achieve the SDGs in a better way. 
 
 “You can play a pivotal role by ensuring constant monitoring of the state government’s schemes in people-oriented sectors like road, energy and health. An MLA can also play a crucial role by leading mass awareness campaign in his/her constituency for education, health and sanitation-related schemes,” Choudhary said. 
 
 The Speaker also said there were several welfare schemes which were directly linked to the standards of the SDGs.
 
 Participating in the debate, ruling coalition members Shyam Rajak, Ranju Geeta and Ashok Kumar Singh pointed out that schemes taken up under the ‘Saat Nischay’ (seven resolves) programme of the Bihar government were related to the SDGs. They lauded Bihar CM Nitish Kumar for launching those schemes.
 
 Responding on behalf of the state government, road construction minister Nand Kishore Yadav said the state’s NDA government would remain committed to achieving the standards under the SDGs. Yadav also called upon the MLAs to play an active role in achieving the standards.
