NEW DELHI: The former leader of opposition in North Delhi Municipal Corporation, Mukesh Goel, swept the Sarai Pipal Thala ward bypoll by defeating BJP candidate Mangat Ram Sharma by a margin of over 2,000 votes. In Maujpur ward in East Delhi Municipal Corporation, AAP’s Reshma defeated Congress candidate Rekha Sharma by 699 votes. The bypoll for Maujpur was held on May 14 and for Sarai Pipal Thala on May 21.

 The vote share of Congress in Sarai Pipal Thala ward was 46% with Goel getting over 10,000 votes.   had a vote share of 36% in Maujpur. BJP, however, failed to create any impact in both the wards despite having a majority in the three corporations.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Goel said, “BJP had roped in senior leaders, ministers, MP and MLAs to defeat me, but I won due to my hard work without any intervention from the top Congress leadership.”Sources said the veteran politician may soon join the north corporation standing committee and the current Congress member   from Bazar Sitaram may be asked to resign. Goel, however, refused to comment calling it an internal party matter.
 
 Maujpur witnessed a closer contest and during several rounds of counting the candidates were neck and neck. “At one point, we thought we may lose the election, but we finally managed to emerge victorious,” said Nadeem Ahmed, Reshma’s husband.
 
 BJP members had a tough time explaining Tuesday’s defeat. “The area under both wards (Sarai Pipal Thala and Maujpur) have for long been politically unfavourable for BJP. The results should not be viewed as a reflection of people’s mood,” said Kuljeet Chahal, general secretary, Delhi BJP. Meanwhile, AAP took to Twitter slamming Congress for demanding recounting in Maujpur. “Congress had demanded recounting in Maujpur. In the recounting too AAP candidate won,” AAP tweeted.
