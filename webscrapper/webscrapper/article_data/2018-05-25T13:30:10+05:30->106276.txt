PANAJI: In view of threats to security, the foreigners regional registration office (FRRO) of the Goa Police on Thursday prohibited the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or unmanned aircraft systems (UAS)—commonly known as drones—for civil purposes in the state.

 FRRO superintendent of police (SP) Bosco George said if anyone was still found using drones, the local police would act against them.
 
 “These systems have the potential to be used in several civil applications. However, their use also poses a security threat,” George said.
 
 He explained that the airspace of many Indian cities has a high density of manned aircraft traffic, and that UAS, which lack regulation and operating procedures, could cause air collision and accidents. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), too, is yet to publish standards and recommended practices (SARPs) for the civil use of UAS.
 
 George said the civil operation of UAS would require approval from the air navigation service provider, ministry of defence, ministry of home affairs and other security agencies concerned, besides the director general of civil aviation (DGCA).
 
 He also said the DGCA was in the process of formulating regulations for the certification and operation of UAS in Indian civil airspaces. “Till such time as the regulations are issued, no non-governmental agency, organisation, or individual shall launch a UAS in the state,” he cautioned.
 
 Earlier, the anti-terrorist squad (ATS) of the Goa Police had recommended that the government ban the use of  . The squad had written a letter to both district collectors requesting them to issue an order to the effect under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).
