CHENNAI: The city police routinely harangue victims of crime for not installing security cameras as a deterrent to potential offenders and to identify such reprobates, but now find themselves at the short end of the stick.

 After a gang attacked the   with petrol bombs early on Thursday, officers discovered that all the security cameras on the premises were dysfunctional. But they received a lifeline from the embarrassing situation from an unlikely source.
 
 Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, a BSc graduate and apparently an expert in electronic surveillance, said in the assembly on Friday that dust-laden wind had put the police station cameras out of commission.
 
 Responding to opposition leader   and Congress legislature party leader K R Ramasamy’s concerns about law and order in a city in which a gang would dare to attack a police station, Palaniswami said, “During monsoon, CCTV cameras are covered with dust. Due to this, the pictures are not clear.”
 
 “Police questioned 12 people,” the chief minister said. “One person matches images recorded by a CCTV camera.”
 
 Investigators were, in fact, in damage control mode after the attack when they released the image of a man they stated was a possible suspect. They had obtained the picture via CCTV camera footage from a building nearby.
 
 “The man was walking toward the station at the time of the attack,” an officer said, not explaining why a suspect would head toward the target of the attack instead of fleeing in the opposite direction. Police officers clarified a day later that they had identified the man as a   returning home from work and said he was no longer a suspect.
 
 Perhaps the chief minister has an explanation for this police bungling too.
