PANCHKULA: Keeping in mind the damage caused to the roads that also gives rise to fatal accidents,   (RTA) of   has decided to install two special posts to check overloaded vehicles crossing Panchkula. The   officials in cooperation with the police department would now keep a check on such vehicles in three shifts. 

 To solidify the move, Panchkula deputy commissioner  , additional DC-cum-RTA   and other RTA officials held a meeting on Friday and identified two spots - Chandimandir toll plaza and in   near police post - to fix these check posts. They also decided that the checking would be done in three shifts from 6 am to 2 pm; 2 pm to 10 pm and 10 pm to 6 am. For this, checking officers from both RTA and police department would be alerted at these posts. "A challan would be issued to the defaulters under a special checking process. During the checking, e-challan would be issued. Training for e-challan facility has already been given to the staff in advance," said Kumar.
 
 As per the information given by the RTA officials, overloaded vehicles are mostly found involved in cases like hit-and-run. It is because of the fact that it becomes hard to apply brakes for a truck driver when a particular carrier is overloaded. "Besides this, overloaded vehicles also damage the roads. Roads can only bear a limited amount of load, which when exceeded damages them," the officials said. The officials further said that two cases of accidents have been reported in the last 10 days from   area. "In both the cases, the overloaded vehicles failed to apply brakes on time," they said.
