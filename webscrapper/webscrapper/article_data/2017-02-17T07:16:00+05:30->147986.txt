AMRITSAR: The   has quietly replaced the much-hyped first   of the state launched in   ahead of  .

 On Thursday, residents of Harikae were surprised to find the amphibious bus packed and loaded on a gigantic truck. They soon clicked and shared its photos. Launched in December, the amphibious bus was to run in public-private partnership, with Krishna Ho Ho Limited given the task of looking after its operations.
 
 When TOI called Krishna Ho Ho Ltd’s office, the person who picked the phone didn’t introduce himself. He, however, said, “Opposition political parties are spreading rumors about the amphibious bus and they could have been circulating fake photographs.” He then put another person on the line, who introduced himself as Sanjiv.
 
 Sanjiv claimed that the manufacturer had earlier sent a trial version of the amphibious bus, which was a lighter type. “They have now taken it back and we have got a new American amphibious bus,” he said.
 
 If things go as per plans, service would be resumed in next 10-15 days, he said, adding that they were going to begin training sessions for the divers-cum-drivers.
 
 A staff member of the tourism department had received a new water cruise bus, which was brought here in the truck on February 13. The previous duck bus was sent back on the same truck. MD of Punjab Tourism Development Corporation Navjot Pal Singh Randhawa could not be reached for comments.
 
 The amphibious bus, also known as Harikae Cruise, is a double-mode tourist bus. It was launched by deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal on December 12 to attract tourists. The tickets were priced at Rs 2,000 per person for a 4 km ride passing through nature’s trail and bird watchtowers.
 
 Earlier, just two days after the launch of the duck bus, its operations were halted since the water level in the Harikae reservoir had dropped. The minimum water level required for the bus to sail is six feet.
