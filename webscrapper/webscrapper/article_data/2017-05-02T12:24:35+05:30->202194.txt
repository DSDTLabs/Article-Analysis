Ranbir Kapoor, who recently wrapped up the first schedule of the   biopic, directed by  , which was being shot in Mumbai, and completed filming his upcoming Anurag Basu-directorial, took off on a week-long vacation with mom   to London. The actor who had been shooting continuously for the last four months decided to holiday at his mother's favourite spot and spend some time away from the country.

 
  
 "When your love is reciprocated with love and care, life becomes really worth it," Neetu shared after a hearty meal at a luxurious Soho restaurant. Ranbir's Delhi-based jewellery designer sister Riddhima and niece Samara, were also invited but since they couldn't make it, it was just the mother and son in the Queen's City. They caught up with a few relatives there too.
 
 Ranbir who has grown his hair long for the Sanjay biopic, tied it up in a high bun and clicked selfies with fans at the airport, hotel and while shopping at the upscale Selfridges and Harrods. While sight-seeing, the 34-year-old actor wore a beanie to conceal his look that bears a striking resemblance with the real Dutt. In the next schedule, his hair will reportedly be longer and his look, leaner.
 
 Late last year, Ranbir with his director-bestie,  , and actress   was in London to prep for their upcoming superhero film 'Dragon'. The trio will reunite there for the first schedule of the film in July.
