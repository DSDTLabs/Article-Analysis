NEW DELHI:   asked   to specify the reason for its “multi-million celebration plan” to mark the third anniversary of the Modi government, saying the Centre was presiding over jobless growth and had put the future of the young in peril.

  spokesman Abhishek   mocked the government’s claims about success, arguing that it had failed in its flagship promise of creating two crore jobs annually.
 
 Claiming that the government’s own figures confirmed jobless growth, Singhvi said, “In eight labour intensive sectors, the growth of jobs is 1.1%. In numbers, it is 1.35 lakh jobs. The government’s definition of ‘achhe din’ is one without jobs.”
 
 He said job creation in 2009-10 was 8.7 lakh and 9.29 lakh in 2010-11 but had fallen to 1.35 lakh in the last two years of the Modi government.
 
 “This is ‘jumlabaazi’ of this government. What is it that the government is celebrating? Are they celebrating joblessness?” Singhvi asked.
