KOLKATA: A 34-year-old man, who had suffered a heart attack, died at MR Bangur Hospital on Tuesday morning allegedly while waiting to get an ECG done at the hospital's diagnostic centre which was locked. Amit Biswas, a Tollygunge resident, was taken to the lab for an emergency ECG from the hospital's emergency section. But the test couldn't be done immediately since the lab technician had gone to the toilet after locking the chamber.   passed away while waiting near the lab. 

 At around 5.45am, Biswas had been brought to the hospital by his family members. He had intense chest pain and was examined immediately at the emergency section. The attending doctor said he suspected that Biswas had suffered a heart attack and needed an ECG. At 6am, he was rushed to the diagnostic lab but was asked to wait. According to hospital sources, the technician had gone to the toilet and had locked the lab. "It took less than 10 minutes for him to return, but unfortunately Biswas suffered a repeat attack and passed away. There was nothing that the hospital could do," said a hospital source.
 
 Biswas's family members, however, alleged that the hospital staff paid no heed to their requests to get the ECG done even as he was writhing in pain and losing consciousness. "We kept requesting the staff members to call the technician but none helped. He was in extreme pain and suffered a second attack. There was no trace of the technician even after he slumped on the stretcher and died," said a family member. 
 
 The hospital authorities denied negligence and claimed that Biswas had been attended to immediately. "His family had suspected that he had a gastric-related issue. But it was our doctor who detected that he had suffered an acute myocardial infarction. It's true that the ECG room was locked but that can hardly be the reason for his death. Biswas would have survived had he not suffered a second attack," said a hospital official. The hospital has initiated an internal probe.
