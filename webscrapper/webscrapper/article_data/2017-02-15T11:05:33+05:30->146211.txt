SHIMLA: The   cabinet will discuss the revival of leasing out 28 acres in Solan district to Yoga guru Ramdev-owned   on February 17, four years after the Congress government had cancelled the land contract in February 2013.

 Chief Minister   has already said the state’s law department and revenue department had examined the matter, and that the cabinet would take the final call. In 2010, the then   government in Himachal Pradesh allocated 28 acres off the Kandaghat-Chail road, near Sadhupul in Solan, on a 99-year lease to Ramdev for the development of health tourism, cultivation of herbs and development of medical science.
 
 Congress leaders had been claiming that a children's park was to be constructed on the land and that the BJP government had violated rules by allotting the land to Ramdev’s trust.
 
 After coming to power, the Congress had decided to cancel the lease. The state government took possession of the property amid police security on February 22. Pantanjali Yogapeeth had challenged the decision through a writ petition filed in the Himachal Pradesh high court. It had also sought the land back. The petition claimed that the lease was validly given to the trust and the trust has spent about Rs 11 crore for the development of land and other strictures.
 
 The court had directed the government to maintain status quo on the land on February 27, 2013.
