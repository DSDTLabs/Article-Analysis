CHENNAI: Rural industries minister   on Wednesday informed the state assembly that the government would take steps to empower the   to take care of the basic amenities at the   at K Pudur.

 His reply came on Madurai north MLA V V Rajan Chellappa’s calling attention motion to the poor basic amenities available in the industrial estate. Chellappa claimed that the industrial estate which was hosting 75 manufacturing units and workshops was struggling without proper roads, street lights and drinking water facilities. “While the civic body has ensured good road facility outside the industrial estate, the same could not be done inside because of jurisdictional issues. The estate is like an island (without basic amenities) in the temple city,” he said.
 
 While promising to improve the situation, minister Benjamin said SIDCO was administering 105 state-run industrial estates including 35 estates established directly by the government across 32 districts. The 56.05-acre located in K Pudur was one of them. 
 
 In order to improve the infrastructure including the road facility, drinking water, and electricity, a detailed project report quoting an outlay of Rs. 375 lakh was prepared and approved during the 279th SIDCO board meeting in February. The project would be implemented under Micro &   - Cluster Development Programme (MSE-CDP) with 60 per cent contribution from the Union government, 30 from the state and 10 from the beneficiaries (companies). The DPR had been sent to the Union government for getting its approval and once the nod was given, it would be implemented, he said.
