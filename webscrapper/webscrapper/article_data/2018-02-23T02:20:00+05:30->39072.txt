Vijayawada: Women organisations intensified their stir against filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma for his controversial comments on women leaders during a TV debate over his recent movie God, Sex and Truth (GST). 

 Various women organisation under the leadership of All India Democratic Women Association (AIDWA) came together at a round-table meeting at Vijayawada on Thursday. They demanded that Varma be booked under Section 354 of IPC for his comments on women activists that he had made in the aftermath of the release of the controversial movie on the internet.
 
 Speaking on the occasion, P Devi, an   working for the rights of women, demanded that Varma be booked under Section 354 (sexual harassment) of IPC instead of 507 and 509. She said Varmaâ€™s comments are a direct assault on AIDWA leader Mani and on herself too. Devi further demanded that the government constitute a working media watch committee to keep an eye on porn films that are relentlessly flooding social media platforms. 
 
 She said the porn addiction is no less harmful than drug addiction and said that it is severely affecting the younger generations.
 
 AIDWA secretary D Ramadevi said porn is inhuman and a form of sexual assault on women. She said trafficking of young girls has a direct relation to uncontrolled porn films that are flooding the internet. She found fault with the government for not keeping a check on the porn industry and also for being unable to take action on those resorting to physical and psychological attacks on women activists opposing porn.
 
 Leaders and activists from various organisations attended the round table. They have announced to sit on protest from March 2nd to 5th if the government failed to respond on their demands.
