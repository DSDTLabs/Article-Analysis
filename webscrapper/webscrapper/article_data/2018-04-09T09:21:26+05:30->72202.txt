LUCKNOW: In an apparent counter to   president   Gandhi’s temple run, BJP on Sunday sent around 200 senior citizens of Amethi, Gandhi’s parliamentary constituency, on a four-day pilgrimage to Haridwar and Rishikesh.

 The pilgrimage, named ‘Amethi Ganga Darshan Yatra’ was organised by BJP Rajya Sabha MP and Union information minister   Irani.
 
 Irani’s representative Vijay Gupta flagged off five saffron-coloured AC buses, one each for the five assembly constituencies of Amethi, to ferry around 200 senior citizens on pilgrimage.
 
 BJP’s media in charge in Amethi, Govind Chauhan told TOI that that the pilgrimage, spanning over a period of four days, is fully sponsored and the yatris will be provided free food, lodging and medical facilities.
 
 
 
 
 Chauhan said that at least 40 pilgrims were selected from each of the five assembly constituencies — Amethi, Tiloi, Salon, Gauriganj and Jagdishpur.
 
 The pilgrimage comes almost a week ahead of Irani’s scheduled two-day visit to Amethi on April 13 and 14. Sources said that the Union minister is likely to stay overnight in Amethi and meet party workers. “A detailed plan of her programmes in Amethi will be chalked out in the next couple of days,” BJP sources said.
 
 Congress president   is also expected to be on a two-day visit to Amethi on April 16 and 17.
 
 Political experts said that Rahul’s temple visits have been troubling BJP. During   elections, Rahul had visited 25 temples in the state. He is also visiting temples in poll-bound Karnataka, causing discomfiture to the saffron party.
 
 Irani had contested against Rahul Gandhi from Amethi in 2014 Lok Sabha elections but lost by over 1 lakh votes. The actor-turned-politician has been visiting Amethi frequently, sparking speculations of her grooming the high-profile constituency to take on Congress president once again in 2019 elections.
