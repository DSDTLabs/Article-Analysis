 Close relative Nafis Ahmed revealed that Jwas deeply saddened by the recent demise of his daughter Nuzhat. "He could not accept the death of his daughter Nuzhat who succumbed to liver cancer on November 17 in London. Each day of the 40-day long mourning period was heavy on him. It finally took a toll on his health on Thursday when ‘Chaliswa’ risuals were being observed in  ," he said.
 
 His son   said: “We were back from Nuzhat's ‘Chaliswa’ ceremony which was performed in our native village in Ambedkarnagar. After the rituals, my father went for bath but didn't come out for long. Suspecting any trouble, we broke open the door. Finding him lying unconscious there, we rushed him to hospital.”
 
 Family friends revealed that Anwar was on ventilator since he had been admitted at the Trauma Centre and breathed his last at around 10 am on Tuesday. "The burial will take place in Jalalpur on Wednesday," they said.
