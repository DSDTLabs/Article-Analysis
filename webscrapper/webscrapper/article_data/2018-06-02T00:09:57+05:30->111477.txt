Chennai: Ahead of World Environment Day on Tuesday, Ezone India, an eco-club facilitator, has invited citizens to bring them newspaper and plastic waste and take home pencils made of the paper. For every kilo of trash to be collected, Ezone will give a pencil worth Rs6. Trash collected through the initiative will be sent to pencil-making factory units. Ezone founder Hafiz Khan said, “The idea is to save trees that are axed for manufacturing wooden pencils.” The ‘Trash to Treasure’ campaign will be carried out in metros including Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad as part of Environment Day celebrations. Thoraipakkam resident Bharathi Hariharan has welcomed the initiative. Around 300 families in the apartment complex have been practising waste segregation for the past three years. Bharathi said, “We plan to get children involved. They will bring newspapers, magazines and plastic waste from the homes. We will be sending out a circular to all residents soon.” Ezone is in talks with about 20 corporate companies in Ascendas IT Park to have employees take part in the ‘Trash to Treasure’ campaign, a part of Ezone’s objective to refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle, repair, reclaim, replace and respect. “Refuse plastic when you can. Avoid plastic bags when shopping. We hope to create a public movement to inspire sustainable development,” said Hafeez. The Environment Day celebrations will also include the launch of a project by Ezone to construct an urban forest in Chengalpet.
