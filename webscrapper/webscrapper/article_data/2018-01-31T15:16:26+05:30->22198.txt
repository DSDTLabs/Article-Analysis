VISAKHAPATNAM: There seems to be no let-up in the spree of murders in the city, as a history-sheeter was killed by unidentified assailants at Gurrammagedda in Sabbavaram mandal on the outskirts of the city in the early hours of Tuesday. Police suspect the victim might have been eliminated by rivals.

  (28) was found murdered on the Anandapuram-Anakapalle Road by locals who immediately alerted police. Anakapalle DSP KV Ramana said 15 cases were pending against Sekhar. A mobile phone and empty liquor bottles were recovered from the murder spot. 
 
 Police led by CI Ramachandra Rao rushed to the area and found deep injuries on Sekharâ€™s head, neck and face which, cops said, were caused by a blunt object. A dog squad and Clues teams were pressed into action to hunt for the killers.
 
 Sekhar was facing three cases in Sabbavaram police station registered in 2013 and another in 2014. He had cases registered in Pendurthi, Parawada and Gajuwaka police stations as well. 
 
 Sekhar was the third history-sheeter to have been killed in   district in recent times.   was murdered in a newspaper office which later turned into a sensational case as DSP-rank officer Dasari Ravi Babu emerged as the main accused and the newspaper owner Bhupatiraju Vijayakumar Raju as A2. Rowdy-sheeter Sheikh   was killed at   near Gajuwaka on December 31. Police are spending sleepless nights what with the unrelenting spate of killings taking place in the port city as well as the district. In the last one month alone, 5-6 persons have been killed.
