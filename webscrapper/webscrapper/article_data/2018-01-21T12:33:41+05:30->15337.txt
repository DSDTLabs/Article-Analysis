Fashion to me is | Being comfortable in what I’m wearing and carrying it with panache. I don’t follow any trends but I try and wear what suits me and my body type. I think that’s what defines fashion.

 My everyday outfit | When I’m lounging at home it has to be my trackpants and T-shirt. If I am going out, I prefer wearing a nice dress.
 
 
 My shopping strategy | I love shopping but there is no particular strategy that I follow. I mostly shop when I’m travelling abroad. Sometimes, I do make a list of essentials that I need to pick up. Other than that I buy anything that I like.
 
 A tip for men | Men mostly ignore taking care of their skin. I think a weekly scrub and a face pack for every man is a must to get rid of all the pollution, dirt and grime.
 
 My favourite style trick/hack | No matter what I’m wearing, a good cat-liner and deep red lips always work for me.
 
 A fashion trend I hate | A lot of people wear sunglasses that are extremely big and bulky, whether or not it suits their face. That’s something I hate.
 
 Biggest fashion blunder | When people wear stuff that does not suit their body type.
 
 Or when they wear make-up or a foundation base that is way lighter than their skin – a lot of people do that.
 
 Healthy skin hack | Eat right and eat healthy. A quick hack I follow is to rub ice, 10 minutes before I start make-up.
