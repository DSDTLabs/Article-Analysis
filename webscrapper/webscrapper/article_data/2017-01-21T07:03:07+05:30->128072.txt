AHMEDABAD:   for a safe access to   and other minority communities, individuals in the city will support and participate in a nationwide inter-sectional march organized by ‘I Will Go Out’ (IWGO), a collective of individuals and groups fighting for equal rights of minority groups. It also advocates for women’s right to be seen, heard and be in public spaces at any given time. 

 The   is being held across 20 Indian cities including Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow, Pondicherry and Goa, among others.
 
 “We also protest the exclusion of the whole range of marginalized communities in a space that is increasingly defining itself as gendered and heteronormative. We also aim to reclaim highly gendered public spaces for women and girls of every class and caste,” said an IWGO spokesperson.
 
 The protest march will also be supported by the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer Intersex Asexual (LGBTQIA) community in Ahmedabad, as they also face violence from heteronormative communities. IWGO has issued a series of recommendations for the government to make women feel safe in public spaces.
 
 Following the march, a national manifesto including these recommendations along with region-specific petitions, enlisting demands to curb street harassment and promote women’s right to public spaces in India, would be presented before the President.
