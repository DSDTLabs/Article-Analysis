RAJKOT: In wake of the indefinite strike of private doctors in the city,   has cancelled leaves of all its doctors to tackle the extra rush of patients.

 Medical fraternity and members of the Rajkot unit of   (IMA) went on strike from Monday morning and have stopped treating patients. 
 
 The doctors are protesting against section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) being often slapped on medical practitioners in event of a patient’s death during treatment. However, the strike was called off late evening on Tuesday.
 
 “We have cancelled leaves of all doctors following the private doctors’ strike in Rajkot. Patients are coming to civil hospital and in order to manage extra rush, we have taken this measure. We have asked our doctors to treat every patient who come at the OPD even if it requires overtime work. We have also added one more doctor at the emergency services department,” said Dr  , in-charge superintendent, Rajkot Civil Hospital.
 
 There are over 1,500 private doctors who are on strike. Protesting doctors organized a meeting to chalk out future plan of action on Tuesday. Doctors said that police is not following the   guideline and is slapping culpable homicide section against doctors when patients die during treatment.
