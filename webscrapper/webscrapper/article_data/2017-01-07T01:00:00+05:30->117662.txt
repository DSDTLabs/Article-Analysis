Annu Kapoor, whose sister   was previously married to Om  , talked to BT about his troubled equation with the late actor... 

 
 The person (Puri) is no more and it is past now. We are courteous and cultured enough to express our deep condolences and pray that his soul rests in peace, but my priority is to take care of the person (Seema) who has suffered the most in this. 
 
 
 
 She is devastated, but under the present circumstances, she will not even be allowed to see the body. Isn’t that ironical? 
 
 
 
 I don’t want to comment on that. It is a very complicated matter; the world is full of obnoxious and cheater individuals and I feel God is nowhere. Throughout the conflict, she suffered the most.
 
 
 
 No, it was the other way round --- Om wanted to reunite with her. My sister was a genuine, honest person, but she suffered and cheaters are in a respected position. My poor sister accepted him despite him being so unwell. She looked after him, while he always played with her emotions. Nevertheless, I don’t want to dwell on it at this moment. I am only bothered about my sister and not anyone else. I know her pain and suffering, and as a brother, I can’t see her like that.
