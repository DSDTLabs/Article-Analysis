KOLKATA: The mother of the three-year-old girl who died at   Hospital on Friday after being pierced with seven needles was arrested on Saturday. Mangala   (32) had been detained along with her mother, Madhuri Mahanta. They were taken to an undisclosed location from Kolkata, where Mangala had been staying with her daughter since last Saturday.

 According to the police, teams have been sent to   and   in search of Sanatan Thakur, a retired homeguard who had employed Mangala as a maid a year ago. Cops suspect that Thakur practised black magic on the girl with Mangala’s consent.
 
 Last Sunday, doctors at SSKM Hospital had operated upon the girl. They removed seven needles in the surgery that lasted a little over two hours. A medical board had been formed to supervise her treatment. But the efforts eventually failed. Doctors said the girl succumbed to severe infection from the needles that had pierced her lungs, stomach and private parts.
 
  Mangala would take the girl regularly to Thakur’s house while she worked there. Thakur has been booked under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.
