The SUV came on the police radar after it jumped a police barricade near Atul Kataria Chowk in the early hours on Monday. After information on the SUV was relayed through police wireless, SHO of Palam Vihar police station inspector Vikram Nehra started chasing it. According to Nehra, the chase lasted around 15-20 minutes, during which time the Xylo kept speeding towards Delhi. Thereafter, the SHO lost track of it. 
 
 However, PCR 22, with SPO Mukesh and constable Sanjay in it, managed to track down the Xylo on a stretch between Hanuman Chowk and the Gurgaon-Delhi border at Kapashera. As Mukesh alighted from PCR 22 to set up a barricade, the Xylo, with its headlights turned off, bumped the PCR from behind in a bid to escape. Mukesh fell, and the Xylo ran over him before he could get up, and sped on into Delhi. Mukesh was rushed to Columbia Asia hospital in Palam Vihar, where he succumbed to injuries later.
