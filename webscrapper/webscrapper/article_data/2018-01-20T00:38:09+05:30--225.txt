Pimpri Chinchwad: The Independent English Schools Association(IESA) has decided to admit students under the 25% RTE quota for the 2018-19 academic year only if the state gives a written assurance to clear its arrears. 

 Else, it will fill up the seats by admitting students through the regular admission process, association president Jagruti Dharmadhikari said here on Friday. 
 
 If this happens, around 600 students in Pimpri Chinchwad may lose the opportunity to get admission under the RTE quota in 2018-19. Altogether 28 schools are affiliated to the association. If other schools in the city follow this model, around 6,000 students will lose the admission opportunity as well. 
 
 The Right To Education (RTE) Act was implemented from 2013. As part of it, the state government has to reimburse fees of the 25% students admitted to schools under the provision.
