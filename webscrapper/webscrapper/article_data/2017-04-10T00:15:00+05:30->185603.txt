Mumbai: As part of   celebrations of   Ali, the first  , on April 10, Dongri-based iconic Mughal mosque is hosting a conference where scholars will denounce terrorism and emphasize unity and communal harmony. Being organized by Muslims’ Association for Peace and Harmony, the meet will reiterate the need to fight extremist ideology with the message of love and peace.

 Communication designer Amir Abbas Rizvi said the importance of remembering Hazrat Ali lay in the fact that he had banished Kharjis (those who claimed to be Muslims but acted against the religion’s principles) in the early phase of Islam. “Terror outfits like ISIS and al-Qaida are modern Kharjis. They claim to be devout Muslims but kill innocents in the name of Islam. Taking a cue from Hazrat Ali’s move, we must reject the terrorists who defame Islam,” said Rizvi. Hazrat Ali was also the Prophet’s son-in-law and is a revered figure for both Sunnis and Shias.
