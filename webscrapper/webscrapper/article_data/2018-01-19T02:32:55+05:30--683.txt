NEW DELHI: A gang of robbers has been busted and the kingpin arrested for self-inflicting injuries and posing as a victim himself to avoid suspicion. He was nabbed after he inflicted an almost lethal wound on himself.

 The accused, Pardeep Kumar (35), had robbed a person in Kirti Nagar and then stabbed him for retaliation,   said. He has been involved in robbery cases previously as well.
 
 Initially, Kumar told the police that on Christmas, he went to the jungle near his house to dispose off garbage at 11.30pm. When he was heading back home, two men approached him and demanded money at knifepoint. However, Kumar refused and the duo stabbed him on his chest. 
 
 He stated that his brother Praveen made a PCR call and a team rushed to the spot after which the man was rushed to a private hospital nearby for treatment, where he was said to be critical. He was then taken to RML hospital thereafter. 
 
 “A case was registered and a team led by SHO Kirti Nagar Anil Sharma was formed to investigate into the matter,” said a senior police official. 
 
 Police said that almost 300 slum dwellers were thoroughly interrogated but they got no clues. “After Kumar was interrogated again, he finally narrated the actual incident,” he told the cops.
 
 On Christmas, he had come back after committing robbery. After getting drunk, like every time, he inflicted injuries on himself. However, this time he accidentally stabbed himself in his chest and dropped unconscious. He was critical for many days.
 
 The police recovered daggers and other weapons from the man’s house. Kumar also led to the recovery of knife with which he had injured himself. Cops are also tracking the cases that were registered against him in the past and are making efforts to nab his accomplices as well.
