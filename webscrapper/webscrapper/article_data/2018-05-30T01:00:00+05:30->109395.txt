Sexy, stylish and super confident… that’s   for you. The actress, who topped the   20 Most Desirable Women on   list, has worked on her style quotient over the years, and feels that persistence is the key. Known for her roles in Saraswatichandra, Beyhadh and now Bepannah, Jennifer’s impeccable fashion sense and toned body make her stand out. In a chat with BT, she shares her views on being desirable and what she finds hot in a man. Excerpts:

 
 
 I have taken a long time to reach this point, and I have not done it alone. It takes an army of people to get everything right — be it your attire, style or make-up. The people I work with, have had a major influence on me and they keep encouraging and guiding me. When I started doing TV, I used to commit many fashion blunders. As clichéd as it may sound, my perseverance and consistency have brought me this far. I believe in doing my work with utmost honesty. Above all, I believe in myself. 
 
 
 
 Honesty is the most desirable quality in a man. More than anything else, if I can be true to myself with a man and vice versa, we can both grow together. Other qualities would include being decent, presentable and wearing clean shoes. I am particular about wearing clean shoes myself. He should be witty, too.
 
 
 
 Being true to yourself is important; everybody has a different style quotient. Also, it is important to be clear about what you want to portray, as only that will help you stand out. Talking about my style, I wear whatever makes me 
 feel comfortable and confident. I don’t care about brands as long as I love what I am wearing.
