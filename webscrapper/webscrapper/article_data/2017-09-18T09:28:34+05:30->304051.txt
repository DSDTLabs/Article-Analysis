CHENNAI: The two-year wait was worth it for   fans in the city. A nail-biting contest on a Sunday meant all roads led to  ,   which hosted its first international match in two years. Despite the hike in ticket prices to a minimum of Rs 1,200, the   match on Sunday was sold out.

 By noon, the Wallajah Road, Victoria Hostel Road and Bells Road were packed with fans clad in blue. Fans divided their loyalty between local favourite M S Dhoni and the Indian captain Virat Kohli, as t-shirts bearing the names of the two stars sold like hot cakes outside the stadium. It was tickets for the match that was in high demand.
 
 S Elango and his gang from T Nagar returned home to watch the match on TV after spending two hours outside the stadium in the hope of getting tickets in black. Elango said, “The minimum ticket price used to be around Rs 700 a few years ago. But now the increased price has rendered black tickets almost unaffordable.” Black tickets were sold for a minimum of Rs 2,500 and found few takers. Tickets priced at Rs 3,000 were sold for Rs 6,000. A senior police official stationed on Wallajah Road said, “We have not caught anybody selling black tickets. We are keeping a close watch.”
 
 For older fans like S Raghunath, 62, from Mylapore, India’s win on Sunday was sweet revenge. Thirty years ago, during the 1987 World Cup, Chepauk hosted its first-ever international match which was between India and Australia. India had lost the league match to   by just one run. “My friends and I had returned home with tears in my eyes when India lost that match here. Today is a memorable day for me,” he said.
