NEW DELHI: India will base its 
  , which are also capable of delivering nuclear weapons, in the eastern sector as part of the overall policy to gradually build nuclear as well as conventional deterrence against China.

 With   already operating from Tezpur and Chabua in Assam, the   has now finalised plans for the first 18 Rafales to be stationed at the   airbase in Bengal from late-2019.
 
 This comes at a time when India is also conducting final trials of the nuclear-capable Agni-IV and   after the   inducted the Agni-III a couple of years ago.
 
 Under the Rs 59,000 crore (7.87 billion euro) deal inked with France in September last year, the IAF will get 36 Rafales in batches by mid-2022 or so. With 14 India-specific requirements, including the capability for “cold start” from high-altitude regions, the Rafale packs quite a punch with its ability to carry 9.3-tonne of weapons and simultaneously perform both air defence and ground attack missions.
 
 “The Hasimara airbase currently has MiG-27s that will be retired over the next two-three years. They will be replaced by Rafales. A team from   has already visited Hasimara to review the maintenance and other infrastructure required there,” said an official.
 
 “The Sarsawa base (UP), among other places, is being considered for the second Rafale squadron. 
 
 Under the contract, Dassault has to ensure minimum 75% availability for the jets at all times under the performance-based logistics support for the first seven years, which can be extended by another five,” he added.
 
 The IAF also activated the advance landing ground (ALG) at Tuting, in Arunachal’s Upper Siang district, just 10 days ago. It is the sixth such ALG to be made operational in Arunachal apart from the ones in eastern  , all with an eye firmly on China.
 
 Moreover, the Panagarh base in Bengal is also set to get its six C-130J Super Hercules aircraft. Panagarh, of course, is also going to be the headquarter of the Army’s new 17 Mountain Strike Corps being raised with two high-altitude infantry divisions, apart from other armoured, artillery, air defence and engineer brigades spread from Ladakh to Arunachal.
