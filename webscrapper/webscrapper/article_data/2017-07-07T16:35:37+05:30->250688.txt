KOLKATA:  , Left and   leaders were on Friday stopped from going to   in West Bengal's   district as the situation was volatile following communal clashes earlier this week, officials said.

 "The situation is still tense. We have not allowed any delegation to go there as it might create problems," a senior district official said.
 
 "We have been stopped near Ashoknagar area on the grounds that if we go to those areas it might create law and order problem. But we are not going there for any political programme. We are going there to meet the people who have suffered due to riots," Left Front legislative party leader Sujan Chakraborty said.
 
 Chakraborty said the Left Front would organise a demonstration against the police and the   government in   area of the district.
 
 The Congress team, led by WBPCC chief Adhir Chowdhury, was also stopped at Barasat for the same reason.
 
 The BJP team was led by state party president Dilip Ghosh.
 
 Baduria and its adjoining areas witnessed a communal flare-up following a post by a youth on Facebook earlier this week.
 
 Though the youth was arrested, members of two communities clashed, set up road blockades, damaged shops and set fire to vehicles.
