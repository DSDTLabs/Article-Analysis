KOCHI/THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The   on Friday quashed the   registered by Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau ( ) in the so-called Pattoor land scam, absolving former chief minister Oommen Chandy of any financial wrongdoing or administrative transgression. The case, turned into a cause celebre by the  , did substantial damage to the credibility and image of Chandy’s UDF government and contributed to its rout at the hustings in 2016. 

 The high court also made scathing remarks against DGP and former VACB chief  , who had used the case to project himself as the state’s foremost crusader against corruption.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 The VACB had alleged irregularities in the construction of an apartment building and shifting of a sewage pipeline at Pattoor. Chandy was named fourth accused, former chief secretary E K Bharat Bhushan was third accused while two former executive engineers of Kerala Water Authority (KWA) and Artech Realtors’ managing director TS Ashok were the first, second and fifth accused respectively.
 
 Overruling the prosecution’s contentions, the court said the claim that the property vests with KWA is not based on any document but on misunderstanding of certain statutory provisions. The court said that even if KWA’s claim over the property was accepted, shifting of a sewage line from one part of the property to another did not give any pecuniary advantage to the company, Artech Realtors. In short, the FIR did not disclose commission of any offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act, the court held while quashing the FIR.
 
 Dismissing the allegation that Chandy had unauthorisedly interfered in the matter, the court said prosecution has not disputed the fact that the chief minister was the only authority to constitute a committee to consider the company’s request for shifting the sewage pipeline as various departments were not in agreement.
