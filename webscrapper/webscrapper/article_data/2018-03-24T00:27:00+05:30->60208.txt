Bengaluru: Sukesh M S was only 17 and studying I PU when his left leg turned gangrenous and had to be amputated. While under treatment, he suffered from acute stomachache, only to be diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) of the kidneys and one of them had to be removed. 

 Sukesh underwent a kidney transplant after his mother donated one of hers. However, nothing stopped the 24-year-old from chasing his childhood dream. Now an MBBS student of Vydehi Institute of Medical Science and Research Centre, the vegetable vendor is all set to become a doctor next year.
 
 “I have overcome many odds and that has only made me positive. I drew inspiration from doctors who were treating me,” Sukesh recalled. 
 
 During his PU days, Sukesh could attend classes only for three days a week as he had to undergo dialysis every alternate day.
 
 His kidney transplant was done in May 2013 when he had to appear for CET counselling. The boy couldn’t go for the interview as he lay on a hospital bed.
 
 His parents — Sriram M and Nirmala S, KR Puram residents — say their hearts swell with pride on seeing what their son has achieved. “Coming from a poor background, we have suffered a lot. But many people helped us, including doctors who treated without charging any fee,” said Sriram.
 
 “He got a medical seat allotted through sports quota as he had been an athlete. But he couldn’t go for the interview. On our request, an official came to see his condition in the hospital,” said the father.
 
 Dr Deepak Dubey, consultant, urology and renal transplant, Manipal Hospitals, said Sukesh was lucky as his mother came forward to donate her kidney. “He underwent multiple surgeries and the transplant turned his life around,” he added.
