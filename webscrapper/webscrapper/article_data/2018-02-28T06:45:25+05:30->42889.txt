 “This is our second government-backed live-and-conserve endeavour after the St Olav’s Church project, which was reopened in 2016,” said conservation-architect Manish Chakraborti, who has led the project with his team of skilled masons from Murshidabad and the Sunderbans. Flemming Aalund, NMD’s architect has fine-tuned the restoration.
 
 NMD historian Simon Rastén said, “Nobody remembered the original name of the ruined building. It was like a detective work to search the archives and it felt great when I realized that it must be the well-known Denmark Tavern and Hotel from 1786, which was located at the Nishan Ghat where the Danes kept their flagstaff and salutation cannons.”
 
 Aalund said, “By restoring this ruin we could recreate a main axes of Serampore’s original urban layout, going from the landing point at the river, through the main gate to the old Danish government house from the 1770s.”
