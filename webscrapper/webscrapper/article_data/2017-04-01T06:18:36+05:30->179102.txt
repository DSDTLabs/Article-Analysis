NEW DELHI: Goa chief minister  , who on Friday was the target of an attack by Congress members of   for forming the government in Panjim despite BJP having fewer numbers than Congress, lobbed the ball back into the court of the opposition party blaming its general secretary   for the failure to form government.

 As Parrikar, who walked into the House during Zero Hour, got up for his farewell speech, Congress members trooped into the well and raised slogans against the former defence minister.
 
 Amid the noisy protests, Parikkar said, “I express my thanks to the chairman, deputy chairman and members of this House for their support during my tenure as Raksha Mantri and invite them to Goa whenever they want to come.”
 
 “I also thank Digvijaya Singh, because he was roaming around in Goa and I was able to form the government,” he said with a tinge of sarcasm touching upon a raw nerve of many in the party who are anguished over its failure to take the reins in Panjim despite having more numbers. Party MLAs in Goa have blamed Digvijaya of not moving swiftly enough to stake claim to form government.
