HYDERABAD: The city is witnessing an increase in the number of people turning up at psychiatric clinics with symptoms of   (SAD). There is a 20-30% jump in the patients complaining of psychological problems such as loss of appetite, fatigue and anxiety.

 SAD or summer depression is a type of bipolar disorder characterized by repeated depressive episodes that recur annually during a certain season. Bipolar disorder is marked by dramatic changes in mood, energy and behaviour, with episodes of elevated mood and extreme sadness. 
 
 “The increasing heat and humidity may play a role in causing summer depression in the Indian climatic setting. There is role reversal in the West where SAD is said to be common during winters, majorly due to lack of sunlight,” said Dr Jyothirmayi K, consultant psychiatrist at  .
 
 “Lack of concentration, lack of interest in activities enjoyed earlier and change in sleep pattern are warning signs. SAD is not properly researched in India and we cannot say for certain if patients are experiencing SAD or not. But the cases of depression go up by nearly 30% during this time of the year,” said Dr Anitha Are, consultant psychologist, Citizen Hospital.
 
 A steady flow of patients suffering from depression in   centres is common from April to June. “In case a patient’s parent was previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder, the chance of the child getting the disorder increases by 10%-15%. The risk of suicide is 50 times more in people with bipolar than the general population,” she said.
