INDORE: Khudel police on Friday detained a man suspecting him of murdering his daughter’s mother-in-law.

 During interrogations, it was found that the woman was reportedly first strangulated by the accused and then her body was hanged using a nylon rope on the ventilation outlet.
 
 “Her body was found lying on the floor but her neck was tied up with the nylon rope and it was fastened to the ventilation outlet,” said Khudel police station in-charge Avinash Singh. 
 
 Shanta Bai, 55, was found dead in   under Khudel police station.
 
 The incident took place on Wednesday when Shantabai was alone at her home.
 
 Police said Dinesh Jat, a resident of   village in Kannod had been living at his wife Kirti’s house in Khudel area for the past few years. Last month, his mother Shanta Bai also came to live with them which made Kirti’s father Punamchand Jat, 75 unhappy.
 
 On Wednesday, the woman’s son had left for work and her daughter-in-law had gone out in the evening. When she returned after an hour, she found Shanta Bai dead. 
 
 Her body was sent for postmortem examination and it was revealed in the report that she was murdered before being hanged. Police interrogated the family members and came to know that Punamchand had entered into a tiff with Shanta Bai several times. They claimed that based on the initial investigations there was a possibility that the woman was murdered by Punamchand.
 
 “We are interrogating him further on the matter. He has been detained,” said Singh.
