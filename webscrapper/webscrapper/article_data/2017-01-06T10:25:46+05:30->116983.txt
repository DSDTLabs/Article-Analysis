AHMEDABAD: Surat-based businessman Kishore Bhajiawala’s son Jignesh approached the Gujarat high court on Thursday requesting for direction to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to allow a lawyer to remain present while he is being interrogated.

 The high court is expected to hear Jignesh’s petition on Monday.
 
 On December 28, ED registered a case of money laundering against Bhajiawala and his two sons – Jignesh and Vilas. This was after the CBI lodged an FIR against for being in possession of Rs 1.05 crore in new currency notes. The hoarding of new notes was discovered during the searches conducted by the   department, which last month seized unaccounted assets worth over Rs 10 crore from Bhajiawala family in Surat.
 
 The CBI has booked the Bhajiawalas, Pankaj Bhatt, the manager of Surat People’s Co-operative Bank and a few others for cheating, forgery and usage of bogus documents as well as under anti-corruption laws. tnn
