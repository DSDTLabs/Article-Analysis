MUMBAI:The   that derailed in Darjeeling on Tuesday had been deployed in Matheran six months ago, before the   was shut for operations after a two derailments in May 2016.

 At least 10 persons, including the driver, were injured when the wheels of the diesel engine jumped the tracks while passing a turn near Paglajhora in Darjeeling and two coaches too derailed. 
 
 “It is a major embarrassment for us as the engine was on the Neral-Matheran section prior to being packed off to Darjeeling,” said a   official. “Officials may be punished if it is found that the locomotive had caused the  .”
 
 In August, the two locomotives used on the Neral-Matheran section were sent to Darjeeling, home to a similar 2ft-gauge mountain railway, as there were apprehensions that the toy train services may not resume soon. The tracks on the Neral-Matheran section were found to be weak and the entire infrastructure needed an overhaul, said railway officials.
 
 In a related development, railway minister Suresh Prabhu on Tuesday sanctioned Rs 6.8 crore to build 5,650m-long anti-crash barriers, 150m of retaining walls and 500m of gabion wall along the Neral-Matheran section to ensure the toy train does not fall into the valley in case of derailment. CR has also decided to change the ballast on the entire 21-km corridor to improve the track. “In Phase I, we plan to resume services on the 3km stretch between Aman Lodge to Matheran at 10kmph,” said an official.
