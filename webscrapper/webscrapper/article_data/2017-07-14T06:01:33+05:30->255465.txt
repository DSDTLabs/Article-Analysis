BENGALURU: The Siddaramaiah government wants all schools in the state, including those following   and   syllabi, to teach Kannada from Classes 1 to 10 from this academic year.

 Primary and secondary education minister Tanveer Sait said on Thursday he had written to all schools to teach Kannada as the first or second language. “We have issued an order in this regard which includes ICSE and CBSE schools,“ he said, after a review meeting with the   board.
 
 While most of the state board schools teach Kannada as one of the languages, schools under the   (CBSE) and the   for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) allow students other options.
 
 The move comes alongside a government order to set aside 5% of jobs for state civil services aspirants who have studied in Kannada medium from Class 1 to 10.
 
 The order, issued on May 10, lays down the guidelines for teaching Kannada under the Kannada Language Learning Act 2015. The department posted the letter on its website on June 5 -one month after the order was issued.
 
 The guidelines say, "Kannada language shall be taught as a compulsory language in all classes, in all schools in the state, either as a first language or as a second language in a phased manner." Those schools which do not teach Kannada are required to introduce the language. The government has drawn up a list of senior officials, including deputy directors and directors, who will monitor the implementation of the order. It isn't clear if the order will be implemented from this academic session.
