TRICHY: Stating that awareness about child rights is very less among children at the grassroots level, advocate and former member of   for Protection of Child Rights, T Jeyanthi  , has called for including child rights in school curriculum. She was speaking on the sidelines of a three-day summer camp conducted by People's Development Initiatives (PDI) for underprivileged children at K A P Viswanathan Primary School.

 Speaking to the students during the inauguration, Rani explained about the four fundamental child rights – Right to Survival, Right to Development, Right to Protection and Right to Participation – and insisted that they seek the help of Childline 1098 service whenever needed. “When you’re talking about social sciences like history and geography, it is high time that child rights is also added as a separate subject as a part of the curriculum,” she told TOI. Rani said that that the commission had framed a policy in this regard and submitted it to the government. Even before the commission for protection of child rights was formed in the state, several child rights clubs were started in schools across the district, she said. 
 
 On the other hand, S Thiyagarajan, city coordinator of Childline nodal agency,  , said that several initiatives were being organised across 330 child rights clubs in many schools across the district. “Several awareness programmes are being conducted for school children across the city. Children are slowly becoming aware of child rights,” he said. A total of 84 students from 15 slums are participating in the 16th summer camp programme conducted by the NGO, where yoga classes, craft workshop, and cultural events are organised.
