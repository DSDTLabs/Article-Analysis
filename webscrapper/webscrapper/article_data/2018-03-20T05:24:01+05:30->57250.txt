MUMBAI: On receiving reports of a black, oily patch in the sea off  , a team of civic employees began inspecting storm water drain (SWD) lines by opening manholes in the area to check the source of the pollutants. 

 One of the storm water drain outlets is located near   at  , where the black patch was seen. 
 
 Civic officials said that there is a possibility of some oil discharge having entered the sea through the SWD outlet. Local corporator Harshita Narwekar said that   employees had got to the job on Monday morning itself. “There could have been oil discharge from a petrol pump or one of the buildings in the area. It is essential that the BMC monitors SWD lines regularly to ensure that such incidents do not take place,” she said, adding that shortage of staff does not allow such close supervision.
 
 A civic official said that there are SWD manholes along Marine Drive at a 30m distance from one another. 
 
 Assistant municipal commissioner (A ward)   said they had received complaints about the patch from some locals. “While checking the SWD drains, some traces of oil were found. However, we are yet to locate the source. We are hoping that by Tuesday morning, we can reach the cource,” he said, adding, “The road is a busy stretch and it was difficult to check all manholes on Monday as it was holding up traffic.”
 
 Environmentalist said that such incidents show how there is no strict punishment for polluting the sea. “We treat our sea pathetically. There is an urgent need for stricter punishments for those who litter the sea. In fact, in some parts of the city, the sea is treated like a dump,” said activist Rishi Agarwal.
