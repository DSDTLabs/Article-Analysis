NEW DELHI: US-based   invited the ire of China after it published a questionnaire for its Chinese members, which listed  , among other Chinese territories, as separate country, reported Chinese state   news agency.

 
 On Tuesday, the global hotel chain had sent out a questionnaire to its Chinese members which listed Tibet, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan as options under the question "Which country are you from?"
 
 Even as the questionnaire was withdrawn following backlash by China's online community, the international hotel chain's official Twitter account added fuel to the fire when it liked a tweet by Tibetan separatist group.
 
 Following the incidents, authorities in Shanghai launched an investigation and demanded removal of all controversial content from the hotel's website and mobile app.
 
 A day later, the cyberspace administration of Shanghai ordered Marriott to shut down its Chinese website and the mobile app for a week.
 
 Amidst rising criticism, Marriott's Chief Executive Officer and president   apologised for the incidents and promised to take measures to prevent such incidents.
 
 "We don't support anyone who subverts the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China and we do not intend in any way to encourage or incite any such people or groups. We recognize the severity of the situation and sincerely apologize," Sorenson said in a statement.
 
 The questionnaire, which has violated China's cyber security and advertising laws, may lead to Marriott facing a maximum fine of one million Yuan ($153,822) or have its business license revoked.
 
 Marriott is operating 270 hotels with nearly 100,000 rooms in China.
