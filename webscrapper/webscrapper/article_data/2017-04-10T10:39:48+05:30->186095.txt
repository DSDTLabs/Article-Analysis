KOZHIKODE: Jishnu Pranoy’s 15-year-old sister   ended her four-day fast on Sunday night much to the relief of her relatives, residents and the district administration who were on tenterhooks after the teenager stood firm on her decision to continue her fast, despite her deteriorating health.

 She ended the fast at 9.20pm after talking to her uncle KK Sreejith and state attorney   who informed her that her family’s fight for justice had succeeded and that the government had agreed to their demands. Responding to media questions whether justice has been delivered to her deceased brother Jishnu, Avishna answered in the affirmative. Hundreds of people had gathered at her house in Valayam to witness the end of her agitation.
 
 The teenager, who went on a   demanding arrest of the accused responsible for her brother’s death and action against police officers who had allegedly manhandled her mother, had put the state government under tremendous pressure.
 
 As per the directive of the district administration, a doctor from the local hospital had been monitoring her health o on an hourly basis. Though doctors had suggested that Avishna be moved to a hospital as she was showing signs of dehydration and low blood pressure, she insisted on continuing her hunger strike at home.
 
 Meanwhile, actor Joy Mathew who visited her in the afternoon said that the silence of cultural activists of the state on the issue was surprising. “The fear of losing awards might have silenced them,” he said.
