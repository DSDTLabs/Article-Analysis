THANE: Six out of every ten offence, involving theft of valuables such as cash, ornaments or vehicles, in the lake city went undetected during 2017, according to data compiled by the police here, indicating to a grim reality about the failure of the police administration to bring to book those involved in these cases.

 Of the 5,300   offences registered across 35 police stations spanning from Kopri to Ulhanagar and Badlapur from January to December 2017, the crime   rate was a poor 37% as just about 1,950 cases were declared detected.
 
 Incidents of street crime such as chain-snatching remains a matter of concern for the common man in the Thane commissionerate area. Of the 333 such incidents reported last year, the police detected 185 cases with the remaining 45% being under investigation.
 
 Top police officials, however, said intensified street patrolling and preventive action by police commissioner Param Bir Singh has resulted in a sharp decline in the overall crime rate here.
 
 “As against 5,456 cases of property offences registered during 2016 with just 32% detection rate, the overall registration of these offences slipped to 5,300 cases in 2017 and the detection rate too improved to 37%,’’ a senior police officer said.
 
 Motor vehicle theft remains among the top three offences in Thane with a total of 1,588 cars, two-wheelers or heavy vehicles stolen causing monetary loss to the owners.
 
 Of the 5,300 cases seen in 2017, a bulk of the case or 29% were recorded in zone three, which includes eight police stations in   townships. 
 
 The highest number of 330 property offences were registered with the Manpada police, followed by 283 cases filed in Kolsewadi police station in 2017.
 
 Interestingly, the Bazarpeth police station which is also a part of this zone, recorded the highest 66% detection rate in the commissionerate.
 
 However, this police station, along with the Wagle Estate (61%) and Daighar (55%) police stations, are the only three pockets of the commissionerate which has a property crime detection rate of more than 50%.
 
 While the residential pockets, including Kopri, Vartak Nagar, Kapurbawdi, Kasarvadavli, Chitalsar and Rabodi, have seen lesser instances of robberies and car thefts than many others, the detection rates in their areas too hovers between a mere 30 to 49%.
