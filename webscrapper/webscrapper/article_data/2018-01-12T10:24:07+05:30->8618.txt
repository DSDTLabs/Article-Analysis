BAREILLY: A fast track court on Thursday sentenced six men to 20 years of rigorous imprisonment for gangrape of a 15-year-old girl on December 12, 2011.

  The court has also slapped a fine of Rs 71,000 each on the six accused. The girl's family had initially refused to lodge an FIR into the incident due to threats from the men but a complaint was later lodged after her rapists circulated a video of the sexual assault on WhatsApp.
 
 According to the court's order, a distant relative of the survivor, had told the minor that her sister was in labour pain and asked her to come with him on his motorbike. Halfway through their way, he had stopped near a sugarcane field where the seven accused persons were waiting for him. 
 
 While she was raped, one among them also filmed the act. Her father, who was then working in  , received a video of the act on his mobile phone some days later. The rapists had also threatened to release it online after which the girl's father met the then senior superintendent of police and an FIR was lodged on April 3, 2012 at the   police station here. 
 
 Additional district general counsel (ADGC), K M Khan, said, "The court of additional district judge   has sentenced Chhatrapal Jatav, Rakesh Dhobhi, Jitendra, Amit Sharma, Shobhit Sharma and   alias Kunwarsen to 20 years of rigorous imprisonment. The seventh accused was a juvenile at the time of the incident. His case is going on at the juvenile justice board. The court has also slapped fine of Rs 71,000 each on the six men. Of the total amount collected from the six accused, half of the money will be given to the rape survivor."
