Tirunelveli and Tuticorin corporations are confident of managing the summer days without much crisis. While the population of these corporations is about 8.42 lakh, Tamil Nadu   and Drainage (TWAD) Board, Tirunelveli, is upset over fast depleting water levels in the reservoirs feeding Thamirabarani River, which is the prime source of water to 28.45 lakh people, through pumping from 113 infiltration wells.

 "The daily requirement for the 27 combined water supply schemes (CWSS) in the district is 118 million (11.8 crore) litres, excluding the corporation. It covers five municipalities, 29 town panchayats and 1,939 rural habitations. The daily allotment per person per day varies from 55 litres to 135 litres based on various criteria. Now we are able to cater to their needs and are scared of the situation from April," a senior TWAD Board official told TOI.
 
 The official said that the fast depleting water level in reservoirs would result in a 10% (1.18 crore litres) drop in water distribution towards the end of March. "It could go up to 20% in April and 25 to 30% (3.54 crore litres) in June if we donâ€™t get the summer spells for a day or two," he said and added that the board is working on proposals to be sent to the government early next week to improve the summer water supply. People living in the tail end of these CWSS will be among the worst hit during a drought.
 
 Meanwhile, Tirunelveli corporation commissioner (in-charge) V Narayanan Nair said that the 15 of the 16 infiltration wells are on River Thamirabarani and are pumping 55 million litres a day (mld), against the requirement of 60 mld. "Residents are eligible for 130 litres per person per day (lpcd). We are providing 110 lpcd now," he said.
