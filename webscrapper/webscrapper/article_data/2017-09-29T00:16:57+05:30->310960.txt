Chennai: Despite funds being allotted for works, the city   has failed to carry out work on painting speed breakers and constructing pavements in Thiruvanmiyur. Residents, who petitioned the civic body for the works to be carried out, said officials failed to appoint contractors to take them up.

 A resident, requesting anonymity, said, “There are several speed-breakers along Srinivasapuram Main Road and surrounding streets in ward 182. The officials arrived recently with some workers from the highways department and painted just one speed-breaker in an attempt to close the file pertaining to our petition.” The residents wrote to the chief minister’s special cell after their civic officials failed to respond to them.
 
 According to an official reply, dated June 23, 2017, from the CM cell, Rs 4.35 lakh was allotted for painting all speed-breakers in ward 182 (zone 13). Only one speed-breaker has been painted on Srinivasapuram Main Road. A resident said, “The officials told us there is no need for other speed-breakers to be painted as they are fairly well-lit and visible from afar.”
 
 An official reply, dated August 18, read, “The proposed work of painting speed-breakers has been completed.” Further, Rs 7.8 lakh was allotted for constructing pavements in the ward. Roads were laid in the ward about a year ago but pavements were not constructed.
 
 Residents said they have been requesting officials for the past several weeks for construction of pavements. A resident said, “The officials have been stalling us. The work will be taken up only next year if it is not taken up before the onset of northeast monsoon.”
