JAIPUR:   has achieved 100% toilet construction target before time and is all set to be declared   about one-and-a-half years before deadline. In the last four years, the state has constructed over 79.29 lakh toilets in the rural areas covering 43,344 villages, under 295 panchayat samitis and 9,894 gram panchayats to achieve the onerous task.

 Sudarshan Sethi, additional chief secretary, Panchayati   and  , said the state has come closer to fulfilling the chief minister’s budget announcement of 2014 to achieve open defecation free (ODF) status. Already 10 districts have been declared ODF and for remaining 23 districts only the formality of verification –district, state and third party – remains. It would be completed in the next two months, Sethi said.
 
 “In the last financial year, 21.28 lakh toilets were constructed in the state to fulfil the target of the scheme,” he said.
 
 He said in 2014 when the Swachh Bharat scheme was launched, the percentage of toilets was only 34% which were mainly in the urban areas.
 
 The total cost of toilet construction in the state is Rs 6,808.80 crore and the subsidy is being transferred directly to the beneficiaries’ accounts. He said the state government has requested the Centre to expedite the payment of its share of Rs 1,261 crore to the state at the earliest. 
 
 According to government of India’s target for states, October 2, 2019 is the deadline to achieve 100% ODF status. But Rajasthan is all set to achieve the target in about one-and-a-half-years before time. This was achieved despite many backward districts including five tribal districts of south Rajasthan, he said.
 
 Complementing the team that worked tirelessly to achieve the target before deadline, he said, regular monitoring, training and motivation from the state level has been instrumental in achieving the target. He, however, said now the challenge is to change the mindset to use the facility. Users had to make their own arrangement for water.
