NEW DELHI:   has no conclusive evidence to prove that the 39 Indian construction workers abducted from   three years ago are either alive or dead, Iraq’s foreign minister Ibrahim   said on Monday.

 Al Jafari, who met his counterpart Sushma Swaraj on what is his first visit to India, also said there was no “absolute proof” that the missing Indians were in   near Mosul when it was under the control of the so-called Islamic State.
 
 “We don’t know if they are dead or alive,” said Al Jafari while interacting with journalists. “The jail of Badush is in the control of the Iraqi government. There are no prisoners there,” he added. He, however, clarified that the jail was under IS control for a while.
 
 The remarks by Iraq’s foreign minister Ibrahim Al Jafari is significant because Swaraj had said last week that, according to information available with the Indian government, the Indians were probably lodged in the Badush jail. This information was made available by MoS V K Singh who travelled to both Erbil and Baghdad after news broke out that Mosul had been freed from terror group IS.
 
 Al Jafari, however, sounded ambivalent about whether or not any such information about the Indians being in Badush was provided by Iraqi authorities to India.
 
 “It may or may not have been. Daesh (IS) is known to transfer people from one place to another and it’s possible that an Iraqi government source conveyed that information but no one knows if that was the final destination,” said Al Jafari.
 
 The foreign minister said that Iraq was working on the assumption that they were still alive and that the Iraqi government was doing all it could to trace them. “We have announced financial incentives too for any information on the missing Indians,” said Al Jafari.He appealed to the Indian people to have patience as he expressed hope that his government would be able to trace the Indians.
