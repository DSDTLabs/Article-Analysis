It was   that initiated the fight against unreasonable prices of   in the country.
TOI in its report, `Fixed price for cardiac stents on anvil' published on September 16, 2015, had reported how the national drug pricing regulator agreed in principle to the Maharashtra FDA 's proposal to slash prices of the stents by including it under the Drug Price Control Order (DPCO), thereby setting the ball rolling to cap the cardiac stent prices in India.
 
 It was in a meeting of the   in New Delhi in July 2015 that the FDA submitted the first report with clinching evidence of sky-high profiteering in the cardiac stents. Patients were being charged a bomb (exaggerated MRPs in the range of 1282%) for stents used to unblock clogged arteries. The report set in motion a chain of events that led to the capping of stent prices on February14, amid protests from stakeholders.
 
 Medical devices, including cardiac stents, are notified as drugs under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, but they were included in the price control order. Therefore, the prices of medical devices couldn't be regulated leading to excessive profiteering.
 
 “The state FDA had also urged the authority to bring the cardiac stents under the   following reports that trading firms were selling the device at inflated prices through a growing nexus of distributors and hospitals. Then state FDA minister Girish Bapat had also followed up with the Union health minister   on the same. All these collectively bore fruits,“ Harshadeep Kamble, who submitted the FDA report in July 2015, said.
 
 The FDA 's first letter to the Centre was sent in 2011 under then commissioner Mahesh Zagade. While price regulation appeared in the agenda and meetings of the Drug Controller General of India, the issue gained momentum only after the July 2015 FDA report.
