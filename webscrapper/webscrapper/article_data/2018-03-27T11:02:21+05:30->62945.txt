GUWAHATI: A disturbing trend that started with the spine-chilling rape of   in Delhi in 2012, has been the rise of juveniles as criminals. In the December 16 sexual assault on Nirbhaya in a moving bus, the cruellest tormentor was a juvenile. Records over a period of six years from 2010 to 2016 in   too show under-age criminals are on the rise. And the biggest victims are proving to be minors-some as young and innocent as five years and below! The shocking rape in   last week, also had two minors in the gang. 

 Giving out details of the growing number of rape cases in the state,   said on Monday 10% of the rape victims between 2010 and 2016 were found to be minors-which again brings into focus the safety of a girl child in the state. Nagaon was not an isolated case. In total, 1,200 minors were raped within that period. Nearly 1,275 rape cases were registered where the victims were minors in that period. The total number of rape cases, the police said, was an alarming 12,633 in that survey period. Nearly 290 minors were also accused of rape, including two gang-rapes, in the state during this period.
 
 "From 39 rape cases of minors in 2010, the number went up to 464 in 2016, the highest within the time frame. Luckily, the numbers were only 42 in 2015 whereas it was 127 in 2014," an Assam Police official said quoting figures. In 2013, rape cases touched 230. In 2012, the number was 333. In 2011, the number of cases related to minors was 40. 
 
 An interesting aspect of these rape cases is the age of the victims. At least three of the victims were not even five years of age. "Besides, there were 98 victims who were between six and 12 years. Some 407 victims were between 12 and 16 years and 767 were between 16 and 18 years," police records revealed.
 
 Manisha Dev Barman, a researcher in human behaviour and allied sciences, said, "The growing number of juvenile criminals is indeed disturbing. It is indicative of lack of proper sex education in schools. Studies have already established that children who are inclined to be abusive are often from dysfunctional homes, exposed to either physical or sexual abuse and could be in an environment of drug and alcohol abuse." 
 
 Child rights activist   said the only way to bring down the crime graph is to opt for a holistic approach.
