VADODARA: Pravinsinh Chauhan, Panchmahal strongman and son of   MP Prabhatsinh Chauhan, died at a hospital in the city late on Tuesday night. Pravinsinh was cremated at his native village   in Panchmahal district on Wednesday afternoon.

 Pravinsinh had suffered a brain haemorrhage after he fell while going to a hospital for a dialysis on Monday. He was suffering from kidney ailments since quite some time now and had been under treatment. He was rushed to Vadodara on Monday and had to be put on a ventilator as his condition was critical.
 
 He died late night on Tuesday and his body was taken to Mehlolni Muvadi in the early hours on Wednesday. Prabhatsinh had also reached Vadodara on learning about his sonâ€™s deteriorating condition.
 
 A large number of persons had remained present at Mehlolni Muvadi to pay tributes to Pravinsinh who had a Robinhood-like image in the area. He was cremated on the banks of Meshri river on Friday afternoon amidst the presence of a large crowd.
 
 Pravinsinh was named in a series of offences till 2007 and was also detained under the Prevention of Anti-social Activities (PASA) Act, but had largely kept away from controversies after that. Later, his name had cropped up only in connection with an offence of violation of poll code and a cricket betting racket.
