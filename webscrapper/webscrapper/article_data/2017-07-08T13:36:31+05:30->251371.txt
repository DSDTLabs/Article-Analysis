NOIDA: Exactly a week after the   (GST) or the 'one nation, one tax' regime has been clocked in, the traders' community claim they are still loaded with supply backlog to assess the real impact of the bill. With changes in the   on commodities,   claim that the real   and loss cannot be ascertained unless   are exhausted. 

 "Because most of the shopkeepers still have a lot of old stock piled up and are presently selling the goods under new tax rates, the real impact on the books is not being reflected. Items for which taxes have gone down, sales are still at old rates at places. For items that taxes have gone up, the same thing is being carried out. So, the seller now is focused on eliminating old stock,"  , president, Gautam Budh Nagar chapter of Uttar Pradesh Vyapar Mandal (UPVM) told TOI.
 
 Jain had been over the last two months hosting workshops all over Noida and Greater Noida, explaining the ramifications of the Goods and Sales Tax (GST) to the small businessmen. UPVM had also sent a detailed feedback to the Ministry of Finance, stating that the transition would take longer than expected.
 
 "Though the shift in tax regime is much desired, it will take time to soak into the ground. So many retailers are now waiting for the old stock to get scarce. Once the fresh stocks arrive and sales increase, the correct balance between taxes paid at point of purchase and taxes paid at point of sales would be adequately calculated," Jain stated.
 According to the traders and retailers, it would take a month to exhaust existing stocks.
 
 "While the account books have started registering GST from July 1, by August 1 correct representation will reflect. However, overall, we welcome the simplified tax regime. We are indeed headed towards the main motive of ease of doing business," Jain added.
