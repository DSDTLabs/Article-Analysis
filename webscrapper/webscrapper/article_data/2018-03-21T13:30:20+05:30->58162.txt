Nagpur: ‘Panyachya Hakkasathi’, a tribute to well-known Marathi littérateurs, was organized by Swayamdeep Parivar to mark   Satyagrah Kranti Divas, at Vidarbha Hindi Sahitya Sammelan hall, on Tuesday.

 Bhanukumar  , coordinator and music director of the event, adapted songs based on scriptures and poems written by Marathi wordsmiths with Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar and his contribution towards society as the theme. 
 
 Quoting Ambedkar on self-reliance and enlightenment, Raut and Sushma Bhagat rendered ‘Ath deep bhav swayamdeep ho’, which was originally composed by Shantaram Nandgaonkar.
 
 Classically trained singers Kanchan Teltumble, Aruna Chaudhary and Raut enthralled the audience with ‘Labhla arth tujya mule’, ‘Jagvila tu manus ithla’, ‘Yethe samantecha tu deep’, ‘Hey Bhimrao tujya pasuni’, ‘Shilpkar jeevanacha Bhim’, ‘Tu amar te akhand’, ‘Pani wadh ga maay’, ‘Panyachya hakkasathi’, ‘Bhim motyacha haar ga’, ‘Unhatanhat tarun na re’, ‘Kar gaya kar gaya’, ‘Tum na hotey hum na hotey’, ‘Chavdar talyachi kathi’ and ‘Gyan surya tu iss jagat ka’.
 
 ‘Uddharli koti kule’, rendered by five-year-old Saransh Gajbhiye, was a surprise element of the show. 
 
 Talking about the linguists, Raut said, ‘Every poetry composed has its own imprint of the Mahad agitation. Present compositions of Ketan Pimplapure, Ramesh Thete and Waman Kardak are deeply influenced by the worst condition of the untouchables in 1930s.”
 
 Describing the power of music compositions, Raut said, “Poetry accounts the melody of life and teaches the significance of righteousness. One should try to understand ideologies in them and follow them.”
 
 The accompanying artistes were Ashok Thawre, Prashil Bobde and Raut. The event, conceptualized by Bhagat, was hosted by Ankita Raut.
