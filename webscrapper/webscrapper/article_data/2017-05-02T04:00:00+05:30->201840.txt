Vadodara: Congress national vice-president Rahul Gandhi made a surprise visit to a tribal village soon after offering prayers at the Devmogra Mataji temple ahead of the public meeting at Dediapada on Monday.

 Gandhi had left Vadodara in a helicopter and landed at Gangapur from where he left by road for Devmogra temple. While returning to Gangapur to board his chopper again, Gandhi stopped at the Pada village for a few minutes. He met the tribal family staying at a house there and spoke to them.
 
 “We could not hear what transpired there. Besides security personnel, the only persons accompanying him were Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) president Bharatsinh Solanki and leader of opposition Shankarsinh Vaghela,” said GPCC delegate from Sagbara taluka in Narmada district Dr Gambhirsinh Vasava.
