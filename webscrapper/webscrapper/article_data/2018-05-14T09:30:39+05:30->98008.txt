CHENNAI: Actor  , who is set to launch his own political party soon, met youth wing office bearers of the   Makkal Mandram (RMM) on Sunday. RMM is expected to serve as the backbone for Rajinikanth’s’s political plunge. He advised them to strengthen the “mandram” at the village level.

 
 The meeting also provided an opportunity for youth wing members to bring to the actor’s notice the problems they face in the districts. They also told Rajinikanth that support for him is huge among women across the state.
 
 “Today, it is the youth who represent the change and are also best placed to take the message for change. While they brought to his attention certain problems that they face in the districts, he advised them to strengthen the ‘mandram’ and its structure at the village level,”  , state secretary, RMM, told TOI.
 
 “Our focus has been on branch committees at the village level. We are working to have at least 30 active members in each one of them across the state,” he said. With elections still quite a distance away, the meeting did not focus on other issues.
