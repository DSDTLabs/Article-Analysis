Mysuru: Members and leaders of the   staged a protest here on Saturday demanding that   apologise to the Mysuru royal family, after he addressed the Maharajas in the singular. 

 The protesters said that they would not allow the CM to offer pujas o Goddess Chamundeshwari during the Dasara procession on September 30 if he failed to tender an apology. 
 
 Protesting under the banner of ‘Aramane Ulisi Horata Samithi’, the community members expressed their anger at some of Siddaramaiah’s remarks, wherein he said that the the many acts of public service rendered by the   came from taxes collected from the public, and not their own money. The CM’s remarks triggered a contriversy after a video went viral on social media, subsequently leading to BJP activists staging a demonstration as well. 
 
 While the members of the erstwhile royal family have steered clear of the controversy, the issue has been taken up by the Urs community. On Saturday, the protesters took out a rally from the Balarama Gate of Mysuru Palace and submitted a petition to the deputy commissioner. “Maharajas focussed on the planned growth of Mysuru and contributed immensely to its development,” they said. 
 
 The agitators also asked the government to install a statue of the former MP Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar at a junction abutting the palace. The Suttur Math is now installing a statue of former seer Shivaratri Rajendra Swami at the junction, which the agitators opposed.
