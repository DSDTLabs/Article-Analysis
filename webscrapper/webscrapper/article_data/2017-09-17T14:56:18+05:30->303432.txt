JALANDHAR: Aam Aadmi Party on Sunday announced Major General Suresh Khajuria (retd) as party candidate from Gurdaspur parliament seat.   and Congress are yet to announce their candidates.

 Khajuria’s candidature was announced by Leader of Opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira and Punjab unit chief Bhagwant Mann in a joint press conference. They said that they had picked up a local candidate while those being considered by Congress and BJP were not local candidates.
 
 Khajuria, 64, originally hailing from village Bhungal near Pathankot, is living in   city. By fielding him, AAP is not only expecting to woo ex-servicemen but has also tried to attract Hindu voters, who have considerable presence in the Gurdaspur Lok Sabha constituency, especially in three assembly segments of district Pathankot.
 
 Khaira said that they decided the name of the candidate after consultations with Gurdaspur unit of the party and the   region leaders and volunteers. “We are proud to state that our candidate has a distinguished career in the armed forces by serving the country while candidates of both the traditional parties BJP and the Congress are likely to be outsiders – from Mumbai and Abohar respectively,” he said.
 
 He also said that they would run a clean campaign and would spend within the limits prescribed by Election Commission. He also attacked Congress saying the suicides by farmers had rather increased in the last six months.
 
 Bhagwant Mann also took a dig at Punjab Chief Minister Captain   saying that he had not gone out for six times in the state in the last six months.
 On this occasion Khajuria said that he served the army for 40 years and for the last five years he was working with ex-servicemen and since 2013 he joined AAP as a volunteer.
  
 BJP Punjab unit has sent names of late MP Vind Khanna's wife Kavita Khanna and senior BJP leaders Swaran Salaria to the party high command. Congress remains a divided house.
