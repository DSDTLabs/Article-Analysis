It’s common knowledge that it takes a lot of hard work to keep our   industry going. Churning out quality entertainment daily is a full-time job that gives little or no breaks. One would expect our tele-stars to spend their rare holiday indulging in family time or engaging in retail therapy. In sharp contrast, a bunch of soap stars made good of their time off and turned up to do some  , more specifically to plant saplings and vegetables in the front yards of homes in two chosen villages of  .
 Spearheaded by  , the programme called Krushi Kushi saw 45 TV stars come together to participate in the day-long activity. “The last time we undertook such an activity, we were in paddy fields. This time it was all about planting medicinal plants and vegetables in the garden space of the villagers and propagating the benefits of not using pesticides. This was how plantains and veggies were grown earlier,” says Shruti.
  The 45-member were divided into two teams and 150 students joined them. “The idea was to show these young minds the joy of returning to nature instead of heading to a neighbourhood pub on a weekend. For many, it was a revelation — they didn’t know how ragi or wheat was grown and their only knowledge of eating came from junk food. It was heart-warming to see their reaction. Growing food the good old traditional way is what we should all aim at,” sums up Shruti.
