AHMEDABAD:   alias   was taken on Saturday to a bungalow at a Danilimda society which — police say — had been rented by co-accused Qayamuddin Kapadia for sheltering terror operatives who came to Ahmedabad to plant bombs.

 “Twenty-one bombs were planted at 17 places in the city on July 26, 2008. They exploded within a span of 45 minutes, from about 6.15pm,” a crime branch official said. “Fifty-six people lost their lives in the terror strike, and over 200 were injured,”
 
 Senior crime branch officials said Subhan had also stayed at the bungalow and hence he was taken there for a reconstruction of the sequence of events which would be laid down in the panchnama.
 
 “Subhan will also be taken to another rented house in Vatva where he had stayed and organized several meetings in which he delivered radical speeches to lure Muslims youths into terrorism,” an investigator said.
 
 Crime branch sources said Subhan had fled the city just ten days before the blasts and had taken shelter in   and Jharkhand before sneaking into Nepal through Raxual border in 2009.
 
 “He stayed in Nepal and worked as an English teacher at a private school under the fake identity of Abdul Rehman,” the senior crime branch official said. “He was arrested last month from the outskirts of Delhi by the special cell of the Delhi Police. The Ahmedabad crime branch brought him on a transfer warrant and arrested him in the serial blasts case.”
