AHMEDABAD: Milan Mistry, 29, went through a nightmare after his throat was slit by a kite thread coated with  . Mistry, a city-based software engineer was travelling to Ahmedabad from Viramgam on Christmas Day on his two-wheeler, when he felt a sudden stinging sensation on his neck. Thinking it was a superficial cut he drove on for around a kilometre, wrapping a handkerchief around his throat. Then, to his horror, he realized his clothes were drenched with blood.

 Mistry was discharged from a private hospital on   on Tuesday. He walked out with an artificial windpipe after spending 10 days in ICU. He’s still unable to speak, his uncle,   told TOI.
 
 “In the beginning, he consulted some doctor in Sachana area near Viramgam, but as the cut was very deep and affected the windpipe, doctors advised him to rush to some hospital in Ahmedabad. He was taken to a private hospital on SG Road, within a couple of hours of the accident,” said Jyotindra.
 
 “The surgery has saved my nephew’s life, but I pray that people don’t use such deadly manja,” said Jyotindra, who has been leading a movement against Chinese manja.
 
 Dr Minesh Mehta, Critical Care Specialist at the private hospital, told TOI, “When Mistry was brought to us, we found his blood pressure extremely low due to loss of blood. The injury had exposed his jugular vein, and he was in pain to breathe.”
 
 A team including Dr Mehta, surgeon Chirag Shah and Dr Bhaumik Shah operated on Mistry on the same day.
 
 “We immediately performed tracheotomy, incision in the windpipe to relieve an obstruction to breathing, and after that he was kept on ventilator,” Mehta said.
 
 “After the surgery, the patient’s condition worsened as he developed pneumonia due to blood loss and had to be kept on ventilator for over a week,” added Mehta.
