AHMEDABAD: Just when pomegranate farming was getting popular with dry farmland cultivators in North   and Kutch using drip irrigation, an  ,  , has begun infesting pomegranate plants. A team of scientists from Indian Council of Agricultural Research-National Research Center on Pomegranate (ICAR-NRCP), Solapur, had discovered the first L japonica infestation in a farm in Nakhatrana in Kutch district. The problem was immediately reported by the ICAR-NRCP scientist team that included Mallikarjun Harsur, Sunil Joshi and Ram Krishna Pal.

 The researchers observed L japonica, during March 2016, on a single pomegranate plant. “In a span of 9 to 10 months, the insect had spread to 58 five-year-old plants causing yellowing of the leaves, stunted growth and poor fruit. Its incidence gradually increased during July and August,” states their report.
 
 The pests first appear as white specks and then slowly and completely covers the stem, branches and twigs with insect colonies containing males, females and its immature stages. 
 
 The averages length of an adult female is between 1.3mm and 1.5mm while it is 0.55 to 0.65 mm in width. L japonica have small microducts. The pest first infests the bark on the branches and trunk of its hosts. Heavy infestations causes senescence — where the plant cell loses its power of division and growth — and causes die-back of infested branches, resulting in premature leaf fall.
 
 Low infestations of L japonica leads to cracks in the bark too. 
 
 Dinu Suthariya a Bhuj dealer in pomegranates came across the finding in the NCRP journal, “The state agriculture department has not warned us of any pomegranate infestation. It was only when I read the   on Pomegranate ( NRCP) 2016-17 annual report on the infestation that I learnt about the new pest,” he said. “Till now most pomegranate produce is clean and healthy except for a few kilos of stunted fruits. But we have not been issued warnings by Gujarat’s agriculture department.”
