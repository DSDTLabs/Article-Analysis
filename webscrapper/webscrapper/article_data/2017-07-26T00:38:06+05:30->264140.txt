Thanjavur: A four-member gang hacked a 34-year-old famer to death in Thanjavur on Tuesday morning. Police suspected it to be a case of previous enmity. 

 According to police, four unidentified men attacked S Rajasimhan, son of former AIADMK functionary Sigamani and a native of Udaiyarkoil near Ammapettai in Thanjavur, with sharp weapons while while he was walking along a railway gate near Saliyamangalam around 10 am on Tuesday. Rajasimhan sustained critical injuries in the attack and died on the spot.
 
 On information, police recovered the body and sent it to Thanjavur Government Medical College Hospital for post mortem. 
 
 Police sources said that Rajasimhan was reportedly involved in a   case in 2001. He was later acquitted in the case. This may be the reason behind the incident, they added. 
 
 Ammapettai police have registered a case and are on the lookout for the accused.
