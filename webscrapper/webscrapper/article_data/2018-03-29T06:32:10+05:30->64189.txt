The commission, during one of its hearings earlier, found that the Deys were charged for this service though it was not rendered to Oyetri. Thereafter, the hospital decided to refund the amount. The couple, however, refused to accept the refund.
 
 "When my daughter needed ventilation support, the hospital denied the service leading to her death. Now they are returning the amount? We will send back the cheque to the hospital," Shampa told TOI.
