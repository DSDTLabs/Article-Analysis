HYDERABAD: The   in   is on its way to death, say environmentalists. This is thanks to inflow of sewerage not only from surrounding residential complexes but also polluted water flowing downstream from  . 

 “The process of diverting sewage from the Durgam Cheruvu began nearly three months ago. It is being diverted downstream to Malkam Cheruvu. It is the   that has taken up this project. They informed us that once Durgam Cheruvu is cleaned, the capacity of the existing Sewerage Treatment Plant at the lake will be enhanced to treat the water,” said Mohammed Faisal, the architect in-charge of the Durgam Cheruvu lakefront development project. 
 
 Officials of the  , however, claimed that special arrangements have been made to ensure that the sewage diverted from Durgam Cheruvu does not make its way into Malkam Cheruvu.
 
 “While it is true that the sewage is being diverted downstream, it is not being diverted into Malkam Cheruvu. We have constructed culverts to ensure that it flows elsewhere,” said Shekhar Reddy, superintending engineer of lakes, GHMC.
 
 Environmentalists, however, dismiss this claim. “Authorities have laid pipes which carry toxic, sewage-filled water where the inflow channels of the Malkam Cheruvu are located. Also of concern is the dumping of truckloads of mud on the lakebed — an initiative of the GHMC that has plans to construct a walking track along the lake. In violation of a high court directive on May 25 that directed GHMC not to carry out construction, authorities have continued the work over the past two days,” said   of Save Our Urban Lakes. SOUL will carry out a cleaning drive at Malkam cheruvu on Sunday to remove the mud.
 
 Although GHMC will roll out a Rs 400 crore project to clean and construct sedimentation tanks inside 20 lakes, Malkam Cheruvu is not in the list. “At Malkam Cheruvu, we will only remove hyacinth, build a fence and walking track,” said Reddy.
