MUMBAI:  , a student of  , aims to get into   to pursue a major in economics. A good   or ACT (American College Testing) score — standardised examination for admission to US colleges — would have been enough to secure admission to the Ivy League institute, but the 16-year-old has gone ahead and aced the exams with perfect scores in both — a rare feat.

 Agarwal scored 1600/1600 in the new pattern of SAT and 36/36 in ACT. Most students take either of the exams. “I took it up as a personal challenge. I had always wanted to appear for SAT, and I started preparation about five months ago. To appear for ACT was a last-minute decision,” said Agarwal, adding that his reading habit helped him in his preparation.
 
 He has his plans all made. “I want to get into investment banking for a short period in the US after completing my studies. Then I intend to return to India and join politics and become the finance minister someday,” said Agarwal.
