The fate of TV shows is often decided by the popularity of its characters and there have been instances in the past where a popular   saw a downtrend after the exit of an actor playing the lead character. To avoid any such situation, producers of popular TV show ‘Zindagi Ki Mehak’ took note of rumours that  , who plays the lead character   in the show, would be quitting and have acted upon it. As per sources, the producers had a meeting with Karan recently, and it was decided that he would continue doing the show as Shaurya, even after the show takes a leap. The actor confirmed that he is not leaving and expressed that he was “unhappy by the way some people on social media abused the producers, based upon the rumours.” 

 He said, “The show would be taking a time leap and it is yet not decided if it would be 18 or 20 years. As the storyline would take a new track, I was apprehensive about playing an old man in the show. I was not happy with the storyline and I didn’t want to be seen 20 years older than my age, but I had never decided to quit the show. It was all rumours and the way people reacted to them surprised me. While I was happy to see how much people love my character in the show and were sending me sweet messages, there were some people on social media abusing the producers and even commenting on my family. Therefore, I think it is important for me to let people know that I am not quitting the show.”

The audience will see a new avatar of Shaurya and the story will take an interesting turn, but it would continue to be a romantic story,” he said.
