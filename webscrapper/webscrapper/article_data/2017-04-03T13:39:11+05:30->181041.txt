Actor  , who has always voiced his opinions about social issues, has come out strongly against the   project. "These projects are aimed at only one thing, to enable swindling of money. Electricity generation is the least of their concerns. 1800 crores is the budget they have set. You can install solar panels in common people's homes using this money." We should channelise solar energy for power, he goes on to say. "Intelligent people do that, while idiots destrot forests and rivers for solar energy."

 People should look at the statistics and see for themselves how badly planned the   is, he says.
