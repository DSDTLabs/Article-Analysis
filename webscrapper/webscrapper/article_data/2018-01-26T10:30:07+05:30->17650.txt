INDORE:   was only nine years old when she saw Pakistan backed terrorist   firing indiscriminately at people in Mumbai’s CST railway station

 On November 26, 2008 the little girl, along with her father and brother Jayesh, was waiting to board a train to Pune to meet her eldest brother Bharat, when the terrorist’s bullet struck her in the right leg.
 
 “We first thought some Haj pilgrims were celebrating by bursting crackers. When we saw blood and people dying, it was nothing less than a nightmare,”   said, recalling the horror of that fateful day.
 
 She later recovered from the bullet wound after undergo six operations. But identifying Kasab as main perpetrator of 26/11 attacks during the trial changed her and her family’s life completely. The testimony had filled her with a sense of pride but this act of hers made their friends and relatives virtually ostracize them as they feared a backlash from terror outfits. Even her eldest brother refused to invite his father and siblings to his wedding.
 
 Devika’s father Natwarlal, who had a flourishing business of dry fruits in Mumbai’s   area had to shut his shop after the attacks as no trader was ready to do business with him. His profits dipped and he had to shift his house from Bandra to   as it was more affordable. There, he was given a job at a general store by one of his community members.
 
 Helping Devika go to school was another struggle for the family, as no school was ready to admit her. However, after many protests when she was accepted by a school, she was boycotted by her friends and teachers who used to call her names.
 
 “I was called Kasab’s daughter, Kasab wali and other such names. But I ignored everyone and did what was right,” said Devika, who is in class 10 now and aims to become an IPS officer.
 
 She along with her father and brother arrived in the city on Thursday and will hoist the national flag at   on Republic Day.
