PANAJI: Apathy from the state government is ruining the   school and livelihood of some teachers is at stake, said the institution’s secretary Subhash   on Friday. He said, the school, founded by RSS leaders, has not been able to complete the recruitment process of nine teachers for the last eight months as the education department has not yet approved it. As a result, these teachers are unable to receive salaries. 

 Velingkar said the government is interfering in the running of Vidya Prabodhini and even tried to change the school management by influencing some of its members. 
 
 On the directions of chief minister  , who also holds the education portfolio, the education department has stopped doing its routine work of the school, Velingkar said. 
 
 Velingkar said the teachers would launch a protest if the approval is not received within a week.
 
 Calling Velingkar’s charges baseless, BJP spokesperson   said, “Appropriate steps are been taken by the government.”
