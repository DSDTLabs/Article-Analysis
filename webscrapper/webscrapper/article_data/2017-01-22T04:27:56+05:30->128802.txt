Mumbai: Two days after 11 doctors from the ophthalmology department of the state government-run   in   wrote to the high court-appointed   committee about withdrawing their complaint against hospital dean   and department head Dr  , they have written yet another letter. This time, they said that their withdrawal was "not made under any pressure''. 

 "We would like to state that we do not want any further enquiry against them as things in the last eight months have changed for the better and we are comfortable working here,'' the letter said. 
 
 They have also said that their exams be conducted in JJ Hospital itself. "We don't have any problem with Dr Ragini Parekh and Dr Lahane being our examiners,'' they said. 
 
 The committee had on Friday allowed one of the doctors who has not withdrawn her complaint to give her exam at Nair Hospital.
