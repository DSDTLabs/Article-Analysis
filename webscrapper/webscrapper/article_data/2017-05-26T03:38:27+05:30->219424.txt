GHAZIABAD: The fee hike confrontation opened a new front on Thursday as a petition signed by over 70 parents against  , Rajendra Nagar, was submitted at Sahibabad police station. 

 The parents alleged harassment by the school which threatened to issue TCs (transfer certificates) to their wards via phone calls if they failed to submit the hiked fee along with development charges in the coming week.
 
 The school authorities, on the other hand, was firm in their stance that the stay order by the Allahabad high court was applicable only to government schools.
 
 Hundreds of parents who visited the school to submit fees alleged mistreatment and blatant refusal by the school authorities to accept anything less than the 51% ‘hiked fee’ along with the annual and development charges, failing which they would begin issuing TCs to their children.
 
 The school management, however, rubbished the allegation of making ‘threat calls’ and have stated that they have not received any order from the district magistrate barring them from charging the fee, hence they would continue charging as they will.
 
 There has been lack of clarity after the three-member district committee’s report released on May 11 was kept under wraps and sent to the state government for a final call.
