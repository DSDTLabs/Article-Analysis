Director   has announced his next —  , which will star Sasikumar, who starred in the original. However, the film will not be a sequel to the first film. “This one will have the flavour of Naadodigal, but is a completely different story,” says Samuthirakani, who is currently busy with the script work of the film. “Like that film, this one, too, is set in a town, and will talk about love and friendship. It will also touch upon the issue of caste,” he reveals.

 Samuthirakani has roped in   to play the female lead in this film. “This might sound clichéd, but both Anjali and Sasikumar have such strong roles that either of the two could be contenders for the National Award,” he states.
 
 He has also cast Bharani and Namo Narayanan, who were part of the first film. The up-and-coming   will also be seen in a crucial role, but he adds the she isn’t paired opposite Bharani. “The story’s focus is not on who is paired opposite whom, but on each of these characters, and how they become linked. I usually take inspiration for my characters from the society, and these characters, too, will be closer to real life. They will be representative of contemporary youngsters,” he elaborates. 
 
 Justin Prabhakaran of Oru Naal Koothu fame will be composing the music while NK Ekambaram will be handling the cinematography. The film will go on floors by March, informs Samuthirakani.
