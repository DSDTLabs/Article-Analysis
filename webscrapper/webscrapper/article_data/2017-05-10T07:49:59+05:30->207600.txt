PUNE: Social activist   has demanded a thorough investigation into the allegations made by former Delhi minister   against chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. 

 He has warned of an agitation for Kejriwal’s resignation if he is found guilty. 
 
 Speaking to reporters at Ralegan Siddhi on Tuesday Anna said, “ There should be a thorough investigation in this case. If Kejriwal is found guilty, I will personally undertake an agitation at   and demand that he resigns.”
 
 Mishra, on Sunday, accused Kejriwal of taking Rs 2 crore from a   colleague. He had accused Kejriwal of graft after he was sacked. 
 
 “Whatever the former minister has said against Kejriwal, it was only after his removal. If he was the minister when the alleged money exchange took place, why did not he alert the authorities?” the anti-corruption crusader wanted to know. 
 
 Last month, Hazare had launched an attack on Kejriwal saying that he was deeply pained by the V K Shunglu committee report. The committee report indicted Kejriwal’s government for bypassing law, nepotism and financial irregularities, among others. 
 
 “I am pained by the Shunglu committee report because Arvind was with me in the fight against corruption. I had great hopes from the young and educated Kejriwal and felt that young people like him will create a corruption-free nation. But he has dashed all my hopes,” Hazare had said in a statement issued from Ralegan Siddhi last month.
