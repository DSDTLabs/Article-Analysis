MARGAO: The   spring in  , a favoured   for those in the vicinity trying to beat the summer heat, is littered with garbage strewn around by visitors, and locals are not happy. Concerned that such unbridled littering would pollute the pristine waters of the spring, village youth are now taking turns to keep watch on visitors. 

 “What troubles us is that some visitors litter the place and dump the leftovers of their meals into the spring waters,” said Janardan Gaonkar, a local. “They should realize that the water is also used by locals for drinking and washing.” Another villager, clearly annoyed at the misbehaviour of visitors, said, “Everyone is welcome to our village, but please do not pollute its natural resources.” 
 
 Rivona, in Quepem taluka and 25km from  , is blessed with numerous natural springs, that make the quaint village a popular getaway for picnickers during the summer and monsoon. The Takazor, particularly, is an all-time favourite. It has five large flows which enable several people to bathe at the same time. Villagers say that not long ago, there was a brick wall dividing the bathing space into two compartments — one for men and one for women. However, locals say that some miscreants damaged the wall, leading to reduced flow. 
 
 Some say that the water of the spring tastes a bit like raw buttermilk, and this perhaps lent it its name — Takazor — from ‘tak’, the Konkani word for buttermilk. The waters are also believed to possess medicinal properties, and many domestic tourists head to Rivona to get rid of their skin ailments and other health problems. In the village, faith in the spring runs high. “Even mental disorders get cured if one bathes in the waters of the takazor three or four times,” said a village elder. 
 
 The Takazor also serves the irrigation needs of the village. The orchards and palm trees in the vicinity only add to its serenity.
