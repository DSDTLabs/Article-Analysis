KOLKATA: Remember Amitabh Bachchan jiving to ‘Saara Zamana’ in 1981 blockbuster ‘Yaarana’? The light-studded costume of Big B had become an instant hit and remained an eternal favourite of Bolly buffs for all these years. And now, Kolkata   personnel have brought the sweet memories back by introducing ‘body lights’ for those manning the traffic on Kolkata roads. 

 Introduced in the ‘season of fog’, Lalbazar sources said it’s a move to ensure safety of cops, especially in stretches that are dimly lit, accident-prone or remain shrouded in heavy fog. Recently, 1,000 red-and-blue LED shoulder lights were distributed among sergeants. Another 3,000 will be ordered soon. “This time, we will distribute them even among constables. Their safety and security is important to us,” said DC (Traffic)  . 
 
 The LED lights will function as a warning equipment. When the traffic personnel work in late evenings and night, the lights will help commuters spot them from even 500 meters away. “This will allow motorists check their speed and know that they are being watched. It has three advantages – one, the device will act as a protective device. Two, it will help cops during checks and last, it will act as a deterrent against speeding and signal violation as motorists will know that they are under watch,” said a Lalbazar officer.
 
 Several late evening accidents involving police personnel — a sergeant recently lost his legs in a minibus accident near   — led cops to think of ways to ensure their safety. 
 
 The jury on the new device is still out. While a section of sergeants told TOI they felt “safer,” others were not yet sure of its efficacy. “In winters, our white uniform is not visible as we wear blue jackets. There have been countless occasions when drivers have allowed us the first right of road after spotting us from a distance,” a sergeant from   traffic guard recalled.
