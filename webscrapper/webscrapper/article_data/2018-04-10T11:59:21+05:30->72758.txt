CHENNAI: Thick smoke pillowed out of the   landfill for over six hours on Monday as   struggled to put down a sudden fire in the trash heap, which caused toxic gas to pervade the neighbourhood's atmosphere.

 According to residents, smoke had filled up the atmosphere as early as 9 am. “For a few years, the landfill's trash had not caught fire or set fire to. There used to be occasional fires but nothing as big,” said  , a local resident.   added that the fire caused irritation to motorists on the Tondiarpet High Road.
 
 "The smoke was visible for everyone because it happened right at the entrance near the weigh bridge," Perumal said.
 
 Greater Chennai Corporation officials told TOI that there was no blaze. "The fire was minor. The smoke made it seem like there was a blaze. We used earth movers to flatten the trash that caught fire and levelled mud to douse the fire," said an official.
 
 The officer added that heat was a big reason as to why the fire started. "After the rain, there was moisture in the trash so instances of fire was minimal. Due to the temperature increase, the trash is dry. Finer particles fly off in the dry air and spread the fire," the official said. Deputy Commissioner (Health) P   did not respond to TOI's calls. In February 2017, TOI reported a major blaze at the Kodungaiyur landfill. At that time, tree waste collected from the city after cyclone Vardah's impact was cited as the reason for fire by corporation officials.
