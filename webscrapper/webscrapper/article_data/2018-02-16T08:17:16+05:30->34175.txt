BENGALURU: Had chief minister   displayed pre-budget blues on Thursday, the eve of the state budget, it would have been out of place. A veteran in the art, drawing up a budget is all in a day's work for Siddaramaiah. 

 On Thursday, the mood at Krishna, his official residence, was jovial as supporters streamed in with bouquets. Sources say the CM had devoted plenty of time for pre-budget consultations over the past month. "He spent six to eight hours every day," an official said. 
 
  It made for lengthy work days since he also squeezed in time to attend pre-election rallies with   president  .
 
 Siddaramaiah is assisted by a team of high-profile bureaucrats, who work overtime grappling with mind-boggling figures in a bid to present a balanced budget. This team, led by   secretary ISN Prasad, works tirelessly to prepare one of the most guarded documents.
 
 Such is the secrecy around the budget-making process that the members of this team are completely cut off from the outside world (including family) till the budget is presented in the assembly.
 
 N R Vishukumar, Kannada and culture department director, who was involved in the preparation of 21 budgets, says it all about team work. Vishukumar was associated with all of Siddaramaiah's 13 budgets, the five presented by S M Krishna and the three by  . 
 
 "Earlier, the budget was written only in English," Vishukumar said. "A few years ago, it was written in Kannada and later translated to English. Until a few years ago, I used to translate the budget speech in simple and lucid style. Now it is a team work. The language should be simple and convey the essence of budget to the people in a journalistic style."
