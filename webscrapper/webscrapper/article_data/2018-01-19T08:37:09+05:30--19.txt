CHENNAI: Land encroachments are like cancer. It slowly eats the lung space of the land and there will definitely be no breathing space for anyone, much less for the earth, to survive in the orbit, the Madras high court has observed, directing the authorities to remove such encroachments, instead of regularising them.

 A division bench of Justices M   and Justice S   made the observation while directing the authorities to raze down a two-storey unauthorised building in  , housing a supermarket.
 
 The issue pertains to a plea moved by D Rajappa and  , the owner of the building, seeking to quash a demolition notice issued by the housing and urban development department and to regularise the unauthorised construction.
 
 According to the petitioner, the order passed by the department is illegal, improper, unreasonable, arbitrary and against the principles of natural justice. He wanted a direction to the authorities to remove the lock and seal put up in their property – D R Super Market and Furniture, at 86/2, Naravarikuppam Village, GNT Road, Red Hills, Chennai and hand over the same to the petitioners to enable them to get regularisation of the construction pursuant to Justice Rajeswaran Committee’s recommendation.
 
 The bench said, “The petitioners, having been unsuccessful in several rounds of litigations, are trying to take every one for a ride including this court, as could be seen from the facts. This court will not perpetuate the illegality and is of the view that there should be a finality to the litigations, in the light of the observations of the   with regard to the illegal and unauthorised constructions, more particularly, when these petitioners have faced adverse orders passed by the apex court.”
 
 The bench then directed the officials concerned to demolish the entire structure within 30 days and to collect the demolition charges from the petitioners.
