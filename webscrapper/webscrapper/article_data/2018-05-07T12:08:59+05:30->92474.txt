MADURAI: With the mercury level rising steeply giving hardships to commuters, the Madurai city   has come up with a cool idea to give them some relief at busy junctions. The civic body is planning to erect canopies at the signals in the section of roads where the commuters wait for traffic signals.

 As a trial, the city corporation on Sunday erected a   at Periyar bus terminal junction which leads to   road. The canopy was created by erecting wooden poles and hanging shade net, generally used for agricultural purposes. Officials said that it was carried out with the help of sponsors.
 
 Corporation commissioner   told TOI that he got the idea from  , where its district administration introduced it for the commuters. “We are in no hurry and are doing it one at a time. Our priority at present is the busiest junctions like Periyar and Goripalayam. We will see how long it lasts and will make some modifications, before covering other areas,” he said.
 
 The canopy erected for about 20 metres long however torn and fell down within a few hours. An engineering official, who was inspecting it, said that they should have made a hole for the air to pass through. “It is a learning process. We have learned something from it and we will do it in a better way next time,” he said.
 
 However, commuters already welcomed the initiative. S Balraj from Ellis Nagar said that often many jump the signals as they do not want wait for 80 seconds at   under the scorching sun. They risk the life as they find it hard to wait under the sweltering heat.
