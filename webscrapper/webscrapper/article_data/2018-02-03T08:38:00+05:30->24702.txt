RAMPUR: Officers of the Civil Lines police station in Rampur have filed a chargesheet against senior   (SP) leader   for his controversial remarks on Army men.

 Khan was booked by the local police for spreading rumours about Army jawans. Police had taken action against Khan following a complaint lodged by local BJP leader Akash Kumar Saxena.
 
 In June 2017, Khan while addressing party workers in Rampur had allegedly said that excesses by security forces led to “women in some places chopping off the private parts of Army men”. The remarks had triggered widespread furore.
 
 SHO of Civil Lines police station Ashish Shukla has sought approval of the state government to initiate a probe against Khan, MLA from Rampur, under section 153 A (promoting enmity between classes) and 505 (false statement, rumour circulated with intent to cause mutiny or offence against public peace).
