Pune: Nearly 73% of the 26,000 applications for the Centre’s low-cost ‘Housing for All’ scheme have been deemed eligible to enter a lottery for allotment of tenements. 

 The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has given the 7,000 invalid applicants one month to get their documents in order in order to be eligible for the lottery under the central government’s Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana ( ) scheme.
 
 Officials said the applicants were told to give appropriate details, but under scrutiny, many applications had documents missing, while some did not even have proper detals. 
 
 “We have published the list of valid and invalid documents on the PMC website. The applicants are expected to do the needful at the earliest. Those with valid applications need not do anything as of now. They however have to understand that just because their applications are valid does not mean they are in the final list of beneficiaries. The final list will be out only after the lottery,” an official said. 
 
 The official also added that list has been displayed only for those   projects being executed on a public-private partnership basis.
