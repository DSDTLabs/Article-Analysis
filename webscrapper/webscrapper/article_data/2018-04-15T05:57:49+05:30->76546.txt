KOLKATA: The   (KMDA) has planned to lay new sewer lines and clear the existing ones at several places along   before the onset of monsoon. The agency has started working on the project as severe waterlogging is reported from certain pockets on the stretch between Ultadanga and   following a few spells of rain.

 To being with, the authorities have started working on the stretch of the Chingrighata-bound EM Bypass flank in front of Duttabad where there are a number of roadside eateries.
 
 The bigger plan is to lay new sewer lines on the Bypass stretch along the up and down ramps of Maa flyover that will help to drain out excess rainwater during heavy rain. Work is expected to start from May and KMDA authorities want to finish the job just before the monsoon.
 
 Only a few days back, water got accumulated for some time off EM Bypass connector at   intersection only after a few spells of light rain. Also, there was some waterlogging off the Bypass stretch at Ajaynagar after moderate rain.
 
 According to plans, a 600mm wide sewerage line would be laid near   crossing from both ends. Old pipelines will be replaced with new ones, a KMDA official said.
 
 Daily commuters who travel along EM Bypass said waterlogging was a big problem on the high-speed corridor as it slows down traffic and creates congestion. “Massive congestion occurs on EM Bypass after a heavy rain as waterlogging occurs in some spots. Vehicles just stop moving,” said Debjani Sen, who travels daily to a hospital off EM Bypass from Garia.
 
 Once the sewer lines are laid, the authorities will also take up restoration work of the dug-up stretches and will take road profile corrective measures to restore the surface.
