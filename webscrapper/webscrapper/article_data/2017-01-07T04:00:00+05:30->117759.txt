Mumbai: Despite the government’s recent decision to borrow less from the market through auction of  , the G-sec space is witnessing a sharp drop in investor interest. 

 In Friday’s auction for gilts worth Rs 11,000 crore, Rs 1,555 crore was unsold (devolved in market parlance). The devolvement came just days before the government is scheduled to redeem gilts worth almost Rs 62,500 crore. With a large redemption due, which would bring in a large amount of money into the system that investors have to park, a devolvement in a G-sec auction is unusual, bond dealers said.

Of these, papers maturing in 2051, worth Rs 1,555 crore remained unsold, RBI data showed. So in effect over 14% of the total amount remained unsold.RBI data on G-sec redemptions showed that on January 15, papers worth nearly Rs 62,500 crore is up for redemption. Bond dealers said lower investor appetite for  , on the face of a large redemption, indicates that yields in the market could rise.
