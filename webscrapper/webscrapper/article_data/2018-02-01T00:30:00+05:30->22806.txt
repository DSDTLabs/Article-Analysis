Bengaluru: Doddanna (name changed), a 45-year-old daily wage labourer in Ramanagara market, became a saviour to at least five persons who received his organs. He was carrying goods in an autoricksaw when it was hit by a truck on Kanakapura main road on January 29. After a brief battle for life, he was declared brain dead on January 30 at BGS Global Gleangles hospital, and his family gave their consent for organ donation. He’s the seventh cadaver donor in 2018.

 His liver was transplanted to a 57-year-old man, left kidney to a 48-year-old man and right kidney to a 61-year-old man. His skin was sent to the Victoria skin bank and corneas to Narayana Netralaya. 
 
 The accident took place around 6.30am when he was taking goats to the local marketplace in a luggage auto. “He was poor, and the breadwinner of the family. We were not aware of organ donation earlier. But when doctors suggested, we agreed to it immediately. We feel he is alive somewhere around us,” said his relative Gopal G C.
 
 Doddanna is survived by his wife and three children.
 
 Of the seven donations in the state so far this year, most donor families have come from the lower economic strata of society.
