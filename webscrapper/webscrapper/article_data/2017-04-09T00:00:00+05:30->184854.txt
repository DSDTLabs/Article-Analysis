 might have opted out of the Malayalam film  , but the movie will still have a strong Bollywood connect. 

 The film, which is a biopic of writer Kamala Surayya (Madhavikutty), will have two Hindi songs, penned by Oscar winning Bollywood lyricist  . Ustad Zakir Hussain’s brother and renowned percussionist Taufiq Qureshi will be the composer for both the songs.
 
 Director Kamal, who is currently busy shooting the film, said, “Yes, we have finished recording both of these Hindi songs. The songs are melodies, and one of them will be sung by Javed Ali.” When asked why the Malayalam film has songs in Hindi, the director said, “The movie has a few sequences set in North India, for instance, in Kolkata where the writer grew up. I can’t reveal more about the reasons of their inclusion at the moment.”
 
 Aami, starring   as Madhavikutty, also has songs composed by Malayalam musician M Jayachandran, with lyrics by Rafeeq Ahamed. The film’s shoot is progressing in Punnayurkulam.
