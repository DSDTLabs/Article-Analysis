CHENNAI: It has been nearly three months since a minor dalit girl was abducted, gangraped, murdered and her half-burnt body found dumped in a village well in   district. The 16-year-old was pregnant at the time of death, and caste atrocity was touted to be one of the reasons for the murder, as a local Hindu Munnani functionary and a member of a dominant community figured in the list of arrested suspects.

 The deceased's mother, Rajakili, has now moved the Madras high court narrating how, for 15 days, the Ariyalur district police made her run from pillar to post without registering an abduction case and then not properly investigating it. Finally on January 14, they informed her that the girl, who had gone missing on December 29, 2016, had been found dead inside a well.
 
 Justice R Mahadevan, before whom senior advocate R Vaigai argued as to how the victim's family had lost faith in the local police, said he would pass final orders in the case on March 27.
 
 It was Rajakili's case that though she immediately lodged a police complaint, she was given only a   and no FIR was registered. Six days later, an FIR was registered and the case was shown as 'girl missing' and not abduction, even though she had specifically mentioned persons suspected to have abducted her daughter.
 
 Had the officials taken proper initiative to secure her daughter she might have been saved, she said. Investigation lacks sincerity and theright to life and fair investigation had been trampled upon, she said.
 
 Rajakili now wants the case to be handed over to the CBCID to be investigated by a woman officer not below the rank of deputy superintendent of police. She also wants action against the three police officials named by her for failure to prevent   and death of the minor girl.
