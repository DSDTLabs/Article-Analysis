IT professionals take to the streets to highlight their safety concerns

 The brutal murder of a 23-year-old techie at Hinjewadi’s IT Park has left the city reeling in shock. While the cops have swung into action and are scrutinising the security system in the IT Park after the death of software engineer   OP; on Friday, employees at   organised a march highlighting their security concerns. Amit Talathi, an IT professional informed that this march was to highlight security issues of engineers working in Hinjewadi. “We want all of us to come together and spread the message. We work at odd hours and it is important that we raise our issues and highlight problems that we face.” The group is also using social media to talk about their concerns regarding security issues of software professionals. Talathi added, “The recent spate of murders has shaken us to the core. One can never know who can be the next victim. The idea of the human chain on Friday was to talk about various issues, including women’s safety.”
  
 
 
 The city police have come up with an assistance system called ‘Police Friend’. The idea of a ‘Police Friend’ is to connect women professionals with the cops. There will be one cop for every 50 women professionals working in IT companies. A group of 15-50 working women will be given the cell phone number of a city cop, whom they can contact in case of an emergency.
 
 
 
  It’s been over a month that software professional Antara Das was stalked and murdered, but the cops are still grappling with the case as they have been unable to book the culprit. The police had interrogated Santosh Gupta, after Antara’s family accused him of stalking her. The cops recently questioned two eye witnesses but no concrete evidence has been found. Ram Jadhav, Police Inspector (Pune Rural) said, “The eye witnesses do not have much information. We are still investigating for more details.”
