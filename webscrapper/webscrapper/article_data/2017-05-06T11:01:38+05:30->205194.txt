 Commissioner of police Yashasvi Yadav on Friday, said, "We have decided to go after land sharks and slap them with stringent laws including Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities Act (MPDA), Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) and if need be, we will even extern them from city limits."
 
 The officer said that just like any other fast developing city, land sharks have mushroomed in Aurangabad city. As a solution to the problem, the city police will have to initiate stringent action to not only check on their activities, but also curb their menace from the root.
 
 Apart from the police, the economic offences wing as well as the crime branch of the city police are currently flooded with applications and complaints by the victims of these land sharks. 
 
 Police sources said that soon the city police would prepare a fresh list of criminals and categorise the land sharks separately. The list would be prepared using the past record as well as fresh intelligence that would be collected at police station level.
 
 "The list would comprise the names that are already on police record and the land sharks, who have used their influence to prevent people from lodging complaints against them," said an officer privy to the development. 
 
 A senior officer told TOI, "Soon the city would witness its first stringent action against land sharks and they may be even white collar mafias."
