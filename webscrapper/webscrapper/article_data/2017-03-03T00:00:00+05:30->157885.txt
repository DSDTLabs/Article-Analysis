Easily one among the most commercially successful Kannada films in recent times,   — starring   and  , and produced by Raghunath from SRV Productions and S Umapathy from Umapathy films — seems to be breaking records at all levels. Add to that the fact that the film has takers even outside Karnataka, with the film being screened for Telugu, Tamil and Hindi audiences across major cities in the country.
“In the run-up to the release, we had to add more number of morning and midnight shows to cater to demand. This development opens markets for upcoming Kannada films as well. The standard and reach of the Kannada film industry increases with each successful film,” says the film’s distributor,  . Speaking of breaking records, Sudeep tells us, “Frankly, it was not the right time to release a film considering there are exams coming up soon that would keep family audiences away from theatres. But the biggest surprise and takeaway has been that people who usually opt to watch a film in its second or third week after reviews and analysis, have made it to the   in the first two days itself. One builds a fan following over the years and I feel that has made all the difference. Based on feedback from Karnataka as well as those outside the state, I think people have liked the character and performances the most.”
