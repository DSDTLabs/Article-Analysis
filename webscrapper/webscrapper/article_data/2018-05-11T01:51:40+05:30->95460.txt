NEW DELHI:   arrested a 25-year-old burglar from   on   and recovered expensive items like   sets and laptops from him.

 The accused, Rahul Dass alias Topi, was preparing for a government job when he came in contact with a few snatchers. Dass then left his studies and told his parents that he had got a government job. At the end of every month, he handed over a sum of money to them, saying it was his salary. In reality he got this money from selling the items he stole with his criminal friends.
 
 Dass was caught when he came to meet one of his friends in Dwarka. Officers said that more than half a dozen cases of theft and burglaries have been solved with his arrest. 
 
 Police said that on Monday, a businessman reported that the lock of his house was found broken and several electronic items were missing. A case was registered at the Dwarka police station. “A team led by SHO Ashok Kumar was constituted to crack the case,” said Shibesh Singh, DCP (Dwarka).
 
 Police said that CCTV footage of the nearby areas were scanned after which Dass was arrested. Dass later named another person who was also involved in the thefts. Police are looking for the other accused.
