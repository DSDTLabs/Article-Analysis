PATNA: The ongoing cash crunch in the state is likely to continue for at least one more week as bankers on Tuesday said the situation would become normal only after fresh supply of currency notes by the RBI.

 “The notes of Rs 2,000 denomination are currently unavailable with the banks, as a result of which the ATMs are either running short of cash or dispensing currencies in lower denominations,” said the branch manager of a public sector bank.
 
 Ambika Singh, employee of a private bank in city, said banks were running short of cash as there had been an imbalance in the supply of higher currency notes from RBI for the last 15 days. “One of the reasons for the ongoing   was higher withdrawals at some of the braches. The route of circulation of money through the currency chests should be monitored by the RBI,” Ambika said.
 
 Prasoon Kumar Sharma, an HRD official at the regional headquarters of RBI, Patna, said there are 217 currency chests in the region – 135 in Bihar and 82 in Jharkhand. “Banks cannot claim shortage of cash as we are sending money to 10 currency chests every day and none has run dry till now. Also, there are no issues in transportation of money from the currency chests,” Prasoon added.
 
 He said the RBI was reviewing the currency situation and analysing other logistical issues to assess why cash flow has dropped. “The central authorities will release a formal statement by Wednesday,” he added.
