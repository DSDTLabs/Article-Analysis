 The unit owners are opposing GIDC’s move to invite private party for the water supply network as they fear the price war and monopoly. 
 
 GIDC recently issued tender inviting applications from the private parties for the supply of 35 million litre per day (MLD) water and the laying of 11 km long pipeline in  . The private party qualifying in the tender will have to maintain the pipeline network, raise water bills and collect payments on behalf of the notified area authority. 
 
 A meeting in this connection was organized by the unit owners at the Sachin Notified Area authority campus to protest the move by GIDC for inviting the private parties and other issues concerning the overall infrastructural development of GIDC. 
 
 Leader of the Sachin GIDC unit owners Mahendra Ramoliya said, “There is open corruption in the installation of the LED lights, construction of the cement concrete roads and the underground cabling of the electricity lines. Now, GIDC wants to give the water supply project to a private party, which will monopolize the business in GIDC. There are 2,250 units in GIDC and all will come under the direct rule of the private party for the water supply.” 
 
 Ramoliya added, “The responsibility of water supply in GIDC should be given either to the irrigation department or the   (SMC). SMC is already working on the project of supplying 35 MLD tertiary treated water in the GIDC. So, why there is a need of a private party in GIDC.”
