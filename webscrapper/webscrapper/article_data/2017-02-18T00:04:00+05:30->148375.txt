Jaipur: The Rajasthan   on Friday restrained the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) from demolishing illegal constructions on Jhotwara Road.

 The division bench of justices K S Jhaveri and V K Mathur asked the JDA to maintain status quo on a petition filed by Shakuntala Devi and 20 others.
 
 The petitioners alleged that the JDA had not given them a hearing before starting the demolition drive. So, they were not able to seek legal remedy after the single bench gave the green signal to JDA for demolition.
 
 The JDAâ€™s enforcement wing had issued notices under Section 72 of the JDA Act for encroachment on government land to 41 houseowners and started the demolition drive on February 9 for the construction of Jhotwara elevated road.

 The court had earlier ruled to upgrade the salary of technical helpers to a higher scale or appear in the court on February 15. Mohanty not only failed to comply with the order but also failed to appear before the court on said date. The court on Thursday expressed its disappointment over the failure of PHED to comply with the order.
