Kannur: An assistant sub-inspector (ASI) of police was on Thursday placed under suspension for allegedly misbehaving with the son of CPM district secretary, P Jayarajan. 

 District police chief G Siva Vikram ordered the suspension—pending inquiry—of K M Manoj based on a complaint by Ashish P Raj.
 
 The senior officer said the ASI’s indiscipline had led to his suspension and an oral inquiry has been initiated into the alleged incident that occurred eight days ago.
 
 “The decision was taken after a detailed examination of the entire episode and it was found that the ASI handled the situation in a bad manner. The CCTV footage showed the ASI misbehaving with the complainant,” he said.
 
 The incident pertained to Raj requesting the personnel of Mattannur police station permission to use the  . He made the request on behalf of a few schoolgirls, returning home via Bengaluru after a dance competition in Bhopal.
 
 The police chief said though it could be argued that the toilets in the station were not for public use, in exceptional cases—like the one in Mattannur involving girls—it could be opened to others.
 
 “Also if there was any issue, he could have informed the higher-ups, but that did not happen here,” he said.
 
 No case has been registered based on Raj’s complaint, and the ASI would likely be reinstated, after the inquiry, within 15 days.
 
 Senior officials, however, said if found guilty, disciplinary action could be initiated against the officer.
 
 Raj and the group of girls had alighted a private bus from Bengaluru on January 10 morning, when a few students wanted to visit the toilet. He said when requested, the ASI misbehaved with him and refused permission to use the toilet.
 
 The preliminary inquiry had found flaws on the part of the ASI, following which a detailed probe was initiated. It was found that he had not handled the situation properly.
 
 The issue had sparked a debate on the lack of public amenities.
