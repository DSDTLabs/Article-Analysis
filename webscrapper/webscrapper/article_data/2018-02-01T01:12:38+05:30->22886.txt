NEW DELHI: An   in   was gutted after a fire broke out due to a short-circuit. Cash worth   of rupees stored in the machine were burnt in the blaze. The fire swiftly spread across a few other shops adjoining the ATM and items worth lakhs were destroyed there as well.

 Fire officials said they received a call from Dwarka Sector 12 around 9pm and a fire tender was sent. Since the fire was not doused for half an hour, another fire tender was pushed to action and the situation was controlled in the next half an hour.
 
 Police that the people in the buildings adjoining the ATM were evacuated timely and no one was hurt.
 
  The exact cause of the fire is yet to be determined and a case of negligence has been registered.
