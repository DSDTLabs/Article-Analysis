 According to the complaint filed by Mihir Lakhia, resident of Brahm Kshtriya Society, the unidentified man tried to get into the house for nearly 35 minutes. “Unsuccessful, he stacked the pillows kept on the porch settee near the balcony door and set them on fire,” he told the cops.
 
 The neighbours who detected the smoke put out the fire before it could spread. The family was not at home when the incident occured. Lakhia told Mirror, “The CCTV footage shows an unidentified person entering the bungalow premises and roaming around. This was around 7 pm on Sunday. He might be checking whether there was anyone in the house. Convinced that the house was empty, he went on to try and break open a door. I have no doubt his motive was to rob the house.”
 
 Cops delayed taking FIR 
 Meanwhile, Lakhia has alleged that the police took more than 20 hours to register an FIR. He claims that only after he approached senior officials did the Ellisbridge police entertain his complaint. “They wanted to verify the motive behind the action before taking an FIR. That is absurd,” he said. Ellisbridge police inspector BS Rabari said, “The modus operandi of this attempted theft is very different from the ones in the past. We are investigating why the person set the balcony door on fire. We have registered a complaint after a primary inquiry.”
