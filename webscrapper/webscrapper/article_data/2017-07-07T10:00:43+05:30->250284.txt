VADODARA: A man who had cheated his friend by giving cheques of Rs 3.55 lakh with forged signatures was arrested by the police on Wednesday.

 The accused Jayesh Patel, an owner of car accessories shop, had taken Rs 24.67 lakh from his friend   Patel in 2012 in different amounts to expand his business. Police said that in February 2012, Jayesh gave a promissory note of Rs 12.52 lakh to Jyotindra along with five cheques of Rs 3.55 lakh. However, when Jyotindra deposited the cheques, it turned out that they were issued from the account of one Bankim Patel and Jayesh had signed on them.
 
 Jayesh had also given two more cheques of Rs 1.7 lakh and Rs 1.9 lakh but had asked Jyotindra to deposit when he asks him to as the balance in his bank account was low. But even after the cheques’ validity date passed, Jayesh did not ask him to deposit.
 
 After the complaint was registered by Jyotindra at   police station on May 27, Jayesh was detained by the police on June 12 but since he had got anticipatory bail from court, he was allowed to go. A police official said that though he was released on anticipatory bail, his custodial interrogation was necessary so he was arrested on Wednesday.
 
 Jayesh was produced before a judicial magistrate’s court on Thursday for custody.
 
 Cops told the court that they needed to interrogate him to know how he managed to get cheques which was of Bankim’s account and also to verify whether Bankim too was involved with him in cheating the complainant or not.
