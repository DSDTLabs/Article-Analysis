BHOPAL: Cab services are back in controversy. This time, they are accused of launching an app for ‘carpool’ circumventing the RTO in Bhopal, purportedly at a concessional rate. According to the MVA, 1989, carriage permits or All India permits issued under the Motor Vehicles Act does not allow cabs to pick up passengers from different points by a single vehicle to drop them at different points. 

 Talking to TOI, Sunil Rai Saxena, Regional Transport Officer, Bhopal said, “We have not received any application from any of the IT enabled cab services in city about ‘carpooling’ or ‘sharing’ services. They have just taken permission for pick and drop of one person per car from source area to destination.” He warned, “If found guilty legal action will be taken against them.”
 
 This is not the first time that IT enabled cabs have come under the scanner of transport office. Earlier, they have been penalized by transport department for not following the guidelines and implementing surge pricing during peak hours. In August 2016, transport minister Bhupendra Singh, ordered to ban cab services, if they are found flouting norms.
 
 This was followed by a three-day strike by 5,000 auto drivers in in January in the state capital bringing services to a halt.
 
 Sayed Yasir Ali, an Ola cab driver said, “The carpool service was started a week ago and people are giving good response, but they are reluctant to avail night service.”
 
 Adding on about her experience in  , Smita Thirke, a commuter engineer said, “Carpooling is a good practice, but it needs to be safe and secure. Even traffic police need to be involved so that cabs involved in sharing services can be checked frequently.”
 
 The services of sharing are available for residents at the cost of Rs 50-Rs 100, half the price they have to pay for a single ride alone.
