Alia comes to call Abhi inside. In the meeting, the organisers state that they want Abhi to collaborate with another celebrity. Alia expresses her disinterest. She refuses to let the collaboration happen. But the organisers ask their other performer to come in. Abhi and King are shocked to see each other as co-stars. They enter into a verbal brawl yet again. Abhi asks him not to come infront of him and King says the same.
