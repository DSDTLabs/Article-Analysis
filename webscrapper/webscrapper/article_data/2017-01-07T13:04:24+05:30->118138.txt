PANAJI: Suggesting that government machinery could be used to derail the conduct of free and fair elections,   (AICC) secretary Girish Chodankar, questioned the need for certain   to continue in Goa despite being transferred months earlier.

 “I don’t know how election machinery will be used. Upright officers have been transferred and some IPS officers with BJP backgrounds continue to serve in the state. We have asked the   to take suo motu cognizance of the issue, else we will complain to the chief election commissioner in Delhi,” Chodankar said while addressing reporters.
 
 Although the Congress spokesperson did not reveal the names of the police officers concerned, he dropped strong hints when pointing out to their family’s links to the BJP and their transfer orders.
 
 The Congress also appears to be veering towards an alliance. Departing from its categorical disinterest in any form of pre-poll alliance, the party hinted it was waiting for a formal proposal from interested parties through the proper channels.
 
 “There is no exact proposal with our local leadership. They (parties) should approach our local leadership if they want an alliance. We are cautiously discussing the matter at various levels,” Chodankar said.
 
 The party is wary of a post-poll breakup or change in political support if the outcome of the election is not favourable. “If we get the leaders, will we get the people? Or if we get the leaders will we lose the people? We are not desperate for power. We want to win the people,” the party’s secretary said.
