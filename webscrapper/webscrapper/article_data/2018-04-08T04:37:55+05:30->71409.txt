KOLKATA: Congress leader and senior advocate   on Saturday explained his position on defending West Bengal in the Supreme Court in a petition filed by BJP against the   government on terrorising opposition candidates in panchayat  . 

 While on a chat show ‘Ek Mulakat’ — a Prabha Khaitan Foundation initiative in association with Calcutta Times — at The Tollygunge Club, Singhvi said the brief on which he defended the state in the SC was based on a petition titled BJP versus West Bengal. 
 
 “On April 6, I was there in the court for appearing against BJP. Congress is not a party to that petition. I argued based on the facts and figures supplied by the chief secretary and home secretary of the state. When the SC matter was being actually argued, it was pointed out that someone has moved a petition in Calcutta High Court on the same issue. I don’t understand how that can be connected with the matter in the Supreme Court. I think there is lack of communication and information,” he said.
 
 While talking about the Congress-TMC relationship in West Bengal, he said: “There is no inherent paradox between strong and vigorous antagonism between Congress and TMC as opposed to necessary coordination between Congress, TMC, Left, SP and BSP at the central and parliamentary level.”
