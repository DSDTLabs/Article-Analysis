MOHALI: Over three years ago, when a fatal accident on the   claimed eight lives, then deputy commissioner, Mohali, TPS  , had ordered the   on the flyover. While there are currently cameras there, they are non-functional, the traffic in-charge, Zirakpur, told STOI on Saturday. Just this Friday, the killer stretch claimed three more lives, when a car hit three labourers. “The   cameras installed on the flyover are not functional anymore, and it is difficult to trace offending vehicles without CCTV footage,” traffic in-charge, Zirakpur, Inspector  , said. “We don’t know what the problem is but we are going to call some mechanic for the repair of the CCTV’s.” Four CCTV cameras had been installed at both ends of the flyover, two in the middle of the stretch, and one each at the Kalka and Patiala lights points. All CCTVs were connected to a monitor at the traffic police control room, to monitor activities round-the-clock, and these cameras were capable of recording footage for 10 days as data. The district administration had fixed the speed limit at 60 kmph hour for vehicles crossing the flyover, but traffic police, sans speed radar, are unable to check speeds. A local resident, Manish Sharma, said that most vehicles on the flyover cross 100 kmph. Mohali deputy commissioner Gurpreet Kaur Sapra said: “The matter has been brought to my notice and I will instruct the concerned departments to install and make functional already-installed CCTV cameras.”
