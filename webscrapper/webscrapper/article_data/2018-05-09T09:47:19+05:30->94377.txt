HYDERABAD: Intensifying their stir against the arbitrary fee hike, students of Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani (Hyderabad campus) camped outside the director's residence all through Monday night, demanding justice. To register their protest, the ongoing comprehensive exams notwithstanding, the students even prepared for their test under the street lights, while sitting on dharna. 

 Taking a dig at the authorities' alleged claim about the fee hike being rooted in the lack of funding from the state and central governments, students even launched a unique drive wherein every student from across its three campuses - Hyderabad, Pilani and Goa - contributed 1 to 10 to "help the administration meet it's financial needs". 
 
 "#ChangeForAChange - An opposite symbol for protest. Students enqueue outside the vice-chancellor's office and chip in 1, 2 coins to help the administration meet its growing financial needs. #RollbackBITSPilaniFeeHike," tweeted Shreshtha Dhankar, a student. 
 
 On Tuesday evening, students at the Hyderabad campus also blocked the main gate to reiterate their demand for fee correction even as many took to social media to express their anguish over the administration's failure to respond to their plea, even on the third day of protest. "BITSians are continuously protesting for the last 48 hours amidst their exams and the administration is reluctant to even speak to them. Is this what BITS stands for? @bitspilaniindia," posted   on Tuesday. 
 
 Those on hunger strike too continued their struggle, and refused to consume anything until the administration came up with an amicable solution.
 
  TOI's repeated attempts at reaching the media relations officer of the institute, failed to yield any response.
