Mysuru: Opposing the Centre’s proposal to privatise the country’s premier defence company, Defence Research and Development Organisation ( ), activists of the Joint Committee of the Trade Union (JCTU), along with AITUC and CITU staged a protest here on Thursday.

 Activists, who gathered under the leadership of general secretary of JCTU HB Ramakrishna, opined that the central government was acting against the interests of the working classes and labourers. “The   has remained silent although employees of DRDO have been protesting since July 2017,” said Ramakrishna.
 
 He added that the Goods and Services Tax (GST) had only served to compound woes of small-scale industries. “While the Centre has not waived off loans of farmers, it has written off debts worth more than Rs 2 lakh crore of corporate frauds,” Ramakrishna added. 
 
 He also pointed to the central government’s failure to ensure all employees were paid a minimum monthly wage of Rs 18,000m besides highlighting its failure to extend social security and pension of Rs 3,000. “Foreign direct investment in Indian Railways, banking and insurance sectors has to be stopped,” Ramakrishna said, further urging the Centre to refrain from privatizing government companies such as Bharat Earth Movers Ltd, Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd, etc.
 
 “While it has failed to generate employment, the central government is creating communal disturbance. Activists are holding protests across the country,” he said.
