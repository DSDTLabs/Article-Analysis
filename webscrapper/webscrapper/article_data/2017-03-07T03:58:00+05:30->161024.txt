Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court, on Monday, refused to hear the bail plea filed by city educationalist and activist Deepak Bajaj, questioning its maintainability.  The single-judge bench of justice Pradeep Deshmukh granted him permission to approach the sessions court. Subsequently, Bajaj, who is behind bars for allegedly having assets disproportionate to known sources of income, withdrew his plea. The petitioner has moved a bail application after his petition for bail was rejected by the Supreme Court. He, however, directly moved to the high court instead of following proper procedure. The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) had booked Bajaj and his wife Veena under Sections 13(1) E and 13 (20) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, while Jaripatka Police booked them under Sections 406, 420, 438, 471, 34, 168, 120B, 201, 409, 467, 193 of Indian Penal Code (IPC). Earlier too, his plea for regular bail was rejected by justice Sunil Shukre in September last year, while observing that he prima facie committed the offences that are of high magnitude having their adverse impact on the education society in which people repose their trust for turning their children into responsible citizens. The anti-corruption Bureau (ACB) officials unearthed cash worth Rs 32 lakhs and several documents during a raid on September 25, 2015, from the school.  The anti-corruption bureau also conducted a simultaneous searches at cooperative society housed in same premises. In initial search, the anti-corruption bureau recovered over Rs 18 lakh cash, besides other valuables, including gold ornaments, worth around Rs 3 crore.
