NEW DELHI:  's army has denied that its chief   said that his country should be more like India, as was reported in the Indian and Pakistani press.

 This was indicated in a cryptic tweet yesterday from Pakistan's Major general Asif Ghafoor, the spokesman of the country's armed forces
 
 
 
  
 
 
 That he was referring to Pakistan army chief Qamar Bajwa's alleged comment about "emulating India" was only gleaned from the fact that Ghafoor's tweet also included a news headline stating the same.
 
 Last week, Pakistan's Nation newspaper reported on a December meeting held by Bajwa, during which he essentially said "the army has no business trying to run the government". He also reportedly spoke at length about how India has managed to make democracy work without ever involving the Army in governance.
 
 The Nation's article sent shockwaves through India and Pakistan, especially Pakistan, which has seen military rule via coups as many as three times. And here's the new Army chief appearing to denounce it.
 
 At the December meeting, The Nation reported that Bajwa apparently urged officers to read a book "Army and Nation", written by Steven I Wilkinson. The book attempts to explain why the democratic process in India has been a success.
 
 "Till now, there has been no attempt to portray Gen Bajwa as a parallel, competing powerhouse, with strong political undertones, unlike the past when an orchestrated campaign was directed and aimed at raising the profile of the then army chief to mythic proportions. ...Gen Bajwa, through his public statements, has stressed that the army will support and assist the civilian government for national interest," the Nation wrote.
