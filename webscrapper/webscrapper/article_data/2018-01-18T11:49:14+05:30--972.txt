TIRUPUR: DMK working president M K   has demanded the state government to set up a separate wing at the secretariat to ensure protection of students from   studying in other states. 

 Commenting on the death of Dr   Prabhu, Stalin said, “The death of the first year MD (general medicine) student of UCMS, Delhi, was a big loss to Tamil Nadu. His parents’ claim of mystery behind his death should be taken seriously.”
 
 “The state government didn’t demand a CBI probe in Saravanan’s death, which was found to be a possible murder. The central government too did not bother about it. A toll free number should be installed to enable the students and their parents to contact the government, whenever needed,” Stalin said in a statement on Wednesday.
 
 General secretary of   said, “It was unfortunate that such incidents happen in leading medical institutions. This may frighten students from the state who wanted to pursue higher education in other states.” 
 
 Youth wing secretary of PMK   said, “Though the Delhi police earlier claimed that   Ganesan, another PG medical student, of AIIMS, Delhi, could have committed suicide in July 2016, post-mortem report suggested that it could be murder. Similarly, the mystery behind Sharath’s death should be solved.”
