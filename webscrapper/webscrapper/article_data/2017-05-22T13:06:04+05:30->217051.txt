PANAJI: Agriculture minister   on Sunday said that his department is working to increase the   by 20% this year.

 Speaking at an event here on Sunday, Sardesai said that he has asked his department officials to work in such a way that the farmer’s income is doubled by 2022 and sees an increment of 20% alone during 2017.
 
 “We are having kharif crops in Goa. Our state’s agriculture is primarily rain-fed and to support it, we’re trying to get mechanization in agriculture. We are fully promoting it with the target to help increase the farmer’s income.
 
  We want to double their income by 2022. We don’t want to miss this   and are already in talks with some companies to bring in mechanized transplantation. The scheme is likely to be announced next week and will be called ‘Farmer Forward’,” Sardesai said, adding that the policy will work in line with the Prime Minister’s ‘Mission 2022’ to double the farmer’s income.
 
 Sardesai, who also holds the town and country planning portfolio, said that a concept paper on transfer of development rights has already been submitted. The move, he says, will help in preserving the local architecture of the state.
