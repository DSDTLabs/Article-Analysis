MUMBAI: Around 1.65 lakh IIT aspirants are all set to appear for the first-ever online JEE (Advanced) on Sunday. Over 28,000 are giving the test from IIT-Bombay Zone — that includes the western region — the third highest numbers among the other zones. The highest number of aspirants belongs to the IIT-Madras zone, followed by IIT-Delhi zone.

 The 1.65 lakh students were shortlisted from JEE (Main). Though 2.3 lakh students qualified to take JEE (Advanced), 32% of the eligible candidates dropped out of the race for the coveted IIT seat. While the IITs have been taking several measures to get more foreign students on the campus, only 36 students have sought to appear for the test.
 
 While IITs are taking all measures to ensure there are no technical glitches in the online test, students and parents are too hoping for a smooth conduct of the test. “The IITs even allowed mock tests to be taken at Kendriya Vidyalayas. Students were allowed to take the test at any KVs close to their place,” said an IIT official. The students are hoping to have an error free and glitch free paper, said a coaching institute teacher.
 
 IIT-Kanpur, which is the organising IIT this year, has issued a list of instructions to the candidates. The students have been asked to reach the exam centres at 7.30am. The candidates will be sent to their designated computers after their biometric verification. The computer screen will display the name, photograph and the JEE (Advanced) roll number of the students. The candidates have been asked to do the rough work on the scribble pad that will be given to them at the centre.
