The OPPO Bangalore Times Fresh Face held at CMR Institute of Technology was nothing short of an extravagant affair. With 47 participants, there was no dearth of talent and what’s more — the audience enjoyed the performances as much as   and celebrity judge for the evening  .

 For the first round, participants showed off their talents ranging from martial arts, dancing, beat boxing and acting. While Sanjana floored us with her yoga act, S Stephen shaking a leg to Despacito got the crowd all pumped up. Uday Kumar’s beat boxing skills were appreciated by many and Kavya rapping to Love The Way You Lie was the perfect way to end the first round.
 
 Bhuvann, who enjoyed the performances throughout, had a tough task of choosing the best performers from the entire lot and chose 14 students — seven boys and seven girls — for the second round. Ameena Meraj and Shrikesh S were adjudged the winners whereas Arpitha R and Nganba Irom, who impressed the judge with their dance moves, were announced the first runners-up. Finally, Sagarikaa Sinha and S Stephen were announced as the second runners-up respectively.
