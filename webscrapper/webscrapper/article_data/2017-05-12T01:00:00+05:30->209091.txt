An alumna of Delhi's   alumna and well-known theatre and film actor,  , has known Gurgaon since before it was the  . The actor who recently performed in the capital, tells us, "Mera sasural hai Gurgaon mein. I moved there after I got married in 1986. I used to stay in Delhi before I got married. When I was in NSD, I remeber spending almost a month of my summer vacation in Gurgaon, rehearsing for a play. That was the first time I spent so much time in Gurgaon. I have also done many workshops in Gurgaon. Yahan ka theatre scene bahut kamaal hai."

  As Chibber has worked in the theatre circuit of both Delhi and Gurgaon, she says that the two cities are completely different. "In Delhi, you have people who do theatre on a permanent basis. But in Gurgaon, those who are doing theatre are usually not professional actors. They might have a job in a comepletely different field and also do theatre on the side. Par tab bhi Gurgaon ka theatre scene bahut achha hai," she tells us.
 
  While she has spent a lot of time in Delhi during her NSD days, Vibha says that her knowledge of Gurgaon is very limited. "Yahan mein maine zyada time spend nahin kiya hai. Par Delhi aur Gurgaon mein zameen aasman ka fark hai. Gurgaon has completely changed now, it has really developed. Yahan enter karo toh lagta hi nahin hai ki India mein ho."
