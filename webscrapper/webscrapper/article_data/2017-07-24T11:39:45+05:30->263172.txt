AURANGABAD: Altogether 158   due to farmers’ suicide from the district will get financial aid of Rs 15,000 each, thanks to zilla parishad (ZP) staff. 

 The district administration on Sunday announced that over 150 families are eligible for the aid. The money will be distributed during a formal function to be held at Marathwada Revenue   off  , at 10.30am on Monday.
 
 The former president of the ZP Shriram Mahajan had taken the initiative last year to offer a helping hand to affected farmers. He had also appealed to all stakeholders to contribute financially to the cause.
 
 The voluntary contribution has resulted in the collection of around Rs 23.7 lakh that will be donated to families affected by farmers’ suicides reported from the district after 2016. 
 
 “While political representatives were appealed to donate at least a month’s salary, officials and staffers were requested to donate a day’s pay or a minimum of Rs 200 per head. Our appeal generated a good response, and so the ZP could reach out to a sizeable number of families,” Mahajan said on Sunday.
 
 Incidentally, the BJP-led state government also announced a special initiative according to which all public representatives and government employees have been appealed to donate a day’s pay from their July salaries. 
 
 The money will be offered as financial aid to widows and children of farmers. Apart from this, the state has also set up a new relief fund — Chief Minister Farmer Relief Fund — to help farmers and families affected by incidents of farmers’ suicides.
