MANALI: A limited number of vehicles will be allowed to visit Lahaul and Ladakh from Manali as the administration has decided to limit the daily quota of   to 800. Besides, they will have to obtain the permit online after paying congestion charges of Rs 50 per vehicle.

 Following the   (NGT) order, the state government has already limited the number of vehicles going to Rohtang to 1,200, which include 400 diesel and 800 petrol engine vehicles. Observing that many tourists were visiting Rohtang on the pretext of visiting Lahaul, the administration has decided to set a cap on vehicles going beyond Rohtang pass as well. Until last year, the administration was issuing manual permits from the SDM office in Manali to go beyond Rohtang pass and there was no limit on the number of vehicles being allowed.
 
 Manali SDM H R Bairwa said the maximum number of permits that were issued from his office to go beyond Rohtang pass last year was 694. “Assuming that there would be around 10% hike in tourists, the daily quota of permits would be 800. The permit can be obtained online and will be available very soon,” he said.
 
 To ensure that the permits are not being misused, tourists will have to submit some documents as a guarantee. “Tourists will be required to give their name and some government approved ID to procure the permit. If anybody misuses the permit to visit Rohtang pass only, the vehicle used for the journey would be blacklisted. This is being done to comply with the NGT order. Any amendment or change in daily quota will be made as per tribunal direction,” Bairwa added.
 
 Local residents of Lahaul will be able to cross Rohtang without following any formality. Two checkposts on either side of Rohtang have been equipped with computer and internet facility to cross-check the permits. The software to generate online permits has been developed and the physical test of the new permit system will be carried out on Wednesday.
