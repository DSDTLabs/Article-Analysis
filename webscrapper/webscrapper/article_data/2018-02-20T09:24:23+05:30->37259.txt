CHANDIGARH: A fire broke out in a   on the top floor in Sector 22 market on Monday evening. More than half a dozen machines, computer and other accessories were destroyed.

 The fire department of the municipal corporation (MC) found no   at the shop, Shiv Enterprises and Blue Star. The reason of the fire is yet to be assessed, though sources said a short circuit may have triggered the blaze.
 
 The fire wing received the call around 6pm. Five tenders were sent to the spot, which took around 40 minutes to control the fire. All senior officers were also present on the spot.
 
 “Laser, paper cutting, paper punching, paper pressing and  , four computers, ceiling fans and other electronic material were gutted. However, we managed to save seven computers and six cabins adjoining the shop. It seems the fire broke out due to a short circuit,” said a MC official.
 
 “Since not fire safety rules were being followed, we will send a notice to the occupier and inspect the area. Though it was quite congested, we managed to reach the second floor and save other cabins. Only one cabin was damaged,” said M L Sharma, station fire officer.
 
 Sources in the MC said since Sector 22 market is congested and vehicles are parked in a  , fire tenders had to struggle to reach the spot to douse the blaze.
