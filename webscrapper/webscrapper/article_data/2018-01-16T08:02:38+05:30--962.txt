GURUGRAM:   State Pollution Control Board ( ) has launched a campaign with a city-based private bus aggregator to raise awareness about the impact of   on air pollution. As many as 25 buses, owned by  , set up with info-graphical messages urging people to shift from private vehicles to shared mobility options, were flagged off by state environment minister   on Monday.

 “We want to make Haryana pollution and congestion free. We are focused on safe, efficient, economical, and environment-friendly transport in the state. This will be achieved when more people opt for shared mobility options over private cars which cause traffic congestion and pollution. Things will only change when people change the way they move around the city,” he said. 
 
 Jai Bhagwan, HSPCB regional officer, urged corporates to come forward to offer shared mobility. “The campaign is a call to action for citizens to end the gridlock on city roads by choosing shared mobility models, such as buses which occupy less space on roads and reduce per capita carbon footprint. We want more private players to come forward and offer such solutions,” he said.
 
 Another 50 buses with the messages, created by HSPCB, will be rolled out soon.
