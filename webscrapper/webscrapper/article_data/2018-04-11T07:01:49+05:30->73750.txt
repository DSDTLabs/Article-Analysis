MANDYA: The uncertainty over actor-politician M H Ambareesh’s candidature in   has left his   on tenterhooks, even as his relationship with the   remains cantankerous.

 Ambareesh’s political clout is not what it used to be, but he is believed to be pressurizing the   leadership to give him a free hand to choose candidates for other assembly segments in Mandya district. He is keen to field his supporters in Melukote, Maddur, Srirangapatna and K R Pete segments.
 
 Sources say   wants only his supporters to be fielded and is particularly opposed to Darshan Puttannaiah being granted a ticket in Melukote segment. Chief minister Siddaramaiah has already declared Puttannaiah would be fielded in Melukote.
 
 K C Venugopal, AICC in-charge of Karnataka, is said to have asked Ambareesh to confine himself to his segment and not to interfere with selection of candidates. But Ambareesh is miffed over being sidelined and is keeping cards close to his chest on whether he himself would contest.
 
 His eerie silence has kept his supporters and party workers guessing. His supporters are confident he would contest on a Congress ticket and are already preparing for his campaigns. They have printed booklets on his achievements, meant to be distributed to voters.
 
 “If he is not interested in contesting the poll, then he would not have asked us to prepare for the poll,” a confidante said. “He will surely contest.”
