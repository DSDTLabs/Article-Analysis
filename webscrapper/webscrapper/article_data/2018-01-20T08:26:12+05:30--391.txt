NAGPUR: In a development that may prompt parents of schoolchildren to reconsider their wards’ commute options, the traffic police on Friday booked five school bus drivers for  .

 During its ongoing ‘School Safety’ drive led by DCP (traffic) Ravindrasinh Pardeshi, starting around 9am and continuing up to 3pm, different squads of the city police inspected as many as 1,000 vehicles and initiated action against 404 drivers (of 108 bus, 147 vans and 149 autorickshaw) ferrying excess children.
 
 During the drive, the zone-II traffic police led by senior PI   booked 210 vehicles, mostly vans and autorickshaws, transporting excess schoolchildren. Of the vehicles, 19 were buses.
 
 When police intercepted four vehicles (MH 31/DS5042, MH 31/CQ1343, MH 49/J406 and MH31/KM0216) at different spots to check whether excess children were being ferried, the team was shocked to find that three bus and one autorickshaw drivers were under the influence of liquor. At first the police dropped the children travelling in these vehicles to their respective schools, from where alternative arrangements were made to send them safely to their homes, said the senior PI.
 
 “Later, we brought the drivers Vijay Choudhari, Sachin Onduskar, Jimmy Prince Anthony and Sheikh Feroz Hussain Shaikh Ansar Hussain to traffic office in   where we performed an Alco meter check on these drivers. It was found that their blood alcohol level was above the permissible limit,” he said.
 
 The police then booked them under relevant sections of the Motor Vehicles Act. Though there is a provision to initiate action against the drivers with stringent sections like booking them under provisions of the   Justice Act, the traffic police released the vehicles after verifying the documents. The fifth driver was caught by zone-III led by senior PI  , said the DCP.
