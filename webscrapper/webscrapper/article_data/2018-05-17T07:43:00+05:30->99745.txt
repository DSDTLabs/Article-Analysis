Jaipur: It was a narrow escape for people inside a multi-storey building located in   after a massive fire broke out on Wednesday morning.

 Panic prevailed after it was found that a woman had got stuck in an elevator during the blaze. The rescue teams managed to open the gate of the elevator and saved the woman who was in distress.
 
 According to fire official  , fire broke out following a short-circuit in an electrical shaft on the ground floor of   located on   in Vidyadhar Nagar. Soon, a thick, black smoke enveloped the building. As the fire spread to other floors of the building, people got panicked. Officials said it was residential-cum-commercial building.
 
 The smoke was emanating from the windows and balconies of the building. The rescue teams, comprising state disaster relief force (SDRF), civil defence and fire officials, began evacuating the building.
 
 “As the fire spread, it triggered a massive panic in the vicinity. The smoke also blackened the adjacent highrise,” said Prateek Jain, a witness.
 
 Ghasiya said that around nine fire tenders were pressed into service. “We first evacuated the building to ensure that there are no casualties. Then, we quickly rescued the woman who had got stuck in the elevator,” he said.
 
 Ambulances were also dispatched to the spot. “There is a space in the building where electric meters are installed and wires pass through. A short-circuit could have led to fire,” Ghasiya said.
 
 Another official said that burning wires could have led to a bigger mishap. “Many buildings in the city have obsolete wires which cannot sustain power supply overload in summer season,” the official said, adding that a similar incident of fire was reported in another highrise in the same area on April 12.
