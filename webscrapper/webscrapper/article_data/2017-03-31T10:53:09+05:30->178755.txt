THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government has embarked on a set of remedial measures to salvage at least some projects under plan fund for the local bodies in the state in the wake of dip in utilization percentage.

 The government has offered a solace for the local bodies which are on the verge of getting their funds lapsed owing to nil utilization by March 31. As per the decision of the local selfgovernment department, civic bodies can get their projects for the year 2017-18 approved by district planning committee ( ) by March 31. If they manage to do so, such projects could be carried over to the next fiscal, thereby preventing lapse of funds.
 
 “It is true that fund utilization was difficult for local bodies owing to many factors. We have given an opportunity to save funds in such a way that once the DPC approval is received, projects could be carried over. The finance department will issue an order on this regard within a week,'' said  .
 
 This will also offer an added advantage for local bodies. With the DPC approving projects before March, local bodies would be able to start implementation by April. “Usually this process starts only by June or in some cases it gets even extended.Now, implementation of pro jects could start off in April itself which would en sure that we would be able to cover al most all projects well before March, 2018,“ said V K  , mayor, Thiruvanan thapuram corpora tion.
 
 Finance minis ter T M   recently told the assembly that the local bodies that failed to complete their projects in time would be able to carry over the plan fund to next financial year.
 
 “The only condition is that the local bodies should have commenced the projects already . The funds of the projects that are yet to begin will be lapsed,'' said   while replying query on fund utilisation in local bodies.
