Filmmaker   and south superstar Nagarjuna’s Telugu film   has been in the news lately. Their fourth collaboration has been ready for release, but there’s speculation that the movie has no buyers coming forward for distribution. When BT got in touch with the filmmaker, he rubbished the reports and said, “The film is releasing on May 25. Where are all these reports coming from? If the film didn’t have any buyers, then how can it have a release date?”

 Interestingly, RGV debuted as a director with the Nagarjuna-starrer, 'Siva' in 1989. He remade that film in Hindi ('Shiva') the following year. A few years later, hits like ' ' (1995) and ' ' (1998) turned him into a force to reckon with in the Hindi film industry. However, in the past decade or so, the director hasn’t been able to emulate his previous success. His last outing, 'Sarkar 3', a franchise offering with Amitabh Bachchan fared poorly at the box office as well. In fact, RGV’s streak of under-performing films is what led to speculations about his latest labour of love not finding distributors. While Ramu has put the speculations about Officer to rest, let’s wait and watch if the filmmaker can prove his detractors wrong.
