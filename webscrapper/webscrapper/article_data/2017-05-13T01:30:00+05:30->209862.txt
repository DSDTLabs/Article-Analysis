Hyderabad: In a bid to create a conducive atmosphere for small and medium enterprises to grow their businesses, the Telangana government is mulling setting up a ‘Business Development Centre’ in the IT hub of the city, principal secretary (industries) Jayesh Ranjan said here on Friday.

 “Many of the   in the IT sector are not located in the IT hub but in areas like Uppal, Begumpet or Secunderabad. They have to regularly interact with clients but find it difficult to reach out to them... we are trying to set up a centre in the Cyberabad area, where essentially you will have facilities for client interaction and meetings,” he said, adding that SMEs can be given a small office space to either conduct video conferencing or face-to-face interactions with clients. He was speaking at the launch of Hyderabad-based business technology solutions providerGGK Tech’s new unit at NSL Arena SEZ at Uppal. He said that SMEs have played a very important role in the economic growth of the state and the state government will be providing all the necessary support to them. The government is also trying to help SMEs in the IT sector in the area of funding and is developing a financial instrument to help ease their cash woes.
