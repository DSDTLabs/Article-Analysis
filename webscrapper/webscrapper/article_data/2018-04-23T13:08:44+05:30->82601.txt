Actress   said being a vegan and choosing cruelty-free fashion and accessories have made her feel better about her life.

  
  
 According to a report, she said that   has in a way helped her save money and it also makes her feel good after ditching all animal-related products and meals from her life.
 
 "I've been vegan for almost 10 months now and I went completely cruelty-free in my life even with my beauty products and my whole wardrobe," said Suvari.
 
 "I feel really good making the personal changes that I did and I've always loved fashion, so I wanted to make it a point, for whatever it's worth, and show people that you can have fun with sustainable fashion and that it's possible," she added. 
 
 Veganism has also stopped the ' ' star from caring about what should be considered to be fashionable and she now no longer looks for designer clothes and bags, but gravitates towards sustainable fashion items.
 
 "  and sustainable fashion is what's important to me. I don't care what the most expensive item is or that whole dynamic of someone thinking that they have to buy something to be equal. Why am I carrying this dead animal on my arm? It doesn't feel good'," she said.
