Tirupur: Citing that as many as 5,427 five-year-old cases were pending in Tirupur alone, Madras High Court Chief Justice Indira Banerjee on Saturday said the state was far behind the national average when it came to disposal of cases in the district courts.

 The CJ was in the city to lay   stone for the new building of combined district court complex and alternative dispute resolution centre on the collectorate campus, where a bhoomi pooja was also performed. The new buildings would come up inside the collectorate campus, alongside the upcoming district police office.
 
 “Quick disposal of cases will allow more litigants to approach the legal forums and at the same time quality should not be compromised in the process,” the CJ said as she asked the state judiciary to dispose all the pending five-year-old cases by March 31, 2018.
 
 Justice T S Sivagnanam, another HC judge and one of two portfolio judges to Tirupur, said as per the Supreme Court direction, the courts should not allow the cases to stagnate beyond five years since the date of their institution. Though the total pendency of cases before the courts in Tirupur are lesser than that of many other district courts in the state, 5,427 out of the 43,249 pending cases are more than five years old.
 
 Seeking better cooperation of the bench and bar, the CJ said Tirupur, which was the fifth largest urban conglomeration in the state, was known for its contribution to the country’s economy. “Now, it is important to make the city known for speedy disposal of legal cases,” the Chief Justice said.
