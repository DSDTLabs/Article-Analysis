KOTA:   of Hadouti region are deeply disappointed by state government’s claims at three-day Global Rajasthan Agri-Meet (GRAM).

 Local farmers said government’s promise to assist in waving off agriculture loans and imparting advanced training in agriculture methods holds no weight. Kishan Suman of Girdharpur village under   in Kota, whose specially cultivated varity of Sadabahaar Aam ( ) send to   of  , was disappointed by facilities there. 
 
 “At GRAM, there is no advanced training on agriculture and farming”, Suman said adding, government’s tall claims of assisting farmers in waving off loans are also hollow. Government had promised to relax farmers from paying two month’s interest after demonetisation. Suman claimed, he has availed loan of Rs 50,000 from   but has not been given any relaxation in interest and regularly paying instalments with interests.
 
 Government claimed to bring about 5,000-6,000 farmers at GRAM in Kota, which turned out to be only 2,000-3,000 and they were not provided facilities even, said another farmer. He claimed several local farmers were not invited to the event as they had no inclination towards the party.
 
 Terming GRAM a ‘gimmick’ former Congress minister   alleged that state government has just invited ‘specially selected’ BJP workers to take part in GRAM and has not allowed farmers at grassroot level. He termed GRAM a total waste of public money. 
 
 Singh said there is no point in organising event like GRAM for farmers when they are not paid fair prices of their produce. They are being denied bonus from government purchase of wheat for last three years and mustard has not been purchased despite its price falling every year, Singh further said. 
 
 “MoUs are just game of grabbing government lands for party leaders and their relatives. Farmer, who is the first producer, is not getting any benefit of MOUs which is availed by people indulged in marketing sector,’’ said Singh.
