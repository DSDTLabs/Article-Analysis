MUMBAI: Traffic at the key   was thrown out of gear on Wednesday with Shiv Sainiks thronging the civic headquarters for the  . The Sena had put up rows of saffron flags, décor and a huge pandal around the BMC building. And ‘dhol tasha' groups played loud music continually, resulting in high decibel levels. The BMC falls in the `silence zone' category as it is barely 100 metres from Cama & Albless Hospital.

 All this continued despite heavy police bandobast. A senior police officer said there is a provision of imposing a fine under Noise Pollution Rules.Another cop said, “We are in the process of taking action. Fines will be imposed."
 
 When Uddhav Thackeray arrived along with wife Rashmi and sons Aaditya and Tejas to felicitate the mayoral poll winners, the sounds of dhol tasha increased, with partymen raising loud slogans. This too led to traffic congestion, with traffic movement at one point of time being restricted completely in the south-bound direction. A civic official said permissions had been sought only for the stage that was erected outside the BMC.
