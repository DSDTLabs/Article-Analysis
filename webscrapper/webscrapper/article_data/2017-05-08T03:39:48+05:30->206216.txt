AHMEDABAD: "Do you love off-road biking? Why go to Leh? Enjoy the same thrill, adventure of   here.   area welcomes all off-road bikers to enjoy the road trip in our area..." 

 This is one of the many banners that have come up at important junctions in the Satellite area. The innovative method of protest has been deployed by residents' welfare associations after tiring of bad roads in the new west zone. The   (AMC) seemed to pay no heed to the conventional modes of complaining. By noon on Sunday, the banners had sprung up. Shailesh Patel, who was part of the campaign, said: "Our zone pays the highest tax in this city and gets the worst roads. No road survives more than a year. It is dug up either by the   or by utility companies." 
 
 Nitin Bhatt, who owns a shop near  , told TOI: "Why can't we have a calendar for civic works in our city? We also want to know which contractor lays such poor roads. As taxpayers, we feel fooled."
