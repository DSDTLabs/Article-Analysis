Mumbai: The country’s largest housing finance company   on Thursday reported a net profit of Rs 2,044 crore for the quarter ended March 2017 — down 21.6% from Rs 2,607 crore in the same period last year.

 The drop in net profit was because of exceptional gains in Q4FY16 following a stake sale in  . In 2016, HDFC sold   in its life arm for a consideration of Rs 1,513 crore and used part of the gains to create a one-time special provision of Rs 450 crore. After adjusting for the one-time gain and special provision, the profit before tax was higher by 14%.
 
 The board of directors of HDFC at its meeting held on Thursday also recommended a final dividend of Rs 15 per equity share for 2016-17. The company’s share price fell Rs 7 to Rs 1,564 on the   by close of Thursday’s trade.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Keki Mistry, VC and CEO, HDFC, said that he expected growth to be good in 2017. “This is the best time to buy a house. There has been a time correction in prices which have not gone up for several years and interest rates are at an all-time low,” said Mistry. He added that the government subsidy on   would boost growth in the segment and HDFC was geared to take advantage of the scheme.
 
 As on March 31, 2017, the loan book stood at Rs 2.96 lakh crore as against Rs 2.59 lakh crore in the previous year. During the year, the corporation sold individual loans amounting to Rs 16,027 crore compared with Rs 12,773 crore in the previous year.
 
  said in a research report, “HDFC’s Q4FY17 performance was in line with expectations on all fronts. We expect individual loan growth to pick up with a lag, given the government’s thrust on the affordable housing segment. However, margin pressures are likely to persist due to the heightened competition in this space.”
