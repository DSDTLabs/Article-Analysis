THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Pettah Junction has been a major bottleneck in the city due to land acquisition hurdles. Now, attempts by Kerala road fund board (KRFB) and   (TRDCL) to install signals at the junction too have been hit.

 The presence of underground cables by various   is affecting TRDCL’s work to install traffic signals at the junction. Sources in TRDCL said that they had been sending letters to KRFB for the past seven months to take steps to shift the cables. “We could not dig the place due to the presence of cables. There is no attempt to identify the companies concerned,” said an official.
 
 In addition to the issue of utility cables, the TRDCL is also in need of some extra space to arrange free-left in the area. Sources in TRDCL also alleged that the   has encroached upon the land earmarked for footpath. “We have taken up the issue with them and they readily agreed. However, no action has been taken so far,” said an official.
 
 Pettah remains the single bottleneck in the whole City road improvement project (Crip). Due to delay from the party of Trida to acquire land on time, the KRFB excluded widening of Pettah overbridge from the scope of work of TRDCL. The overbridge and the Pettah junction thus remained a bottleneck in the widened MLA Hostel–Airport road. 
 
 Due to increasing accidents, KRFB had decided to install traffic signals without widening the stretch. It also planned to make improvements to ensure smooth flow of traffic from Anayara to Palayam. The Pettah Junction is not only a bottleneck, but also is congested with traffic to and fro airport, Sanghumugham, etc. It is a meeting place of traffic from various sides such as airport, Palayam, Anayara and  .
