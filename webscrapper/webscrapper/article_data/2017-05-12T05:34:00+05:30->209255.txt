NAGPUR: Come Saturday, the members of Nagpur for Kids (NFK) Club will learn how to make their   ‘Junior Chef with Dominos’ to be held at   from 8.30am to 11.30am.

 The activity-cum-interactive workshop organized by Domino’s Pizza aims at introducing children to culinary skills in pizza making. Special emphasis will be laid on hygiene and kitchen etiquettes.
 
 Mandar Uikey, restaurant manager, says, “We aim at exploring chefs in the little ones and helping them understand the dos and don’ts in a restaurant kitchen. The pizza making process is as satisfying as eating it.”
 
 Uikey added that   organizes such workshops for children on a regular basis to help them get a peek into the world of hospitality.
 
 Children will be divided in two teams. One team will design their own themes for pizza on paper and the other will be led to the kitchen for demonstration purpose and vice versa after some time.
 
 During the demonstration, children will be told about the main ingredients required to make a tasty pizza. Interested children can try their hand at making a pizza, which they will also get to savour.
 
 Uikey added that children will also told about basic kitchen hygiene. A team of seven will assist the children during the workshop. “Such workshops also open doors to various career possibilities, while introducing new concepts to children as well as their parents,” says Uikey.
