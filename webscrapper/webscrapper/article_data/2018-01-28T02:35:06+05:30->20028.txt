GURUGRAM: An   query by a Gurugram resident has revealed that 84   in the city are yet to submit reports on installation of CCTV cameras on their premises as had been directed by the district administration recently.

 In the wake of recent incidents of crime in school compounds, the Gurugram administration had in September last year directed all private institutions to install CCTV cameras and keep recordings of their footage. Surprisingly enough, the directives were only for private schools.
 
 The RTI query, filed by city activist Aseem Takyar, revealed that 221 schools had submitted reports mentioning they had complied with the directives.
 
 “I was worried after the death of a student in a Haryana international school. This prompted me to ask the administration how many schools had complied with the directives it had issued,” Takyar said. 
 
 District education officer Ram Kumar said: “Most of the schools have submitted reports on installation of CCTV cameras. The schools were asked to document the details of the footage so that they have every information about each staff member.”
 
 The RTI activist was reportedly told that a safety committee had been formed to look into any violation of the directives. During a visit to the schools, TOI found one government institution in Gurugram that had installed CCTV cameras with its funds.
