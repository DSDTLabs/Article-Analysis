MANSA: Chief minister   unveiled the foundation stone for work of repairing 1,600 kilometer link roads by the Punjab Marketing Board at a cost of Rs 2000 crore.

 The work of laying or repairing link roads will be completed by March 31, 2019.
 
 Amarinder, who was here to launch the farm debt waiver scheme, said that, “I had ensured laying of link roads during my previous tenure till 2007. In the last 10 years of SAD-BJP rule, nothing was done on the count and the roads had got big potholes. At many places the roads were washed away.”
 
 “Now, again under the   rule, these link roads will be constructed by marketing board for which we have mobilised resources,” he said.
