BENGALURU: With   now entrusted with carrying out background verification for those applying for a US visa under the   (GEP), the process is expected to become hassle-free.

 Bharath Kumar Kuthati, regional passport officer in Bengaluru, said 530 people have already applied for visas under GEP, a US Customs and   ( ) trusted traveller programme, and that the verification process will begin soon.
 
 He said the initiative is part of the GEP memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between India and US in 2017 during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit.
 
 CBP allows expedited clearance for pre-approved, low-risk travellers upon arrival in the US through dedicated lanes and kiosks. On why the 2017 MoU is only being put into action now, Bharath Kumar said: “There were several agencies involved in the process and a lot of nuances had to be worked out.”
 
 According to the passport regional office, the GEP programme came into existence in the backdrop of US’s concerns about people without background checks entering their country, especially with H-1B visas. The background check will include probing the candidates’ financial background, crime record, if any, and other general police verification.
 
 ‘Bangladeshis getting Indian passports’
 
 Bharath conceded that several Bangladeshis got Indian passports by providing documents in the state. “The agencies which have tracked these people staying here illegally have brought it to our notice and we have registered a few cases,” he said.
