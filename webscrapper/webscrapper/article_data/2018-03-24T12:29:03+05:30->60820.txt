HYDERABAD: A 16th century temple like structure with Chaturbhuja (four handed) Rama idol has been discovered on the hillocks at   near Yadadri. Based on inscriptions, historians and epigraphy experts say the idol is similar to the Rama statue in the Bhadrachalam temple. Four-handed idols of Rama are said to be very rare and historians believe this temple may have been built before the Bhadrachalam temple.

 “The small hillock was once the caves of primitive humans. The temple was discovered by cattle grazer P Mallesh. The idol in the temple has four hands holding a bow and arrow in one pair and   and Chakra in the other. Sita is sitting on the lap of Rama and there is no Lakshmana. As Saidapuram Rama resembles Lord Vishnu, the incarnation can be called Vaishnavarama. The idol is five feet high and is embedded into the rock. The walls of the temple are built with stones. The Bhadrachalam temple idol dates to the 17th century,” historian   of   told TOI.
 
 “There is an inscription near a big boulder which reads ‘Sree Rama Bhona Gandiva’. The script in the inscription dates back to the 16th century. The boulder also had an idol of Lord Hanuman,” he added.
