NAVI MUMBAI: The   chairman, Shivram Patil, presented the   financial   of Rs 2,934.29 crore for 2017-18 in the general body meeting on Friday. The committee-approved budget is Rs 65.18 crore less than the Rs 2,999.47 crore estimated by the civic commissioner. The budget was presented amidst criticism of civic chief Tukaram Mundhe and his mode of functioning.

 Patil expressed anguish over Mundhe’s failure to seek prior permission from standing and general body for increasing taxes. He explained the changes incorporated by the committee to the budget presented by the Commissioner. “None of the proposed increase in taxes, estimated by the administration, as part of income was accepted, as the committee was not informed about them before February 20, as is mandatory according to the Municipal Corporation Act.”
 
 He added that certain unwanted allocations, as in case of CCTVs, were reduced from the expenditure. The General Body will now be holding a two-day discussion on the budget on March 21 and 22.
 
 The civic chief was also criticized for not undertaking construction work of Ambedkar Bhavan, as instructed by the house.
 
 The chairman also alleged that not a single development work has been undertaken during the civic commissioner’s tenure.
