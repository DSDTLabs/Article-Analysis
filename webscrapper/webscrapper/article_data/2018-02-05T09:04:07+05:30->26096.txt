G Rajadurai, 33, who had been working in an   in the city, wanted to start his own business around two years ago. Driven by the information he had read in a book about mushroom cultivation, he went about learning the ropes. “I did a one-day course on mushroom cultivation and also travelled to a lot of mushroom farms around the state,” he says.

 Today, he runs his own oyster mushroom farm at Athappa Gounden Pudur near the city. He harvests around 80kg a day on the one-acre farm and sells them for around Rs125 per kilogram. Mushrooms have been a favourite in Coimbatore for around 20 years, say cultivators. “Even when mushrooms were unknown in Chennai, Coimbatore residents were seeking mushrooms from outlets,” says A R Subramanian, who has been cultivating oyster mushrooms in the city for 20 years. Today, from bakeries to roadside ‘kaalan’ outlets, mushrooms have almost become a staple.
 
 Subramanian, a former marketing professional, said in the early 1990s, he found out there was a demand for mushrooms. “I found out that it was a ‘pull product’, something that we don’t need to push to outlets,” he says. He set up an oyster mushroom farm in 1993. He says for 20 years he ran his farm on trial. “In 2004, I started a fullfledged mushroom farm in an acre,” he says. Today, he harvests around 100kg of oyster mushrooms on his farm near Ramachettipalayam near the city. He has four cultivation sheds in his farm, each of which can house 1,000 to 1,500 cultivation bags.
 
 Today, several people from the city are taking to mushroom cultivation. Mushroom farms in the city cater to hotels, outlets, vendors or dealers who retail them.
 
 But the enterprise, which seems a very promising business option, can turn out to be a failure if not properly implemented using scientific and technical methods, say experts. Several people who jumped into the business have abandoned it in a few months due to the lack of know-how, they say.
