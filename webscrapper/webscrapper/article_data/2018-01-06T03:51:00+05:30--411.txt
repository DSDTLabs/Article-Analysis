Panaji: Just days after a massive blaze gutted a rooftop pub leading to the death of 14 people, the North Goa collector and the North Goa district disaster management authority held a meeting to review   in restaurants, discos and other public places.

 During the meeting, the fire and emergency services department was asked to undertake a detailed review of fire safety measures at all important buildings and installations in the North Goa district to ensure “strict compliance with fire safety norms”.
 
 “All local bodies shall have to ensure that trade licences of commercial establishments that fail to comply with fire safety norms by March 31 are not renewed,” a government official, who was part of the meeting, said.
 
 According to sources, the government has ordered panchayats and municipalities not to give permission to operate to hotels, restaurants, discos or hospitals if they do not comply with fire safety norms.
 
 The tourism department was also directed to ensure that all shacks and huts comply with fire safety norms by January 31.
 
 Present at the meeting were representatives from the fire and emergency services, health department, police, sarpanchas and secretaries of coastal villages of North Goa and officials of the disaster management authority.
 
 The disaster management plan for industries dealing in hazardous substances was also reviewed.
 
 “Industries handling hazardous material in North Goa district must plan to conduct mock drills involving all stakeholder departments and local community within a month,” a government source said.
 
 Sources said that such review meetings will be held at regular intervals and “follow up action will be taken to ensure compliance” of the directions issued regarding fire safety and disaster management, sources said.
