CHENNAI: DMK will soon hold its organisational elections in what is seen as a significant move by its working president   to strengthen the party structure further, in the backdrop of the prevailing political scenario in the state.

 Party general secretary   has announced that new members can join the party, which already has 1.1 crore members, by paying Rs 25 as application fee and Rs 20 as membership fee.
 
 The membership drive will close on November 15 and preparations will begin for holding organisational elections in 2018. This will be the first time in the history of the party, where organisational elections will be overseen by a working president.
 
 As a prelude to this, the IT wing of the party has started holding conferences and consultations across Tamil Nadu to woo more youth into the party.
 
 “All applications must contain the EPIC number and a photocopy of the name which must be sent by post to the party headquarters. The application must have the signature of a local party MLA, MP or a former secretary among others and must reach before the last date,“ said Anbazhagan.
 
 The membership drive comes at a time when   cadres are in confusion about their future, as also that of the party.
 
 “We had a meeting of the IT wing in Chennai and, through WhatsApp as well as social media, we invited youngsters to join the meeting. Within a few hours, we received good response from youngsters, either college students or those who have recently taken up jobs, especially in the IT sector,“ one of the IT wing organizer of the party told TOI. Leaders apprised the youngsters about the party history and how it worked for social justice at the meeting.
 
 “Many youngsters showed interest in knowing about how reservation was introduced in the state. Finally, after the meeting ended, many took selfies with IT wing chief,  ,“ said the organiser.
