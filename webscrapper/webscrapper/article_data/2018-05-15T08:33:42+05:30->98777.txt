A   trooper was martyred along the International Border while preventing a ceasefire violation in Samba district of   and Kashmir. 

 The troopers of post Manguchack, 173 Battalion BSF (  area) noticed some movement ahead of the fence, closer to the International Boundary.
 
 The BSF troops fired few illumination rounds as the area close to international boundary has thick foliage and hinders observation. The illumination attempt was immediately retaliated by fire from the area from where the movement was suspected.
 
 BSF troopers from nearby mounds engaged with this fire effectively.
 
 During this exchange of fire, one burst from counterpart side hit a loophole of the mound from where Constable   was engaging the threat. Constable   got hit on his left eye from a bullet.
 
 He was immediately evacuated to medical facilities but he couldn't be saved. Complete area of operation is cordoned off. At present firing has stopped and the search operation is on.
