AHMEDABAD: A city sessions court on Monday sentenced two women of   area of the city to life for killing their brother’s wife four years ago.

 Additional sessions judge D P Mahida observed in the verdict that the duo —   and Rani Vaghadia — had committed a heinous crime by burning their sister-in-law, Usha Akash Sujwani, alive which was proved in the dying declaration of the victim and hence no mercy can be shown against the convicts.
 
 According to the police records, Usha was staying at her in-laws’ place in Sardarnagar where Jayshree and Rani used to indulge in scuffle with their brother Akash over some financial issues. To pacify her sister-in-laws, Usha used to tell them to settle the matter with their brother. On April 30, 2014, when Usha again asked the two sisters to go for a peaceful solution, they started arguments with her. It soon took an ugly turn when the duo poured kerosene on Usha and set her on fire. Usha was rushed to the civil hospital in Asarwa where she named the two sisters in her dying declaration before police.
 
 Public prosecutor Ramesh Patni had earlier submitted before the court that the dying declaration can be substantiated with the corroborative evidence of the case and demanded stern punishment for the sisters which was accepted by the court.
