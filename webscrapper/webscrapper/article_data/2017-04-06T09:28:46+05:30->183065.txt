LUCKNOW:   might soon be developed into an AIIMS-like facility under the central government’s proposal of setting up six new   in the state. On KGMU VC Prof Ravi Kant’s request for the same on Wednesday, CM   said a plan in this regard should be looked into. 

 Giving directions to medical education minister Ashutosh Tandon on a plan for KGMU’s prospects of being developed into an AIIMS, Yogi said, “It will be a good step if KGMU can be developed for this.” 
 
 Yogi also asked Tandon and health minister   to chalk out a road map for inclusion of all medical colleges in the state under KGMU. 
 
 “The curriculum will have to be centralised and examinations be uniformed. Something that should be thought over and looked into,” he said. Currently medical colleges in Allahabad, Kannauj, Jalaun and Azamgarh are affiliated to KGMU. 
 
 Yogi also announced that 25 new medical colleges will be set up in the state but that would add to the demand for faculty that is already a big concern. “Devise a plan to try and fill all vacant posts in a year even if that calls for making of a special Act,” he directed his team of cabinet and state ministers. 
 
 Herbal gardens: To strengthen ayurvedic, unani and homeopathic medical facilities in the state, a total of 10 herbal gardens are proposed. According to additional chief secretary Anita Bhatnagar Jain, one in Lucknow has already been taken up and Yoga wellness centres have been established in 41 districts. The number of post graduate seats will also be increased. Besides, counselling for NEET will be fully online till college allotment.
