NEW DELHI: Gangster   (31), who was running his brother  's gang following his arrest, was nabbed on Tuesday night from east Delhi's Maujpur. He had allegedly murdered two gang members of his rival Chhenu in April 2017 and had a reward of Rs 50,000 on him. 

 DCP (northeast) Atul Kumar Thakur said the accused was arrested when he came to meet an aide on the eve of Shab-e-Barat. He is allegedly involved in six cases, including that of murder, arms act and extortion.
 
 Nadir had taken over the charge of the gang after his younger brother Naseer was arrested on November 5, 2013. Since then,   and his aide   have been running the gang.
 
 Cops said that after the double murder of Qamar and Imran of the Chhenu gang in Jafrabad in April last year, Nadir went into hiding. He had his hideouts in Maharashtra, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.
 
 Nadir ensured that he doesn't stay at a place for more than a day and would communicate with his gang members using WhatsApp and Facebook messenger to avoid coming on the cops' radar. 
 
 Police said that Nadir and Naseer entered the world of crime in 2007 after being influenced by other local criminals. They ran a mobile repairing shop but later started a cable network business, following which they increased their influence in the area.
 
 Naseer's gang came in direct confrontation with Irfan alias Chhenu and since then, both have been involved in a gang-war to take control of the organised crime syndicate of trans-Yamuna area. In October 2017, two members, namely Wajid and   of Naseer gang were gunned down by shooters of Chhenu.
 
 Senior police officers said Nadir has studied up to Class X and is married. He was handing the drug and gambling operations of the gang. Cops are now zeroing in on Hashim Baba, who has taken over the charge of the gang.
