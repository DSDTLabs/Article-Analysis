LUCKNOW:   across the city   at several crossings and some of the   to a standstill on Tuesday. Areas like Mahanagar crossing, Wireless chauraha, Kapoorthala, Dandaiyya market, Pariwartan chowk, near Kaiserbagh, Lalbagh, Aishbagh, Mawaiyya, Chowk chauraha, Koneshwar chauraha and the adjoining roads experienced gridlock. Traffic SP Habibul Hasan said, “We have put several diversions and alternate routes in order to keep the traffic going.” 

 Most bhandaras started around 10am. And soon, the diverted routes got congested even as some areas had been barricaded by traffic police. The 400-meter stretch in front of Hanuman Mandir opposite Lucknow University was barricaded, hampering traffic movement from New Hyderabad. However, later it was resolved by traffic police.
 
 A similar situation arose around 4pm at Wireless chauraha when people started stopping their vehicles in the middle of the road to accept ‘prasad’ from   bhandaras. The chaotic situation was controlled by traffic police later.
 
 Police deployed at Koneshwar crossing had a tough time managing the situation which many vehicles parked haphazardly. Speaking to TOI, commuters said that during Bada Mangal, crowds at bhandaras lead to traffic mismanagement. Many others trapped in the congestion near Koneshwar chauraha pointed out that the road was narrow so the district administration should allow only one or two stalls at crossings. There were more than four stalls at the crossing.
