His last directorial 'Jab Harry Met Sejal' (2017), starring   and  , though failed to impress the audience, had all the elements of a quintessential   film --- a coming-of-age narrative, discovering love while travelling and understanding it from a Sufi perspective. The director, who has entertained viewers with his brand of cinema with films like Tamasha (2015),   (2011), Love Aaj Kal (2009) and   (2007), has recently zeroed in on his next script, which the director has penned himself. 

 However, he is quick to point out that he will be embarking on a hitherto uncharted territory. He says, “I have written a script and I am hoping that I will be able to start shooting by the middle of the year. What I can confidently say is that, this film will not have any of the elements for which my narratives are known for.” 
 
 Clearly, it’s high time Imtiaz rewrote his own journey.
