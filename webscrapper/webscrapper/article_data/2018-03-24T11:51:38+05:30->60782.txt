GAYA: A division bench of Patna   comprising Justice AK Tripathi and Justice   on Thursday expressed unhappiness on the manner in which the state government is handling the issue of encroachment of Gaya   

 During the hearing of a contempt petition filed in the matter on Thursday, the state government made a submission that concrete structures constructed in the Maidan area are located in its periphery and they occupy a very small part of the Maidan area.
 
 However, disapproving the government’s submission, the court gave four weeks’ time to the state government to comply with its earlier order. Earlier, on January 12, Justice AK Tripathi and   had rejected the government’s move to regularise the encroached or unauthorised construction. The order clearly mentioned that "no post facto approval will be given by any authority to any constructed building or offices in Gandhi Maidan.”
 
 As per records, Gaya Gandhi Maidan is spread over an area of about 80 acres and more than a dozen unauthorised constructions have come up on about 5 lakh square feet area.
 
 The order on January 12 had stated that Gandhi Maidan will have to be cleared of all constructions and encroachments to be made available for the people of Gaya. Pratinjya, the local citizens’ group has approached the court for the Maidan’s restoration as it is the only green lung situated at the heart of the town.
