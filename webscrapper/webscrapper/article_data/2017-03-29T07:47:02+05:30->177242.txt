Kendrapada: A scorching summer on the horizon spells a host of problems for the animals at Bhitarkanika National Park. 

 "Summer is a testing time as the animals in India's second largest mangrove forest will have to cope with acute water stress and fodder scarcity. To tackle the extreme heat, authorities are making special arrangements to make life comfortable for penned crocodiles, pythons and other animals in   within the park," said  , the forest range officer of the park.
 
 Water of the smaller ponds dry especially quickly, making it difficult for the estuarine crocodiles to survive. About 100 baby crocodiles in the newly built crocodile breeding and research centre at   are in greater danger, due to their young age, said Nayak. 
 
 Bhitarakanika's mangrove forest is also home to hundreds of endangered spotted deer and wild boars. "This summer, we renovated 20 ponds, many water holes and ditches inside the forest to provide water to spotted deer and other animals to prevent the animals from entering villages in search of water," informed the forest official.
 
 The spectre of forest fires now looms large over the forest with the onset of summer. The forest department has set up fire lines around the park. They have deployed 40 permanent staff and 45 daily wage watchmen to detect forest fires and prevent it from spreading, said Nayak.
 
 "We have also installed fire extinguishers in the boats and with forest guards to check any fire accident in the forest. The forest department has also banned cooking inside the park areas by tourists and forest guards," said the forest official.
