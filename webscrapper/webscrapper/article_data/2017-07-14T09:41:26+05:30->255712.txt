THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister   and his cabinet colleague AK Balan have registered strong protest against Central Board of Film Certification’s (CBFC) directive to remove words like cow, Hindutwa and Gujarat from a   on renowned economist  .

 In his Facebook post on Thursday, the chief minister said the censor board’s directive on the documentary titled ‘The Argumentative Indian’ was an outright attack on free and independent thoughts. “This can be seen only as a fascist trend,” Vijayan said.
 
  was afraid of words like Gujarat, cow and Hindu being brought up for discussions, he said. “Those who are in power at the Centre should clarify whether they made the censor board to beep out these words in the documentary fearing it would point at their heinous acts,” he said.
 
 Pointing out that these words were used by Sen himself in the documentary by Suman Ghosh, Vijayan said the Centre has transformed various institutions like the censor board into mere tools for implementing its Hindutwa agenda.
 
 Seconding the chief minister’s concerns on the issue, Balan said the ‘politics of restraints’ was once again trying to make inroads into art and literature. “
 
 Citing ‘similar restrictions’ imposed on screening of three films at the recently-held International Documentary and Short Film Festival in the state, Balan said enforcing the Centre’s politically-motivated decisions was a threat to the country’s diverse culture. “Ghosh’s stand that he will not abide by the CBFC’s direction is praiseworthy,” the culture minister wrote on Facebook.
