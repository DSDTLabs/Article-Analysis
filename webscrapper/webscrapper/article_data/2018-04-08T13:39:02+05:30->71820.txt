Actress  , who has featured in   and will be seen in Anupam Kher-starrer  , said she wants to do more slice of life genre films now.
 
  
 Aahana told "I want to do a film which is more light... A slice of life kind of film... I have not done such kind of a film in the true sense. So, I want to do that. Though 'Lipstick Under My Burkha' was something like that but it became a film with social messages. Something where 'baat kehdi and kisi ko bura nahi laga (a statement is made without hurting anyone)."

 Aahana said the film made people notice her. 
 
 "The film did not as such help in opening doors but helped me as people know me now. It has been a great branding for me... They understood that 'she is not scared to pick up challenging roles'. That has been like a good learning and good take away from the film," said the actress, who has also featured in the film   .
