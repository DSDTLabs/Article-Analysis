PANAJI: With just over a month left for the financial year to close, the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) has written to the   seeking Rs 22 crore as grants to clear the pending   and the salaries of   staff.

 In a letter addressed to the directorate of municipal administration (DMA) on Friday, CCP mayor   reiterated his request for the state government to sanction the grants for the corporation as earmarked in the state budget.
 
 “The current financial year will expire on March 31 and the allocation of the budget provisions is to be utilized before the said date. Hence, we request you to kindly put up the proposal before the government for immediate release of funds,” Furtado said.
 
 Furtado said the funds were required for developmental works in the CCP wards amounting to Rs 6.30 crore. CCP also requires funds for land acquisition for development and beautification of Miramar amounting to Rs 30.30 lakh, procurement of weed cutting machines and pole-pruners worth Rs 6.63 lakh, procurement of brush chipper at Rs 85.68 lakh and purchase of a water tanker and   at Rs 43.12 lakh. The total sanction for various works stands at Rs 11.86 lakh.
 
 Furtado also pointed out that non release of salary grants since 2013-14 has led to a major financial burden on the corporation. “A major portion of the revenue earned by CCP by way of house tax, licence fees and others taxes is spent on salaries of the staff, cleaning of the city and routine development and maintenance works,” he said.
 
 The corporation has failed to receive salary grants for 2013-14 and 2014-15 and some dues for 2010-11 and 2011-12, amounting to Rs 10.65 crore. “We are not in position to take up any major development activities without the support and financial assistance from the government,” Furtado argued in his letter.
