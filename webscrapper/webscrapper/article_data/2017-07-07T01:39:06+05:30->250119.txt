MUMBAI: From January 1, 2018, the practice of dual maximum retail price (MRP) will be outlawed, ordered the  . This means, companies cannot charge a different price for water, aerated drinks, snacks or other packaged commodities at airports, hotels, malls or any other public place.

 The order, dated June 23, was issued after an appeal from the   (LMO). The LMO had cracked the whip on big-time manufacturers for affixing a higher MRP at premium locations like malls, upmarket restaurants, hotels and airports. The quality, quantity and weight of these branded products were no different than the identical packages sold cheaper at the regular grocery stores.
 
 In view of the new order, the LMO has now issued fresh   to various companies, including Coca Cola, Pepsi, Red Bull, Eureka Forbes, Flipkart and Amazon, to desist from the practice of   and follow mandatory declaration norms for packaged commodities.
 
 Pepsi CEO declined comment, while Coca Cola officials were unreachable.
 
 “It has been a long-drawn battle because the big companies had approached the Bombay high court and other fora. They claimed the Legal Metrology Act was silent on dual MRP so they could charge a different price,” controller of legal metrology Amitabh Gupta told TOI. “We have now got the Act amended to state that companies cannot levy two different MRPs for a single product unless it is within legal provisions. Clearly, there is no law that permits them to do so.”
 
 Gupta has called upon members of the public to report instances of dual MRP after January 1 so that punitive action can be taken.
 
 A frequent traveller, Shridhar Yadav, who has often paid three times more for bottled water or an aerated drink at the  , feels this step was long awaited. 
 
 “Now, the enforcement poses a challenge. Restaurants too charge more than the MRP on any given day. Dual MRP is the manufacturer’s mode of connivance,” he added.
