KOLKATA: Once again it is time for the alumni of IIT-Kharagpur, settled across the globe, to visit the campus and pledge for funds. This year’s meet, slated for January 12-14, is likely to bring in Rs 4 crore in donations, over and above individual commitments made by alumni who keep giving annual funds to help run the interdisciplinary schools of studies they have founded in collaboration with their alma mater.

 Outgoing president of the Foundation, Arjun Malhotra (founder of HCL), who started the GS Sanyal School of Telecommunications, and the incoming president,  , who started a school of architecture on campus, will meet the institute authorities to find out about the pressing needs of the hour and the infrastructural/academic plans that can be brought to life at a time when government funds are shrinking.
 
 As part of a tradition, the batch of ’68, which is in its 50th year of passing out, and the batch of ’93, which completes 25 years of leaving the institute, have donated Rs 50 lakh each. New pledges for hostel renovations are also likely to be announced at the meet. Alumni who were past residents of the Patel hall set a trend by donating Rs 75 lakh to modernize the building last year. This was followed by donations for RK Hall.
 
 “The Foundation has already generated over Rs 180 crore for the campus and we are pushing our goals further,” Malhotra said. The alumni are also helping to build a hi-tech ambulance service, a landscaped and sculpted adda zone and a clock tower to add to the aesthetics of the campus.
