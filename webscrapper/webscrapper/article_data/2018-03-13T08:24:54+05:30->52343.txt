RAJKOT: A   stabbed his ex-wife to death at a   opposite   in Rajkot on Sunday night. Police arrested   for the crime on Monday morning. 

 Police said Parmar, a resident of Vijaynagar in Nava Thorala area, was angry with his ex-wife Dipika Solanki (28), a resident of Ambedkarnagar in Nava Thorala, for divorcing him. According to the complaint lodged against him by Dipika’s mother Lakshmi, Parmar used to call and abuse her often ever since she divorced her a month ago. The couple was married three years ago. 
 
 “As Parmar would pick up fights with Dipika, suspecting her of having an extra-marital affair, she divorced him. Dipika used to work as a caterer. On the night of the murder, she had gone to a party plot to serve as a caterer. At this time, Parmar called her outside, and when she came out, he stabbed her and fled from the spot,” Rajkot taluka police station inspector V S Vanzara said.
