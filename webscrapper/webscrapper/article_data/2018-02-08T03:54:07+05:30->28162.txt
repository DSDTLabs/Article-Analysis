 The audits were commissioned to look into reasons for the delay in handover of flats to homebuyers. 
 
 GNIDA officials did not share any more details, saying that can only be revealed once the report is finalised. In the Greater Noida, about 1.33 lakh flats are stuck across 104 housing projects.
 
 GNIDA additional CEO BK Tripathi said, “Some details have come to light from the audit report of the first 25 builders scrutinized. I will share the facts regarding each builder once we have a final audit report in the next few days. If builders have used the money deposited by homebuyers wrongly or for their own personal use and have thus been unable to deliver flats, action will be taken.”
 
 On January 15, chief secretary Rajive Kumar had said “criminal or civil action is on the cards for builders on a case-to-case basis depending on the facts and findings of the audit reports in the three areas of Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway”.
 
 A financial and physical audit of builder projects in Noida and Greater Noida has been carried out by international firm Currie & Brown. So far, a total of 62 builders’ accounts have been audited in the three areas in the first phase of the exercise.
