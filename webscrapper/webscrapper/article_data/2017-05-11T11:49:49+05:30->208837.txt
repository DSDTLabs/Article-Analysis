RANCHI: Chief secretary   appeared in person before the division bench of   on Wednesday. She was summoned by the court in a six year old   case related to crisis of   in the state. The court in its own motion had registered a PIL in 2011 and has been hearing the case regularly, issuing necessary directions to the government from time to time.

 Verma appeared before the bench comprising chief justice Pradeep Kumar Mohanty and justice Anand Sen. Though the court reserved its order after the hearing, it issued directions to Verma to ensure that no one suffered crisis of drinking water during the summer months. 
 
 Sources in the court said Verma was asked not to confine work related to drinking water to paper only. It’s only during summer that the government has to make special arrangements for drinking water, otherwise once monsoon arrives there is no crisis, the court observed. 
 
 Asking Verma to ensure availability of drinking water in every village, the bench also directed her to arrange water supply through tankers in villages with a population of over 500 people. 
 
 Verma admitted to work in the direction of providing water supply to villages. Prior to this six senior advocates and ten advocates presented their reports on state of affairs related to drinking water availability in state. Amicus curie in the case   said that the court has been very serious about the issue. 
 
 “We have villages where women have to walk more than 2km to ferry drinking water during summer months whereas there are handpumps that have since long been pumping out red coloured water which is not even suitable for consumption by animals,” he said.
