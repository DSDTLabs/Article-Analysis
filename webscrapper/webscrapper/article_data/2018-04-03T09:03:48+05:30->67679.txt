 The Lokayukta’s office said the notices will be issued on Tuesday and that the next hearing was likely to be held on May 7. The first preliminary hearing in the case was held on Monday in the presence of Goa Foundation director,  .
 
 Goa Foundation had earlier filed a complaint with the anti-corruption branch ( ) of the vigilance department, and the   (CBI) to investigate the process of lease renewals. As both agencies did not initiate a probe, it then filed a case before the Lokayukta.
 
 The voluntary organisation sought investigation of the circumstances that led to the en masse second renewal of 88 mining leases in Goa to various private stakeholders (leaseholders) for the period spanning November 1, 2014 to January 12, 2015, through “flagrant abuse of power and conspiracy” by the persons listed as respondents.

As a result, they benefited by operating the mining leases, allocated for nearly three years from the period 2015-2018, till the intervention of the  , which set aside all these illegal renewals,” the Goa Foundation complaint read.
