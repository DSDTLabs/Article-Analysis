NEW DELHI: Mocking   by invoking megastar   and mouthing his marquee dialogues was an innovative way of engaging   workers who had endured speeches on demonetisation on a cold evening at   stadium.

  drew guffaws and cheers alike for his performance as he put a hand on his waist and mimicked Bachchan. At one point, he said Modi gave an Amitabhlike speech on demonetisation on November 8, to tell Indians that he had turned currency notes in their pockets into worthless paper. 
 
 He recalled the song from   to say Modi had duped people through notebandi. “Ram naam japna, gareeb ka maal apna,” he recited.
 
 Ever since Gandhi family’s famous fallout with Bachchan, he has been a taboo subject in Congress. But many felt it was politically smart of Rahul since Bachchan is a “brand ambassador” of PM Modi and the two enjoy a cosy relationship.
