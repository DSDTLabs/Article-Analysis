 The hoopla about the menace of stray   and how it threatens road safety hides the fact that these herds eat trash, sleep on the roads, and die of starvation, disease, and accidental injuries. People have lost all tolerance and mercy for these meek animals that have nourished them for ages. Owners abandon these cows when these can no longer produce milk.
 
 
 Cruelty to the stray cattle is increasing despite laws against it. The cattle need shelters where it would not have to survive on dirty water and leftovers. Feeding on plastic-mixed waste is choking it. The love and kindness for holy cows is gone. Volunteer bodies can’t help the animals without their computerised tracking and radio-collar tagging. Instead of buying an expensive dog of a foreign breed, adopt the street puppies and calves. Feed them for love instead of just rituals. It is for food, generally, that they chase people. Show them kindness and you’ll find them peaceful and docile.
