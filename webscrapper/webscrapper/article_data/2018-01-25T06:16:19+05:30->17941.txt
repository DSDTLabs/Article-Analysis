GREATER NOIDA: A driver and two helpers of a garbage collection van narrowly escaped after four men allegedly chased them on a bike and set the van on fire in Omicron on Wednesday afternoon. The three workers immediately jumped off the vehicle to save their lives.

 The workers were employed by a contractor for AG Enviro Infra Projects Private Limited, which is engaged in sanitation works with GNIDA. Though it is suspected that the four men may have been demanding the ban on Padmaavat movie, police have not confirmed this yet.
 
 Driver Bablu and helpers Kramveer and Jeetu, said they were returning from Surajpur to Omicron to pick up garbage. “When we reached near the Omicron roundabout, four men on a Hero Splendor bike chased us. They threw a bottle of suspicious liquid on our van and set it on fire with matches,” Bablu said.
 
 He said he immediately opened the door and jumped off the vehicle along with his two helpers. The vehicle immediately went up in flames. The four accused fled the spot. Bablu said they did not raise any slogans.
 
 Suniti, SP (rural) GB Nagar said a case has been registered and added that fire tenders soon sdoused the flames.
