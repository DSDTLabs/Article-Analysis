ERODE: A week after stopping movement of all vehicles, except two-wheelers, via the 70-year-old bridge across the   River at   here suspecting its stability,   officials on Saturday inspected the bridge and found it to be in good condition.

 “Only the tar road needs to be relaid. Otherwise, the condition of the bridge is fine,” K  , executive engineer, said.
 
 The Public Works Department (PWD) constructed the bridge across the Bhavani in 1948 to transport construction materials required for Bhavanisagar dam. After the construction of the dam in 1956, PWD dedicated the bridge for public use.
 
 The bridge was of great benefit to the residents of Pungar, Periyar Nagar, Karatchikorai, Pattaramangalam and Thengumarada. A week ago, PWD handed over the bridge to the State Highways Department, which placed iron bars to stop movement of heavy and small vehicles through the bridge. State Highways Department officials advised the commuters to use Thottampalayam bridge instead.
 
 During the inspection on Saturday, officials found that all the pillars of the bridge were in good condition. “A detailed proposal will be sent to government to get fund to relay the road,” Thirumoorthy said.
