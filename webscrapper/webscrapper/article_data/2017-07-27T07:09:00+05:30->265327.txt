CHANDIGARH:   is soon going to start work on developing   into an open-air jail as a pilot project so that prisoners could reintegrate into the society before finally stepping out. State jails minister   said there was an initial proposal to shift 31 prisoners confined in the jail, to open-air jail on the basis of good behavior and conduct inside jail premises. These are those prisoners who have completed their maximum term of sentence for the offence committed by them and are to be released from the jail in a year or two.

 He said this would give these prisoners new lease of life, a chance to reform, re-establish family ties and find work for earning livelihood before they go out. 
 
 The minister said spouses of prisoners would also be allowed to live with them in an independent room inside the open-air jail premises with minimum security, adding that prisoners would be allowed to move out of the jail premises during the day for work with jail authorities keeping them under survellance through the global positioning system (GPS). 
 
 Further, prisoners shifted to the open-air jail would be allowed to meet their families, said Panwar,
