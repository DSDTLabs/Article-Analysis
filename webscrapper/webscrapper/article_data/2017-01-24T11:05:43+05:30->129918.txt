Getting   on your chin can be very painful and at the same time look hideous. It’s the most common spot on the face to get  . Women often experience these breakouts before their periods, but if it’s happening more than often, it might indicate something!

 We got in touch with Mumbai-based Dermatologist & Laser Surgeon, Dr.  ,   to break down the reasons behind such acne.
 
 Hormonal acne occurs first around the mouth, chin and jaw line. This hormonal acne comes and goes throughout the menstrual cycle. The breakouts commonly appear during the ovulation or just before your period begins. Other hormonal reasons for acne your chin can be pregnancy, birth-control pills and puberty stages for some. While if your acne comes more than often, it may indicate that you’re dealing with severe PCOS. In this case, you should always consult a dermatologist.
 
 Apart from the hormonal reasons, your make-up use can cause breakouts too. Lip balms, lipsticks, glosses may contain few ingredients that encourage breakouts on your chin. Sometimes even your nail paint can cause this—as many people have a habit of touching their chin too often. So, if you notice persistent   after applying make-up, try to identify the product and stop using it.
 
 Also, bacteria and poor hygiene is the most common reason for such acne—resting your hands on the chin, dirty pillows or constantly using mobile phones. 
 
 Lastly, even poor diet can cause such acne, as the acne on chin is related to the small intestine and indicates the build-up of toxins. Try to keep a balanced diet and incorporate more fibre.
