SURAT: A 57-year-old inspector in the regional transport office at  , who has just four months to go for retirement, will be sitting on an indefinite   for due promotion and salary for 36 months from Monday. 

 H L  , currently a class-II officer in Valsad   office, who has been in service for past 34 years, shot off a letter earlier this   to the state government informing him about his decision to go on an indefinite hunger strike from January 1 if his pending demands for promotion and salary dues are not met. “I am senior-most in the department and what did I get after serving it with dedication all these years? I have written 18 letters to the department requesting for promotion which is due since 2014. Also, I wasn’t paid salary for over one-and-half-year since 2016,” he alleged.
 
 He has threatened in his letter, a copy of which is with TOI that he will sit on an indefinite hunger strike at Valsad RTO office from Monday. “I was transferred to Valsad in 2016 but my in-charge RTO did not allow me to join. I could join the office only in July 2017 after I had threatened to go on an indefinite hunger strike,” said Parekh. He was not paid salary for this period. Parekh claims he was regularly attending office. “Initially, I was not considered for promotion because I had not cleared the compulsory computer examination. However, I cleared it and presented the result when promotions were being announced. The department should have given me promotion but I was denied my right. People several years my juniors have become senior to me,” Parekh added.
