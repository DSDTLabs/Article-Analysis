 Many commuters agree with him. “The presence of traffic cops on the road goes a long way in curbing violations. In Hyderabad, there is a general notion that one can get away with any traffic violation by paying a fine. If stricter punishments are doled out, things will change. Consider the example of Bangalore, where traffic cops have strictly enforced the helmet rule even for pillion riders,“ said Anand Gummadi, a techie and resident of Chandanagar.
