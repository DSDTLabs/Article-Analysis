LUCKNOW: For a party that got decimated in UP assembly elections,   did well enough in Ambedkarnagar, credited as the caste laboratory of party founder  . 

 Of the five seats in the Dalit- and MBC-dominated district, BSP won three, the highest in any district. State party president Ram Achal Rajbhar won from Akbarpur, while Ritesh Pandey got elected from Jalalpur. Medical education minister in the previous   government Lalji Verma got elected from Katehari seat.
 
  BSP had won all five seats in 2007 but was wiped out from the district in 2012 when SP stormed to power. This time, SP lost all five seats, while Tanda and Alapur reserved seats were won by BJP. 
 
 Alapur held significance for Mayawati who had contested from here in 2002. The seat was then known as Jehangirganj. Following delimitation in 2007, BSP old-timer Tribhuwan Dutt contested for Alapur and won. Dutt, however, lost the seat in 2012 but Mayawati gave him a ticket again. This time, Dutt got third place.
 
 Political experts said BSP losing this seat again was an indication of BJP making inroads into the Dalit vote bank which has been siding with Mayawati since Kanshiram experimented with bringing the marginalised castes together.
 
 Tanda too continued to haunt the BSP which lost the seat once again, this time to BJP. 
 
 Party sources said Mayawati was particularly concerned about Ambedkarnagar, the district she carved out of Faizabad in 1995 when she became UP chief minister for the first time. 
 
 During one of her rallies in Ambedkarnagar, Mayawati got all five candidates paraded on the dais while asking party supporters to forgive them. " Agar in logon se koi ghalti ho gayi ho to inko maaf kar dena...aap inko nahi apni behenji ko vote doge... (Pardon them if they've committed a mistake...it will be for me)," Mayawati had said.
