BENGALURU: Reiterating that personal issues and poor health were the reasons behind IAS officer  's death, the   bureaucracy and the officer's seniors dismissed the allegations made by his family in their police complaint that Tewari was about to blow the lid off a scam in the food and civil supplies department, and that he was forced to sign some papers.

 "One of my close relatives was perfectly healthy and worked for a   till the age of 41 years. One day, he suddenly died of a massive heart attack. Things happen and you deal with it. You cannot go crying that there was work pressure and someone is making you do something against your will. It's not a tenable accusation," said a senior officer who knew Tewari.
 
 The officer said that IAS cadre personnel can approach the CM if someone is interfering in his work and forcing him to sign anything. “If nothing, he would have shared his predicament with his batchmates and colleagues. But nobody seems to be aware of any sort of work stress,“ the officer said.
 
 Contrary to the family's claims that Tewari was transferred six or seven times in his career, the IAS officers said he had only four postings since 2007, the shortest as deputy secretary in Karnataka finance department. The officers, however, admitted there was a situation once wherein a minister sought for Tewari's transfer following complaints against him by zilla panchayat members in Bidar. “He was transferred to the food and civil supplies department earlier this year,“ the officer added
