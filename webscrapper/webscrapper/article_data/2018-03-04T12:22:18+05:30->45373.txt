MEERUT: Prominent Samajwadi Party leader of west UP region,  , was on Thursday expelled from the party, three days after he attended RSS’s mega event held in the city. Singh, the former Meerut unit chief of the party, was expelled for anti-party activities by SP chief   Yadav.
 
  Singh’s presence in the RSS event did not go down well with the SP’s district unit, which reported the matter to state leaders.
  
  In a circular issued by state president Naresh Uttam, Singh was accused of “indiscipline and anti-party activities”. He has been expelled for six years.
  
  Sources close to TOI said that Singh’s presence in RSS event was the last nail in the coffin, as complaints against the SP leader were piling up.
  
  “He had been inactive for the past one year, and was trying to jump the ship. His attendance at the saffron event emboldened the speculations following which the action was taken,” a party insider told TOI. Singh, however, was not available for his comment.
  
  Singh, who was once considered close to party president Akhilesh Yadav, was twice given the reins of district unit. Singh has also served as the president of the district cooperative bank in Meerut during the previous regime.
  
  Meanwhile, party has also issued a show-cause notice to Mohammed Abbas for posing as party’s spokesperson on news channels without any authorization from brass.
  
  “You have been representing party’s stand at different forums, including TV channels without any authorization from the leadership. You are hereby requested to submit a written explanation on why disciplinary action should not be initiated against you,” party’s state president said in a letter.
