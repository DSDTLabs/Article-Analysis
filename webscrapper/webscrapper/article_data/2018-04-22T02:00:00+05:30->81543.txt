PATNA: At least 132 job offers have been made to students of Lalit Narayan Mishra Institute of Economic Development and Social Change-Patna in this year’s placement season so far. On-campus placements increased from 63% in 2016-17 to 82% in 2017-18 academic session. The placement season began in September 2017 and is expected to continue till June this year. This information was given by institute director N Vijayalakshmi at a press conference in Patna on Saturday. “Most of our students get placed during the on-campus recruitment drives... Those who don’t are the ones who choose not to risk waiting for the results and start looking beyond the campus placements,” she said.

She said an MBA student bagged the highest pay package of Rs 7.4 lakh/annum, offered by Hindustan Unilever. “Federal Bank has offered Rs 9 lakh to one student, but its confirmation letter is awaited,” Priti said. The other companies which offered jobs to the institute students this year include ICICI Prudential, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Concentrix, ITC, Indigo Airlines, HDFC Birla Sunlife, Big Bazaar and Flipkart. “This year 120 students from management stream appeared and 73 were placed during the recruitment drive,” she said.
