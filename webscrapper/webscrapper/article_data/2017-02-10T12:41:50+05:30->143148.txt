 Corporation of the City of Panaji’s ( ) controversy child, the market complex, continues to throw up problems for the civic body and this time around, it is an unpaid electricity bill of Rs 3 crore.
 
  The state electricity department on Wednesday threatened to disconnect power supply to the municipal market complex in   as CCP has failed to cough up Rs 3.12 crore since October 2015 for the power consumed. The electricity department has warned that power supply would be disconnected if dues were not paid within seven days. “It is very much regretted to inform that the energy bill pertaining to the Panaji municipal market has not been paid till date,” the disconnection notice says.
  
  CCP officials, however, have tried to wash their hands off the bill, pointing out that the bill is in the name of   (GSIDC). CCP officials say that   had applied for water and electricity connections for the municipal market complex and thus the bills continue to come in GSIDC’s name.
  
  “Who is liable for paying this bill? The bill is in the name of GSIDC, but the disconnection notice has been issued to CCP,” a file noting says.
  
  In 2015, the unpaid dues for the electricity bill amounted to Rs 1.5 crore even as CCP failed to recover revenue of Rs 2-3 crore from the commercial operations of the market complex.
  
  Built in 2004 by GSIDC, the market complex was handed over to CCP, but has since run into allegations of mismanagement and irregularities.
  
  The then market committee which included some elected corporators, fraudulently allotted shops to those who had not received any licences or lease agreements from CCP.
  
  CCP is struggling to sign fresh lease agreements and simultaneously evict encroachers and thus has shied away from paying the electricity bills, sources said.
  
  When asked whether CCP would pay the dues, the mayor said that a decision on the same will be taken in consultation later.
