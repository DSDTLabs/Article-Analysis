NAGPUR: For the third consecutive year, engineering and post-SSC polytechnic courses have seen huge vacancies in Nagpur region. After admissions for the first-year of both the courses closed, the final figures show more than 10,000 vacant seats in BE and polytechnic.

 While only 40% students were admitted for polytechnic, BE too registered just 55% admissions this year.
 
 The technical courses, which used to be the first preference for many a few years ago, found less takers despite the state common entrance test (CET) cell extending deadlines and even the number of institutes and seats going down.
 
 Nagpur region comprises six districts — Nagpur, Wardha, Bhandara, Gondia, Chandrapur, and Akola. Over 40,000 students from the region had appeared for the MH-CET, that is conducted by the directorate of technical education (DTE) through the cell, for admissions to engineering and pharmacy courses.
 
 The centralized admission process (CAP) was started on June 19 and concluded for all types of admissions on August 28. On July 22, the DTE had extended the deadline for those who failed to apply for the CAP. But, the move failed to yield the desired result as only 12,249 students were admitted while the sanctioned intake capacity was 22,266. Total 10,017 seats across the 56 engineering colleges went abegging, making up for 44.99% vacancy in the stream.
 
 The CAP round for admissions to polytechnic had started a bit late after the results for SSC were announced in June. Owing to poor registrations, the DTE was forced extend the last date and CAP round kicked off only in the second week of July. Like engineering, the extension didn’t attract more admissions as finally 8,023 students were admitted in 65 institutes of the region. Total 12,981 vacant seats make up for 61.80%.
 
 In 2015-16, 10,929 seats remained vacant followed by 10,838 the next academic year in engineering. Polytechnic saw 11,766 vacant seats in 2015-16 which rose to a whopping 15,217 seats in 2016-17. Last year, six colleges too were shut down bringing the figure to 65 from the earlier 71.
 
 Laxminarayan Institute of Technology (LIT) director Raju   tied the trend of poor admissions in engineering colleges to the employability factor of graduates. “Even after becoming an engineer, youths are not getting good paying jobs. At the same time, even IT companies are hiring talent from non-technical courses,” he said.
 
 Mankar added that so far government-run institutes are not facing any immediate problem of finding students. “People still have faith that campus recruitment won’t be any issue in government colleges,” he said.
 
 DTE officials blamed it to rising cost of education, lack of faculty and poor infrastructure in many colleges.
