CHENNAI: Passengers travelling from Chennai Egmore to   could soon see their travel time slashed by up to 33% following the completion of doubling along the stretch by Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd (RVNL), Indian Railways' engineering arm, on May 23 with the commissioning of the 20-km second line between   and Trichy. Trains on the   chy section can now touch a maximum speed of 100kmph and, with stoppages, the average speed can reach up to 75kmph, an official said. “Trains can complete the 334km journey in 4 hours,“ he said. Currently, trains take 5 to 7 hours to complete the journey . The popular overnight train   takes 6:30 hours, while   takes 6:30 hours, while Pandian Express takes 5:25 hours. A senior official in the railways' operations department confirmed that top-level officials are discussing proposals to reduce running time by at least 20 to 30 minutes immediately .“Changes in running time are usually made in a timetable revised in October. But because of the completion of doubling, we might revise it within a month,“ the official said.

 
 The drop in running time has been pos sible because line doubling has eliminated a number of stations at which trains have to wait as another train passes through.Some stretches only had a single line. An official in the Trichy division said the maximum section speed of 100kmph can be achieved gradually over a period of 3 to 4 months, according to directions of the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS).Due to added line capacity with the completion of doubling, officials now have the scope to increase the number of services by at least 50% to 100%, officials said.
