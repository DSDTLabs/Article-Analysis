NEW DELHI: Rising global   is a matter of concern, but it is still within the government’s comfort range, finance minister Arun   said on Thursday. “I think India has got out of the high-inflation era and an inflation target of 4%, plus or minus 2%, is a reasonable figure, and is achievable,” the FM said at a function where he defended his 2018-19 Budget proposals.

 He said the latest spurt in inflation was linked to the increase in prices of some vegetables, global crude oil prices and housing allowance provided to government employees. The recent spike in crude oil prices has triggered concern about its potential impact on inflation.
 
 The FM said he had provided relief to the middle class in his previous Budgets and would do so in future when the fiscal situation permits. Jaitley has faced criticism for not providing any significant tax relief to the middle class in his fifth budget presented to   on Thursday.
 
 “India has a serious challenge in terms of compliance. Another big challenge is in increasing the tax base. Therefore, if you analyse the sum total of the last four-five Budgets that I have presented, you will see that I have systematically given relief to the smaller taxpayers almost in every Budget,” the FM said.
 
 Replying to a question on consolidation in the staterun banking space, Jaitley said the government was committed to the process and would also carry forward its proposal to cut government stake in   below 50% as unveiled in the 2016-17 Budget. “I stand by both these announcements and they will happen at the appropriate time once the financial health of the banks strengthens,” he said.
 
 He said the mopping up of Rs 1 lakh crore from divestment in 2017-18 was significant and hoped to achieve this fiscal’s target. “The Rs 80,000 crore target for this year is fairly achievable,” he said.
