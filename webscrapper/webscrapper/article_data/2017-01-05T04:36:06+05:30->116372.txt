GURUGRAM: An unscheduled repair work carried out by the power department left the residents of sectors 3, 6 and 5 crippled on Wednesday as the power outage took place in the morning leaving office-goers and housewives in a foul mood.

 Residents alleged that power went out around 10am catching them unaware mid-work. Angered by the prolonged shutdown, the residents started calling the RWA. “I received several calls from angry residents who were furious about the outage,” said RWA president Dinesh Vashisht. 
 
 Vashisht alleged that the power officials often snap the supply without any prior information leaving residents in the lurch. “Many residents complained that they could not even take a bath before going to work as the geysers didn’t work,” he said. 
 
 The break down, officials said, was caused by the maintenance work at the Sector 4 power house. “We are doing the maintenance work at a transformer in the power house,” said  , junior engineer, DHBVN. Singh said that the transformer of 25/31.5 MVA at the power house needed repair. “It is through this transformer that supply lines serving these sectors emerge.” He added that electricity would be resumed by evening.
 
 “They told us that power would be back by 3pm but nothing has happened so far. Since morning, we have a list of chores to do for which electricity is mandatory. Children have to download winter work from computers. The power officials snap the supply arbitrarily without even issuing a prior notice,”  , a resident told TOI.
 
 The frequent power shutdown is a recurrent theme during winters as power discoms scale up the maintenance work.
