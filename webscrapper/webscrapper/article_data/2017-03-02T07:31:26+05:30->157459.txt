NEW DELHI: The defence ministry has ordered a CBI inquiry into the leak of question papers for the Army's recruitment examination for soldiers, which was detected by Thane police in Maharashtra on Sunday and led to the cancellation of the test for the entire Pune zone.

 “The Army recommended to defence minister Manohar Parrikar that a CBI investigation be conducted into the entire episode since it probably involves insiders as well as outsiders. The minister has approved it,“ said a ministry source.
 
 As earlier reported by TOI, Thane police detected the racket and arrested over 18 suspects in the case on Sunday.
 
 The Army has already ordered an internal Court of Inquiry (CoI), headed by a major-general, into the case.
