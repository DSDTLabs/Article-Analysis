CHENNAI:   has for the second time invited bids to outsource the work of collecting   of street vendors in the city, a move that is likely to peg back the enumeration of vendors by another 12 months, said officials.

 Without completing the enumeration, the corporation, through the yet-to-be-formed   (TVC), cannot allot designated pots for the city's over one lakh street vendors.
 
 “On the first occasion, we received bids from ineligible candidates. They had neither the biometric equipment nor the personnel to carry out the process of enumeration,“ said V Anbuselvan, corporation deputy commissioner (revenue and finance). The corporation has asked staff in all 15 zonal offices to be prepared to carry out enumeration. “There is no instruction regarding when, where and how to start,“ said a zonal officer.
 
 Street vending is disputed territory for the corporation, police, the courts as well as the residents. T Nagar, Purasaiwakkam, George Town and other densely populated neighbourhoods in the core city have over the years witnessed unrest between residents and street vendors, who occupy public space. The issue was expected to be resolved when the state notified the Street Vending Act, 2014 in Novem ber 2015, which called for the constitution of a TVC. It also had provisions to protect the welfare of vendors.
 
 Various associations of street vendors have criticised the corporation for its slow-paced approach to the issue. “The corporation has given an undertaking to the courts that the TVC has been formed, whereas the opposite is true. When we are evicted unlawfully , the courts direct us to go to the TVC. If this situation prevails, we (vendors) will be forced to take matters into our own hands,“ said B Karunanidhi, general secretary, Chennai Small Vendors Federation.
