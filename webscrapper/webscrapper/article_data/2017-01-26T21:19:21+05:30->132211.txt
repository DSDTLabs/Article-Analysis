NEW DELHI:   president   on Thursday said his party won't contest the 
  in alliance with the  , ANI reported.

  
 Thackeray explained that he isn't worried about the BMC elections, and that he's sure the Sena will win "all" the elections. As many as 25 years of the Sena's history were wasted because of alliances, he claimed. 
 
 While the Sena has "mawlas" (sainik) in its ranks, the BJP has "gundas," Thackeray said. 
 
 He claimed that the BJP had hired the "gundas" since it doesn't have the capacity to fight the Sena's sainiks. 
 
  
 BJP MP Kirit Somaiya responded within minutes, saying 
  on his party's side if "someone" is sad about its wish to make the BMC corruption-free. 
 
 
 Earlier today, prospects of a saffron alliance for the   between the BJP and the Sena appeared to have vanished. 
 
 A senior BJP leader said it was too late to salvage the talks. "Although the Sena would be ready to leave 90-95 seats for us, the dispute would then continue over the wards they wish to contest," he said.
 
 On Tuesday, Thackeray refrained from talking about his party's infructuous seat-sharing talks with the BJP, and simply said, "Let's be peaceful and watch the game."
 
 He said he would speak about "political issues" on January 26, and it appears he has kept his promise. 
 
 The BMC polls will be held on February 21, and results will be announced on the 23rd.
