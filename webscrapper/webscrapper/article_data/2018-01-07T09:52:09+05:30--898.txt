PUNE: To defuse tension and bitterness after the violence of January 1 over the Koregaon Bhima battle, Maratha & dalit outfits have joined hands to restore harmony within the communities, and defuse tension. 

 The first joint meeting of the communities after the incident was held in the city on Friday. The leaders decided to avoid tension in the two communities and work for their betterment.
 
 The leaders of both the communities are planning to hold a social harmony meet —   — in every district, starting from Pune. People will meet on a common platform to discuss various options to maintain peace.
 
 
  
  
 
 The leaders stressed the state had a legacy of Chatrapati Shahu Maharaj, B R Ambedkar, Mahatma Phule and Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. These leaders always thought beyond the caste and community. There was a need to keep away casteism in society, they said.
 
 Shantaram Kunjir, a leader of Maratha community, said a draft for the Samajik Salokha Parishad would be out in a few days. The first meet of the Samajik Salokha Parishad would be held in the next couple of weeks. “We want the government to punish all those who instigated unrest at Koregaon Bhima,” he said.
 
 Stressing that the Maratha outfit never supported violence, he said the community was looking for employment opportunities for youths and people’s uplift.
 
 Pravin Gaikwad, another leader of the Maratha community, said violence was not an answer to any debate. “The society needs to come out of casteism. People from both the communities should support the idea of saying no to casteism,” he said.
 
 Siddharth Dhende, the deputy mayor and the leader of RPI, said the incidents like Koregaon Bhima would not happen is people have better opportunity for education and employment.
 
 The Samajik Salokha Parishad would make efforts to bridge the gap between the two communities, the RPI leader added.
