CHENNAI: Residents and   are a worried lot. Even walking in the already congested area will be difficult as a few cement   in the area, dug up by   to replace old/defunct pipelines, may have been cut up beyond repair, they fear. 

 Unlike tar roads, concrete roads are not just tougher to break open, but also harder to carry out any patchwork. In ward 60 of George Town, Metrowater sought permission from Greater Chennai Corporation for cutting up six roads, including Sembudoss Street and  . 
 
 Officials at the corporation office in the zone have promised to rope in a contractor, once the pipeline work is complete, to fill up the dug-up portions using the same high grade concrete, in this case M30. "If the road cut was in the middle of the road it may have been difficult," said a corporation engineer. "Since only the side of the road has been dug up, we can level it properly." Metrowater will pay for the damages. 
 
 In 2014, corporation identified 1,063 interior bitumen roads and transformed them into white topped stretches at an estimated 172 crore. Residents in the neighbourhoods concerned were assured that the new roads would be stronger than tar roads and wouldn't require to be relaid for at least 30 years.
 
 People in the area aren't convinced. Prasmod M, a businessman who commutes to   everyday, said some of the dug-up portions had been temporarily covered with mud which is unsafe. "Given how patchwork is carried out on our roads, we know repairs will be shoddy," said Pramod.
 
 Urban planners say any cut made can inflict almost permanent damage. "Concrete roads need to be built only when all utility lines have been shifted to the property edge," said Advait Jani, Chennai programme coordinator for the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy.
