Ahmedabad: An official of the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has registered a complaint with Navrangpura police against a Navrangpura-based firm for deducting a total of Rs 47.06 lakh from salaries of employees towards EPF, but not depositing it with EPFO.

 According to Navrangpura police, Vigi Mohan, enforcement officer with EPFO’s regional office near Income Tax crossroads, an employee of Macquire HR Solution, located at Ganesh Plaza, Navrangpura, had given an application to EPFO in December 2017 about getting her PF from the firm after leaving it. 
 
 She mentioned in her complaint that the firm officials refused to sign her letter for withdrawal. She later came to know that the firm had not deposited the PF amount.
 
 “The complaint names Nityarajan Sarkar, a resident of Vadodara, and Anidhya Sarkar, a resident of Chandkheda, as proprietors. The firm was registered with EPFO in 2010. In an inquiry conducted by EPFO, it was revealed that the firm had not deposited Rs 47.06 lakh from January 2015 to January 2018. Mohan mentioned in her complaint that the firm was given written instructions to deposit the money, but it has not complied so far,” said an official.
 
 Investigators said that they are yet to record statements of the accused in the case.
