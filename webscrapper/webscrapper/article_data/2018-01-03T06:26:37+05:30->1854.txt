LUDHIANA: Rail traffic remained disrupted on Tuesday as more than 30 trains were seen running late by several hours to reach the city railway station. The trains that were delayed by maximum hours were the ones running at night. The fact of the matter is that these trains were grappled with zero-visibility issues on the back of dense fog that had enveloped the region.

 Railway officials stated that the situation became worse on Tuesday due to dense fog and all trains running on long routes – Mumbai, Kolkata,   – were delayed by over 10 hours.
 
 “Pooja Express (12412) Ajmer to Jammu was delayed by 13 hours and 20 minutes. Amrapali Express (15707) from Katihar to Amritsar reached 12 hours after its arrival time. Amritsar Howrah express (13050) from Howrah to Amritsar was late by 11 hours and 20 minutes. Tata Muri Express (18101) from Tata Nagar to Jammu Tawi reached after 10 hours and 45 minutes,” the railway officials said.
 
 “Even a premium train like Shatabdi Express (12014) running between New Delhi and Amritsar was delayed by over 8 hours,” the officials added.
 
 Other trains that were late by 7 to 8 hours were Darbhanga–Amritsar Jan Nayak Express (15211); Amritsar–Howrah Mail (13006); Kolkata–Jammu Tawi Express (13151); and Ferozepur–Delhi Sarai Rohilla Intercity Express (14626) and Amritsar Jaynagar Saryu Yamuna Express (14650) were delayed by 7 to 8 hours.
 
 
 
 
 Meanwhile, the passengers who had to travel on long route trains were seen irked as their trains were running way behind the schedule.
 
 Rakesh Kumar, a passenger who had to go to Kolkata in Howrah Mail said that the Centre kickstarted the bullet train project in the county without acknowledging the ground reality. “They should adopt some modern mechanism to tackle the issue of train delays as passenger have to suffer a lot while waiting out in the open in these weather conditions,” he added.
