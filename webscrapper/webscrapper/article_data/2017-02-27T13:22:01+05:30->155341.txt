The 89th Academy Awards host   didn’t waste any opportunity to take a jibe at the US   Donald  . In his opening monologue, Kimmel joked, “This broadcast is being watched live by millions of Americans and around the world in more than 225 countries that now hate us.” On a serious note, he added, “There are millions and millions of people watching right now, and if every one of you took a minute to reach out to one person you disagree with and have a positive, considerate conversation – not as liberals or conservatives but as Americans – if we all did that it would make   great again.”

 
 
 Kimmel’s references to the US President continued right through the awards ceremony. The host referenced the President’s obsession with “fake news” and even mentioned how there will be certain speeches that Trump “will tweet about in all caps during his 5am bowel movement”.
  
 The high point of the evening came when Kimmel sent a tweet out to Trump that read, “Hey @realDonaldTrump u up?”
