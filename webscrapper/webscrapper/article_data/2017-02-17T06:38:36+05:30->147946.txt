AHMEDABAD: Around 2,500 farmers from 15 villages near Sanand took out a rally from   on Tuesday morning, demanding a fair share of Narmada water for drinking and irrigation.

 The procession’s destination was Gandhinagar but when it arrived near  , Ahmedabad rural police stopped it and asked the agitators to disband as they had no permission for the rally. This led to heated arguments between the police and the farmer leaders. At around 12:30 pm, protesters began throwing stones at the police.
 
 Ahmedabad (rural) SP   was injured when a stone hit him on the head. He had to be given five stitches. Four other police personnel sustained similar injuries. 
 
 Soon after, police resorted to lathi-charge to disperse the crowd. 
 
 Protesters alleged stone-pelting by the police as well. 
 
 Asari told TOI that the police had tried to reason with the leaders of the agitation but they were adamant on marching towards Gandhinagar. “We had to use force to bring the situation under control. We had videographers with us and the footage will be used to identify the rioters,” he said. tnn
