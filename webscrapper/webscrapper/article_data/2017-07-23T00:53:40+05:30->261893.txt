MUMBAI : Even as the authorities are cracking down on drones, a public interest litigation has urged the Bombay high court to direct the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA)to issue   for their safe flight. 

 Filed by Eshan Saha, the   points out key lapses in the DGCA’s April 2016 draft circular for registration and operation of drones and suggests compulsory safety measures. It says drones should be equipped with parachutes to prevent crashes and have sensors and systems in place to avoid mid-air collisions with birds, trees and building and recognize visual or other signals of interception. “It should be able to identify and avoid terrain as well as severe weather and wind conditions. It should also be able to avoid collision with other aircraft in flight,” the petition states.
 
 It also says drones must be classified according to flight capability rather than weight and subjected to regular statutory checks. Besides, its entire flight path should be monitored and not limited to 500 meters visual line. “In a city like Mumbai where there are high rises, a visual range for the operation of unmanned aerial vehicles is inconsequential,” it adds.
 
 Last week, the matter was mentioned by Saha’s advocate   and it will be heard on July 28.
