HYDERABAD: Film   India will shut from March 2 as talks with digital projection service providers to reduce charges failed on Friday. No films will be released across 5,000 theatres in Telangana,  ,  ,  , a   state film chamber of commerce (TSFCC) official said. 

 Producers, distributors and exhibitors held a meeting with digital providers in Hyderabad a few weeks ago and discussed the issue. Subsequently, another meeting was held in Chennai and on Friday, it was decided to resolve the issue and a meeting was again held in Bengaluru. 
 
  
 Producer D Suresh Babu who headed the committee of the film industry and held discussions with the representatives of the digital providers in Bengaluru informed other committee members that the talks had failed. 
 
 "This means that there will no release of films in South India from March 2," the former president of TSFCC said. He said some theatres will enforce the bandh from March 1 itself. 
 
 There are several demands of the digital service providers. It is learnt that they charge 13,000 per week for the satellite projection of films from each theatre. The film industry demand is that there should be no charges at all as they had been charging these amount for the last seven years.
