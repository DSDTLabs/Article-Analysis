LUCKNOW:   has just taken his spot in the room and started to perform a yoga asana with the agility of a gymnast. It's no wonder because the 21-year-old has represented India as a swimmer in the Special Olympics Asia Pacific in Australia in 2013, winning a silver. A gold in the national championships had come in the same year. 

 On his birthday in January, he was made the station officer of a police station-a long cherished wish-and is now training to be an assistant teacher in sports at a school for special children.
 
 His achievements are undoubtedly grand for a regular 21-year-old but Saahil is even more special. He has a genetic chromosomal dysfunction called Down Syndrome but is never pulled back by it.
 
 In between colouring flowers on a paper bag and teaching yoga asanas to other specially abled children, Saahil said, "Mai kuch banna chahta hoon (I want to become somebody). I want to be a singer." 
 
 He continued, "I will take my XII standard exam in April and then my yoga exam." 
 
 Spending their time at Dosti-a school for the specially abled-children like Saahil have become role models for their peers with special needs. 
 
 Rishi Agarwal, 14, does not have clear speech but it is computers and technology that the young boy finds his calling in. 
 
 "He works on the system effortlessly. He is helping out his father in his business. He works on MS Excel and waits to be paid every month for it," said his mother Bhawna, who is also a special educator at the school. 
 
 Class VI student   and class V student  , who were in this class, have added a feather to their caps. Both have been integrated into mainstream education and study with other children.
 
 For their parents, it is society's role towards them that is of utmost importance. 
 
 "Society needs to be aware towards such children, deal with them patiently, let them be free and receive unconditional love from them in return," said  , principal of Dosti.
