On Tuesday, at around 3 pm, a fire broke out outside the sets of   TV’s show   at Katharsis Studio, Powai. The fire spread to the set and the cast and crew who were preparing to shoot had to be evacuated immediately.
 
   , the lead actor, told Mirror, “During a break we were informed about the fire which was inching towards us. We immediately alerted the fire brigade and ambulance. There was a lot of chaos as there was only one way out and the fire had reached the exit. The set is in the middle of a forest and the dry leaves fuelled the flames. Fortunately, they did not ignite the gas cylinders.”
  
  
 
  
  Luckily there were no casualties but shooting came to a standstill for over three hours and only resumed after the fire brigade and electricity department declared the premises safe.
