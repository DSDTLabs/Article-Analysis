KOLKATA: The   investigating a shooting on a moneylender, Gopal Shaw (52), on Friday arrested his son, Bikash (26), who allegedly hired supari killers to bump off his father so that he could grab his properties. One of the supari killers, a Class XII student,   (18), who took Rs 500 and fired at Gopal twice, and Bikash's friend Amit Singh alias Banti, who was part of the plotting, were also arrested. 

 Gopal is now at a hospital off EM Bypass. "We suspect the accused plotted the crime after his father refused to pay money," said Rajesh Singh, police commissioner, Barrackpore. 
 
 Gopal, also a state transport driver, was riding a bike to a Barrackpore SBSTC depot on March 18 morning, when he was shot at near his home at Sadarbazar. A witness said two bike-borne persons, their faces hidden behind helmets, opened fire at Gopal from behind. "Even after being struck in the back, Gopal still tried to ride away and the assailants chased him. They again shot at him, but missed," a trader said. 
 
 Police said Bikash later lodged an attempt to murder complaint at the Titagarh police station. "But his statements had inconsistencies. Him being a late-riser, he never stepped out early, but on that day, he went out before his father left," an officer said. Bikash confessed to the crime to the Barrackpore detective wing on Thursday. 
 
 Police said Bikash took loans of several lakhs from traders. "He asked his father for money but was refused, following which he plotted the murder," the officer said. Bikash gave a contract of Rs 60,000 to a Barrackpore-Titagarh goon,  , who engaged Ankit. "Bikash paid Ansari Rs 20,000 as an advance and Ankit Rs 500," the officer said.
