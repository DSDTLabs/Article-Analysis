BAGHA: The level crossing on Narkatiaganj-Gorakhpur rail section in Bagaha, which is virtually the only way to enter the town, is faced with frequent snarls in the absence of the much-needed   (ROB).

 The level crossing, which falls under   division of East Central railway (ECR), is located in densely populated area and is merely 12 feet wide with no footpath. Long queues of vehicles, including overloaded trucks, trailers with sugarcane and passenger buses, hardly leave space on the road for the pedestrians, when the gates of level crossing is closed on the arrival of trains.
 
 The situation worsened following deep trenches dug by BSNL on both sides of the level crossing last month. Bagaha station rail superintendent Jai Kumar Srivastava said reminders have been served to BSNL to fill up the trenches, but to no avail.
 
 NH-28 (B) also passes through this railway level crossing, but the district administration or the railways do not appear inclined to divert the heavy traffic from the area.
 
 Locals, including president of Bagaha Bar Association Indu Bhusan Pandey, Bagaha Nagar Parishad ward councillor Sandesh Pandey and convenor of Indo-Nepal Border Friendship at Valmikinagar Pramod   have blamed Bagaha MLA R S Pandey and Valmikinagar MP Satish Chand Dubey – both from   – for the situation.
