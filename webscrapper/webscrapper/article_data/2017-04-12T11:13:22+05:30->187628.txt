PUNE: The   (PMPML) will impose a fine of Rs 5,000 from April 16 on   that breakdown for as long as an hour. 

 "The maximum number of bus accidents and breakdowns involve buses run by private contractors. Buses run by private operators record around 130 to 140 breakdowns each day. As far as the PMPML-run buses are concerned, the number is anything between 120 and 130," said a senior official.
 
 In case a PMPML-run bus breaks down, an inquiry is ordered against the driver and he can be suspended or dismissed at times. "The private contractors don't pay their drivers well so they leave the job and get replaced by new faces who don't know the city or  . They have been told many a times to mend their ways but all requests have fallen on deaf ears," the senior   official said.
 
 The PMPML, at present, operates 1,200 buses, while 853 buses are managed by the contractors.
 
 "Earlier the fines were around Rs 500. We are also thinking about having a rule whereby drivers involved in accidents or breakdowns cannot be hired by any contractor for operating public buses. Violation of the rule will lead to cancelation of his agreement with PMPML," another official pointed out.
