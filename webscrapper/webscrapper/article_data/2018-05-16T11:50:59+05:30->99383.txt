LUDHIANA: A day after two brothers were reported to have fled from the central jail here, police started a long, intensive search operation on the premises of the high-security prison on Tuesday, saying that there was a possibility that the duo were hiding inside.

 Search teams also looked in gutters under the prison to check if the two brothers, Jasvir Singh and Harvinder Singh of Rattan Paloon village of Fatehgarh Sahib, were hiding there or if they had escaped using them. Earlier in the day, inspector general (prisons) R K Arora, deputy inspector general (prisons) Lakhveer Singh Jakhar and a team of Ludhiana police reached the jail and started investigations.
 
 Police teams also scanned   cameras installed in the jail and saw the two inmates moving around the jail in them till 8.35pm of Sunday. The jail authorities had come to know of the two men missing on Monday afternoon, during a headcount of the inmates.
 
 The duo is facing trial for allegedly stealing 120g gold from a locker of Andhra Bank’s Rasulra village branch in Khanna on February 23 this year. Even as they carried out investigations and searches for the second straight day, police and prison officials continued to be clueless. By the evening, the police released photographs of the two brothers.
 
 So far, it has been suspected that they escaped after scaling the compound wall near the jail’s visitor room.
 
 Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP-IV) Rajveer Sing   said their teams had tracked the entire route of gutters connected with the prison. “Our teams have also searched areas where the gutters discharge waste,” Boparai said.
 
 The ADCP said the accused were also seen around the main gate at 7.30pm on Sunday and later inside the jail at 8.35pm. The case in connection with the jailbreak has been registered at Division VII police station.
