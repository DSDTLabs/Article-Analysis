AMARAVATI: While ‘gau raksha’ has been a point of hot debate for quite some time now, the story of millions of milk producing animals, who are subjected to cruelty every day in   across the country, is going unheard. 

 In an investigation carried out by Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations (FIAPO), a premier agency fighting for animal rights, it has found that animals live up to only 40% of their actual lifespan because of mismanagement in dairies. While a cow could happily live up to 25 years, its lifespan is reduced to a mere 10 years once it is chained, and milked in the dairy. These animals are losing almost 60% of their lifespan only because of the cruel practices adopted in dairies.
 
 The abuse of dairy animals in Andhra Pradesh, one of the leading milk producing states in the country, is high. AP is known for poor care and  , as investigation revealed that animals are tethered all the time in 79% of dairies here. 
 
 Animals are milked even when they are unwell. Animal care activist  , said: “It is outrageous to keep animals chained all through the day. Milking them when they are unwell is inhuman.” According to FIAPO studies, almost all male calves are sent for slaughter before 3 months of age.
