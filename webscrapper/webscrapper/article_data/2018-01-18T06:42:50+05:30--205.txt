CHANDIGARH: Panchkula DJ Varnika Kundu’s legal team on Wednesday opposed a bail application filed by the second accused in high-profile stalking case,   resident   Kumar, saying that he had lied to the court that he had no criminal history.

 Kundu’s lawyer, Manu Kakkar, argued that Kumar was already facing an abetment to suicide case in Hisar. His submission said Kumar “failed to consider humanity, respect to (a) woman and acted like a beast in lust” on the night he allegedly stalked   along with BJP   president Subhash Barala’s son Vikas. 
 
 The prosecution’s submission described Kumar’s behavior on that night as that of a roadside romeo. He submitted that the abetment to suicide case dated to June 2017, wherein Kumar and three others had been accused of harassing the deceased, and borrowing up to Rs 14.85 lakh from him and not returning it. The deceased had lent the accused huge amounts of money including Rs 14.85 lac to Kumar. 
 
 Kakkar informed the court that the deceased consumed poison and left behind a suicide note, blaming the four accused and told his father about the same. 
 
 The arguments over the bail application will be held on Thursday and the order is also expected on the same day. Vikas has already been granted bail by the Punjab and Haryana high court.
 
 
 
 
 Kakkar said Kumar concealed material facts and tried to mislead the investigation. “He has been denied bail twice by court, but his bail application mentions that it has been turned down only once,” said the lawyer.
 
 The defence counsel argued that   had already been released on bail, so keeping Kumar in custody served no purpose. The bail application also stated that the cross-examination of Varnika was over and she failed to mention kidnapping in her initial complaint. Kumar and Vikas were arrested on September 5 night, after they alleged stalked Kundu and tried to kidnap her.
