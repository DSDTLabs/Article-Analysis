BHUBANESWAR: Experts from different countries attending a five-day workshop organised at   on Monday expressed concern over trafficking of women for sexual exploitation. They appealed to the government, non-government organizations, business houses and people from all walks of life to come together and create zero tolerance to sexual assault of girls. 

 The workshop, beginning Monday, is being organised by   (KISS) in association with BRIDGE, an international consultancy agency, and other NGOs to draw up a set of strategies that will prevent and redress sexual assault on girls in India.
 
 Simon Mckenzie, managing director ( ) of BRIDGE, said trafficking is one of the reasons behind sexual exploitation. Poverty sometimes forces girls to work outside to earn a livelihood. The traffickers first promise the girls good job, but later they force them into sex trade or exploit them sexually, he added. 
 
 Sean Kelly from   said trafficking cases are increasing across the world. "We have to curb this problem in order to bring down the cases of sexual exploitation of girls. All stakeholders have to work united in this field," he added. 
 
 He said the stakeholders have to create awareness among the people not to fall prey to the traffickers. "We have to be very empathetic towards the victims and offer them support to come out of the trauma," said Kelly. 
 
 On this occasion,   was launched by BRIDGE in association with NGOs like FXB India, Ashoka Foundation and Dasra. The KISS will provide the fellowship. Main objective of the fellowship is to bring together key stakeholders to facilitate a breakthrough in thinking and strategise how to prevent sexual assault on girls in Odisha.
