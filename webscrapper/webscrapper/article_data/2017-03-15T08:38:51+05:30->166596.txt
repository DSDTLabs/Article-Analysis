NEW DELHI: The   brought forward on Tuesday the floor test for the BJP-led coalition government headed by chief minister   in Goa to Thursday but 
  , while also rejecting the Congress’s plea for a composite floor test. Parrikar and his nine-member cabinet were sworn in on Tuesday evening.

 The SC, while hearing 
  Mridula Sinha’s invitation to  , reduced the 15-day time given to Parrikar to prove his majority.
 
  
  
 
 However, it did not accept the Congress’s plea to stay the swearing-in, saying the party had not effectively challenged BJP’s claim of numbers and the court could not play the role of governor. 
 
 BJP, with 13 MLAs, succeeded in reaching the majority mark in the 40-member assembly with the support of eight other MLAs.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 In the poll result announced on Saturday, the Congress finished with 17 MLAs.
 
 The court also said that Congress’s Goa unit had challenged the non-invitation to the single largest party to form government yet it did not dispute, either before the governor or the SC, the claim of the Parrikar-led BJP that it had the support of 21 MLAs.
 
 Except for advancing the floor test, a bench of Chief Justice   and Justices Ranjan Gogoi and R K Agrawal rejected all other pleas of Congress legislature party leader Chandrakant Kavlekar who had also sought a stay on Parrikar’s oath.
 
 The SC ordered all other processes — issuance of notification by the EC constituting the assembly, appointment of pro tem speaker and oath-taking by 40 MLAs — to be completed by Wednesday. “The only agenda before the House on March 16 will be the floor test,” the SC said before disposing of Kavlekar's petition. “During the course of the hearing, we were satisfied that the instant sensitive and contentious issue raised on behalf of the petitioner can be resolved by a simple direction, requiring the holding of a floor test at the earliest,” the SC said.
