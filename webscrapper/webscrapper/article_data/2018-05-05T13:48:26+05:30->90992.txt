MADURAI: Former judge of the Madras high court, D Hariparanthaman, has said that only students can cleanse the higher education system in Tamil Nadu of its corruption and other vices. They should be empowered politically through the formation of students’ associations, he said at the meeting organised by the ‘Save MKU’ movement in Madurai on Friday .

 Hariparanthaman said that the action of the four female students of the   in   in exposing the sex scandal was commendable and that they should be seen as the beacons for cleansing the system of all its corruption.
 
 Stating that the higher officials indicated in scandal could even be the governor of Tamil Nadu or the vice chancellor of Madurai Kamaraj University, P   himself, he said that the governor’s move to constitute a commission was against the rules as no man could be a judge to his own cause. The meeting resolved that   vice chancellor P P Chelladurai should be suspended till the scandal involving the university faculty is concluded. The former judge also said that the outcome of the commission’s probe was questionable.
 
 He said that empowering students in all spheres including political at the institutional level by forming powerful students’ associations as has been done in the past, was the only solution for ridding the system of all its vices. 
 
 The speakers at the meeting, including professor A Seenivasan, P Vijayakumar and R Murali said that the CB-CID enquiry into the Nirmala Devi scandal should continue under the direct supervision of the court.
