 wrote, directed and acted in the lead role in   (OMK), a comedy-drama about a prematurely bald 28-year-old man. But like most new filmmakers he found it difficult to take the film further. That's when   (of   and   fame) stepped in. He joined   as the producer. From being an obscure entity till a few weeks ago, OMK is now one of the most anticipated films in   this year. The film will have its world premier at the New York Indian Film Festival on May 6. This will be followed by special screenings in major US cities for a week. It will then travel to the London Indian Film Festival. Pawan's U Turn too had its premier at the NYIFF.

 Speaking to Mirror about how he came to be part of the film Pawan said, “The movie came to me after it had been shot. It was a good attempt and I wanted to take it forward. It is a sensitive subject told in an entertaining manner. With the arrival of social media, we are addicted to photographs. How we look becomes very important. In this scenario how does the society judge a bald person? The film has a Chaplinesque feel to it and strong emotions. It is the kind of films I want to make. So I wanted to be a part of it.“
 
 Ahead of its world premier, the audio launch of the film is scheduled for May 2.
