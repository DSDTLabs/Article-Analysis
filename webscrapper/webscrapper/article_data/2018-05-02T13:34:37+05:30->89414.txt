 is delighted to be a part of   Mukherji’s ‘Uma’. We all know the reason; it’s a special project for him because his daughter   is set to make her debut in it. He still remembers the day when director Srijit approached him and wife   to allow their daughter to work in his film.

 Srijit apparently came to Jisshu’s home around midnight and said he wants Sara to play the lead in his upcoming film. Initially, Jisshu and Nilanjana rejected the offer straight away. But then Sara supposedly woke up from her sleep and came to Srijit asking what he was doing at that time and the director, who is close to the Sengupta family. smiled and said that it would be a waste of time to ask the parents. Jisshu also reportedly revealed that Srijit then asked Sara to decide whether she wants to work in ‘Uma’ and we all know what happened next.
 
 Meanwhile, the recently released trailer of ‘Uma’ has been getting an overwhelming response from the audience. The film is set to release on June 1.
