NEW DELHI: The capital on Sunday saw thousands of volunteers working hand in hand with the   staff of the three corporations to rid the city of its accumulated garbage. The state   organised the massive sanitation drive along with a social organisation, Dera Sachha Sauda. Early in the morning, volunteers gathered at India Gate circle, where the campaign was launched in the presence of Union minister V K Singh and Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari, who all wielded the broom. 

 The move was supported by the three corporations and NDMC which not only provided their machinery and equipment but also roped in the sanitation staff. Each of the 12 zones falling under the corporations received thousands of volunteers who swept the roads, removed posters/banners and cleared the drains. Thousands of people - young and old - were busy cleaning the city. The NDMC areas received 3,000 volunteers, Civil Lines had 6,000, Narela zone had 4,000, Karol Bagh had 2,000, Rohini had 2,500, while   had 1,500 among others. 
 
  
 Sushil Kumar of Dera Saccha Sauda from Hisar, Haryana who led 50 volunteers of Dera group assembled at Gate No 4, Palika Bazar at  , said, "We feel ashamed when foreigners call our country dirty and we are here to wash away that dirty tag. Just yesterday, all of us were doing the same in Karnal."
 
 Soon after the municipal election results, Tiwari had announced that the priority was to make Delhi garbage-free. "Our aim is to engage maximum social groups and individuals with the 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan'. Once the streets and markets are cleaned, the civic bodies will have to ensure its upkeep," he said.
