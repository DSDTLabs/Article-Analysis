Known for their prowess in Indian Classical music, Ambi and Bindu Subramaniam recently collaborated with Carnatic   fusion artiste Mahesh Raghvan to launch the Indian adaptation of Coldplay’s Something Just Like This. Speaking to us about the collaboration, Ambi says, “It is an exciting thing for us to work on something like this and it’s first time as well. We are quite happy with the end result,” says Ambi adding that while they tried to do something different, they wanted to maintain their individuality through the  .

 “Both Bindu and I are used to performing our own songs. Collaborating with an artiste like Mahesh is a first for us. So, when we are doing a song like this, the most important thing is to get your own individuality out. We’ve Indianized the song a bit but didn’t want to overdo it, ” says Ambi. The video, released on Tuesday, was shot in Bengaluru and features Ambi, Bindu and Mahesh. Prod him further about Mahesh and Ambi says, “Working with Mahesh was fun. He is good at what he does and brought different things to the table.”
 
 Mahesh, on the other hand, who is known for his works in Indian Classical fusion in contemporary ways, says that through this collaboration, the trio wanted to give the popular number an Indian twist. “We wanted to give it our own flavor and twist to the song. Both Ambi and I follow each other’s work and after months of discussion and talks, we have the final product,” says Mahesh. Did he face any challenges while working on the video? “The only challenge I faced was the distance. Both of us are busy and had to use a lot of technology, given he’s in Bengaluru and I in Dubai. It would have been a lot easier if we were in the same place,” he adds.
 
 On the work front, Ambi says that there may be more such collaborations in the future. “We’ve thoroughly enjoyed working on this video. I hope and would love to collaborate with other artistes and Mahesh too in the future,” he signs off.
