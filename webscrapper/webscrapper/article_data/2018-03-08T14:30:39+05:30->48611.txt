PATNA: The second and third shifts of the   (SSC)’s combined higher secondary level (CHSL) Tier-I online examinations-2017 could not be held at one of the examination centres in Patna on Wednesday due to protests over alleged favours to a candidate by invigilators.

 The plus-two level examination is held for recruitments in ministries and departments of the central government.
 
 The controversy erupted soon after a girl examinee asked for several rough sheets from the invigilators at the RS Digital (an educational testing service) examination centre on   in Kankerbagh. The protesting candidates alleged the rough sheets had the correct answers of the questions scribbled on them, and demanded re-examination.
 
  said the candidate’s handwriting didn’t match with the answers written in her rough sheets. “Obviously, the question paper was leaked and solved by experts for the girl before the exam began,” he alleged.
 
 Even as the protests were on, police were called in. Kankerbagh police station SHO Ravi Bhushan told this reporter that the protesters did not allow the the second shift of the exam to begin at 1.30 and dispersed after a few hours. “No complaint was lodged with police in this connection,” he said.
 
 RS Digital director   denied that any candidate was helped.
 
 Later in the evening, a notice was issued by the office of assistant director of the central region of SSC. It said, The CHSL (10+2) examination, 2017 Tier-I scheduled on March 7, second shift from 1.30pm to 2.30pm and third shift from 4.30pm to 5.30pm at RS Digital is hereby cancelled due to unavoidable reasons.”
