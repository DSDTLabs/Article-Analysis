NOIDA: The chief medical superintendent ( ) of the district hospital in Sector 30 says he received a phone call, on Monday, questioning the eviction of   from the hospital. 

 The caller also allegedly told the CMS, “Dogs roam around in the compound of other hospitals too”.
 
 CMS Ajay Agrawal, who had ordered the eviction of stray dogs from the district hospital premises for the purpose of safety of patients recently, told TOI he had noticed that a number of dogs had been roaming the district hospital premises for quite some time. “A few days back, I instructed the guards that the dogs should not be allowed inside the hospital premises and strictly told them that if any of these animals are found inside the premises, action will be taken against the guard on duty,” he said.
 
 “However, around 11.30 am on Monday, I received a call from a landline number and the person on the other side said he was speaking from the office of minister Maneka Gandhi. He said they had received an email complaint against the eviction of dogs from the hospital compound,” he added.
 
 The CMS said during the phone conversation, he told the official on call the decision was taken keeping in mind safety of patients, their attendants and hospital staff. “I was told that dogs roam around in the compound of other hospitals too. I then informed the caller that dogs cannot be allowed to roam around in hospitals just like in the case of corporate hospitals where street dogs are not seen at all,” he said.
 
 An official from the residence of the minister confirmed that the number belonged to Gandhi’s residence, and that they receive a number of such complaints daily. However, the official did not confirm if this particular call had been made. “I will have to check about his particular complaint,” said the official.
 
 Sticking to his decision, meanwhile, the CMS has asked the hospital security guards to keep a strict vigil on the entry of dogs in the hospital.
