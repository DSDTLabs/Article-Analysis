DUMKA: Even as the district administration was busy giving finishing touches to the preparation of the shrawani mela - which will begin on July 9 - for the pilgrims arriving in   temple, the dilapidated condition of the 35km stretch between Hasdiha and Nonihaat along the   road is likely to prove a stumbling block. 

 Apart from the traditional route most kanwarias take between Sultanganj (Bihar) and Deoghar, a section of the pilgrims arrive in Basukinath temple on foot from Barari (Bhagalpur), covering almost a distance of 100 kilometre.
 
 This time, however, pilgrims who prefer to arrive in Basukinath from Bhagalpur (Bihar) may have to suffer due to frequent traffic bottlenecks in the stretch of road between Hasdiha and Nonihaat due to the ongoing road construction work. "Several passenger and goods transport vehicles remained stranded for over eight hours after a truck was trapped in the mud on a diversion near Hasdiha owing to incessant rain,"  , a resident of Nonihaat, said.
 
 Godda BJP MP   said he will apprise the district administration on the quality of the construction work and ask it to ensure smooth passage of vehicles along the pilgrimage route between Bhagalpur and Basikunath.
