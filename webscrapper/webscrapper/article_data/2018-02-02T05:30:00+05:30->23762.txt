Mysuru: Exhorting Mysuru city   workers to strengthen the organisation at the booth level, the party’s Karnataka general secretary   reminded them of the party’s feat in the 1994 assembly elections, when the BJP had won all three assembly segments in the city, and called on them to emulate it in the 2018 elections.

 Expressing his appreciation towards the party workers for their efforts in making the Parivarthana Yatra a big success, Ravi added, “Now, we have a bigger responsibility to wrest in all three constituencies in the city – Narasimharaja, Krishnaraja and Chamaraja – from the Congress.”
 
 Ravi, who inaugurated the executive committee meet of the BJP in the city, said, “We have to show our strength again. In 1994, Shankarlinge Gowda, SA Ramdas and Maruthi Rao Pawar won the elections by strengthening the party at the booth-level, and because of our  . We will have to repeat the feat in this election.”
 
 Dubbing the upcoming elections an ‘ideological war’, Ravi exhorted the workers to fight with determination. Ravi also touched upon the Nav Bharat Sankalp vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
 
 Lambasting the Congress government in the state, which has proposed to drop names of those accused of communal riots belonging to certain communities, Ravi said, “Schemes were earlier designed along caste lines, and they are now being withdrawn along the same ones. We have to first understand corruption in various schemes.”
 
 BJP leaders Ramdas, HV Rajeev and city BJP president BH Manjunath were also present at the executive committee meeting.
