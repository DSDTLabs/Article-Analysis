HYDERABAD: Five persons, including four members of a mason's family , were killed in a road accident on the   highway on Thursday night. The deceased were identified as Somanna (65), his wife Narsamma (60), Somanna's sister-in-law   (55), of Gudur village in Kurnool district and Somanna's son Somesh (36) of Serilingampally and car driver Mallesh( 33) of Chevella.According to the police, a few days ago, Somanna, his wife Narsamma and Giddamma came to visit Somesh.“While they were at Somesh's house in Serilingampally , he suffered a leg fracture after he slipped and fell in the bathroom. As medical treatment in Hyderabad is a costly affair, the family wanted to take Somanna to a herbal clinic in Kurnool district and rented a car,“ Kothur SI A Srisailam told TOI.

 The accident occurred at 11.30 pm at MSN Pharma com pany in Nandigam village on the Hyderabad-Bangalore highway when the Indica car in which they were travelling crashed into a standing truck from behind. “Due to mechanical failure, the truck had come to a halt on the highway right next to the median. Heavy vehicles are not supposed to travel in the first lane and even when the truck came to a halt, its driver did not turn on the indicators,“ the SI said.
 
 As there was no street light at the accident spot, and with indicators not turned on, the Indica car driver Mallesh failed to notice the truck in time and the entire front of the car went under the truck.
 
 While Mallesh, Somanna, Narsamma and Giddamma died on the spot, Somesh succumbed to his injuries while undergoing treatment at a hospital in Shadnagar.
 
 After the accident, the driver of the truck fled from the spot and police registered a case against him under sections 304-a and 337 of the IPC.
