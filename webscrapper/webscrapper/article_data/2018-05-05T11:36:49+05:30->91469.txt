CHANDIGARH: Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sec 32 - the only medical school in the city without a plagiarism checking software - has finally decided to procure one. In its absence, the faculty used to send its theses to others institutes for verification, which is not always feasible. 

 Confirming the development, GMCH director principal Dr BS Chavan said, "We have started the procurement process. The software will be provided to the library and the the faculty. We also have MD theses and in-house journals. We feel there is a need to get our own plagiarism checker."
 
 The medical college that offers 100   seats has been working on enhancing MD seats in different departments. It is believed that either Turnitin or Urkund will be purchased for the college. "We had been not training either the faculty or the students on ethical practices. It is high time that the basic teaching of plagiarism was taken up," said a GMCH faculty member.
 
 There have been cases of copyright infringement and data fraud in prestigious institutions like the IMTECH and the PGIMER. "Plagiarism is a plague that has to be eradicated. If everyone looks the other way, it will just embolden the defaulters and perpetuate the problem," said Prof Vinay Kumar of University of Chicago.
 
 The PGI and IMTECH have softwares to check plagiarism and have underlined guidelines on text similarity. But this began only two years ago. "Plagiarism has not been taken very seriously in the country as compared to the west," said a senior PGI doctor.
