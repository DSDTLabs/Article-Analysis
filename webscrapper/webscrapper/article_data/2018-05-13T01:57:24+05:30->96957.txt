GURUGRAM: The authorities are planning to take action against the owners of at least 190 farmhouses illegally built in   area which is protected under the PLPA (Punjab Land Preservation Act) and the Aravali notification. 

 Acting on a directive of the   ( ), which is hearing a plea in the matter, the department of town and country planning (DTCP) has decided to ask the municipal corporation in   to crack down on unauthorised construction going on in the area.
 
 “These farmhouses have been built without any permission, violating environmental norms. However, the DTCP cannot take any action in the area, which falls under the jurisdiction of the Sohna municipal corporation. Thus, we will write to the civic body (most likely by next week) to take action (maybe even demolition) in the matter,” said a senior DTCP official.
 
 He added the decision was taken at a meeting held earlier this week with officials of the state pollution control board and the district revenue officer.
 
 Sources said the DTCP had carried out a survey in March-April to identify the illegal farmhouses in Raisina area. 
 
 It was found that permissions were granted for construction of only five farmhouses and one school in the area while the remaining 190 were raised illegally. The list of the illegal farmhouses, which fall in the gair mumkin pahad, has already been submitted to the NGT.
 
 The Aravali Retreat was launched in the 80s for developing 675 farmhouses over 1,200 acres. But, subsequently the government prohibited any kind of non-forest activity in land falling under sections 4 & 5 of Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) and the Aravali notification.
 
 Under sections 3(1) and 3(2)(v) of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and Section 5(3)(d) of Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, cutting of trees and construction is prohibited in areas covered by Aravali notification.
