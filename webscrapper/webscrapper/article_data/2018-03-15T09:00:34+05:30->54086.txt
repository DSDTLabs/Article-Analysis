HYDERABAD: It’s been a smooth sail for   this year, with most of the papers being relatively easier than previous years, said experts on Wednesday — the concluding day of the examinations.

 Barring the Maths IIB paper (for   second year) that came as a shocker to many — about 60% of the questions were unfamiliar to students — there were absolutely no surprises in the rest of the tests.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 “All the papers this year have been quite simple and straightforward. There is very good chance that students will score high marks in all subjects. Now, it’s time for them to prepare for   as there is very less time remaining,” said Satyanarayana A, lecturer at a private junior college.
 
 The sentiment among students was much the same.
 
 “It would have been much better if the Maths IIB paper was set on the same lines as the rest. Yet, we are confident of scoring good marks. This confidence will definitely help us in preparing for the competitive exams,” said  , who appeared for his Class 12 examination.
 
 Given the lack of time, corporate colleges said that they would immediately start revision classes for IIT JEE, EAMCET, NEET and other competitive exam aspirants. “The board of intermediate education (BIE) hasn’t allotted sufficient time to cover the entire syllabus. We have just about 180 days. Ideally, colleges should get between 270 and 300 days to help students prepare well for the competitive tests,” said  , IIT coordinator of Narayana Group.
