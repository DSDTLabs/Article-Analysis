ALLAHABAD: State president of Bharatiya Janata Party Keshav Prasad Maurya has landed in trouble as an FIR was lodged against him under Section 130 of the Representation of the People Act with Civil Lines police here on Saturday. 

 Maurya was found to be wearing the party symbol within the premises of the polling booth at Allahabad while he cast his vote on February 23. He was spotted wearing a badge of party symbol on his waist coat while voting at a polling booth in Jwala Devi Inter College. 
 
 The district administration had taken cognisance of the alleged flouting of model code of conduct. The returning officer had sought a report from sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) within 24 hours. It was evident from the pictures published in newspapers and shown on TV channels that Maurya was wearing his party symbol while he was within the premises of the polling booth, which amounts to violation of the Representation of the People Act. An FIR has been lodged against him, deputy election officer Mahendra Rai said. 
 
 Section 130 of the Representation of the People Act deals in prohibition of canvassing in or near polling stations.
