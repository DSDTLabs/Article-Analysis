MUMBAI: Over a fortnight after the state ordered the suspension of assistant municipal commissioner   for allowing a nine-storey illegal building to come up in  , the civic body is yet to take any action. The   has only one month to take action as   is due to retire in May. 

 A source said that it's unlikely that Ghegadmal will be suspended with immediate effect and without an inquiry, which will unquestionably take more than a month. Ghegadmal told TOI he is yet to get any orders. 
 
 The state had also ordered the suspension of a designated officer. Civic officials said they had written to the state urban development department two days ago, seeking directions on what should be done. A senior official said, "  reports said that action needs to be taken against the two. We want to understand what is the BMC supposed to do." 
 
 No action has been taken against the building as well. Another official said, "There have been problems. There was a glitch in the online system and hence, a notice had to be served manually to the structure on March 28." The owners have replied to the BMC and attached the approved plans but the civic body is not convinced, said a source. A final order in the matter is yet to be passed. Deputy municipal commissioner   was unavailable for a comment
