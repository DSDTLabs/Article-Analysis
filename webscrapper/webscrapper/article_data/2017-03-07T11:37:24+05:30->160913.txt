JAIPUR:   on Monday directed the  , Rajasthan to transfer the investigation of rape and blackmailing racket by   Rameez to   (SOG).

 The high court gave these directions in response to a petition moved by the victim’s family through advocate Aslam Khan. “The present investigation officer in the case has not carried out a fair and impartial probe in the case, hence, we decided to move the high court to demand proper investigation,” Khan said.
 
 The matter came to light on February 7 when the parents of a 14-year-old boy alleged that their son was sexually abused and blackmailed for money by Rameez, a private tutor, for four years.
 
 Khan said in the petition that the complainant had gone to the Ramganj police station to lodge an FIR against Rameez on February 6, but the police station in-charge declined to register their FIR.
 
 “Next day we met the police commissioner who directed the Ramganj police station to file an FIR in the matter. Despite that, the local police station did not include Section 377 (unnatural offences) and 384 (extortion),” Khan alleged in his petition.
 
 Rameez (27), a resident of Ramganj area was arrested on February 9 for sexually abusing his students. The police subsequently identified 13 minors from 77 video clips which were recovered from the mobile phone and pen drive of the tutor. The cops found that the teacher had abused and blackmailed students for over five years on the pretext of giving them private tuitions. Most of Rameez’s victims were between the ages of 6 and 15 years.
