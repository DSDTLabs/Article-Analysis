NASHIK: The ABB circle on Trimbakeshwar road and Jehan Circle on Gangapur road would have road   by April 20. 

 Traffic and civic body officials on Thursday conducted a   of the two points to install the road signals. Assistant commissioner of police   the   (NMC), which is responsible for setting up the signals, has approved the facilities at 10 chowks at present. 
 
 Currently, there are 42 traffic signals that are operational in various parts of the city. But with the city expanding fast and the number of vehicles rising, the traffic   have planned more such signals to reduce the congestions on the roads. 
 
 Bajbale said they were checking other parts of the city that should get the signals on a priority. He added that the signals would be useful at certain junctions of the city, where vehicular rush has increased over the years and witnessed accidents and traffic snarls regularly. 
 
 Bajbale said that they would also do away with the traffic islands at the Jehan circle and ABB circle. Of the 42 road signals in the city, two are non-operational and 11 are on the blinker mode. 
 
 Ã“nce the new signals are installed, the traffic police personnel deployed there would be utilised for other activities such as taking action against errant motorists, an official added. 
 
 Two accidents occurred around Jehan circle recently, following which a large number of people from the Gangapur road area gathered near the spot and paid tribute to those who died on the busy road. They had appealed to the authorities to take necessary steps that would stop such fatal accidents. 
 
 There have been 43 fatal accidents so far in the city, this year until March 27. Last year during the same period, the city police had registered 44 fatal accidents. If the 43 fatal accidents registered by the city police this year, 15 occurred in the current month alone.
