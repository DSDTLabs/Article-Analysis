The episode of Kumkum Bhagya begins with Abhi and Pragya dancing. Simonika thinks Sangram is a fool to think that Pragya doubts her plan.  Abhi dances with Disha, while Purab dances with Pragya. Simonika gets happy to see only 15 minutes are remaining for the bomb to explode and decides to leave a few minutes prior to the bomb explosion.  Abhi opens the bag and the bomb explodes. Simonika, who is standing outside, laughs saying her revenge is taken. But it turns out to be her imagination.  In reality, Abhi is dancing with Pragya. She gets emotional and hugs him while dancing. Purab and Disha talk about the bomb and try to figure out in which gift is the bomb placed. Suddenly, Disha slips and is about to fall from the stairs, but Sangram holds her. Disha thanks him as Sangram smiles. Purab searches for the gift bag which has the bomb. Just then he gets Simonikaâ€™s gift bag and thinks that the bomb might be placed in there. Simonika sees Purab and gets tensed. She rushes to stop him but collides with Alia, who scolds her. Simonika says she was going to bathroom.
