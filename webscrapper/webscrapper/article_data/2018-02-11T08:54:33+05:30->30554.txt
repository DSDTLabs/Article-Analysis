The   group is being routed from its strongholds, and the rebels who seek to topple President Bashar al-Assad are down to a few remaining pockets of land. But seven years on, the war in Syria shows no signs of ending anytime soon. The complex war, which has drawn in foreign powers like Russia, the US,  , Saudi Arabia and Israel, is playing out on four fronts:

 
 
 
 The conflict that started the war, an uprising against Assad that evolved into an armed rebellion, is headed toward a conclusion. Even if Assad’s forces are depleted, nobody now appears willing & able to topple him.
 
 
 
 
 Turkey feels threatened by the predominant fighting group to emerge from Syria’s Kurdish minority, which carved out a de facto ministate along the Turkish border amid the chaos of the civil war. Recently, Turkey attacked the Kurdish enclave of Afrin, and they may now target the US-backed Kurds farther east
 
 
 
 
 The jihadists have lost nearly all of the territory they had controlled as a self-proclaimed caliphate, rooted out by relentless, separate attacks by forces backed by the US & Russia. But as their territory shrinks, analysts believe they may resort to more violence
 
 
 
 
 Till now, Israel had managed to keep itself out of the conflict. But the bigger Iran vs Saudi Arabia battle for supremacy in the region has threatened to drag them into the conflict, which appears to be happening now
