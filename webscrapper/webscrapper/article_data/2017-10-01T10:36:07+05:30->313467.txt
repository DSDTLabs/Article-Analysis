So me of the students and college staff noticed the urns and they alerted the college administration, which later informed the   officials about this.
 
 A team of officials led by ASI sub-collector   from   visited the place and confirmed that these urns were 3,000 years old. They kept stones around the exposed urns and white washed the sto nes marking a boundary around the urns. The officials also informed the college authorities to preserve the place from intruders to get more information about the megalithic sites.
 
 A 4.5-tall urn with a circumference of 3 ft and a mouth width of 1.5 ft was found at a depth of 10 ft. Several shards of bones, a shred of a skull and pottery that included water jars (kalayams) and bowls of varying sizes were recovered from the urn.
