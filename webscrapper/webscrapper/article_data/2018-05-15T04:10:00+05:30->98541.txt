Vadodara: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) is yet to get any clarity on the supply of water from the Narmada canal for the Ajwa reservoir, the primary drinking water source for citizens whose level is dwindling consistently.

 VMC officials said on Monday that they are still awaiting response from the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL) to their request of additional water supply from a Narmada branch canal near the Ajwa reservoir. The officials added that a letter seeking 60 cubic feet per second (cusec) water from the canal was sent by the VMC last week. So far, the SSNNL has been supplying 20 cusec water from the canal.
 
 Officials said that 60 cusec water would ensure that the level in the reservoir is maintained and water supply to the city is adequate at the present level. VMC has also sent a cheque of Rs 1.36 crore to SSNNL towards deposit for the water supply.
 
 An official said that the level in Ajwa reservoir went down to 204.35 feet on Monday. With this, the civic body is supply 130.52 million litres per day (MLD) water to the city as against the need of 148 MLD.
 
 There has been a curtailment in water supply to the city without any formal declaration by the civic body. Officials said that the difference was minor and would not affect in a major way. 
 
 If the levels continue to recede further, the VMC may have to curtail water supply significantly or look for alternatives for the eastern part of the city that depends heavily on water from Ajwa reservoir.
