CHENNAI: Unidentified miscreants on Thursday morning hurled 'petrol bombs' at   in Chennai damaging a few bikes parked on the premises, police said. 

 The incident occurred at 4am on Thursday when there was no policemen outside the Teynempet police station. The gang, which is believed to have come on two bikes, threw two bottles filled with petrol. They lit the bottle and threw it on the bikes which went up in flames. 
 
 A few passers by noticed fire and informed policemen who doused the flames. However, there was no damage to the police station.
 
 "It is a small incident. There was no damage. We are trying to study the CCTV footage to identify the culprits," said a senior police officer.
 
 Following damage to the vehicles on police station premises, a criminal case under Section 436 of the Indian Penal Code for causing mischief by fire or explosive substances with intent to destroy house has been registered, police said. Efforts are on to nab the culprits, police added.
 
 Chennai city police commissioner A K Vishwanathan inspected the spot.
 
 In September last year, miscreants hurled petrol bombs at   police station, which has recently witnessed protests over an alleged custodial death of a robbery accused.
