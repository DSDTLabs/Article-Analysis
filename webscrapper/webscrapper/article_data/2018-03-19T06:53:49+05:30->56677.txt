LUCKNOW: The probability of train accidents between Lucknow and Kanpur would reduce and trains would arrive on schedule as   has started changing the rail interlocking track system from manual to electronic. 

 On Sunday, three electronic systems were inaugurated for Ajgain, Harauni and   railway stations. There are total 11 stations between Lucknow and Kanpur. Rest will be changed by October. About 200 trains run on   track section every day. As per operation department of railways, majority of trains on this section get delayed due to track clearance issue. 
 
 The manual process is cumbersome and time consuming as when the operator in control room receives signal to change track of a train, he ensure two yellow signal lights to the loco pilot signalling him to slow down so that the technical in charge of local track operation changes the track by pressing the button of track interlocking board and one worker joins the track points manually with the help of tools. Sometimes, this manual process takes over an hour if there is any technical glitch and thus trains get delayed. Hence, NR has started changing the interlocking control system from manual to electronic. 
 
 The change will reduce chances of track failure and wrong signalling besides being helpful in arrival and departure of trains on schedule.
