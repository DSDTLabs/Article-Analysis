Bhopal: Amid doubts on the re-evaluation process of the  , the vice chancellor of   has asked for another re-evaluation - this time by different people. 

 The re-evaluation results, announced on February 15, caused concerns among many, as 40 % of the students who applied for the rechecking passed. 
 
 According to rule, a candidate's marks cannot be increased by more than 20 per cent. However, sources say that the marks of as many as 11 students were inflated beyond 20 per cent. 
 
 "Thirty-nine students applied for the re-evaluation. Out of which 16 students were declared pass leading to doubts over the pass percentage. So many students cannot pass in a re-evaluation," said a university official without quoting his name. 
 
 "The marks of these 11 students were withheld as their marks were increased by more than 20 per cent.
 
 Sources say that a checking of re-evaluation process would benefit BU and might put an end to repeat of similar incidents. "BU's dental scam also began with re-evaluation. It was found that the answer-sheets were filled outside the exam hall. A proper probe is required into the matter," said a senior teaching faculty
 
 Registrar UN Shukla confirmed that VC Prof Verma has asked for a rechecking of the answer sheets by another teacher. 
 
 "We have been transparent in our work. Evaluation was done by the teacher not the university. We will follow the direction and proceed with the re-checking," said registrar Shukla. He also said that if any student still has a doubt, they can approach any investigation agency. "We have done nothing wrong," said Shukla. 
 
  said that there should be a probe on the matter. "It is not just about re-checking the evaluation process. We suspect that passing students in the re-evaluation is the work of an organised group of people," said NSUI state's spokesperson Vivek Tripathi.
