When we asked   about her role in this week’s release,  , she didn’t quite have an answer. “I am really confused; I don’t have much to say about it. Every day on the set was different. I have a lot of shades in the film, so I had a wide range to deliver, in terms of expressions, look, costumes and dialogue delivery. The way director   works is very different. Usually, you know what happens before and after each scene, but it was the opposite with Varthamana. Forget the previous or next scene, we didn’t even know what was going on in the scene we were filming. I blindly followed the director’s instructions. We weren’t allowed to click pictures on set or tell people about the film, so no one even knew that we were making a film till recently. It was a different and fun experience,” she says.

 Without knowing much about the film, what made Sanjana sign on the dotted line? “When the director approached me, he asked me just one question — ‘What is 
  (present) to you?’ When I thought about it, I realised that I either think about what has happened or am anxious about what is to come. I used to never live in the present. That thought clicked.   and I improvised for almost every scene, which was a fun and satisfying for an actor,” says an excited and anxious Sanjana, who is looking forward to the release of the film.
