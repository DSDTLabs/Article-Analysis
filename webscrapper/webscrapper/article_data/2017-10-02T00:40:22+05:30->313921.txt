Trichy: The National Waterways Development Technology (Nawad Tech) has planned to hold a massive rally in Trichy in November to promote interlinking of waterways and also to pressurise both the state and Union governments to implement the project.

 While addressing reporters, AC Kamaraj, chairman of Nawad Tech, said that interlinking of   was absolutely essential not only to tackle flood and drought, but also to provide drinking water to the people. However, it is not a simple affair since it involves multiple problems, he said.
 
 “A state which has surplus water will never accept that they have surplus water. Even if they do accept, they will not spare the same. The second problem is the problems it will create between states in sharing of water. States are not coming forward to bear the huge expenditure to implement the scheme. So, the Union government has to mobilise large funds. Will any state giving water to its neighbour come forward to spare such a huge amount,” he said.
 
 However, interlinking will not help in controlling floods as rivers can draw a maximum of 40,000 cusecs of flood water but in the case of flooded rivers the inflow would be around 10 lakh cusecs. The flood control was just about four percent, he added.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Kamaraj said, “Creating awareness among the public was the focal point for holding a state-level conference that has been planned on November 5. At the meeting which will be held in Trichy, every effort will be taken to include all the stakeholders including farmers, traders, volunteers and NGOs.”
 
 “Though both the state and Union governments have readily accepted the project, no one is coming forward to execute it. We have planned to draw various resolutions at the conference in such a way as to catch the attention of both the state as well as the Centre,” he added.
