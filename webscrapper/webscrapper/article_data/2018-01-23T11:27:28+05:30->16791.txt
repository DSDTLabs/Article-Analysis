LUCKNOW: District inspector of schools (DIOS)   on Monday recommended to   to withdraw the affiliation of   on grounds of irregularities found in the college. 

 In his recommendation to additional secretary of UP Board, Singh said the college has flouted norms on security and safety in schools.
 
 Singh's recommendations came after a class VI girl allegedly attacked a class I boy with knife in the Brightland College. The incident, which took place on January 16, has raised questions on the safety and security of children in schools.
 
 The DIOS had constituted a two-member committee to probe the incident. The committee, which submitted its report to DIOS on Monday, found severe anomalies at Brightland College. The affiliation documents showed that college did not adhere to the norms. The college failed to provide the building plan and land related documents, said Singh. "The college is running science courses but doesn't have a biology lab. In other labs, equipment are missing," Singh told TOI. 
 
 The committee found that classes III and IV were running in a separate building, about 300 metres from the college building. Classrooms were smaller and the students enrolled was beyond the prescribed limit, said DIOS. 
 
 Meanwhile, women cops in civvies on Monday recorded the statements of students who were seen with the suspected girl in CCTV footage provided by the college.
 
 The investigating officer   told TOI: "The girl under the scanner looks nervous and seen biting her nails in the CCTV footage. She is also seen whispering in the ear of a student," said Singh. On Tuesday, police will speak to the victim to know the sequence of events and also interact with the doctors treating him. "We will then analyse if there is contradiction in the statements," said Singh.
