Nagpur: A supreme court judgment had raised hopes of millions private sector employees who otherwise may have ended up getting very meagre pension. The court in R C Gupta and others vs Regional Provident Fund Commissioner, ruled that in case contribution towards employees pension scheme (EPS) is made on a salary over and above the upper limit of Rs6,500 then even pension can be received on higher amount. The field offices of employees provident fund organization (EPFO), which also handles pension, have been issued directions to follow the verdict.  The pension payable under EPS has been capped to a salary of Rs15,000 since 2014. Prior to 2014, it was Rs6,500. So under the old salary limit, the pension comes to around Rs3500 and a little over Rs7000 under the new ceiling. The supreme court order gives scope for an employee to get pension according to a higher salary. In case the employer begins contributing on higher salary from the day the employee’s pay surpasses upper limit of Rs6,500, even pension has to be paid as per actual pay.  As 12% of employee’s salary is deducted as provident fund, an equal contribution is made by the employer too. Nearly 80% of the employer’s share goes towards pension fund. Generally the employers limit there contribution to the upper limit, which was earlier Rs6,500 and is now Rs15,000. There have been many cases where the employers’ contributions have been made on actual salary which is beyond the limit.  Here is an example. Suppose A had a salary of Rs6,500 in 2012 which was also the upper limit for pension calculation at that time. In this situation the employer will contribute 12% as PF dues. “As much as 80% of the employers’ contribution goes towards pension. In the first scenario, A will continue to get pension based on a salary of Rs6,500, which comes to around Rs3500. Now if A’s salary is hiked to Rs12,000 the next year and the employer makes an contribution at the new amount then even the pension will be pegged at the new amount,” says the ruling. For this, contribution on the higher salary has to be made soon after the pay his hiked, said a source interpreting the ruling.  Since pension was capped at a salary of Rs6,500 the surplus contributions by the employers has gone to PF account. Now extra amount which went to the PF fund could go back to the pension fund, says an EPFO order. A source in the EPFO said ruling may only be applicable to the cases up to 2014 as the limit of Rs6,500 mentioned in the communication was hiked to Rs15,000 after that.
