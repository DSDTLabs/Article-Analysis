BIJNOR: While many people across the country managed to get their hands on  ,   are still facing   at a time when the   is going on. About 95% of   across Bijnor district continued to run dry and most of them are locked.
 
  Central government had implemented demonetisation on November 11, 2016. That time, customers had to face lots of problems as they were empty handed. But situation had got normal during assembly polls. But, now in Bijnor, bank account holders are running from pillar to post for cash but of no avail.
  
  For a month, about 95 % ATMs of the district are running dry, creating problems for the customers.
  
  Giriraj Singh, a resident of Shadipur, said, “It is wedding season. For months, all ATMs are running dry. There is no cash in the ATMs. We go to withdraw money from ATMs, but most of them have been locked and ATMs which are opened are running dry. We can take only balance inquiry from them.”
  
  Singh further added, “To get the cash, we have to line up outside the bank. It is very hot season and old people cannot stand in the line. The point is that customers, not only in rural area but also in the urban, are unable to get sufficient money.”
  
  On being asked about the matter, Ajay Kumar, lead bank officer, said, “It is right that banks are facing cash crunch. The supply of currency notes have been affected for one month. We are not getting sufficient supply of currency notes from RBI. It is hoped that problem will be sorted out soon.”
