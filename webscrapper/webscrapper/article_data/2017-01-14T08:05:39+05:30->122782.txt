PUNE: Former Congress minister and   (67) passed away after a brief illness at a   here on Friday morning. A Congress loyalist, Chhajed was elected   from Bopodi for five terms from 1978 to 2002.

 Earlier in 1971, he joined the civil defence services and took charge of various important posts. He was felicitated with the President’s gold medal.
 
 Fondly known as ‘mamu’ in political circles, Chhajed was popular among the masses. A former lawyer, he served as Pune mayor in 1987-88 and was leader of the House in PMC from 1992 to 2002. 
 
 He was elected twice as MLA from Bopodi Assembly constituency in 1999 and 2004. Chhajed became minister for tourism in 2003.
 
 Chhajed was a close aide of the late V N Gadgil, who represented Pune in the Lok Sabha. 
 
 When Gadgil’s popularity waned, he switched allegiance to former MP Suresh Kalmadi. A past master in civic politics, Chhajed had backed Kalmadi’s Pune Vikas Aghadi. He stood by Kalmadi through the 18-month phase of political wilderness between 1998 and 1999. 
 
 Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has expressed condolence over Chhajed’s death. “Chhajed joined the civil defence services through which he became a mass leader. He helped common people, particularly slum dwellers, in getting public amenities,” Fadnavis said in his condolence message.
