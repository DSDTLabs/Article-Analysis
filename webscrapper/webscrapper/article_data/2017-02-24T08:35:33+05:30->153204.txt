NEW DELHI: The BJP parliamentarian for New Delhi,  , and AAP MLA  , who represents Greater Kailash, were caught in a battle of words on Twitter on Thursday over setting up open gyms at NRI Colony in Alaknanda. 

 After Lekhi called Bhardwaj a “copycat”, he put up scanned copies of documents claiming that the money for the project was transferred to the south corporation from his MLALADS funds in March 2016, much before Lekhi made a similar proposal. Denying the charge, Lekhi claimed she had started the process in 2015. She, however, is yet to provide any documentary evidence. 
 
 NRI Colony will now have two open gyms in the same park. The gym set up with Lekhi’s funds is ready for use while the other one will be available in a day or two.
 
 “Copycat is apt word. First open gym project in whole of India was mine, told   (then standing committee chairman) to approve for MCD,” Lekhi tweeted, adding, “Saurabh, enough work is left to be done where MP funds can’t be used but MLA funds can be. Why didn’t (you) pick up water, sewage, PWD roads?” 
 
 Bhardwaj returned fire, tweeting, “Check ur facts. I transferred funds in March 2016. For ur inflated ego, later u gave funds for second gym” He said, “Your BJP-ruled MCD delayed open gyms in GK just out of petty politics. Put your docs on Twitter that you did earlier than me.” Bhardwaj’s documents showed he had transferred Rs 1,34,98,800 for installation of open gyms and play equipment for children in four locations, including NRI Colony. 
 
 Lekhi’s last tweet says, “AAP neither has original thinking nor interest in work, thus continues to create ruckus.”
