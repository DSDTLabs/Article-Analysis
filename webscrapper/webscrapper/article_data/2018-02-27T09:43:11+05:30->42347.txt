AURANGABAD: The   ( ) will be submitting a Rs 74-crore waste management project proposal to the state government. 

 The draft of the Detailed Project Report (DPR) is ready and awaits approval of the municipal commissioner. 
 
 The state government, as per the norms of the Swachha Bharat Mission (SBM), appointed  , an Indore-based private agency, to prepare the DPR. Funds of SBM are allocated to the municipal body based on this report.
 
  of Eco-Pro said the agency has calculated the daily waste generation in Aurangabad at 611 metric tonnes and suggested that it can be managed in 12-14 months. 
 
 ”Our team surveyed the city and reviewed the existing waste management system before working on solutions. The infrastructural and systematic changes in the report bridge the gap between the ideal waste management and the existing scenario,” said Warsi.
 
 The report says that the municipal corporation should rope in NGOs or private companies to educate the citizens and commercial units on segregation of dry and wet waste at source, the report says. 
 
 “To undertake the primary collection, the agency suggests that tempos or ‘chhota haathis’ (pick-up vans) be bought. These mini dippers will then unload the waste into compactor bins at transfer points. These bins, with separate compartments for different waste categories, will be mounted on vehicles, through which wet waste will be sent to different treatment facilities,” said Warsi.
 
 The plan proposes four material recovery centres for sorting of dry waste into different types of paper, plastic and reject material through manual means. This categorised waste can then be sent for recycling to private vendors. 
 
 “Eco-Pro also suggests bio-remediation of old dump site at Naregaon; 50% of the the existing waste has decomposed by itself turning into soil, the remaining waste will be treated according to the process of bio-mining so that the landfill site can be reclaimed,” Warsi said.
