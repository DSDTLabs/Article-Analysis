 clarifies that he doesn't take the privileges of being part of Indian Territorial   for granted. "For me, it's a blessing to wear the army uniform. I am fortunate to be part of this fraternity and be able to do what I had wished if I was in the army. To wear the uniform is a luck bestowed to only one in a crore,‚Äù says the superstar, who was honoured with the   rank. 

 The war-centric films that he has been part of in the Major Mahadevan franchise such as Keerthichakra and Kurukshetra too seemed to have served their bit in igniting the patriotic fervour in the youth, he says.
 
 "Last November, when I had attended a get-together organised at the army camp in Mahajan, Rajasthan, a young man told me that he joined the Army after watching Keerthichakra. He's a   now. Similarly, I met a lady engineer. She too joined the army after watching the movie. She had two sisters and her family initially would not relent. But she convinced them and now she is also a captain," he says, adding, "It's not a fashion to join the army. People do it because they are patriotic."
