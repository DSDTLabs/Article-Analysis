Surat: Forty-two-year-old Anjali Salaunke has been a rangoli artist for the past 30 years. It was always her dream to bring pride to the city through her artworks. 

 “Art means Vadodara and Ahmedabad only. This is why we wanted to do something for the city. And our group drew the epic Ramayana in rangoli,” she told TOI. 
 
 There are 14 local artists in Alpana group which has begun doing theme-based rangoli exhibitions in the city. The group’s theme exhibition will be open for public viewing in the city from September 30 to October 18. 
 
 Ramayana has been created by this group in an area of 3,450 square metres at the Science Centre of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC). Each artist had worked for 10 hours in a day for 11 days to create 85 rangolis to show the epic in colours. The expense of Rs 2 lakh was borne by the Surat Municipal Corporation, which is yet to take a decision whether to pay any honorarium to the artists or not.
 
 A professional freelance artist Ashwin Jariwala, who sketched 85 pictures for the rangolis, said, “The younger generation needs to know this epic because it is one of the most important literary works of ancient India.”
 
 Persis Presswala, a professional web designer and rangoli artist, said, “The 14 artists merged their individualities to create this artwork. We hope people will like it.” 
 
 Bhamini Mahida, an officer of the civic body, said, “These artists have been associated with the SMC in their individual capacities for the past many years. However, this time they have joined to become a group and created something which has never been done anywhere in the country before.” 
 
 Alpana group comprises Anjali Salunke, Shikha Jariwala, Ashwin Jariwala, Amita Bhagat, Mira Kordawala, Aditi Bhatt, Darshana Sachania, Nina Rathod, Kamisha Chevli, Dhavni Chevli, Persis Presswala, Pradip Hans, Priyanka Patel and Bhavik Patel.
