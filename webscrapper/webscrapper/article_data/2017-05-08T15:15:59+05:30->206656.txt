In a random gesture,   Nicki Minaj decided to pay tuition fees for her fans. 

 One of the Twitter followers of Minaj, 34, asked her if she wanted to pay for his tuition. 
 
 In reply, the songstress offered to pay the fees for all her fans, who would show her their straight A-grades. 
 
  
  
 
 "Show me straight A's that I can verify with your school and I'll pay it. Who wants to join THAT contest? Dead serious. Should I set it up?" wrote Minaj.
  
  
 After she was satisfied with the proof, Minaj asked the selected fans to send in their bank account information. 
 
 A user wrote, "1k would be more then enough for my 3 summer classes help me Nic @NICKIMINAJ." 
 
 To this Minaj replied, "That's it? I'll send it tomorrow. DM me your bank information babe. Next!" 
 
 
  
  She also paid for a professional camera for a student taking up a course of production in audiovisual media.
