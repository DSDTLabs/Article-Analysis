CHENNAI: Hinting at a possible amicable settlement with the  , Japanese automobile maker   informed the   on Friday that the state had commenced talks.

 “As a step forward, Tamil Nadu government has initiated talks with us. As of now, the subject of the talks has been kept confidential,” senior counsel P S Raman said, seeking a directive to defer the hearing of the plea moved by the government to stall the   proceedings initiated by Nissan.
 
 As no one represented the state when the plea was taken up for hearing, Justice Anita Sumanth said she wanted to know the stand of the state as it might throw some light on the latest development in the issue and posted the application to March 21, for the appearance of advocate general.
 
 In December 2017, the state government moved the high court seeking an interim injunction against Nissan, from proceeding with its arbitration against India over unpaid tax refunds of nearly $770 million. The state alleged that Nissan invoked the international arbitration under the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) between India and Japan to “coerce Tamil Nadu government.”
 
 However, the Union government filed an affidavit saying the state government did not have locus standi to challenge the international arbitration proceedings.
