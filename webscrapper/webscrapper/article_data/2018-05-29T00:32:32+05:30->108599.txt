Coimbatore: The school education department on Monday filled seats in private schools in the district under the right to education (RTE) Act. The department used the lot system to fill seats in as many as 154 matriculation schools and 53 nursery and primary schools. Then lot system is used to fill seats under the 25% RTE reservation in schools where the number of RTE applications were more than the number of available seats. Till last year the rules said students from weaker sections, who had applied for RTE seats, would be given seats if they lived within 1km for primary classes and within 3km for upper primary classes. But, from this year, the state has decided that only students, who lived at a distance of 1km from a school would be given RTE seats, said an education department official. This decision didn’t go well with several parents, who had gone to schools in the city to seek admissions through RTE. A parent, who had gone to a school on Avinashi Road to seek admission for his child, was turned away as he was living more than a kilometre away from the school. “The school had around 23 RTE seats. But according to the new rule, only six people were eligible for the seats. So, 17 RTE seats would remain vacant,” said the parent. When asked about this, an official of the education department said the state had taken the move because if students from weaker sections had to travel more than 1km, they would have to bear the transportation cost. Also form this year, the state has reduced the number of admission spells under RTE to one. “While last year we had three spells of admissions to fill up vacancies, this year the department has reduced to one,” said the official. The official added that because of these norms, this year all the 25% RTE seats wouldn’t get filled.
