PANAJI: The state government has enacted the Goa Regularisation of Unauthorised Construction Act, 2016, and thus there was no need for the Calangute-Candolim Outline Development Plan (ODP) to regularise unauthorised homes, Congress spokesperson and former Calangute   Agnelo Fernandes said on Saturday.

 “(Calangute MLA)   is trying to fool people by claiming that he is bringing in the ODP to regularise illegal homes,” Fernandes said. “The state government has already promulgated the Goa Regularisation of Unauthorised Construction Act, so why does he need the ODP?” 
 
 Fernandes accused Lobo, who is also chairman of the North Goa Planning and Development Authority (NGPDA), of facilitating illegal conversion of about 25,000 sqm of land lying in the no-development zone (NDZ) and another 4,000-5,000 sqm of land that is currently paddy fields.
 
 Fernandes alleged that Lobo was pushing for the ODP only for the benefit of builders from outside the state. “This is a big scam,” he said. “After the ODP is done, Lobo’s family stands to gain in kind to the tune of Rs 500-600 crore. I will come out with the details soon.” 
 
 The former MLA also taunted Lobo for supporting the Banjara community and for promising its members SC/ST status. “Lobo does not have the spine to stand by his statement,” Fernandes said. “If the video (of Lobo making the statement) is edited or he is misquoted, let him sue me for defamation.” 
 
 Fernandes also refuted allegations that he had applied for conversion before the NGPDA. Lobo had, on Friday, said that although the former   has been opposing the ODP for Calangute and Candolim, he was the first to apply for change in land use when applications were invited.
 
 “In 2015, the state government notified rules giving additional 20% floor area ratio (FAR) for hotels and educational institutions,” Fernandes said, adding that he applied for additional FAR for his hotel as per the government’s rules.
