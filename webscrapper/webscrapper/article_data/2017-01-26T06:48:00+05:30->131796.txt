NAGPUR: To upgrade the image of government hospital, 12 Indian Police Service (IPS) officers from the district came up voluntarily on Wednesday to get their annual health check-up done at   (SSH). The initiative has been taken up for the first time in entire state.

 Commissioner of Police (CP) Dr   said, “Every year we have been going to corporate hospitals and lot of budget is allotted. The facilities offered here is at par with other private hospitals. We approached all the IFS officers of the district and each one of them offered their support. From now on we will be coming here every year.”
 
 Even Chief Minister   is happy with the initiative since it is saving the revenue which is otherwise spent on corporate hospitals.
 
 Dr  , member secretary, chief minister health relief fund, Nagpur centre, “There are about 300 IFS officers who every year get the same check-up done at Rs20,000. Funds of Rs2 croces is spent for the purpose. The government had identified Suretech hospital from Nagpur district for the check-up. But this by choosing SSH, the officers have set an example.”
 
 SSH officer on special duty (OSD) Dr Manish Shrigiriwar said, “This kind of initiative by the officers will give a message to common public to have faith in government system.”
 
 Out of the total 19 IPS officers from the district, seven couldn’t show up due to some official reasons, while 10 male officers and two females went through the check-up. Apart from annual heath check-up format framed by the central government, SHH introduced Fibroscan (Liver Examination).
 
 Divisional Commissioner Anup Kumar appreciated CP's move and said it can be implemented for other government officers and staffers.
