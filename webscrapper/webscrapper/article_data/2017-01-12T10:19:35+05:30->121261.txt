Cochin  , one of the anticipated events in the city is here! The lines Pookkal, Panineer Pookkal, Neeyum Kaanundo... come to your mind as you step into the expo, which has 36,000 flowering and leafy plants this year, the largest one conducted by them so far, according to the organisers. 

 A set of floral arrangements welcome the visitors, looking more like a fairy tale, themed on Alice in Wonderland and Cinderella. Professor V I George, a founder member, says that this year’s edition handpicked some of the best varieties from Pune, Gundlupett, Kumali and Rajasthan. He says, “What makes this year’s show stand apart is the way it is arranged, with an aesthetic sense.”
 
 Around 500 hibiscus plants, 1,500 rose plants, which also includes Kashmiri roses, 1,000 Thailand orchids and another 1,500 dahlia plants are on display, along, with varieties of Adunium, Chrysanthemum, Marigold, Cosmos, Celosia and Dianthus among many others. A collection of topiaries in the form of a tortoise, peacock and rabbit are among the highlights this time. A set of ayurvedic plants are also on display, with the Malayalam name, scientific name and its medicinal use. Just as you think the show has come to a close with last line-up, the arrangement of flowers and plants using waste materials made by retired professor Anthony leave you amazed. Helmets, cycles and PC desktops turn raw materials to give the garden a revamped look, and it is surely an eye-catcher. 
 
 George concludes that the collection of plants will be given off to people in reduced prices on the day after the show wraps up.
