SHIMLA: The two missing leopards, out of the three which had escaped from the zoo in  , near Palampur in   district, have been captured and caged again on Thursday. The wildlife officials had traced one missing leopard injured in the forest nearby on Wednesday evening.

 The staff at Dhauladhar National Park, also known as Gopalpur Zoo, had found the three leopards missing on Wednesday morning. Wildlife officials suspect sabotage by miscreants as the fence of enclosures was found cut at two places. An FIR has been lodged for the sabotage act in the zoo and the matter is also being inquired into by the forest officials. 
 
 The zoo has 12 leopards in captivity. 
 
 Principal chief conservator of forests-cum-chief wildlife warden S K   told TOI that enclosures of these leopards were cut with the help of hand cutters and that even police suspect sabotage. He said the escape of leopards had created a very dangerous situation and since they are usually fed around 3am, they could have done anything when hungry. “Luckily, nothing of this sort happened and they were captured in time,” he added.
 
 Lauding the zoo staff for not letting up the operation to recapture these leopards even at night, Sharma said they suspected that the two leopards were hiding in a nullah about 50 meters from the zoo boundary. To lure them back, the staff laid out a food trail of goat meat for them -- right from the nullah to their enclosure. Sharma said the strategy worked and one female leopard walked back to the enclosure around 12.30am. The third leopard, a male, was also traced in that very nullah on Thursday morning and successfully tranquilized before being brought back to the enclosure.
