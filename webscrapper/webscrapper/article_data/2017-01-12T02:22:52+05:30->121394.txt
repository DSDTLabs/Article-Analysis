GURGAON: Chief minister   on Wednesday said 24 deals, involving potential investment of Rs 20,000 crore, were signed during the two-day  , which would help “provide employment opportunities to 43,000 people”.

 Some important MoUs in defence, aerospace, manufacturing, healthcare and education sectors were inked in the event. The biggest MoU signed is between the state government and Chinese mobile manufacturing giant Oppo mobiles. A deal worth Rs 500 crore was also signed to set up   in Manesar.
 
 “Also, 23 pravasi Haryanvis have offered to invest Rs 17 crore in various philanthropic works,” Khattar said, adding that the event was attended by 400 NRIs from across 33 countries, and 300 of them belonged to Haryana. 
 
 The government will also tie up with a Chinese giant to carry out a feasibility study on the transport system between Gurgaon and Manesar. 
 
 Investors welcomed the initiative. “We are a firm interested in funding sustainable growth projects. A chance to invest in the home state sounds great, but the government needs to ensure that processes are corruption-free and executed on time,” said  , one of the investors, who is originally from Rohtak and lives in Netherlands.
