CHENNAI: Travellers who are yet to plan their trips for for the months of May and June may not have to burn a hole in their pockets as a sale announced by a low-cost carrier has brought down the fare on some of the   for travel   

 Tickets which were expensive last week for travel on different dates in May, are now selling at at prices lower by Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000 because of the effect of the sale announced by the airline. 
 
 The fares are likely to dip further if more airlines join the fray. 
 
  Airlines has launched a three-day sale in which an all-inclusive fare starts at Rs 1,499 for travel in May and June. 
 
 This has brought down the fares marginally to airports that connect to various tourist destinations from Chennai. 
 
 However, the lowest fare offered by the airline has already been lapped up. Only one or two seats are available on most sectors at the cheapest fare. 
 
 Though the intent was to attract the travellers who were yet to make plans to the book on Indigo flights, the move by the airline has helped in reducing fares to destinations like Mumbai, Hyderabad, Pune, Goa and Kochi. 
 
 The price band of fares for travel in May remains higher than that in April because a large number of people travel for leisure and family visits in May as vacations in schools and colleges begin next month. 
 
 Travel Agents Federation of India member Basheer Ahmed said, “There a mild decline in the domestic fare but it is highly unlikely that it will dip any further because of high demand for tickets. There is a lot of enquiries for tours to Kulu-Manali, Shimla, Goa, tourist spots in Kerala, hill stations near Mumbai and Pune. The new fares will help these tourists.” 
 
 He also said that the sale opened up lower minimum fare for booking but the number of seats available were less. 
 
 Though the fare has dipped marginally, ticket prices remain high on weekends and on dates closer to the beginning of vacation.
