A sessions court in Pune rejected the   application of Samasta Hindu Aaghadi leader   on Monday in the   violence case.

 Ekbote was booked by the Pune rural police for inciting a mob to commit violence in Koregaon Bhima on January 1 when Dalits were congegating in the village in Pune district on the 200th anniversary of the British-Peshwa battle there. Dalits were among the British troops that held back the   forces on January 1, 1818, and every year Dalits mark the event.
 
 Apart from offences of attempt to murder, unlawful assembly, rioting and charges under the Arms Act, Ekbote is also booked for offences under the Prevention of Atrocities (SC/ST) Act. 
 
 “The court of additional sessions judge Pralhad C Bhagure rejected the plea at the interim stage of hearing itself,” additional public prosecutor Vilas Pathare said. 
 
 Pathare said that since the matter was decided at an interim stage, the issue of directing notices to the state for its response did not arise.
 
 Ekbote’s lawyer Chintamani Ghate said they would move the   on Tuesday against the order. 
 
 “In a plea under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the interim and anticipatory bail is heard simultaneously,” he said. The court held that the matter is sensitive and it will not interfere with the same at this stage.” 
 
 He said that though Section 18 of the Atrocities Act places a bar on the grant of anticipatory bail, higher courts had spelt out exceptions. “We had cited a few Supreme Court and high court rulings that made an exception to this provision under certain circumstances and had made out our case for grant of interim relief to the applicant,” Ghate said.
 
 He said they submitted that Ekbote was not present in Koregaon Bhima on January 1 and even the police papers have not established his presence. “The witnesses, too, have said that they did not see him there,” he said.
