Actress Kristen   says US President Donald   was earlier 'obsessed' with her. Trump had in 2012 commented on Stewart's personal life. 'He was mad at me a couple years ago, really obsessed with me a couple years ago, which is f*****g crazy,' Stewart told variety.com. 'I can't even understand it. I literally cannot even understand it. It's such far-out concept that I don't want to believe that actually is happening. It's insane,' she added in reference to Trump's swearing-in as the US President.

  
  
 Trump's presidential inauguration took place on Friday. He had tweeted in 2012: '  should not take back Kristen Stewart. She cheated on him like a dog & will do it again ' just watch. He can do much better!' When asked how Trump's tweets made her feel at that time, Stewart replied: 'At that point, he was just, like, a reality star. I had no reference. It wasn't like really a thing. But in retrospect, somebody reminded me of that and I was like, 'Oh my gosh, you're right!'
 
 Stewart, who's not on Twitter, quipped: 'He's probably, like, going to tweet about this.' 
 
 Yesterday, a small part of the US President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural speech was sounded somewhat similar to the dialogues of The Dark Knight Rises popular villain Bane.
