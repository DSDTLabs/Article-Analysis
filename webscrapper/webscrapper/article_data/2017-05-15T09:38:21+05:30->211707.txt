THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Devaswom minister   and Travancore devaswom board president   are at loggerheads once again. This time it is over the religious educational institutions that the board is planning to set up adjacent to temples across the state.

 The minister, in a Facebook post on Sunday, flayed the   president’s statement that only those who send their children to such religious educational institutions will be allowed to be part of temple administration.
 
 “He has no moral authority to decide on such things. He, as president of the TDB, only has administrative powers. He cannot make decisions on such policy matters,” said the devaswom minister.
 
 The TDB president is trying to implement the agenda of the   in the temples under the board. The government will not allow this to happen. Almost all the statements and moves made by the TDB president is aimed at encouraging the Sangh Parivar in the state, said Surendran.
 
 The minister also said that the board president, who was appointed by the UDF, is now appeasing the Sangh Parivar. The people of the state are eager to know the stand of KPCC president M M Hassan on the several communal stands taken by the TDB president, he said.
 
 Surendran also urged the TDB president to remove V S Jayakumar, the brother of former minister  , before conducting a probe into the corruption charges against the board involving him.
 
 The board president should concentrate more on rooting out corruption in the board and remove the devaswom secretary who is facing several corruption charges, said the minister.
