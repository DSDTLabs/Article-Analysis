HYDERABAD: Though there are several laws such as Right to Information, Right to Education and land legislation laws, their implementation is riddled with problems, activist   said here on Monday.

 Speaking at Manthan Samvaad on 'Transparency to Accountability in India's Democratic State', Dey , who is known for rallying to bring in RTI, pointed out that close to 80 lakh people file RTI applications every year across India and more than 60 people have lost their lives so far 'in pursuit of truth'.
 
 “Last week in MP, one more whistleblower was killed since there are no legal provisions to support whistle blowers -a bill has been passed but not enacted," said Dey.
 
 “In fact, one of the most important and powerful provisions of the RTI Act, Section 4, which deals with proactive disclosure, has not been implemented by successive governments. People must campaign for the government to implement this provision,“ he said, adding that despite the   being passed, the government is 'refusing' to implement it and wants to make some 'terrible' amendments.
 
 Nitin Pai, founder of Takshashila Institution, pointed to the ability to discern the truth as being extremely important today . Talking on 'Where the mind is without fear',   said, “Movement of fake news and narratives has become rampant throughout our society. One of the most important duties of parents is to teach their children how to discern the truth, spot fake news and search for facts on the internet. The ability to discern the truth is the single biggest gift that can be given to children."
 
 Stand-up comedian   had the audience in splits with his 40-minute-long act titled ' ' that took potshots at the government and touched upon serious issues such as the insistence on linking the Aadhaar card with all financial transactions and the 'antinational' sentiment that has emerged in our country today.
