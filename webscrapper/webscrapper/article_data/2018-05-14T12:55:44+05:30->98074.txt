 is no stranger to stunts and action adventure. The 50-year-old superstar is one of the fittest men in showbiz and he has a penchant to pull off difficult stunts with ease and at random, unrehearsed moments. Akshay took some time off his work trip in   and indulged in a zip line session in Cape Town on May 12. The actor was spotted effortlessly zipping on a line suspended above a valley in the South African forest. 

 
 Such was the ease with which Akshay grappled the zip line that he left his instructors and friends in awe. There is good reason why the actor is referred to as ‘khiladi’. He's showcased skills in activities like rappelling, parkour, sea diving, sky diving and much more. The actor is a true adventure enthusiast.

On the work front, Akshay is currently working on two highly anticipated films, 'Gold' and 'Kesari'. He'll also be seen in Rajinikanth’s '2.0' which releases later this year.
