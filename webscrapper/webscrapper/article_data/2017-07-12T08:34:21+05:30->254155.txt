CHARMINAR: Fearing that the people of Old City will not be able to access the Metro, after the area was left out of the initial rollout plans, citizen groups have launched protests. 

  While it has drawn flak from all corners of the Old City, the   (AIMS), accused the   of not being sincere to the people of their constituency and also alleged that they want to keep the city backward and that they are playing vote-bank politics. 
 
  The members of AIMS believe that travel will become very difficult for the Old City residents, who just depend on public transport for their daily commute. They also said that the roads in   and Sultan Bazaar were narrower than those in the Old City. They also raised the issue of widening the road for the six kilometres stretch from   to Falaknuma, stating that most of the properties are old and need to be demolished and reconstructed. They added that the owners will be willing to hand over properties at a reasonable amount. 
 
  In a statement, the AIMS stated that if the metro project is not begun by August 2017, it will lapse. The Old City will not be able to get connected to the rest of the city by metro rail. According to HMRL, the project is progressing at a brisk pace. It is expected to finish in a few months, except the 6 km stretch from MGBS to Falaknuma. Owaisi however had lashed out at L&T and HMRL on Twitter for changing the original alignment which was supposed to pass through Salar Jung Museum, Charminal, Shalibanda, Shamnseergunj, Jungampet and end at Falaknuma after MGBS.
