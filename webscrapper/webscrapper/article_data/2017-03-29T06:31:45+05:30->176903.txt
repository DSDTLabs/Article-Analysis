CHENNAI: Vinod Rajagopalan has always been fascinated that the state of sleep offers endless possibilities.

 That’s why many of the 26-year-old self-taught artist’s works has sleep as their central theme. And his work will now be part of an art show that aims to create awareness on the  .
 
 “I am fascinated by sleep and dreams, and how you can achieve anything in that state,” says Rajagopalan, who is working on an acrylic on canvas on the topic.
 
 ‘Sleep Soundly, Nurture Life’ is the theme of an art exhibition being organised by Splatter Studio, in association with Nithra Institute of  , to commemorate World Sleep Day, observed on March 17. The idea is to create awareness on the importance of good sleep to lead a healthy life.
 
 The idea for the show took shape when Dr N Ramakrishnan, director of Nithra, contacted Splatter Studio director Senthil Ram to see if awareness about sleep could be created through art. “When we spoke, I realised how lack of sleep has become a lifestyle disorder. Not many people are aware of the consequences of lack of sleep,” says Ram, who came up with the concept.
 
 “We are inviting artists of all age groups to send in their paintings and photographs with the title ‘Sleep’. The artworks have to be of A3 size,” Ram says, adding that they have received about 20 pieces of art and 18 photographs so far.
 
 Each artist can submit only one entry. The last date to send in a piece is April 7, Ram says. The works will be curated for an art show, which will be inaugurated on April 12 and be on display till May 16. The displayed artworks will also be available for sale.
 
 “When people walk into the institute see the works of art, we will distribute pam-phlets and brochures focussing on sleep disorders. This will help create awareness among the public about the importance of sleep,” Nithra manager, operations, Mary Isabel says.
