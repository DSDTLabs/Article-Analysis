The families of 14 Patidar victims killed in police firing have not got justice. Cases were registered against 22,000 innocent Patidars. Patidar women were beaten and abused, but still no justice has been done. At the Patidar Panchayat, it was also decided to demand a special session of the assembly to discuss these atrocities.”
 
 “I will write to the CM and the speaker, requesting them to convene a special session to discuss the long pending issue of justice to the Patidar community. If they will not do it, the Congress and the Patidar community will keeping fighting for justice,” Dhanani added.
 
 Gujarat BJP president   said, “The Congress is desperate to grab power through division of castes. Congress tried to regain lost ground by calling a gathering of their supporters a ‘Patidar Panchayat’. There was not a single Patidar institution at the panchayat. Despite getting a lesson during the state assembly elections, the Congress is again trying to mislead Patidars ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, but that will not happen.”
