CHANDIGARH: Three years back, the   got an approval to start its own   This store was to offer 50% discount on most of the medicines including the branded and non-branded products. However, recently a tender has been opened for the storage house of the pharmacy and shall take another three months to complete. This has delayed the Rs 15 crore project, which is most awaited by the patients for affordable health care. 

 “We were supposed to complete the pharmacy store by the start of this year. However, it has been delayed by the engineering department,” said Dr Arvind  , chairman of the pharmacy project. 
 
 The medicine outlet is being set up at the   centre where the drugs will be dispensed. The store where the medicine is being made is near the drug de-addiction centre. Expressing his ignorance about the reason for the delay, Rajwanshi said, “It has been tendered again. I am not aware why the work was halted.”
 
 The plan is to set up a pharmacy and if it’s a successful model, other such stores shall be set up for centres like the cardiac centre and the trauma centre. Currently, there are a total of 15 chemist shops on the PGI campus paying rents as high as Rs 80 lakh per month. 
 
 Also, there are several outlets of AMRIT (Affordable Medicines and Reliable Implants for Treatment) where medicines are available at a discount ranging from 30% to 60%. “With our own pharmacy, the discounts will be higher as we will not engage with any middleman,” said Rajwanshi. 
 
 The medicines will be procured directly from the manufacturers which will lower the cost and offer more than 50% discount. The project was already delayed by 4 months and has again been granted an extension. “There should be a penalty for the delay. The cost escalates with each passing deadline everytime,” said an administrative officer in PGI.
