VADODARA: The sessions court rejected anticipatory bail plea of one of the accused, who looted Bharuch-based businessman of Rs 2.25 crore.

 Vijaysinh Baria, an accomplice of the prime accused   alias Vicky Kahar, had applied for anticipatory bail earlier last week. During the hearing, additional public prosecutor R M Bhavsar opposed the bail on the grounds that Baria’s role in the said crime is evident since beginning.
 
 Police affidavit said that when Kahar went to meet the complainant Minal   near   over-bridge, Baria was present with him. The affidavit had also mentioned that Baria was also carrying a weapon with him when the accused looted Shah.
 
 The public prosecutor also argued in the court that the investigation of the case is on and involvement of several persons have cropped up. 
 
 The police have interrogated Kahar and his two brothers Umang and Smit alias Shakti during which Baria’s involvement in the crime had become evident. It was argued in the court that Baria’s custodial interrogation is necessary.
 
 While rejecting the bail application, additional sessions judge A L Vyas observed that if a conditional bail is given there is a possibility that the accused will influence other accomplices. 
 
 Kahar and six to seven other persons including Baria had allegedly looted Shah of Rs 2.25 crore on November 19 last year after promising him of exchanging invalidated notes. Kahar and his two brothers are currently behind bars.
