Surat: The Regional Transport Office (RTO) has decided to carry out an inquiry into the alleged role of automobile dealers for taking extra money to fit high security registration plate (HSRP) in two and four-wheelers. 

 It is alleged that dealers are charging Rs 300 for HSRP in two-wheelers against the prescribed fee of Rs 140, while in four-wheelers they are charging anything between Rs 1,200 and 1,500 as against the official fee of Rs 400. 
 
 As per the official data, around 10,000 new two-wheelers are registered every month and 10,000 cars in three months. At present, the vehicle population in city is pegged at 29 lakh, which includes more than 17 lakh two-wheelers. 
 
 The RTO has appointed automobile dealers in the city as ‘deemed RTO’ for installation of HSRP plates on the vehicles. Officials said the vehicle owners are not coming to the RTO for fitting HSRP due to long wait in the appointment cycle and queues. The work is performed by automobile dealers at the showroom itself. 
 
 Recently, the state government’s transport department issued a directive to the automobile dealers to take up the process of HRSP fitment and registration in a single day. However, many automobile dealers are charging hefty money from the customers in the name of HSRP and registration of vehicles at the showroom. 
 
 Sources said the RTO authorities have started surprise checking at dealers’ showroom to check the reality. 
 
 “We have started surprise checking drive at various automobile dealers appointed as deemed RTO. There is a clear cut directive from the government not to charge extra money to the customers coming for fitment of HSRP. We will ensure that the rates of HSRP are displayed at showrooms for customers to know,” a RTO officer said.
