CHANDIGARH: The   syndicate has extended the term of the current Panjab   ( ) by two months so that it completes its investigation in the   complaint against Panjab University vice-chancellor Prof Arun Kumar Grover. The term was to expire on July 31 but now has been extended to September 30. 

 This was decided when a letter sent to Venkata Sastry Yedla, director, department of higher education, MHRD, by PU on July 10, informing him about the chancellor’s decision directing PUCASH to probe the sexual harassment complaint, was tabled for information in the syndicate meeting on Sunday. The university had informed the MHRD that chancellor M Hamid Ansari had asked PUCASH to probe the sexual harassment complaint against the vice-chancellor. 
 
 It was stated by the syndicate in its last meeting that the chancellor had decided that the sexual harassment complaint against the PU vice-chancellor should be probed by PUCASH instead of a special committee recommended by the syndicate. The syndicate in its previous meeting had decided that the PU registrar should take clearance from the MHRD as well inform it about the chancellor’s decision. 
 
 The PU faculty member had alleged sexual harassment and misbehaviour by Grover when she had visited his office to congratulate him on the extension of his tenure. She had sent a complaint to PU chancellor Hamid Ansari in April 2015.
 
 The new committee formed was to come into effect from August 1 to July 31, 2019. However, now the syndicate has given it an extension of two months. After the syndicate approves the name, the final nod will be given to the PU senate. 
 
 Moreover, a four-member committee comprising syndicate member Prof Pam Rajput, PU professor Ameer Sultana, syndicate members Prof Navdeep Goyal and Prof Dalip Kumar was formed in the matter regarding Dr Neelam Paul. The committee will approach the professor to persuade her to apologise to the vice-chancellor.
