NEW DELHI: The case relating to alleged suicide of an   will be heard by a fresh bench of   as one of the judges hearing the matter recused from the case on Tuesday.

 A bench of Justices G S Sistani and Vinod Goel had earlier expressed concern over the alleged suicide, saying it appeared that there was a communication gap between the student and the people close to him.
 
 The court had also remarked that it found it hard to “believe that a 20-year-old boy ends his precious life just because he was allegedly not allowed to sit for his semester exam, due to shortfall in attendance”.
 
 Sushant Rohilla, a third-year law student, allegedly hanged himself at his home in Delhi on August 10, 2016, and his family and friends said he took the step because the university had barred him from sitting for his semester exams due to inadequate attendance.
 
 The Supreme Court had on September 5, 2016 taken cognisance of a letter written by a friend of Rohilla. The apex court said it will examine if there was an “element of suspicion” that the incident could have taken place due to “harassment”.
 
 Later on March 6, SC transferred the matter to the Delhi HC to decide it on merit. Acting on the apex court’s direction, the HC had issued notice to the Indraprastha University, to which the institution is affiliated, saying it too is a necessary party.
