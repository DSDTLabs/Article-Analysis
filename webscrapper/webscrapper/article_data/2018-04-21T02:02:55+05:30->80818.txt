NEW DELHI: Defending its decision of not conducting a   of the leaked Class X mathematics paper, the Central Board of Secondary Education on Friday told the Delhi high court that the decision was taken after doing a trend analysis of science, maths and English papers.

 In view of the   impact of the  , the board took a considered decision not to put lakhs of students in difficulty over a re-test of maths, it said.
 
 Taking note of the stand, a bench of justices Gita Mittal and C Hari Shankar asked why a petitioner student, who filed a plea seeking re-conduct of the exam, is insisting on his demand.
 
 “How is your client (student) affected with the decision of not conducting a re-test. When you are asking for such a radical relief, you have to see it in an overall perspective...They have done a trend analysis of not only maths paper but also science and English to see there are   spikes of leakage," the bench told the lawyer for the student.
 
 It listed the matter for next hearing on July 23, while noting that the petition is silent on what kind of prejudice has been caused to the student who wants a re-test. On its part   also placed before HC the records relating to the board’s decision not to conduct the re-examination.
 
 The court had earlier dismissed a plea seeking rescheduling of the re-examination of the Class XII economics paper, which the CBSE has decided to conduct on April 25, following an alleged leak.
