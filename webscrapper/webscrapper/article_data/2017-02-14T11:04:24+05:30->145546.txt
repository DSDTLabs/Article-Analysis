Nagpur: Despite loud noise about better coordination between MSEDCL and forest officials, poaching of wildlife by electrocution continues unabated.

 A slot bear was electrocuted in a farm in Tilli ( ) in Goregaon forest range under Gondia division. The spot falls in the buffer zone of   (NNTR). The incident occurred two days ago but came to light on Sunday.
 
 All the body parts including heart, teeth, gall bladder, nails, and kidney of the bear were removed and the carcass was burnt to destroy evidence. Also in Goregaon, a bag full of animal bones was also found in a well on Monday in Palewada area.
 
 Goregaon RFO SM Jadhav said he suspected sloth bear body parts must have been removed under belief that they have medicinal properties. “We are investigating all angles,” he said.
 
 “Poaching of sloth bear is rampant in several pockets of Vidarbha, especially around Nagzira. Its body parts are used by tantriks (black magic performers) under beliefs that they have medicinal properties,” said Gondia honorary wildlife warden  . “Forest department should also share blame for such incidents as they do not expedite crop damage compensation cases,” he added.
 
 This is not the first case in Goregaon. On February 1 last year a sloth bear was poached and its body parts removed before the carcass was dumped in an open well. On January 25 this year, another sloth bear was electrocuted and its legs chopped off in a farm in Pandhari near Paratwada (Amravati). On January 13, a tigress and two sambars were electrocuted in a farm in Khapa range.
 
 Tall claims of better coordination made by   and forest department and various agencies at a regional level meeting on January 25 in Nagpur notwithstanding, nothing is being done on the ground. The buffer zone of Nagzira continues to remain under the control of territorial department whose priority is not wildlife management.
