Vijayawada: Information technology minister Nara   took the pledge on Thursday that the TDP government in the state will leave no stone unturned to transform Vijayawada into a   city in next three years. He said that a retaining wall would come up in Krishnalanka before the 2019 elections so that the flow of Krishna water will not get disturbed.

 Addressing a review meeting of TDP city east constituency, Lokesh assured the cadre and leaders that the government would focus on developing the city in every possible manner. The city has seen a lot of progress in the last three years. “We will take a decision soon on house pattas and improve the drainage system,” he said.
 
 Street-lighting system in the constituency will be solved within 10 days, the minister said, expressing dissatisfaction over the fact that 28 % of the invitees skipped the annual conclave, Mahandau.
 
 Coming down heavily on the Opposition, Lokesh said that communists are anti-development and they try to stall every work. “They are responsible for Vijayawada’s lagging behind and say nothing remarkable has happened in the city during their regime. Some other parties are also trying to divide people in the name of caste and religion. Even they can create a gap between me and my father,’’ he rued.
 
 Reacting to the busting of Tollywood drug rackets, he echoed the TDP’s stand is that the offenders should be punished.
