PATNA: Police will move the court on Monday to seek permission for narco analysis test of three suspects in the Raunak   kidnapping and murder case.

 City SP (East) Vishal Sharma said police will conduct narco analysis test of former Fatuha RJD MLA Om Prakash Paswan’s son Parshuram Paswan, a contractor   and Mohammad Tehseen alias Bittu, owner of a sim card shop in   area. On Saturday, police took fingerprints of Vicky, Parshuram, Jairam, Tehseen and one Pradeep Kumar after court’s permission.
 
 Raunak, a Class IX student, was kidnapped from a place near his Maurya Vihar Colony residence in Kumrahar on January 17 when he was on way to catch his school bus. Later, his body was recovered from Shubham Sringar and   at   in Kumrahar on January 19. Shopowner Vicky Paswan (19) was arrested for his alleged involvement in the case. Later, police also arrested his cousin Ankit Paswan (20), who was allegedly involved in making ransom calls to Raunak’s family.
 
 “Jairam is a contractor. He works for Raunak’s father Sudhir Kumar, a property dealer. Tehseen is the person from whose shop the sim card used in making ransom calls was sold,” the SP said. However, as per law, the consent of the suspects will be necessary before conducting the narco analysis test on them.
 
 The SP said Pradeep is the brother of a labourer, Dilip Kumar, who also works for Sudhir. “Sudhir suspects the involvement of Jairam as the latter had taken Rs1.5 lakh from him which he did return,” he said.
 
 Sharma also said he would submit the supervision report of the SIT formed by Patna zonal IG Nayyar Hasnain Khan in the case before Wednesday.
