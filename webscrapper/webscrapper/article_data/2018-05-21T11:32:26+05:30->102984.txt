CHANDIGARH: One former Haryana chief minister was cooling his heels in jail, while another is set to land in prison, Chief Minister   on Sunday said, in a veiled attack on his predecessor  .

 Khattar made the remark during a function organised to mark the   at Safidon in Jind district, according to an official release.
 
 “While one former chief minister (Om Prakash Chautala) is cooling his heels in jail (in the teachers recruitment scam), another ex-chief minister is set to go to jail,” he said, without naming Congress leader Hooda.
 
 On Saturday too, while speaking at a function here,   had trained guns on Hooda over various alleged scams that took place during the Congress tenure and have been unearthed now. “Some scams committed during the Congress regime are now coming to light through the Supreme Court and the high court,” he had claimed.
 
 The Chief Minister today said that since the inception of Haryana, various governments were formed in the state but none could claim that they stayed away from corruption.
 
 “In sharp contrast, during the three-and-a-half years of the present government, there have been no allegations of any scandals against any minister or MLA... I can say confidently that the present government has uplifted the living standards of the people and made efforts to change the direction of the society for the better,” he said.
 
 Later interacting with the villagers of Munak in Karnal district, Khattar said the responsibility for implementing the Swaminathan Commission report rested with former chief minister Hooda, who was then chairman of the working group of Chief Ministers on agriculture production, set up on agriculture.
 
 “But he (Hooda) did not do anything during his time and kept pretending to be a leader of the farmers,” Khattar said, adding his government has worked for the farmers during the last three-and-a-half years.
