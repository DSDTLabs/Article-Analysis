LUCKNOW: A week after the 12-year-old alleged rape survivor was sent to a women's shelter home on  , her mother has not returned to meet her. 

 The survivor, officials claim, is desperate to go back home in  's   area. With the family failing to turn up, the process to give the child born to her up for adoption has not yet been initiated. 
 
 The survivor, whose eight-day-old son was sent to the state-run children's shelter home on January 3, has not been visited by any of her family members. The indifference, officials said, has persisted even after constant communication to the mother of the minor.
 
 "She has been crying for her mother and to go back home. At times, she has even refused food. We made several rounds of communication to both the mother and the older brother, but for a week, they have not checked on her even once," said   ( ) member Sangeeta  . 
 
 On January 30, the girl had given birth to a boy child at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia hospital and showed unwillingness to keep the child. The survivor's mother had also denied wanting to keep the newborn with them. The next day, the girl was sent to the women's shelter home for counselling and strengthening her health. The child was sent to the children's shelter home. 
 
 "Written consent from the survivor's mother is needed for surrendering the child," added Sharma.
 
 The minor was allegedly raped by her 25-year-old neighbour last year.
