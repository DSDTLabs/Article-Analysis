NAVI MUMBAI:   (MIDC) has decided to revamp and expand the capacity of the   (CETP) at Taloja MIDC. The   CETP has a capacity of 22.5MLD and the industries representatives want it to be upgraded to 27.5MLD. A US-based company has been contracted for studying the design, development and modification of the CETP.

 Rajesh Zanzad, MIDC superintending engineer, said nine other CETPs will also be studied similarly. “The detailed project report will be prepared with suggested modifications to cater to the industries’ demands. This is a change from national level consultancy to international level consultancy to study details such as plant health, modification, expansion,” he added.
 
 The other CETPs include Ambernath, Badlapur, Dombivli, Tarapur, Kagal in Kolhapur and Butibori in Nagpur. Zanzad added, “The company will take six months to prepare a detailed project report. Another three months will be required for tendering.”
