MOHALI: The Saturday-night squall caused a 12-hour blackout in eight sectors of this town when the violent gusts of wind snapped a 64-kilovolt overhead transmission line in Phase V.

 Left without electricity from 10.30pm on Saturday to Sunday noon, residents of Phases VII, VIII, IX, and X, besides Sectors 66, 67, 68, and 69, had a sleepless night. Electricity department superintending engineer (SE) H S Oberai said: “The main power transmission line had snapped in Phase V, due to the fast winds on Saturday night, probably. We were busy all night in replacing the high-tension wires, a job we finished by 11:30am on Sunday. It was a breakdown. There are no power cuts in Mohali, since the state is power surplus now.”
 
 The department says the power outages these days are because of the overloading of the lines. “In this scorching heat, the load on the transformers and the rest of the power infrastructure is so enormous that both trip, burn, and stall commonly,” an official said.
