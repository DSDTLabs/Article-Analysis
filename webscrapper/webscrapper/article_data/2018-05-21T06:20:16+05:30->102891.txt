MUMBAI: The price of petrol in Mumbai touched a historical high of Rs 84.07 per litre on Sunday and will, with yet another marginal increase of 33 paise, reach Rs 84.40 on Monday. Similarly, the diesel price which touched Rs 71.94 per litre on Sunday, will reach a new high of Rs 72.21on Monday.

 
 These record price levels come on the back of fuel retailers raising prices every day after resuming daily revision from May 14, two days after the   elections got over. They had stopped revising prices since April 24, ahead of the state polls, after the government informally nudged them to hold the price line.
 
  
  
 
 The prices of fuel in Mumbai are the highest in the country as   levies a surcharge on fuel (Rs 9 per litre for petrol and Re 1 on diesel) over and above the VAT, which is 26% on petrol and 24% on diesel.
 
 With the continuous rise in fuel prices, private transporters have decided on a 25-30% increase in tariff from June 1. The   and the   taxi operators, in a statement, said, “We have decided to revise our fares by 25% to 30% across all segments of commercial vehicles, including school buses and tourist taxis. This is due to increase in the fuel price which is increasing every day.”
 
 Harsh Kotak, general secretary of   Malak Sangathna, said, “The last hike was done two years ago when the charges were increased by 10%. The fuel prices are too high and we have plans to bring revised tariff from June 1. This will include buses hired by corporates, buses taken for events per day, private transport vehicles hired on per day basis and fares of intercity buses.”
 
 Meanwhile, Union oil minister Dharmendra   on Sunday raised hopes of the government cutting excise duty to soften the impact of bubbling oil prices. “The Centre is sensitive towards the rising fuel prices. Various alternatives are being explored. I hope something will work out soon,” Pradhan told reporters in Bhubaneswar in response to questions on runaway pump prices.
