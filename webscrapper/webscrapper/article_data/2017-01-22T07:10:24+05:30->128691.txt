LUCKNOW: Four-time MLA and Mulayam loyalist   served as cabinet minister in two   regimes. The veteran leader was upset with the way party treated him after Akhilesh Yadav’s coronation as the national president and denied him ticket for the assembly elections.

 “I have been with Mulayam since November 1992 and won assembly elections in 1993, 1996, 2002 and 2007. This is not how party loyalists should be treated,” he told TOI after joining the BSP. Chaudhary said he always stood with Mulayam Singh Yadav and never joined parties for getting ministerial berths.
 
  Not surprisingly, Chaudhary, who enjoys considerable political clout in his home district Ballia, was perhaps the only leader besides Shivpal Yadav and   who accompanied Mulayam to the Election Commission during the hearings related to the battle over party’s name and symbol.
 
 “I have been in the party’s national executive for the past 10 years and was a member of SP’s central parliamentary board that was constituted by Mulayam Singh Yadav. But with the change of guard at the top, the party denied me a ticket this time,” he said, adding that though he lost the 2012 assembly elections, it cannot undermine the fact that he had won four previous assembly polls.
