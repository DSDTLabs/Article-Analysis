AHMEDABAD: When the @CPAhmedabad   handle posted images of Pablo Escobar from the online series Narcos on March 31, with cryptic messages about missing liquor bottles many did a double take to make certain it was the official Twitter handle of city police. However, the handle really went viral the next day, with it announced that ‘free seized beer’ would be distributed at city police headquarters. The tweet was re-tweeted 155 times and liked 185 times, (as on Thursday night) as many enjoyed the ‘April Fool’ gag.

 However, the handle changed gears and got down to serious business the next day, on April 2, when many parts of the city witnessed unrest as part of the Bharat Bandh. About 50 tweets gave citizens updates on the situation in various parts of the city. 
 
 Over the following three days, the handle had a go at spreading awareness about traffic issues, PCR functioning and live Twitter assistance for designated hours. The average tweet impression has passed 1 lakh, said  , who is helping city police with the handle.
 
 Vipul  , additional CP (administration), said netizens had long made requests to raise city police’s online presence and connect with citizens via Twitter. “We decided to revive our Twitter handle and gauge the citzens’ expectations and response. We are happy with the feedback so far,” he said.
 
 Aggarwal admitted that engagement is still at a nascent stage as they cannot take all complaints through the micro-blogging site or keep it functioning round-the-clock. “However, we have decided to go live from 4pm to 5.30pm every week day, when citizens can post issues where police can help them, ranging from traffic to law and order,” he said.
 
 City police officials said that while all major Indian police forces are active on Twitter, they want to make a mark through live events, though limited, and give citizens a peek into how the police functions.
