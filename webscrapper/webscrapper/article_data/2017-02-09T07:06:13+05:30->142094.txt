BHUBANESWAR/BERHAMPUR: As politicking intensified ahead of panchayat polls over the murder of a BJP worker in Dhenkanal district, oil minister   demanded CBI probe into the political violence. After meeting the bereaved family members of slain BJP worker Salman Rout at Tarabha village, Pradhan said the state election commissions proposal for Crime Branch probe is an eyewash. 

 "Why is the chief minister   silent? He should immediately hand over the murder case to CBI for free and fair investigation," Pradhan told media persons. He said the Crime Branch cannot probe the case fairly. Earlier, the BJP had demanded crime branch probe and organised a 12-hour Dhenkanal bandh.
 
 Rout, 23, was shot dead at his native village Tarabha on February 4. Police arrested main accused Byomkesh Biswal, a constable, a day after the incident. However, the opposition political parties are seeking arrest of the other accused.
 
 "What is Routs fault? He was pasting BJP posters. Victory and defeat are part of an election. But there should be no place of violence in the democracy. BJD resorted to violence," Pradhan said, indicating alleged involvement of BJD behind Rout's murder. 
 
 "It was a brutal murder. Police personnel assaulted female family members of the deceased when they went to receive his body. People should give a befitting reply to BJD as lawlessness hit the nadir during Naveen Patnaiks regime," Pradhan said on the sidelines of addressing a rally at Kanishi near Berhampur.
 
 On Tuesday, the SEC recommended the home department to order a Crime Branch probe into Rout's death. BJP earlier held statewide demonstrations demanding probe into role of steel and mines minister  . 
 
 BJD spokesperson   said opposition parties should not politicize the issue. "The state election commission has already recommended Crime Branch probe. Let the probe be complete. It has become habit of opposition parties to blame BJD on ever issue," Satpathy said.
