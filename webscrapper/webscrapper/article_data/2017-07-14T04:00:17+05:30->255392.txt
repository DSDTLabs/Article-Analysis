Mumbai: Doctors at the BMC-run Cooper   in Juhu successfully removed a   from a year-old girl’s   on Tuesday without operating on her.

 Rukaiya Khan from Jogeshwari had swallowed a pendant and was gasping for breath when her mother rushed her to the hospital. An X-ray revealed that the pendant was stuck in the food pipe. The toddler was wailing and restless.
 
 The ENT department head Dr Shashikant Misal with Dr Vinod Gite performed an endoscopic procedure to remove the pendant. During the procedure, a tube-like structure with a camera is inserted in the mouth and used to examine the digestive tract.
 
 The doctors said that the pendant had sharp edges that posed a challenge during the procedure. “The pendant could also have caused poisoning in the food pipe due to various chemical coatings on it,” said doctors. 
 
 “Hyperactivity among kids is common and the parents need to be vigilant and precautious to avoid such accidents, said Dr Gite.
 
 The girl has been discharged and is doing fine now.
