CHANDIGARH: Thousands of people living in the homes built by   (CHB) gathered in Sector 47 here on Sunday to launch a campaign for permanent solutions to their problems. 

 Since the Congress was busy in its Plenary Session in Delhi and the   with the RSS ( ) Shivir in Chandigarh, both parties could not send their top leaders to the rally, but they sent their endorsement letters to the federation, expressing solidarity with the campaign and assuring full support.
 
 Three political leaders present on the occasion were former Union minister Harmohan Dhawan, Hardeep Singh, and former mayor Harjinder Kaur of the   (SAD). The federation's representatives demanded that the new annual penalty be dropped, as Chandigarh Housing Board was to be blamed for letting people make additions/alterations to houses for whatever reasons. "Now 90% of the populatino was guilty of violations," said a protester.
