BENGALURU: The   -Arogya Karnataka - has been launched but several questions remain unanswered. As per the government order, the state will bear costs up to Rs 1.5 lakh and an additional Rs 50,000 per family per annum, and the rest must be paid by the patient. However, the private sector has raised financial concerns and questioned the rider that accompanies the scheme. 

 "Patients' families will be left in the lurch as they can't be beneficiaries of   if they are availing any other scheme. If the bill exceeds Rs 1.5 lakh, the patient will end up paying from his/her pocket. How is it a cashless healthcare facility," asked a doctor from the Private Hospital and Nursing Homes' Association (PHANA). 
 
 Though the scheme accommodates everyone, notwithstanding their financial status, it comes with the rider that the patient has to first avail treatment at a government hospital and can be referred to a private-empanelled hospital only if the treatment is unavailable at the government facility.
 
 Dr Nagendra Swamy S C, chief coordinator,   providers (FHP), feels the referral system will only add to the chaos. "If all was well with government hospitals, why would people go to private ones? Getting a referral letter from government hospital authorities to shift the patient to an empanelled private hospital will be easier said than done and could lead to corruption," he said 
 
 He added the scheme covers only surgical intervention whereas in many cases like dengue, treatment require only medical management. "The scheme will neither help patients nor hospitals," he said. Healthsector leaders said they will meet officials once the government communicates to private hospitals about the scheme. Health cards will be issued at 10 select government hospitals from Monday.
