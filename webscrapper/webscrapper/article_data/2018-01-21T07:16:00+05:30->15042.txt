Chandigarh: Panjab University Lab and Technical Staff Association (PULTSA) will submit their demands in a charter to the senate members before the meeting on Sunday. The technicians are vying for a change in the promotion policy of the technical staff.

 Kapil Kumar Kaushal, president of PULTSA said, “There is 100% internal promotion policy from grade-IV technicians to grade I. Due to the current policy, the group I and group II positions are not given to internal employees. The University should take steps to promote the technical cadre.”
 
 He further told that following a fire incident in the administrative block, the service books of many employees got burnt.
 
 “Most of the employees have submitted duplicate service books along with a certified copy of original service books. They are yet to be verified and audited even after eight months of occurrence of the incident,” said Kaushal.
 
 “The pay scales of workshop instructors, superintendents, computer operators and technical staff have not been increased since 2012,” stated Kaushal.
