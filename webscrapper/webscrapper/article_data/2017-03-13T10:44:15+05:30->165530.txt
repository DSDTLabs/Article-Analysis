LUCKNOW: In what is being seen as a precursor to the rumblings that may rock the   in the aftermath of the recent Yadav family feud, senior leader   has put out a video clip on social media proclaiming "war for victory" in his struggle for existence. 

 Of 40-second duration, the video on Shivpal's Twitter handle has a carefully worded title: " Hum Jeet Kar Hare Hain ...Hum Phir Ladkar Jeetenge" (I won my election but the party lost...We will fight again and win the battle). But what is more telling is the voice-over grab from the film 'Pink' where superstar Amitabh Bachchan recites a couplet questioning the authority of the "sinners" to question a person of high moral values. 
 
 During the family feud, Akhilesh had targeted uncle Shivpal for his role in the entire crises. They were pitted against each other in the battle for supremacy. 
 
  Shivpal had hit out at his cousin and SP MP Ram Gopal Yadav - who had sided with Akhilesh during the Pari-war - accusing him of patronizing MLAs and party leaders indulging in illegal acts. 
 
 The couplet says, " Charitra jab pavitra hai, to kyun hai yeh dasha teri; yeh papiyon ko haq nahin ki lein pariksha teri" 
 
  Another couplet, which goes with visuals of Shivpal's contribution to establishing the party and the support he enjoys among cadre, the voice-over is about Shivpal and his fresh efforts to establish himself in SP. " Tu khud ki khoj mein nikal, tu kis liye hataash hai; tu chal tere wajood ki samai ko bhi talash hai ".
