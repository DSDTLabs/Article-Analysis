NEW DELHI: A 65-year-old man was   dead at his shop in Begampur, Rohini, on Friday afternoon. 

 Ratan Lal Chauhan’s son had been murdered last year in front of his wife’s eyes. Thereafter, considering the threat perception, a court had assigned 24/7 security to the Chauhans in the form of a PSO. 
 
 A constable would keep watch over the family at all times, working in shifts. On Friday, though, the PSO on duty left early before another constable could replace him. 
 
 At the shop, two armed assailants came on a motorbike around 2pm, opened fire at Chauhan, and scooted. A few people tried to stop them from fleeing but were unsuccessful. The PSO who left early has been suspended pending inquiry. But police are trying to find out if he was complicit in the plot to bump off the elder Chauhan. 
 
 Chauhan’s son Gaurav had been killed in March last year. He was friends with one Manjit Thakran and had taken a loan of Rs 1.5 lakh from him to set up a business. But when he didn’t return the money after several months, Thakran started getting aggressive. Both friends fell apart and regularly had tiffs. Then Thakran decided to eliminate Gaurav. 
 
 On March 31, 2016, Thakran invited Gaurav for dinner. The family knew about the rift so they didn’t let Gaurav go alone: his mother accompanied him. After dinner, Thakran shot Gaurav thrice and fled from his own house. He was later arrested. 
 
 But fearing for their life, Chauhan and his wife sought for state protection and got it. 
 
 “Strict action will be taken against constable Jagat Singh, the PSO, or other police officers for dereliction of duty,” said DCP (Rohini) Rishi Pal.
