PANAJI: The   (GHRDC) is contemplating installing a cage at the   and Hospital (GMC),  , to tackle the rooster menace.

 “The cage will prevent the roosters from wandering around the hospital. Placing the birds within it will also not hurt the religious sentiments of devotees,” GHRDC general manager (security)  , who recommended the solution, said. 
 
 Relying on the belief that a dead person’s soul remains in the control of the folk deity, relatives of deceased Hindu patients at the GMC offer roosters to please the deity in the hope that the souls will be released. In other cases, roosters are also offered once a patient has recovered.
