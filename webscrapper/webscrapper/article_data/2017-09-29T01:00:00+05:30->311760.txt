You might not remember the entire storyline of 'Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela' or 'Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam', but you will surely remember what   wore in 'Nimbooda Nimbooda' and   in 'Nagada Sang Dhol Baaje'. With dandiya and garba nights the highlight of the Navaratras, and dandiya parties extending long after the nine days are over, the search for the perfect lehenga-choli, jhumka and bangles can be never-ending. The celebrations are somewhat incomplete without the traditional Gujarati skirts and the pretty cholis with beautiful mirror-work. However, if you don't know the right places to go shopping, it can get quite tiresome. But don’t worry, we are here to help, and the one place you just can't miss when shopping for a dandiya night is the   in Janpath. While shopping here is not exactly cheap, if you have good bargaining skills, you can get great deals.

  You will not only find the lehengas you were looking for, but you’ll also be able to get your hands on the traditional chaniya-choli as well as the accessories that go with it. The price range of the lehenga may vary depending on the intricacy of the designs or the work on the piece, but if your bargaining skills are something you're proud of, then you are sure to find a decent outfit at around Rs3,000.

 Though the shopkeepers here are willing to bargain, they will not give you anything below Rs1,000, so plan accordingly. "The cheapest choli you will get here will be around Rs1,000 and it goes upto Rs6,500 and above. In one day, we sell around 13-14 chaniya-choli," says Pooja, a shopkeeper. 
 
  
  
 
  Arun, another shopkeeper from the same market, adds, "We have costumes for kids as well, and these start from Rs500. Log bachchon ke bhi costumes lete hain but zyada young log leke jaate hain."

 A Gujarati chaniya-choli is incomplete without that colourful silver choker or earrings. Here. you'll find that there are enough jewellery options to choose from. Gujarati-style chokers worth Rs700, bangles for Rs600, and jhumkas starting from Rs350 are only a few things from the jewellery collection that you can find in the market. If you're a fan of rings, then you can buy rings match your outfit for Rs1,200 from the market.
