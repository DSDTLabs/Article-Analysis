GURUGRAM:   met forest officials on Friday to draw the department’s attention towards the alleged tree felling for setting up petrol and   on NH-8 near Sector 15 (parts I &II).

 Reportedly, construction of a petrol pump and a CNG pump has started on service lanes in both Part I and II of Sector 15. 
 
 Residents alleged that trees have been cut in the green belt to clear land for the construction of the pumps between Rajiv Chowk and Signature Tower on NH-8.“Nearly 125 ancient trees have so far been cut in Sector 15 (part I). Trees are yet to be felled in part II of the sector yet. Here, some labourers have set up base and commenced construction of the petrol pump. We have also written to the deputy commissioner and CM’s office,” said Praveen Dagar, a resident of Sector 15.
 
 Shweta Bhargava, also from Sector 15 (Part II), raised another concern. “This service road is a high traffic density zone and construction of petrol and CNG pumps will lead to more congestion. These sites will also increase air and noise pollution in the area, affecting children and senior citizens, especially,” said the mother of two children. Experts have blamed the authorities for not taking strict action against those destroying green belts. “It is shocking to note that the Master Plan 2031 states that green belts are temporary in nature,” Vivek Kamboj, a city-based environmentalist. District forest officer Anand could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.
