CHENNAI:  's decision to step down as limited-overs captain shocked the whole cricket fraternity and former Indian skipper and ex-chairman of selector   was no exception. 

 “Frankly speaking I wasn't expecting this to happen so suddenly and it's even more surprising because Dhoni took the decision just before the home series against England,” Srikkanth, who was the chief selector when India won the World Cup in 2011 under Dhoni, told TOI on Wednesday. 
 
 However, Srikkanth said  , who has been captaining the Indian side in Tests for more two years, is ready to do the job in all three formats.
 
 “Dhoni has been one of the most successful captains in the world and winning two World Cups and a Champions Trophy within such a short span elevated him to a different level. He has been phenomenal. But I think Virat too has been doing a great job in the longer version and has already set high standard for himself. He is right man to lead the Indian side in all three formats and I'm sure he'll prove his mettle in the upcoming series against England,” the former India skipper added.
 
 Srikkanth felt Virat will have extra advantages as Dhoni will be there to guide him on the field. “It was the right approach by Dhoni to hand over the mantle to the best in the team. Great leaders always do that. You sometimes get tired of your responsibilities and want to pass on the baton to the next best guy so that you can fully concentrate on your game. Moreover, Dhoni may want to bat with more freedom and it'll only help the team,” he explained.
