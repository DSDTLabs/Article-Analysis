 Deepak K S, 29, manager of Salt pub, told police that the miscreant, who identified himself as Raghu, drove away with his   Verna from 100 Feet Road in Indiranagar on December 24, 2017.
 
 “Deepak was in urgent need of money and decided to sell his car. He placed an advertisement on  , an online ad platform. Raghu expressed interest in buying the car and met Deepak on 100 Feet Road around 12.30pm on December 24. He agreed to buy the car for Rs 8 lakh and even paid Rs 30,000 as advance before taking the vehicle for what he said was a test drive,” a police officer said.
 
 Deepak waited for an hour, but Raghu didn’t return with the car. When Deepak called Raghu, the latter said he had to rush somewhere due to an emergency and promised to return the car within two days. However, a week passed by but Raghu hadn’t returned the vehicle, though Deepak continued to call him. 
 
 “Raghu also threatened Deepak that he’d murder him if he repeatedly called him for the car. Deepak told Raghu that he’d file a police complaint, following which Raghu deposited Rs 14,500 into Deepak’s bank account on January 14. Raghu’s mobile phone remained switched off since then,” a police officer said, quoting from   on Saturday. Indiranagar police have registered a case of cheating and criminal intimidation against Raghu.
