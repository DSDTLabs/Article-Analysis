Amaravati: Dismissing the charge levelled by   president   in his letter to N   that AP has not been submitting utilization certificates, the CM said it was BJP that was running away and not responding to the challenge posed to it by   MP CM Ramesh on the issue. 

 “AP stands No.3 in the country when it comes to submitting utilization certificates. It’s time other political parties also took a clear stand on the Centre.” 
 
 “They have to decide on supporting a Central government that’s ignoring people of AP or the TDP which has been fighting for the people of the state,” he said.
 
 On Saturday, Naidu hit back with a vengeance after Amit Shah’s letter to him. Addressing the AP assembly, Naidu said: “TDP did not snap ties with the BJP for political considerations. In fact, it was BJP that did so in Telangana by parting ways with TDP without informing us. “We went to polls together in Telangana and AP, but Telangana BJP leaders unilaterally announced they will not tie up with the TDP for 2019 polls. Did we say anything on that? Amit Shah’s letter may be addressed to me, but it is an insult to the people of AP. 
 
 Contrary to his claims, AP did not get anything new or more than other states despite facing a difficult situation after bifurcation. In fact, you were just giving back taxes paid by the people of AP to us after taking your share.” 
 
 Naidu also blamed the Union government for asking him to float a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), while no such SPV was required for the NE states. “Why this discrimination? Why don’t you give us Central funds as you are giving to NE states and other SCS states,” he asked.
