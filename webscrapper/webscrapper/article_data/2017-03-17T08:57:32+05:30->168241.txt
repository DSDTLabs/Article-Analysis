VADODARA: Six persons including five candidates, who had applied as   in   were arrested for allegedly forging  . Two other candidates are absconding. 

 The complaint was registered by V H Joshi, police inspector of Vadodara   ( ), who was assigned the task of verification of the documents. Police said that the incident came to light on March 10 when D J Damor, an officer from tribal development department of the government, raised doubts about the caste certificate of Rakesh Damor, one of the candidates. 
 
 The forgery of certificate was confirmed after the records were cross-checked with the tribal development department. 
 
 Joshi told the police that the department had never issued any certificate to him. Meanwhile, on Wednesday documents of six more candidates were found to be forged during verification. Cops said that after arrest, Mohan Sukha Damor, Chehra Damor, Rajesh Pagi, Mohan Hira Damor and Sudhir Damor admitted to forgery. 
 
 They told the police that they had forged the documents after Arjan Damor, a resident of Khanpur taluka of Mahisagar, got them a fake stamp of tribal development officer. Arjan was also arrested by the police on Thursday. 
 
 A police official said that Arjan had given fake stamps to the candidates at prices varying between Rs 1,500 and Rs 3,000. 
 
 The police is investigating from where Arjan managed to get the stamp.
 
 Cops are suspecting that all seven candidates who had forged the certificates had conspired the crime since all of them are residents of Mahisagar.
