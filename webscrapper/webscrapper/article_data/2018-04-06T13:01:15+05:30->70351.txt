 Court seeks govt reply on fire safety steps
 
 High court has asked the state government what measures it is taking to avert fire incidents like the one happened at Vidhyadhar Nagar last year which claimed the life of five members of a family.
 
 The division bench issued the order while hearing a PIL by lawyer  . The court had earlier issued notice to the JMC.
 
 The petition said had the fire-fighting machinery been alert, the damage to life and property could have been averted. The petition further said a number of posts in fire department are lying vacant and employees are mostly hired on contract basis. They do not possess the necessary equipment and training to react in an emergency situation as was evident in the recent fire tragedy in Vidhyadhar Nagar on January 12.
