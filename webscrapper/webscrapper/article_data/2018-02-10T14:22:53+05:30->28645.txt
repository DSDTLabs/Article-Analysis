INDORE: Police on Friday solved the mystery behind a five-year-old murder and arrested a man and his two friends for strangulating his father for grabbing his ancestral property in   area.

 The accused had planned the murder and drove his father to Bisankheda village with his friends on pretext of showing him a farmland for purchase and later strangulated him in the jungles on March 31, 2013.
 
 Police had found body of Surendra Kumar Kataria, 60, a resident of Ashok Nagar, and registered a case of murder. His son, Tarun Kataria, who had lodged a missing complaint about his father, had identified the body.
 
 The investigators didn’t find any clue about the perpetrators of the crime till recently they got a tip-off about Tarun’s possible involvement in the crime.
 
 Police rounded him and he confessed having killed his father with the help of his friends Jitendra lias Jitu, 37, of Dwarkapuri and Nattu alias Shakir, 34, of Chandan Nagar.
 
 Tarun had often picked up fight with his father since childhood and was staying separate with his mother. After his mother’s death, he started living with his father, but could never have cordial relations with him.
 
 Tarun, who runs a mobile shop, got married to   Kataria around eight years ago and has a 6-year-old daughter. Sona had miscarriages twice after marriage and Tarun required money for treatment. Surendra had refused to help him.
 
 Tarun was fostering enmity when Jitendra gave him the idea of killing his father and becoming heir to the land and house. They cooked up the plan and drove Surendra on bikes to the designated spot, before they killed him.
 
 The accused took his purse and valuables and threw them over to the river at Kishanpura bridge.
 
 Police have arrested the accused and secured a remand from a local court.
