UDHAGAMANDALAM: The hills of Ooty reverberated as Veena player Rajesh Vaidhya and Anandan   played their best notes in the ongoing annual flower show. 

 The instrumental concert by the duo started with an all-time melody ‘Ilaya Nila...’ composed by Maestro Ilayaraja. The duo subsequently played pieces originally composed by Ilayaraja and A R Rahman. 
 
 Heart-flipping tunes of ‘Chinna chinna Aasai’ and ‘Netru Illatha matram ennathu’ by the duo received audience appreciation. Also, Sivamani kept the audience captivated with his 45 minute-long solo performance. 
 
 “It has been long time since we witnessed music concerts by stalwarts, such as Ilayaraja and MSV during the flower show. Over the years, the quality of cultural programmes during the summer season saw a dint,” L Rathika says, adding that the district administration has done a good job by bringing in few good cultural programmes instead of opting for more average talents.
 
 “The audience enjoyed the instrumental music show by the stalwarts. The administration should continue conducting quality cultural programmes in the coming years too,” H Prakash, another resident of Ooty feels
 
 The duo also performed a few numbers in front of Tamil Nadu chief minister,   and other ministers soon after the flower show was inaugurated.
