Trichy: The DMK has welcomed the Supreme Court's criticism of the Centre on the Cauvery issue for neither framing the scheme within six weeks as directed by it nor approaching it prior to March 31 for clarifications. However, it was a great disappointment for farmers in Tamil Nadu as the court had again asked the Centre to frame a draft scheme by May 3, said , the party working president and opposition leader M K Stalin. He said that the people of the state should observe April 12 as ‘Black Day’ — when Prime Minister Modi visited Chennai to inaugurate the Defence Exhibition — as a mark of protest on the Cauvery issue. He was in Thanjavur as part of his padayatra launched from Trichy on Saturday on a mission to ‘retrieve Cauvery’. Meanwhile, protest and agitations continue”d across the delta districts demanding to implement Supreme Court’s order on CMB. “When the entire Tamil community had totally lost their faith in the Centre, people trusted Supreme Court. However, it is a great disappointment that the court itself again asked the Centre to frame a draft", Stalin further stated. He also urged the governments to do the needful to get Tamil Nadu’s due share of water released from Karnataka. He further added that the Centre should withdraw a petition filed asking for explaining the word Scheme and should form Cauvery Management Board as per the earlier orders of the Supreme Court. While elaborating on their future course of action, the DMK leader said that after completing the padayatra on April 12, he would continue his rally towards Raj Bhavan. “The next course of action would be announced as per a decision to be taken at an all-party meeting", he added. Meanwhile, protest and agitations continued across the delta districts on Monday also. At Mukkombu in Trichy, over hundred farmers and functionaries of farming bodies formed a human chain across the Cauvery demanding the setting up of CMB.
