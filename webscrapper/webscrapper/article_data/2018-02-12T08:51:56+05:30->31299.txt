TRICHY: There was nothing in the Union budget to address the challenges in education, healthcare, agriculture and employment witnessed in the country in the last four years. Instead the budget was replete with grand announcements and schemes, said former Union finance minister P Chidambaram here on Sunday. Speaking at a budget analysis event organised by   (JIM) at St Joseph’s College here on Sunday, the Congress leader said that the budget had left major issues unaddressed.

 The former minister termed the announcements on national health protection, minimum support price and jobs as ‘jumlas’ (gimmicks). The budget would stand out in history for its three big jumlas over minimum support price (MSP) for farmers, job creation and health protection for 10 crore families, he said.
 
 Quoting chief economic adviser Dr Arvind Subramanian, Chidambaram said that he had clearly stated about the present state of education, healthcare, agriculture sector and employment. However, the budget had not paid heed to his recommendations, he alleged. 
 
 Finance minister   had announced that farmers would get the cost plus 50 per cent as MSP without clarifying as to what would be considered as cost. “When we say cost of production, it includes input cost, family labour, rent on land and interest of capital. These all put together are considered as cost of production”, Chidambaram said. The government was borrowing an additional Rs 85,000 crore not to meet capital expenditure but to meet revenue expenditure while cutting capital expenditure by Rs 36,000 crore. This, he said, was a double whammy.
 
 He said that petrol and diesel prices now were more than what they were in 2014 despite crude oil prices dropping significantly during the period. “The BJP-led government is sucking the people’s blood by continuously increasing excise duty on petrol and diesel prices”, he alleged.
