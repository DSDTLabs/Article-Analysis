MUMBAI: Seven months after the   government announced a  , it has disbursed Rs 12,362 crore into the accounts of 31 lakh farmers. This is just 53% of the Rs 23,102 crore which has been approved for the   by the state government so far.

 Of the total of Rs 12,362 crore, Rs 10,379 crore has been disbursed into the accounts of eligible farmers. A sum of 1,884 crore has been disbursed as incentives to those who have been regularly repaying loans. The slowest disbursal of Rs 18 crore so far has been for the one-time-settlement scheme, where the state pays off Rs 1.5 lakh to farmers who repay the rest of their loan worth more than that sum.
 
 The state government has approved the disbursal of Rs 23,102 crore into 47.73 lakh accounts so far after conducting a lengthy verification process. The figures were presented at a meeting of the cabinet sub-committee on the loan waiver on Tuesday.
 
 
  
  
 
 Defending the slow pace of disbursal, cooperation minister   said, “We are ensuring that the money goes to the right beneficiaries. And that there is transparency in the process. Not a single eligible farmer will be left out of the scheme.” He also said that farmers had been given a deadline of March 31 to clear loans for the one-time-settlement scheme.
 
 However, farmer groups say that large numbers of farmers have been excluded from the scheme on account of the tough eligibility norms imposed by the state. “The government had initially promised Rs 34,022 crore in the waiver scheme. Now, they are trying to wind up the scheme. The result is that farmers have not had their loans waived and they are not eligible for fresh loans. It is a very difficult situation,” said   of the Kisan Sabha.
