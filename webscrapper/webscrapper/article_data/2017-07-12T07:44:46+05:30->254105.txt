HYDERABAD: If statistics of the   (TSDRF) and   are anything to go by, the city has recorded 731 fire accidents in six months that claimed 17 lives.

 Officials from the department say that most accidents are caused by faulty wiring and electrical short-circuits in buildings. Another disturbing trend rearing its ugly face in the city are swanky cars, developing electrical faults and catching fire, said district fire officer (Hyderabad) M Srinivas Reddy .
 
 The city has the second highest number of fatalities after Khammam which recorded 20 deaths over the past one year. Ironically, the city not only figures in the list of the highest casualties, but also has the highest number of fire-stations.
 
 Experts say during construction, people compromise on the kind of wires being used or the fuse box being installed. “When this is done, electricity passing through the wire causes a spark and results in a fire,“ said Narayan Bhosekar, president of Fire and   (FSAI), Hyderabad chapter.
 
 “Over the last three months we have noticed that many cars are catching fire.In the most recent case at   , a car erupted into flames. Fortunately , no one injured in the mishap. So it is not just homes, even car engines are catching fire,“ Bhosekar said.
 
 Experts from the Fire and Security Association of India, (FSAI) said cars can catch fire if they are not maintained properly.
 
 “Unlike constructions where the materials used for construction can be monitored, a car comes ready made. People need to be careful, since there are a lot of combustible items inside the car like fuel and air-conditioning gas. Since the engine generates a lot of heat, people must check their cars for any electrical fault,“ said an experts.
 
 “The people of the city are aware now, but many are trying to tamper with the voltage of electricity passing through wires, triggering sparks,“ said district fire officer M Srinivas Reddy.
