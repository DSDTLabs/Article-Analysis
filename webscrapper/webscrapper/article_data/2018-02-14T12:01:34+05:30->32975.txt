HYDERABAD: AIMIM leader and Hyderabad MP   questioned how the RSS could compare itself to the Indian army, calling the comparison an insult to the army, in a reaction on Tuesday to RSS leader  's statement that RSS would be ready to jump into a war in three days as compared to the six months the   who would require to prepare for it. 

 "Mr Bhagwat should stand on the border with his cadre if he truly believes in what he said," Asaduddin Owaisi tweeted. Later, speaking to TOI, he said: "How can a cultural organisation compare itself with army? It is a very grey message which may have many repercussions." 
 
 Blaming Prime Minister   for the terror attacks happening in the country, he said, "Time and time, the question is raised about the patriotism of   to the country. In Jammu, five out of seven killed in the attack (Sunjawan terror attack at an army base) were Muslims, including a woman. Does this not show how patriotic Muslims are?" he commented. 
 
 Asked if the perception about Muslims would change with what he pointed out on the Sunjawan terror attack, Owaisi said, "It won't change. I know that for sure. All that happens is insults are heaped on us and I am targetted for verbal attacks. And I do not care about whether they change their perception or not." 
 
 "Everyone knows the neighbouring country is pushing the terrorists into India. The government has failed to learn lessons from any incidents despite many lives being lost. Is this not intelligence failure? Where does the buck stop? The Prime Minister alone is answerable and should explain why the attacks are not being prevented," he said. 
 
 Owaisi wondered why the RSS was quiet on the five dead Kashmiri Muslims. he said, "They question Muslim's love and loyalty for the country and call Indian Muslims as Pakistani," he said, adding that the media was also responsible for allowing them a platform to spread canards. "PDP-BJP govt in J&K have completely failed in securing the country," he said.
