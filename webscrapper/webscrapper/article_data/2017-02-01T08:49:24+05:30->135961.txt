PUNE: The police will investigate whether the live CCTV footage on the   at Hinjewadi was monitored at all or then neglected by the   who could have been appointed to check it.

 Software engineer   OP was found murdered on the company’s premises on Sunday and the police arrested a security guard of the company in connection with the crime the next day. A preliminary probe revealed that the guard entered and left a restricted area where the victim was working several times. 
 
 A police officer told TOI, “We are taking this aspect seriously in order to find out if the incident could have been averted had there been proper monitoring of the CCTV live streams.”
 
 Already, city police commissioner   has questioned why the live CCTV footage was not being monitored by staff in the Infosys security office. “The incident could have been averted as somebody monitoring the footage would have alerted other security guards about the suspect’s unauthorised entry into the restricted area on the ninth floor of the building where the victim was working,” she said.
 
 “The girl was working all alone on the 3pm to 11pm shift. A male employee was given the morning shift and the girl the late hour shift. There should have been other male or female employees with her on the floor,” Shukla suggested.
 
 A safety alarm button was not provided on the floor. “Such safety gadgets are the need of the time and the victims, in a situation like this, can effectively use them,” Shukla said.
 
 A senior police officer said the incident shows how IT companies are neglecting the safety of women employees and are creating an insecure atmosphere. “Had the incident occurred outside the company premises, society would have blamed it on the law-and-order situation and would have questioned the functioning of the police,” the officer said.
