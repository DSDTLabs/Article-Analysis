VISAKHAPATNAM: After the carnage in the morning, order was restored in the evening session of the fourth edition of the   tournament at the Novotel here on Friday.

 Following the ouster of world No. 5   and world No.9 Stuart Bingham, world No.2   and defending champion   ensured there were no more casualties as they moved closer to an all-Scot showdown in the final.
 
 While Higgins put paid to Liam Highfield's hopes with a workmanlike 4-0 victory in the quarterfinals, McGill avenged his UK Championship loss to   with a clinical 4-0 rout in another last-eight stage clash.
 
 While Higgins takes on rookie pro Xu Si, who outclassed   4-0, McGill will meet the winner of the match between the two giant-killers -Mark King (Bingham conqueror) and Elliot Slessor, who had edged out Murphy.
