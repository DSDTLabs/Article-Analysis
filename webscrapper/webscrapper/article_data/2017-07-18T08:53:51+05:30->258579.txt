BAREILLY: A   lodged a complaint with UP chief minister   and   alleging that a doctor posted at the   had demanded Rs 10,000 from him in order to issue a disability certificate. The CM’s office forwarded the letter to the chief medical superintendent (CMS) of the district hospital. The latter wrote to the additional director, health, Bareilly division, directing him to investigate the matter.
 
 Complainant Ramswaroop Sharma in his letter to the CM said, he had brought the matter regarding the doctor’s demand to the notice of the chief medical officer (CMO) who had said, “The doctor has spent a large sum on his education and he should give him the money”.
  
 Both doctor concerned and the CMO have denied the allegations levelled against them.
  
 Sharma, a resident of Karolan near Biharipur police outpost, alleged in his complaint that Dr Laxmikant Saxena at the district hospital had demanded Rs 10,000 from him to issue him a disability certificate for a hearing impairment on June 3, 2016.
 
  “On the same day, I consulted another doctor at a private hospital and his report said I have 90% hearing problem. When I showed this report to Saxena, the latter lost his cool and again demanded Rs 10,000 for the certificate. When I pleaded with him that I cannot afford to pay him, the doctor pushed me from my chair. When I complained about this to the CMO, the latter said the education of doctors is very expensive and I should give money to Saxena,” Sharma said in his complaint which was lodged in April 2017.
  
 Denying the allegations, Saxena said, “Sharma is wrong. I made his certificate with 70% disability in May 2016.”
 
  CMO Dr Vijay Yadav said, “I am not aware about the matter. The complainant should produce evidence to back his claims. The truth will be revealed during the probe.”
