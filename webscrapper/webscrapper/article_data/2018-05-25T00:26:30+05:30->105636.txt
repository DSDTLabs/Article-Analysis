PATNA: A Muslim man from   district,  , broke his roza (fast) on Tuesday to donate blood to an eight-year-old Hindu boy suffering from thalassemia.

 Bhupendra Kumar’s son Punit suddenly experienced a drop in his haemoglobin level and required an immediate blood transfusion. Punit’s blood group is A+ve and none of his family members shared his blood type.
 
 Alam got to know about Punit’s condition and gladly agreed to donate his blood even at the cost of breaking his fast. “When I got to know about Punit’s condition, I immediately rushed to the hospital. Believing in religion is one thing but humanity is a bigger thing,”   told TOI on Thursday.
 
 Alam works as a clerk at the Gopalganj district education office and has been a member of the District Blood Donors’ Team (DBDT) for the last two years. He was informed about Punit’s condition by  , the founder of DBDT, Gopalganj, who was approached for help by the boy’s father.
 
 “Punit is suffering from thalassemia for the last seven years. He needs blood transfusion every 15 days. Most of the time there are friends who donate blood. But on Tuesday, we couldn’t arrange his blood type,” Bhupendra said.
