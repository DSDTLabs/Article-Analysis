PUNE: Soon after the results of the municipal elections, Rajya Sabha MP Vandana Chavan resigned from her post as Pune’s NCP chief. A few party leaders were always opposed to her being at the helm of affairs in the city. However, Chavan stayed put because of the blessings of NCP chief  .

 Among Chavan’s detractors were MLC Anil Bhosale and senior party corporator Subhash Jagtap. Several NCP corporators were also opposed to Chavan and her supporters for backing biodiversity parks in the city. 
 
 Former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar now has a tough task identifying the next party chief for  . While Jagtap lost the  , Bhosale has lost the party’s goodwill after his wife Reshma contested and won the elections with the BJP’s support.
 
 “The party needs to clear the way for a new leadership. All these years, the NCP has promoted certain people who have not allowed others to take up the leadership mantle. The youth and women’s wings of the party are dominated by leaders who have no mass base. The party is disconnected from the grassroots and it has shown in these elections,” a senior party worker said. 
 
 The NCP faces a similar crisis in  . Party leader Yogesh Behl, city chief Sanjog Waghere, mayor Shakuntala Dharade, former MLA Vilas Lande, former mayor Mangala Kadam and Anna Bansode have failed to keep the party intact and stem its declining base. 
 
 Speaking about the election results, Kadam said, “We accept the people’s mandate. Our party implemented several development works in Pimpri Chinchwad over the past ten years. But we were still denied a victory. The panel system, which confused a majority of the voters, did not work in our favour. But we will continue to strive for development of the twin township while being in the opposition.”
