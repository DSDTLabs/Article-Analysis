NAGPUR: The indigenously built   — the 155mm artillery guns developed on the lines of the famed   — has failed yet again after reaching the last phase of tests.

 In a test fire undertaken last week, a shell hit the muzzle brake, a source privy to the development said. The muzzle brake is the component fitted on the top of the barrel. It helps in reducing the recoil created when a shell is fired. Sources said the gun had faced a similar issue in the test fires carried out in May this year. The guns are being manufactured at Gun Carriage Factory at Jabalpur.
 
 Sources said questions were being raised now about the barrel’s design. One of the suggestions is an increased diameter for the muzzle so that the shell can freely fly out.
