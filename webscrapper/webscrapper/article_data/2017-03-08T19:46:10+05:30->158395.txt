  India's most wanted Black Money agent, Vicky Chaddha, gets arrested in Malaysia and is kept in a safe house by the Malaysian authorities, along with his wife. A team of four is being sent to Malaysia to bring them to India. Apart from the growth of inter-personal relationships, the mission has quite a few twists and turns on its way. The story follows Karan as he uses his brain and brawn to recover all of the laundered black money. 
 
 
  Barring Esha Gupta's ravishing looks and permanent smirk, nothing quite stands out in the film. None of the lead actors are able to show a single expression. Ada Sharma's attempt at speaking comic Hyderabadi Hindi (or at least that's we thought it was) fails to amuse. The blaring 'Commando commando' background during the action scenes is strikingly outdated. Overstretched and uninspiring, this film is reminiscent of a poor man's Abbas Mustan film. Even decent action cannot salvage this dreary supposed crime thriller. 
 
 
 
  'Commando 2: The Black Money Trail' has collected around Rs 1.90 crore on its first Tuesday, taking the total collections to Rs 17.40 crore, as reported by Boxofficeindia.com. Its weekend collections stood at Rs 13.25 crore and on Monday, the film raked in Rs 2.25 crore.
