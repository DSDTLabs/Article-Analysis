GHAZIABAD: In a bid to do away with unwanted crowds inside court rooms, the district court has installed LED monitors outside 35 rooms to display the   of cases for petitioners and officials.

 “Ghaziabad district court is among the first few courts in the state where LED monitors have been installed outside court rooms,” said Manoj  , court manager. “It will enable the courts for a more swift discharge of cases,” added Mishra.
 
 “There are 18-inch LED monitors installed outside 35 out of 56 court rooms. In the next one week, it will be extended to other court rooms, including the   court,” said Mishra. He said while one LED monitor will be installed at the entrance, two display screens have been connected for the reader and the judge. 
 
 “The reader will enter updates from his computer which will y be displayed on the judge’s screen and the LED monitor outside,” said Mishra. The display will have four columns indicating serial numbers, case number, names of the parties and the status. “The status column will show ‘called’ as soon as the party is ready to be called inside and ‘in progress’ when the court proceedings are on. It will read ‘complete’ once the case is dismissed,” said Mishra.
