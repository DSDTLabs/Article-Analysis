MANGALURU: A 24-year-old   woman allegedly locked up in a house by her mother for a year was rescued by police last week. The mother allegedly confined her to a room after she learnt of her   from another community.

 
 The victim from Thrissur had released a video from an undisclosed location in   two months ago, explaining how she was subjected to torture by right-wing men. In the video, widely circulated on social media and aired by a Malayalam channel on Saturday, the woman alleged RSS and BJP workers were harassing her and she was illegally detained in a BJP leader’s house.
 
 Uma Prashant, DCP (crime and traffic), said: “The woman was rescued from a rented house in Barke five days ago and has been shifted to a rehabilitation centre now. Her mother has been booked for forceful detention.”
 
 In the video, the woman said she was taken to Kochi’s Amrita Hospital for psychiatric assessment and lodged in an RSS orphanage for two months. “My relatives are spreading lies about me. I was beaten up. Some BJP workers brought me here against my wish. I need help. They won’t let me live if they get to know I’ve used a cellphone,” she said in the video.
 
 The woman’s boyfriend admitted they were in a relationship for two years, and knew each other for eight years. “Her father died a few years ago. When her mother learnt about our relationship, she thrashed her and shifted her to a hospital in Kochi. There was no communication until two months ago when she contacted me on a cellphone. She sent me a video that I passed on to the media. I sent a copy of the video to police and the Kerala CM’s private secretary,” he said.
