MYSURU: The   has been at the forefront of the opposition to the   celebrations. However, Mysuru BJP leader   on Wednesday, in a statement that went against the party’s grain, said that the BJP would continue to celebrate the former Mysuru ruler’s birth anniversary if it came to power in the state.

 At an interactive programme hosted by the Mysuru District Journalists’ Association, wherein leaders from the Congress and JD(S) were also in attendance, Manjunath said, “We will continue the tradition of celebrating Tipu Jayanti, like all other birth anniversaries. We should also celebrate the birth anniversary of former President APJ Abdul Kalam.”
 
 Charging religious leaders with taking money from chief minister Siddaramaiah, Manjunath said, “A few seers of Lingayat mutts welcomed the government’s decision on the Lingayat-Veerashaiva minority status. It might appear as though some of the Swaijis might have taken money from the CM to support his stance.”
 
 Manjunath, a former president of the Mysuru city unit of the BJP, dubbed Union minister Anantkumar Hegde’s remarks against the Indian Constitution ‘foolish’.
 
 Meanwhile, city Congress president R Murthy exuded confidence of the Congress returning to power, with Siddaramaiah leading the government. “The governance provided by Siddaramaiah will ensure people vote for the Congress, and we will return to power,” he said.
 
 His JD(S) counterpart TK Cheluvegowda said both national parties had failed to deliver, and called on people to vote for the JD(S). “People should opt for the JD(S) given the performance of HD Deve Gowda as Prime Minister, and HD Kumaraswamy as CM,” he said.
