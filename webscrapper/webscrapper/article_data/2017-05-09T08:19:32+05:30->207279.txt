CHENNAI: A man created minor pandemonium, leaving the crew and passengers of an   bus flummoxed, by grabbing the vehicle’s keys and fleeing with them on foot near   in north Chennai on Monday morning.

 The man, who police are yet to identify but quoted witnesses as saying appeared to be around 35 years old, boarded the bus (159E), which plies from Ennore to CMBT, when it halted at Ernavoor around 5.30am.
 
 “When the conductor asked him to buy a ticket, he pulled out a Rs 100 note,” a police officer said. “The conductor asked him for change but he said he did not have any other notes.”
 
 The commuter pleaded for a ticket but the conductor rebuffed him. An argument broke out and the conductor asked the man to alight from the bus.
 
 “The man refused to get off the bus and the driver,  , halted the vehicle to sort out the issue,” the officer said. “The man was enraged and tried to attack the driver and the conductor.”
 
 Then, without warning, he suddenly lunged toward the driver’s seat and pulled out the keys, jumped off the bus and ran away. “The bus crew did not expect this,” the officer said.
 
 The baffled crew called for a mechanic from an MTC workshop even as the passengers, startled at first by what had taken place, soon grew restless.
 
 “The mechanic helped the driver start the bus after a 30-minute delay,” the officer said. “Several passengers had by then alighted to flag down another bus.” 
 
 The Ennore police are searching for the commuter.
