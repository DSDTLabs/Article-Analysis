KOLKATA: A day-long postal   has thrown schools affiliated to the   into a tizzy as many of them have not been able to send answer scripts to Delhi even after 24 hours of holding the exams.

 “The results are expected to be published within the second or third week of May. Even a day’s postal strike may lead to a delay. The postal department should have intimated us to avoid confusion. Moreover, such strikes are uncalled for during the examination season,” said the principal of a city school.
 
 According to Nabarun De, secretary of the   in Bengal, answerscripts are dispatched the next day if there are ICSE and ISC exams on the same day. On Wednesday, ICSE students appeared in English literature exam while ISC candidates took maths test. “We expected the post offices to function on Thursday. At 10:30am, when the schools started to send answerscripts to be mailed to Delhi, they got to know about the strike. There was no intimation from the postal and telegraph department,” added De. A senior postal official, however, claimed that the strike was announced much earlier. 
 
 “Some schools were forced to send answerscripts in courier instead of speed post on Thursday,”  , principal of   said. The cost of sending answerscripts in courier is much higher. “I had to shell out Rs 800 instead of Rs 500 to send around 52 copies. Apart from the cost factor, most of the districts do not have easy access to top courier services that are recommended by the council,” Biswas added.
