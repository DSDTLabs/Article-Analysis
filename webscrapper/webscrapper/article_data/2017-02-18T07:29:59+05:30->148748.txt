PUNE: The postal department has taken serious objection to the state election commission's order to use the   in Kondhwa as a   for the corporation elections on February 21.

 Post master general ( ) Ganesh Sawaleshwarkar has sent a mail to the state commission objecting to the use of post office as a polling booth without prior intimation.
 
 “They have told us to clear the space and shift all our equipment in the coming two days.The   post office is among the leading offices and has 15 postmen and a daily service of 4,000 ordinary mails and 1,000 speed posts for dispatch. They have told us to keep the office closed from February 18-21. This is basically closing an essential service without co-ordinating with us. The election office has pre-decided polling booths and they cannot suddenly decide on the post office without giving us anotice or discussing it with us,“ Sawaleshwarkar told TOI.
 
 Postal officials spoke to election officials who said they could not do much about it. The post master general said that it was a major task to shift records, cash chest and other material at such a short notice. “In effect, we would have to shift our services to other post offices at Wanowrie or Kondhwa and we would essentially not have operations from February 17-21as we would require one day each for clearing the room and then again setting it back,“ Sawaleshwarkar said.
 
 For the PMC elections, there are 3,432 polling booths. PMC election officer Satish Kulkarni told TOI the respective returning officer can decide areas for polling and issue orders. According to the rules, any school, society club office, wedding hall or government office can be converted into a polling booth.
 
 Returning officer of Kondhwa area, Jyoti Kadam, told TOI they have already declared the post office as a polling booth so they cannot reverse it. However, if there are issues, temporary arrangements can be made, Kadam said, adding, “I will personally examine the location."
