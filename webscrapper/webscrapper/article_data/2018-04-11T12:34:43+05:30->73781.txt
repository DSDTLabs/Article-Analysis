NURPUR: While chief minister   has ordered an inquiry into the accident in which 27 people, including 23 schoolchildren died on Monday, local residents blame the public works department ( ) for not maintaining the patch where the mishap occurred. Villagers had full faith in ex-serviceman Madan Lal, 65, who was driving the 2013 model Ashoka Leyland bus, when it plunged into the gorge and has been booked in the case.

 Nurpur sub divisional magistrate Abid Hussain said that school bus was fit and was passed till May. “It was a 2013 model bus and passed till May 2018. We have not find any discrepancies so far but investigations are still on,” he added. Kangra SP Santosh Patial said it was being checked whether the bus was fitted with speed governors. Ruling out overloading, he said the was 32-seater and “children below the age of 12 years are considered as half seat”.
 
 He said the bus went over the wrong side of the road when it plunged into the gorge and it was being ascertained whether it happened due to over-speeding or it skidded when brakes were applied. Villagers, however, blame   which turn slippery after it rains.
 
 Harbans Kumar, 67, a resident of Khuwara village claimed that the road was last repaired around 10 years back. “I don’t remember any road repair work being done recently. It was done 10 years back. Potholes are filled with mud, which turns slippery during rains,” he said. As his sentiment was echoed by other villagers, senior officials of PWD rushed to the accident spot to check the condition of road. Chief engineer (PWD) S K Ganjoo, who inspected the spot, said, “I have myself measured the width of the road, it is around 5.9 meters. We call it formation width. According to rules, it requires to be between 5 to 7 meters for a link road,” he said.
