Mumbai: Union minister for shipping Nitin Gadkari attacked the navy on Thursday for putting roadblocks before development projects in Mumbai.  “I have come to know that the proposal for a floating jetty at Malabar Hill was stayed by the high court due to the Navy’s objections. Where is the navy at Malabar Hill? A mindset has developed to create roadblocks in projects,” he said on the occasion of laying the foundation stone of the International Cruise Terminal at Ballard Pier. “You bring the proposal before me. We are in power and not the navy or the defence ministry. The PM has set up a committee under my chairmanship for infrastructure clearance. I will get it (the jetty) cleared… many projects get cleared by reading the agenda itself.” He said the navy should secure the borders instead of raising objections to projects.  “Navy people had come to seek land for housing in south Mumbai. Why should I give land in South Mumbai? I will not give even an inch of land.” The minister made the remarks in the presence of the Western Naval Command’s chief Vice Admiral Girish Luthra. Gadkari said the Navy is needed near Pakistan. “We respect the Navy, but they should go to Pakistan and do patrolling,” he said.
