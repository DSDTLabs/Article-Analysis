NEW DELHI: Two attempts of   robberies were   by alert staffers within the past two days in the city. 

 The first incident was reported from   where two men on a motorbike sprayed chilli powder on the face of the driver of cash van, Sohanlal, to force him to stop the vehicle. However, Sohanlal did not stop and kept moving until he reached a police station, forcing the miscreants to abandon their plans. 
 
 The second incident was reported from Mianwali Nagar on Saturday where miscreants tried to hold the cash van employees, who were unloading cash near a private bank ATM, at gun point. The other employees nearby raised an alarm and the men had to flee. Police are scanning through the CCTV footage to identify the men.
