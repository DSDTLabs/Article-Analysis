TV couple   and  , who have been dating for the past three years, had a roka ceremony on February 15. In keeping with the duo’s wish, it was strictly a family affair. 
“We wanted to keep it brief and simple; some good wine and food. Though we’d planned to have our roka on Valentine’s Day, our family pandit said the following day was more auspicious,” says Manish. 
 Ask him if they have finalised the wedding date and he replies, “It hasn’t been fixed yet, but it will be mostly by the end of this year. Till then, we are trying to spend some quality time together. I won’t say that we understand each other completely, but the journey of knowing each other has been quite interesting. The more I get to know her, the more I fall for her.”
