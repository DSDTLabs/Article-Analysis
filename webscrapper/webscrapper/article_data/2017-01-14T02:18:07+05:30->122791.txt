NEW DELHI:   on Friday accused the Centre of harassing its functionaries through the income-tax department. AAP treasurer   said the party expected   on its office and residences of senior members just before the Goa and Punjab elections.

 Chadha alleged that the I-T department was under “tremendous pressure from   to trap AAP in false cases”. He said: “From two or three income-tax notices a month, AAP has now started receiving one or two notices every day. The aim is to clearly bog down AAP members with unnecessary work so that they are unable to focus on campaigning in Goa and Punjab. It shows PMO’s desperation.”
 
 Chadha said that BJP wanted to dent its image in the two states. He claimed that every bit of AAP’s funding was accounted for. “We maintain records for 100% of our donations; even those who donate Rs 5. We have also been responding to the I-T notices. But we have some questions to ask as well,” he said.
 
 “Do I-T officers ever question the treasurers of BJP and  , which get 75% of donations in cash? Do officers visit the residences of their treasures and auditors? We have received notices from the I-T department, seeking information from 2010, when AAP was formed only in 2012. The department is simply cooking up stories against us. The same tactics were deployed before the Delhi elections, but nothing worked,” he said.
