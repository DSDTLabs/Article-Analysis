New Delhi: The Delhi government has announced the setting up of 12   that will work to promote not just the languages but also the culture and traditions of the country.

 Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who recently took charge of the culture department, has given directions to start work in this direction. 
 
 The languages for which academies will be set up include Bangla, Tamil, Telugu, Malyalam, Marathi, Gujarati, Assamese, Oriya, Marwari, Kannada and one for Garhwali, Kumaoni and Jaunsari.
 
 “At present, there are about six language academies in Delhi. We have observed that these academies work really well in promoting languages and culture. Given the cosmopolitan nature of Delhi, the government believes that there are still several languages that need representation and for that, it has been decided to establish these academies,” said a senior government official.
 
 The promotion of languages through academies was promised in the current budget of the Delhi government. On Wednesday, Sisodia had announced that the government would also start a three-month special course on Sanskrit to enable the common man to understand it in daily use.
