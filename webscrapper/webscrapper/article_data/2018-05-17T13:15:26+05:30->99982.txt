VADODARA: The   and   ( ) will fund a project to treat sludge generated by a sewage treatment plant (STP) in the city and generate water and energy from it. 

 The project has been proposed at the   of the   (VMC).
 
 A representative of the BMGF had visited the VMC in February and met senior officials. The foundation had also made a presentation regarding the Omi Processor Plant to process the sludge generated by a STP.
 
 According to a proposal prepared for the project by the VMC administration, the plant will use a thermal treatment based technology that is the best globally. This would do away with the need of waiting for the sludge to dry up in the drying bed for about four to six weeks.
 
 The water generated during the drying process in the plant will be recovered. An interesting aspect of the plant is that 10 per cent of the water generated from the plant will be of distilled water quality while the remaining 90 per cent will be industrial grade water. The plant will generate 60 to 70 kilo litres per day (KLD) of industrial grade water and six to seven KLD distilled water quality water.
 
 The plant will also generate 1,000 kilowatt hour electricity every day. This will lead to a saving of Rs 22lakh per year for the civic body towards its power bills. The ash generated from the town can be used for construction of blocks for green buildings.
 
 The agency that will set up the plant will also maintain and operate it for 10 years. The civic body can earn around Rs one crore from supplying purified water from the plant. After deducting the expenses, the civic body will also get 40 per cent of the surplus amount generated from the sale of water. The proposal has been put before the elected wing that will now decide on it.
