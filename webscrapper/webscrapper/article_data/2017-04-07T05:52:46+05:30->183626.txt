MUMBAI: Three photocopy centre owners have been arrested for allegedly selling copies of the summative evaluation II test question papers.

 The tests --third of the series this academic year--that evaluate learning levels of students in first language and math are being held across schools in the state on April 6 and 7.
 
 On April 4, TOI reported that copies of the papers were circulated on a messaging app.
 
 On Wednesday, Agripada police booked Raies Ahmed Ansari, Iftikar Ansari and   under various sections of Maharashtra Prevention of Malpractices at University, Board and Other Specified Examinations Act 1982. “Probe is on to find where they had sourced the papers from,“ said an official. The three have got bail.
 
 The education department approached police following complaints from principals that the question papers were being sold at photocopying centres. “Taking cognizance of the complaints, we informed the police,“ said B B  , deputy director of education, Mumbai.
 
 Maharashtra Vidya Pradhikaran, Pune, designs the tests for classes I to VIII. The baseline tests were held in July and summative evaluation I in October. On Thursday, a few schools found that students had access to the language paper. “Two students had a photocopy of the question paper before they came to the exam. We informed their parents and counselled the students,“ said the principal of a south Mumbai school. Similar instances were found in the suburbs too.   secretary   was unavailable for comment.
