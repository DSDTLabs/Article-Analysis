Sanjay Dutt’s comeback film ‘Bhoomi’ found itself in trouble when a group of media persons were allegedly ‘roughed up’ by the security and crew members of the   directorial on Thursday. Following this, a police complaint was filed against the actor. According to reports, the local media person who lodged the complaint stated that he was assaulted and his camera was snatched away by the film’s team.

  
  
 Now, the film’s producer   has refuted the claims of the complainant. According to a report in Mumbai Mirror, the producer stated that they had decided to shoot at one of the sweet shops in Agra. However, the owner of a rival sweet shop started taking pictures of the sets. Turns out, he was requested by the bouncers to stop taking pictures but he continued doing so. When the bouncers warned him again, he reportedly got aggressive and this led to the commotion. Others soon joined in and the situation got out of hand.
 
 The producer further added that they were scheduled to shoot for another month in Agra. However, post the incident, he is unsure whether they will continue the shoot in the city.
