 About 40 to 50 Maoists, who had reportedly crossed over from Chhattisgarh, carried out the attacks after forming three teams.
 
 Following the attacks, police sounded an alert in the area and launched combing operations.
 
 Telangana was once the stronghold of Maoists but their activities have been brought under control by sustained police operations. 
 
 Police claimed that in 2017, Maoist violence declined by 90 per cent.
 
 Director General of Police M. Mahender Reddy said in December 2017, that the police were maintaining the vigil, especially in areas bordering Chhattisgarh to foil any attempt by Maoists to regroup.
