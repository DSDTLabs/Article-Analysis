Krishnagiri: A pilot and maintenance engineer of a private chopper narrowly escaped tragedy when they were forced to make an emergency landing at a village near Krishnagiri due to bad weather on Thursday evening.

 Art of Living founder Sri Sri Sri Ravi Shankar flew to Neyveli in Cuddalore district from his ashram at Kanakapura in a private chopper belonging to Bangalore-based Oxford Aviation to participate in a function there on Thursday morning. 
 
 After dropping off the spiritual leader in Neyveli, the chopper was on its way back to Bengaluru when they were hit by a heavy downpour and strong winds in Kelamangalam, a village along the Tamil Nadu - Karnataka border.
 
 Pilot R P Daly decided to land the chopper at Kelamangalam. “Visibility was poor due to thick fog and rain. I had no other option but to force land the chopper in the village,” he told reporters. At 6pm, he landed safely in forest area near Mugalur village on Thursday. “Maintenance engineer Vinay Kabir was with me when we landed the chopper,” Daly said. He alerted headquarters about the situation.
 
 Meanwhile, villagers in Mugalur informed Kelamangalam police who in turn took Daly and Kabir to a safer place in the village. Police officials deployed 10 policemen to protect the chopper from miscreants.
 
 On Friday morning, officials from Oxford Aviation came to the spot with sufficient fuel and other equipment to check the chopper. Around 10am, they flew back to Bengaluru, after getting clearance from the Bengaluru airport.
