 Gadgil made an attempt to meet the CM to stake claim to the chief secretary's post, but did not succeed, while Shrivastava did meet the CM, but in vain. 
 
 According to reports, both Gadgil and Shrivastava may not resume duties on Tuesday, after a four-day holiday break.
 
 Gadgil did not respond to a TOI message, while Shrivastava said he was travelling on personal work. Significantly, when Jain took over the charge from outgoing chief secretary Sumit Mullick, both Gadgil and Shrivastava were conspicuous by their absence.
 
 A senior bureaucrat said appointment of the chief secretary is the prerogative of the CM, there is no question of seniority. "In the past too, the senior-most bureaucrat was superseded and a junior bureaucrat was appointed to lead the bureaucracy,'' he said.
