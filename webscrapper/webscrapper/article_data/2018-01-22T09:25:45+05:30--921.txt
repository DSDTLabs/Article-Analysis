CHENNAI: Kalu Uche’s brace went in vain as Delhi Dynamos lost 3–2 to   in   on Sunday. Dynamos’ skipper sounded upset after the loss. “I’m so sad that we lost the game. We had a better start and were leading 2-0 and at the end of the day, we lost the game. It’s so sad honestly. But we have to forget about what happened today and think about the next game. Today’s game is past and we don’t have to keep dwelling on it,” Uche said at the end of the match.

 
 The Nigerian, though, was happy with his and Dynamos’ performance. “Well, I am happy with our performance. Scoring two goals and it’s really good for me, for my goal-scoring ability and I am happy with my performance today. Also, I want to thank the team because they helped me. And it’s not only me, I want to take the opportunity to thank the team for their performance and it’s sad that we lost the game at the end of the day. I wish, we could end the game the way we started it but in football, so many things happen in 90 minutes,” he said.
 
 Uche praised Jamshedpur’s fighting spirit. “Jamshedpur are a very good team and they showed it today and never gave up throughout the 90 minutes. Even when they were losing 2-0, they kept fighting and fighting until the last minute. So, I have to use this opportunity to congratulate them on their win and their hard work,” he said.
