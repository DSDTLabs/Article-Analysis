AHMEDABAD: After seeking police protection against her husband and father, for fear of ‘honour killing’, the daughter of ex-IPS officer V V Rabari,   Desai, a yoga trainer, appears to have patched up with her relatives. On April 26, Gujarat high court directed the city police commissioner and ACP of Mahila Cell to ensure her safety. However, Rashesha did not show up before the cops with the high court order. She, in fact, refused to have police protection, after apparently having settled the dispute with her family members.

 Assistant commissioner of police of Mahila Cell,  , said they had not received a notice or order from the high court, but Rashesha approached her on Friday. “She expressed her desire to not go ahead with the complaint. We also asked her whether she needs protection. She refused, saying she had patched up with her father and husband   on the issue,” Momaya said. Rashesha, however, was not available for comment. Earlier, Rashesha approached the   and sought police protection against her husband and father, who had allegedly threatened to shoot her following her differences with her husband.
