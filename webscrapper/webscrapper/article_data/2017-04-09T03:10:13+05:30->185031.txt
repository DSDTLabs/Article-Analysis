GURUGRAM: Around 100 parents gathered outside   in Sector 4 on Saturday to protest against “illegal”   by more than one and a half times enforced by the management this month. 

 The aggrieved parents of students studying in the institute assembled outside the premises seeking rollback of the school management’s decision. “We tried to persuade the school to reverse its decision of increasing fees by 1.5 times,” said Sudershan, a parent. “The authorities issued a circular in this regard in March. The hike has been enforced in annual fee, development fee and other fee, which is not acceptable under the Haryana Education Act 2003.”
 
 Saturday’s protest came on the heels of the recent outrage of parents against Gurgaon schools for hiking fees “illegally”. Last month, DPS-G Palam Vihar and   had come under fire for charging exorbitant fees.
 
 “It has become routine for schools to hike fees by enormous proportions. How do we shell out so much money year after year?” Sudershan added.
 
 Parents said under sections 24 (2) and (17) of the Haryana Education Act, schools can only charge Red Cross funds, tuition fees and sports fees. “Charging parents under every other fee is not legal,” said Ramesh Rana, president of the All India Parents Forum for Education. 
 
 The school management has now asked the parents to convene a meeting on April 22 to discuss the issue, said  , another parent. “We will put our point across during the meeting. We cannot afford to pay such huge amount as fee. The school will have to roll back the hike. The school has not even provided form VI to the parents. The last time we sought the document, the management told us to collect it from the district education officer. We plan to visit the education officer on Monday and file an RTI to get form VI,” she added.
 
 Despite repeated attempts to contact them, the school authorities could not be reached.
