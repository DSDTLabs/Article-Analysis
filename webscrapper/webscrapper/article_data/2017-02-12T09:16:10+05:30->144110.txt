AHMEDABAD: Five years after Vishwa Patel, then 11 years, went missing from her flat in Anandnagar, the city crime branch has once again launched a hunt to trace her. Crime branch officials said they have formed team to start the probe afresh.

 Vishwa went missing from her house on January 27, 2012 under mysterious circumstances. The case had triggered a public outcry and snowballed into a state-wide campaign to trace  
 
  A missing person’s cell was formed in the CID crime headed by additional DGP Anil Pratham at that time to trace missing children. A similar squad was formed also in the city crime branch to deal with missing children complaints from the city. The Vishwa missing case, which was being handled by local police was transferred to city crime branch, but all efforts to trace the minor proved futile.
 
 “The last point where we got stuck were the two video clips which showed Vishwa leaving her building on the fateful day. The footage was recorded first by a videographer, who was covering a marriage party and the second footage was from a CCTV nearby construction site,” said a senior crime branch official.
 
 Officials at the crime branch said they have got several calls informing them about a girl who looks like Vishwa seen at Delhi, Mumbai, Vadodara and Goa. “We took no chances and had dispatched a team every time we came across a clue about the girl,” a crime branch investigator added.
 
 “We have constituted a team which will look into the Vishwa missing case afresh. We will start gathering fresh information through various means which will include technical inputs. Out cyber cell team has also been included in the squad to trace Vishwa,” said a crime branch official.
