In one of its largest single day falls ever, index heavyweight ITC plunged 12.6% on Tuesday wiping out about Rs 50,000 crore or $7.7 billion in the market capitalisation (M-Cap) of the cigarettes-to-biscuits major that sent the benchmark Sensex tumbling to its steepest daily fall so far in 2017.

 Interestingly, ITC was the biggest driver contributing about 21% to the Sensex’s rally in 2017. The Sensex lost 364 points or 1.1% to close at around 31711 points while the broader Nifty was down 88.8 points or 0.9% to end the day at 9827.15 points.
 
 The FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) index, which includes ITC, the best performer in the current market rally, also cracked. The index plummeted 6.1%, the biggest fall among indices. The ITC scrip lost massively due to the GST Council’s decision to increase the cess on cigarettes.
 
 The council hiked the compensation cess on filter and non-filter cigarettes with effect from midnight of July 17. The government indicated that the GST rates announced earlier led to about Rs 5,000 crore windfall gains to cigarette companies resulting in a unanimous reversal of the same. Incidentally, several brokerages upgraded ITC stating that the “neutral GST rate” augurs well for cigarette volumes.
 
  (LIC), the largest individual shareholder with a 16.25% LIC stake in ITC, was left poorer by around Rs 8,127 crore or $1.25 billion due to the crash in the stock price. ITC is a market leader in the cigarettes category with volume market share of nearly 75%. Cigarettes business contributes about 50% of ITC’s revenues. ITC’s M-Cap stood at around Rs 3.46 lakh crore after Tuesday’s fall.
 
 “The   went ahead and tinkered the structure in a manner that leads to an 8%-16% hike in total indirect taxes on cigarettes. We estimate a hit of INR 35-36 billion (Rs 3,500-Rs 3,600 crore) to ITC’s profits on an annualised basis” said   and   of JM Financial Institutional Securities. “From a situation where ITC’s earnings growth was expected to revert to a mid-teens level, the trajectory drops right back into the mid-single-digit zone again. We see the stock de-rating,” they said. ITC’s net profit stood at about Rs 10,201 crore in 2016-17.
 
 “This (hike in cess) will impact the earnings of the cigarette companies as companies will either absorb the tax impact or see some drop in volumes if they hike the prices,” analysts at Angel Broking said. 
 
 “This move will impact prices of cigarettes adversely. The increased cess is in addition to highest rate of GST i.e. 28% and ad valorem cess of 5%,” said  , senior consultant, Taxmann.
