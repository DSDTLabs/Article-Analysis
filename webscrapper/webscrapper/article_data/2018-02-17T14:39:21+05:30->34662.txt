Panaji: The state government has begun a crackdown on non-Indian citizens holding   cards in the state. “It has come to our knowledge that some persons who have taken citizenship of Portugal or some other country continue to have ration cards,” said minister for civil supplies  . He said that action would be taken if such cases are detected. 

 “As per the law, you need to surrender the ration card if you have given up Indian citizenship.”
 
 A few months ago, the department of civil supplies asked all households to fill forms for ration card registration. It received forms from around 70% of the state’s ration card holders. The department has issued around 3.3 lakh ration cards in the state.
 
 Gaude said that if ration card holders are found to have acquired nationality of other countries, the cards will promptly be cancelled. He said that a few months ago, a case had come to light of a foreigner having a ration card. Not only was the name deleted, action also was also taken against the official, Gaude said.
