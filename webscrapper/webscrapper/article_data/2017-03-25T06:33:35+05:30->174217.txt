AMRITSAR: Gunshots were fired in the air and blankets set on fire at   on Friday morning as inmates of the prison clashed with its staff. 

 No one was injured in the violence that was triggered by a warder allegedly using expletives against a group of prisoners. While police fired the gunshots to bring the jail in decorum, the prisoners had set the blankets afire on a staircase to keep the staff away from them.
 
 Gurdaspur senior superintendent of police (SSP)   said the situation was brought under control by the evening, but the jail administration was yet to file a complaint. “They (the prisoners) have some genuine grievances also. We will look into them later on. For now, the situation is normal,” he said.
 
  told TOI that there were heated arguments between a few inmates and a jail warder, after the latter allegedly used abusive language. “The inmates got irritated with the warder’s behaviour and thrashed him. In return, he came back with his colleagues,” said Virk.
 
 This is the third clash at a prison in the state in 35 days. The earlier two incidents of violence took place at Kapurthala modern jail on March 19 and 23, leaving a few injured. However, in Friday’s clash, tension spread in neighbouring areas too, as the gunshots were heard outside and smoke could be seen bellowing out of the jail.
 
 Virk said as the warder got his colleagues, the inmates started pelting stones and bricks at them. SSP Virk, who has also been superintendent of Patiala jail, said they had to calm the prisoners down through persuasion.
 
 Meanwhile, Pathankot district legal services authority secretary   visited Pathankot sub-jail. She interacted with the inmates and enquired about their issues and assured to resolve them. On the occasion, paper formalities were completed for providing free legal aid to the inmates who couldn’t afford to hire lawyers.
