MUMBAI:   (45), a US citizen of Indian origin, who was arrested on Sunday for allegedly making “bomb threat” call at Mumbai’s   can fly back to Virginia only after the court allows the police to release his seized passport.

 Moorjani, who is still in Mumbai, is expected to move an application before the magistrate’s court in   to get his passport back. Experts said that looking at the sections slapped on Moorjani, he can get bail.
 
 Officials of the Sahar police station on Monday submitted a final probe report which states that   made the call to delay a   flight as he thought he would not reach in time.
 
 Moorjani had reportedly told the woman attending his call: “Bomb hai in Delhi-Rome flight”. He, his wife and children were offloaded around 4.30pm from a Mumbai-Delhi flight after the woman lodged a complaint.
 
 Moorjani’s lawyer told the court that his client was only checking the status of “BOMDEL flight” and the woman who attended the call misunderstood. TOI attempted to reach Moorjani, but he did not respond.
