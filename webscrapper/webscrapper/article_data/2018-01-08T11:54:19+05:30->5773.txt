MARGAO/PANAJI: There is no need to create a Hindu rashtra. The very essence and character of India is based on Hindu philosophy that believes not only in protection (of all other belief systems), but in equal respect to and acceptance of all ways and cultures, editor of ‘Organiser’, the mouthpieces of the   (RSS),   said on Sunday in Fatorda, Margao. 

 Ketkar was addressing a gathering of RSS swayamsevaks at the   event of the organisation. 
 
 The   part of the event was attended by chief minister  , dressed in the RSS uniform of khakhi trousers, white shirt and a black cap.
 
 “The original Indian philosophy is rooted not in the concept of ‘unity in diversity’, but in the manifestation of diversity of inherent unity,” Ketkar said, adding that honouring this concept and respecting those struggling for the cause of it was everyone’s bounden duty. “It’s on the basis of this concept that the country will march forward towards the pinnacle of glory,” he said. 
 
 Stating that striking a balance between spiritual development and economic development was also a fundamental concept of this nation, Ketkar stressed that “the RSS works towards upholding this thought.” 
 
 Speaking at the Panaji event, Jayantrao Sahasrabuddhe said that for centuries, Indians believed in the phrase ‘vasudaiva kuthumbakam’, which means the entire world is connected into one entity. “The Western concept of a global village is a concept created for practical purpose and is limited by it,” he said. He also said that it is such philosophy that kept India from attacking any other nation throughout its long history. “It is important that we take pride in our culture because this will not only benefit India, but the entire humankind,” he said.
