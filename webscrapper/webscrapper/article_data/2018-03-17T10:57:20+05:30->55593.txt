CHENNAI: Having qualified for the ISL-4 final,   have bounced back in style this season after finishing a poor seventh last season. Chennaiyin have been extremely consistent and coach John Gregory have found the right balance between defence and attack.

 
 What has also shone through is Chennaiyin’s resilience this season. They have been the third most miserly team in defence, conceding only 19 goals. The likes of  , with nine goals, and Raphael Augusto, have also been instrumental in taking the team over the line in a number of close matches by scoring late goals. While 12 of Chennaiyin’s goals 28 goals - a staggering 43 percent - have come in the final 15 minutes, 20 of those strikes have come in second half of matches.
 
 Chennaiyin co-owner   said that it is this fighting spirit which has made his team lethal. “We were disappointed after finishing seventh. But then it’s not about how high you rise or how you low you fall. It is about how you come back and this team knows the art to fight back. It has made all the difference. The way they have conducted themselves throughout the season has been amazing,” Bachchan told TOI in a recent chat.
 
 Bachchan feels it is Gregory who brought about the ‘never-say-die’ attitude in the team. “When we appointed Gregory, we believed in his plans. We were sure how we wanted to go about this season. He has been a father figure to the boys. The way he backed Jeje has worked. He has etched out a leader in Jeje. We have immense faith in him,” said Bachchan.
