NEW DELHI: Union minister for minority affairs   said on Monday that Saudi Arabia has agreed to India’s decision to revive the option of sending   pilgrims through sea route. According to the ministry of minority affairs, sending pilgrims through ships will help cut down travel expenses significantly.

 A decision in this regard was taken during signing of bilateral annual Haj 2018 agreement between India and Saudi Arabia by Naqvi and Haj and Umrah minister of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Dr Mohammad Saleh bin Taher Benten, at Makkah.
 
 The practice of ferrying Haj pilgrims between Mumbai and Jeddah by waterways was stopped in 1995. Naqvi said another advantage with ships available these days is they are modern and wellequipped to ferry 4,000 to 5,000 persons at a time. “They can cover the 2,300-odd nautical miles one-side distance between Mumbai and Jeddah within just 3-4 days. 
 
 Earlier, the old ships used to take 12 to 15 days to cover this distance,” he explained. Naqvi said he had discussed the option to revive sea route for Haj pilgrimage with transport and shipping minister   in 2017. He also pointed that this time Haj has been made fully online.
