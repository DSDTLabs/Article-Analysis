BENGALURU: Starting Monday, only   will be allowed to enter or exit through the first two   the loco-pilot’s cabin in all Metro trains during the peak hours.

 However, this will be done on a pilot basis in the three-coach trains. BMRCL plans to have coaches exclusively for women in future.
 
 The separate entry and exit for women passengers will be available only from 9am to 11.30am and from 5:30pm to 7:30pm. “This is being done on an experimental basis. Depending on the feedback, steps will be taken to make travel more comfortable for women commuters,” BMRCL managing director   said on Saturday.
 
 However, there will be no segregation of passengers inside the coach and women passengers will be able toenter and exit through other doors of the train as well.
 
 Many women passengers have welcomed the move. “It’s a good idea to reserve the first two doors for women. Metro trains are increasingly getting crowded. Some male passengers refuse to move and block the entrance to the train,” said Swathi Krishna, who regularly uses the Metro from Indiranagar.
 
 Earlier, BMRCL decided to implement the new system from March 1, but now it has decided to advance the data considering the growing demand from women passengers. On Saturday, BMRCL o fficials made announcements at all Metro stations about the new system.
 
 BMRCL does not have the exact number of women passengers, but officials estimate it to be around 40% of the average three lakh commuters who take the Metro daily. There are increasing complaints from women about difficulty in getting into the threecoach trains on both Purple and  , particularly during peak hours.
 
 The Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML) on Wednesday handed over first set of three coaches to BMRCL.
 
 The Purple Line will start operating the first six-car Metro train in two months, after receiving clearance from the commissioner of rail safety. BEML will supply six to nine cars a month from   all the 150 cars by December 2019.
