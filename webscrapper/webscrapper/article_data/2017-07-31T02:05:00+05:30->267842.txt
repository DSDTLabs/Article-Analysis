MEWAT:   affiliate   (MRM) is trying to lure Mewati Muslims, by literally planting its seeds in Muslim households via the   plant, which Hindus consider holy.

 MRM will organise a mass event — Jashn-e-Azaadi — at Badhkali Chowk next week, to glorify the role of Mewatis in India’s freedom struggle. Around 5,000 Mewati youth will hold a tiranga (tricolour) rally, where MRM leaders will distribute 5,000 tulsi plants to Muslim youth. Mohammed Habib, BJP’s Muslim face in   has been given charge of arranging for the plants.
 
 “Tulsi is called reyhan in Arabic, and is also mentioned in the Quran as a plant of heaven,” Habib told TOI. “It’s a medicinal plant. Every Muslim household should have it. We now associate animals, plants and food with religion. People associate tulsi with Hindus and dates with Muslims. They should only be considered part of nature and used for their benefits,” said Habib.
 
 RSS leader and MRM patron Indresh Kumar said he supports the movement. He told TOI, “Reyhan has already reached 7 lakh Muslim households in the country. We request all religious leaders to help us reach out to all households. Let everyone benefit from tulsi.”
 
 Mewat residents though said they have always used the plant for various purposes. 
 
 Homemaker Irshad Begum (57), resident of Nagina, has four tulsi plants in her home. “I bought these years ago from Delhi, when my husband was a cop there. I’ve been using tulsi in tea. I love the aroma in my house,” she said.
