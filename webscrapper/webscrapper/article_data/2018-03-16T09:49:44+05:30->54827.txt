CHANDIGARH: Panjab University (PU) vice-chancellor (VC) Prof Arun Kumar  , on Thursday, said the university should now start a graduate school so that the students have a long association with it and they produce quality papers which are published in quality journals. 

 While delivering the presidential address at the   (CHASSCONG-2018), Grover said, "There is a need to break silos and create graduate school with the intent that students stay at the university for longer periods of time and every student before he or she quit it, would have written a paper. We need to evolve and create a new direction for ourselves. We really have to justify the tag that we are a national institution," said Grover.
 
 Talking about teaching and learning resources, Grover said PU is nowhere in national ranks, forget about international ranks. "We can really improve on teaching-learning resources. When it comes to teaching-learning resources, we are nowhere at the national ranks, what to talk of international ranks? This is where we need to improve. We created departments and a large number of our departments became centre for advanced studies. But, how do we go forward unless we do course correction? We should create something that not only improves teaching-learning resources, but also concurrently enhance the research output, which is another parameter we are not doing well in," said Grover.
 
 He also added that the number of good papers the university publishes per faculty is not very large. "The only way to improve the quality of papers is to make sure that the students, who enroll with us, stay here for a sufficiently longer time. I think the time has come that we should create a graduate school on behalf of the university," he added.
