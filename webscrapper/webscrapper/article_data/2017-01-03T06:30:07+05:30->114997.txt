NASHIK: The city police initiated action against autorickshaw drivers and   norms in the Ashok Stambh and   areas of the city on Monday.

 Senior officials said the surprise action was implemented taking into account the rampant violations at these spots. 
 
 Jayant Bajbale, assistant commissioner of police, city traffic department, said, “There were a couple of roads declared as one-way in the   areas. Motorists generally tend to break this in the absence of police, which leads to traffic congestion in the   area, where roads are narrow.”
 
 The traffic police also acted against motorists who had parked their vehicles on the road in the Ashok Stambh and MG Road area. Officials said that the area has many commercial complexes with no parking place and so people ended up parking their vehicles on the road, which severely hampers the flow of traffic. 
 
 Bajbale said that they have also begun using a new towing crane to take action against four-wheelers parked illegally. The new crane would ensure there was no damage to the vehicle while it was being towed, since motorists had complained about this earlier. 
 
 “On Monday, we decided to conduct the surprise drive so that errant motorists realise they can be booked any time by police for violating traffic norms. Meanwhile, action was also taken against autorickshaw drivers who were found operating without uniform,” a traffic official said.
 
 Senior officials said auto drivers must wear the uniform as many women and girl passengers often complained that these drivers harassed them by passing comments and asking them for their destination for no reason. 
 
 In the past, a survey conducted by the city police found that women and girls feel unsafe in autorickshaws.
