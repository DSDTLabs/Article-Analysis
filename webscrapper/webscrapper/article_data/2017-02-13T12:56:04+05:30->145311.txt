BHUBANESWAR: First it was   chief minister  , on Sunday it was the turn of his Jharkhand counterpart,  , to take pot shots at  . Hitting the   district, Das mocked Naveen's achievement in 17 years.

 While Raman highlighted the Mahanadi issue as his state is at loggerheads with Odisha over sharing of its waters, Das focused on tribal welfare since the areas he campaigned in were tribal dominated.
 "Seventeen years is not a small time. In 17 years, the state could have achieved new heights of development. Unfortunately, in these years, the regional parties, BJD and JMM, did politics in the name of tribals just to fill up their ballot boxes, but they did nothing for their uplift. They are anti-poor," Das said at a rally at Rairangpur.
 
 The significance of Das mentioning JMM (Jharkhand Mukti Morcha) is that it used to be a force in Sundargarh and Mayurbhanj districts -they share their borders with Jharkhand - till 2014 when the party's top leadership in Odisha merged the state unit of the BJD ahead of the Lok Sabha and assembly elections.
 
 "The large turnout of people is a warning to the BJD. Work for the poor or else the people will throw you out in 2019," Das said, in a message to the Naveen-led party.
 "The BJP is the only political party committed to development of the tribals," the Jharkhand chief minister added.
 
 Responding to the Jharkhand CM's attack, senior BJD leader and former minister S N Patro said Das should worry more about Jharkhand. "His own fate is uncertain in Jharkhand. He need not worry about the situation in Odisha," Patro said.
 
 He felt the BJP is daydreaming about 2019. "Naveen continues to be the most popular leader because of the excellent track record of development under him," he added.
