AHMEDABAD: Some 40 members of the   community collected Rs 50,000 to organize the weddings of two orphan Dalit girls —   and Jagruti Solanki — at   village of Kankrej taluka in   district. The weddings were held on May 12.

 The event in which humanity triumphed over caste took place in a district which has registered the highest number of atrocity cases (1,792) against Dalits in  , from 2001 to 2017. The figure accounts for 11.15% of the total number of cases —18,530 — recorded by the state. Just last week, a Dalit family in the district was threatened by the Darbars because the Dalits had used the ‘Sinh’ suffix with the names of the groom’s nephews in the wedding invitation. That wedding had to be held under police protection.
 
  As for the two weddings funded by the Darbars, one of the organisers — Kismatsinh   — said that his group, comprising a range of people from farm labourers to shop-owners, stepped in to help the girls settle in life. “We wanted to bring happiness to the orphan girls. That is why we held the weddings without thinking about caste, creed, or community,” said Waghela, a farm labourer in the village. This was their first attempt to offer an olive branch to the community traditionally victimized by caste-based discrimination, said Waghela.
 
 “Our group is made up of lower-middle-class people who do not believe in discrimination,” said Waghela. “We will continue this work to inspire others.”
 
 Parvati, 19, said was happy because she married to an educated man. “My father died when I was very young. My mother died a few years later,” she said. “I started working on farms to support my two younger siblings.” 
 
 “It was difficult for us to hold a wedding but with the effort of the Darbar brothers, my wedding became a grand affair,” she said.
