Reality TV star   and her husband, rapper   became victims of swatting after police were reportedly called to the couple's   mansion when they received a complaint about a "possible suspect inside the home with a gun". But it turned out to be a hoax.

 The incident took place on Saturday, reports dailymail.co.uk.
 
  authorities said no crime took place after officers responded to phone reports of criminal activity at their residence.
 
 
  
 Swatting means when a phone phone call is made to authorities in order to draw out police, fire or medical officials to a specific location.
 
 On Saturday, the Twitter account for the Southern California Monitoring Association (SCMA) -- an organisation that monitors scanner reports -- said that reports came in that the residence was the target of a home invasion and that a cleaning girl was shot by a suspect. 
 
 The organisation said that the reports might have been a possible swatting incident.
 
 "It appears (that) Kim Kardashian's home is victim of (a) swatting call," the SCMA said.
