BHUBANESWAR: Director-general of police   here on Sunday issued a strong warning to those circulating   about   on the prowl. 

 Sharma's instruction to district superintendents of police (SPs) to take action against   coincided with separate incidents of people roughing up suspected child-lifters in Ganjam and Nayagarh.
 
  "So far, we have not come across any case of kidnapping of children. But messages being circulated on social media claim that some interstate child-lifting gangs are active in the state. This is nothing but a rumour," he said.
 
 Sharma appealed to the people to refrain from taking the law into their hands. "We have been coming across reports from different places of people assaulting suspected child-lifters. Such mob violence should be stopped. People should inform us if they come across any suspicious person in their localities," he said.
 
 Though nobody has been lynched in the state, police have rescued at least six 'child lifters' from angry mobs in different districts in the past two days. They have not arrested any of the attackers yet.
 
 Significantly, rumours of a child-lifting racket had gripped pockets of the state in May-June last year. On June 3, 2017, a mob beat to death a 45-year-old woman in Domuhani village in the Bangiriposi area of Mayurbhanj district after accusing her of being a child-lifter.
 
 "We have clearly asked SPs to remain alert and prevent mob violence. Quick and stringent action should be taken against those attacking innocent people by branding them child traffickers. The SPs should step up their intelligence-gathering mechanism and keep a close vigil on mischief-makers," Sharma said.
 
 Some SPs have also taken to Twitter and Facebook to dispel rumours. "We request the people not to believe in messages of child-lifting gangs working in Rayagada," says a video message posted by SP (Rayagada) Rahul P R on the official twitter handle of the district police.
