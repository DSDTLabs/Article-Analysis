We had told you that   will be composing music for Susi Ganeshan's  , which stars  , Prasanna and Amala Paul playing the lead roles.We managed to get an exclusive sneak peek into the composing session for the film, which kick-started on Tuesday . Along with the director and the composer, lyricist   was also present during this session and the trio, who is coming together for the first time, hit it off right away.

 Talking about what audiences can expect from the songs, Vidyasagar said, 'The songs are going to be very modern and will cater to today's youth. At the same time, they will be rooted in melody as well.'
 
 We are trying to ensure that in addition to going well with the flow of the film, the songs work well outside the context of the film as well, he added.
 
 Describing Vidyasagar as a 'melody master', Vairamuthu described the songs as 'massukku pidikkum but classa irukkum'. 'Kuthu songs are needed, but not everything should be a kuthu song. People will get tired then. Also, such songs are only for the ears and not for the heart. We are trying to give songs that travel from the ears and reach the heart,' he said. The trio worked on a song about a young woman and her dreams on her birthday, we hear. 'I gave the words and Vidyasagar came up with the pallavi and charanam.The final tune has come to me and now, I have to sit and complete the song,' Vairamuthu revealed.
