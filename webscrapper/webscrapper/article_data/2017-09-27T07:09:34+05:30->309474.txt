CHENNAI: Security camera footage on Monday showed a youngster riding a bicycle had taken away a three-year-old boy from near his house in   but police officers who rescued the child on Tuesday were taken aback to discover that the suspect was a 14-year-old Class IX school student.

 Investigators received a breakthrough on Tuesday afternoon when two residents of Karneshwar Nagar, Korrukupet, who saw images in the news from footage of the kidnapping, contacted police to say the suspect resembled a teen in their locality.
 
 “We found Mohammed Sathu in the teen’s house in Korrukupet, barely 2km from where he took away the child,” a police officer said.
 
 Additional commissioner of police, north and west, H M Jayaram, said the boy told investigators that Mohammed told him that he wanted to go on a bicycle ride.
 
 “The boy also said he wanted to play with Mohammed in his house,” he said. “We are trying to determine his real motive.”
 
 Deputy commissioner, Washermenpet, Sashank Sai said police are also probing the role of the teen’s parents. “We have to establish why they did not send the child back home,” he said.
 
 Korrukupet residents K Ravi and N Akilesh took two policemen to the locality and showed them the teen’s house. The policemen found the child playing in the house.
 
 The informants told police the teen’s mother was acting suspiciously and keeping a close watch on police patrol vehicles passing by. They said the boy’s mother repeatedly came out of the house as if to check if anyone was coming.
 
 When Mohammed failed to return home after going out to play on Monday, his parents Iliyas and Barkath Nisha searched for him in the locality but to no avail. They later obtained security camera footage from stores nearby that showed a youngster take their child away on a bicycle.
