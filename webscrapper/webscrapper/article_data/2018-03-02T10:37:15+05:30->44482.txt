BHOPAL: The   (PCB) gave a sudden appearance on Thursday at   to make people aware about the importance of using herbal over   during Holi. 

  As per PCB officials, the campaign was organised near the colour shops so that the city residents can be made aware about the disadvantages of using non-herbal colours. 
 
 During the inspection, the PCB team found shopkeepers selling non-herbal and chemical colours openly. However, the team did not take any legal action against the vendors and gave them the last warning.
 
 PCB regional officer PC Bundela said, "Such a drive during Holi has been conducted for the first time in the city. Usually, we don't conduct any inspection in markets. However, from next year, we will impose fine on the vendors."
 
 "We've hung banners in market areas where shopkeepers put up temporary stalls to sell colours to convey the message to public," he added. 
 
  Akhilesh Yadav, a vendor at Bittan Market, said, "Craze of non-herbal colours is more than herbal ones. Consumers are going for non-herbal gulaal sold in loose packets. However, PCB officials would have informed us earlier about the drive. We would have not sold non-herbal colours." Whereas Sandeep Kumar, herbal colours seller, said, "Even though price of herbal colours is thrice of chemical ones, people prefer to buy it. Now people don't want to risk themselves just for the sake of fun."
