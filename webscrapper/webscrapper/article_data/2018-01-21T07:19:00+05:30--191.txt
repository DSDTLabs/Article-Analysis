Chandigarh: Dynamic fuel pricing — daily since May 2017 and fortnightly from December 2015 to May 2016 — is not really working in the benefit of motorists in Tricity. Since December 2015, petrol and diesel prices in Chandigarh rose by 12.13% and 29%, respectively, shows data with Chandigarh Petrol Price Chart.

 That’s not all. Diesel’s price crossed the Rs 60 mark for the first time in Chandigarh this month.
 
 Most consumers spend a fixed amount on fuel for their vehicles, but the constant hikes in diesel and petrol prices might change this old habit. Sector 27 resident Mukesh Kumar said he still paid Rs 100 daily to get his motorcycle fuelled. “A few litres more or less do not make much of a difference. However, this constant rise in fuel prices has burnt a hole in our pockets and I might have to check my spending habits. The government must cut taxes to pass on relief to end-users,” he said. 
 
 While residents of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula have called fuel pricing “mere eyewash”, dealers say it has been launched to benefit oil companies. The steep price hikes have been there in spite of the central government cutting excise duty on both fuels by Rs 2.35/litre and the UT administration slashing value added tax (VAT) by 5%.
 
 The owner of a petrol pump in Chandigarh, Amanpreet Singh, said though the Centre’s August 2017 decision to cut excise duty was of help at first, things were back to square one now. “Chandigarh cut VAT too, but the prices have risen to earlier highs,” said Amanpreet. 
 
 According to data, petrol rose from Rs 61.37 per litre in December 2015 to Rs 66.56 per liter in December 2016. Its price rose to Rs 71.72 per litre on March 5, 2017. Though its price fell to Rs 66.58 by December 2017, it rose to Rs 68.82 this January. In all, this marks a Rs 7.45-per-litre rise in two years.
 
 The price of diesel, a fuel widely used among car-owners in Tricity, has risen the sharpest, from Rs 46.84 per litre in December 2015 to Rs 55.49 per litre in December 2016, and Rs 56.69 per litre in December 2017. This month, the fuel has touched an all-time high of Rs 60.80 per litre.
 
 'Companies lost out in fortnightly pricing'
 
 Mohali: The president of Petrol Pump Dealers’ Association of Chandigarh, Arjan Singh, said the previous fortnightly fuel-pricing mechanism used to cause losses to oil companies, as it affected stock valuations. “Now, in daily pricing, oil companies monitor fuel stocks and set the price according to them. This way, they pass on the hike to dealers and general public,” he said.
 
 Benefitting oil companies?
 
 Mohali: The president of Mohali Petrol Pump Dealers’ Association, Ashwinder Singh Mongia, said daily fuel-pricing system was helping oil companies earn more profit and all this was coming at the cost of people’s expenses. “The government advertised it as a benefit for people. Petrol’s price rose by Rs 7.45 per litre and diesel by Rs 13.59 in two years, but this has almost gone unnoticed by people,” he said.
 
 Oil companies, on the other hand, described daily pricing as a “consumer-oriented concept”, saying that fuel prices were now proportional to international crude oil barrel rates.
 
 A senior divisional manager of Indian Oil Corporation, who did not wish to be named, said the fortnightly pricing system was more burdensome for consumers. “The daily changes don’t affect the pocket as much,” he said.
