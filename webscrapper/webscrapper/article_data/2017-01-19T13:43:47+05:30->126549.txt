PANAJI: Nearly cent per cent   have a library available in its premises, but only around 21% of the institutions have a   with it, as per the data of the   DISE.

  simply attributes this an oversight in appointment of full-time librarians for schools over the years.
 
 “Until last year, any librarian appointed in schools was recruited to the post of a lower divisional clerk-cum-librarian and not exclusively as librarians,” Bhat said.
 
 In 2016, for the first time in Goa, 40 persons were appointed as full-time librarians in schools across the state.
 
 “In all, 189 posts were created by the government, but the recruitment process had to be halted due to the election code of conduct coming into force,” Bhat said.
 
 All schools offering Classes from V to X and having at least 5,000 books in its library were to get a full-time librarian under the new scheme, which belatedly realised that LDC-cum-librarian posts sees the employee getting caught up with other official duties.
 
 The scheme said that the librarian will help students ‘explore books’ and be part of activities like author visits in schools and ‘reduce the co-dependence of children on e-content.’ The DoE also hoped that the librarian will act as a ‘teaching partner’ in class.
 
 Also, Goa got a bachelor’s in library science programme only around three years ago after it was offered at Goa University and later a masters degree in the subject was introduced.
 
 “Libraries mean that students learn to read books and try to understand the meaning which help in language and also in knowledge, but in most government schools there is no library period in a week and therefore students do not know when to read the books which are pushed into lock-and-key in the office,” said a source.
