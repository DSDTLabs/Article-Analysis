BHUBANESWAR:   and former   on Thursday plunged the   into fresh controversy, saying that bureaucrats are running the ruling party. 

 Such attacks fuelled speculation about the possibility of their, especially Panda's, moving close to the BJP, which has lately emerged as the BJD's main challenger in the state.
 
 Obliquely hinting at an IAS officer attached to the chief minister's office, Panda, a four-time BJD MP, said, "When an officer forgets the service rules, crosses the Laxman Rekha, gets involved in party politics and encourages those working against peoples interests, he doesn't deserve respect."
 
 Panda made the remark while speaking to the media after inaugurating an overhead water tank at Buhalo in Nischintakoili block of Cuttack district. Buhalo falls under Kendrapada constituency that he represents in the Lok Sabha.
 
 Invoking former chief minister Biju Patnaik, after whom the ruling party is named, Panda said, "Biju babu had himself advised people on what they should do with such officers. While addressing a public meeting in 1990, Biju had asked the people to beat up corrupt babus."
