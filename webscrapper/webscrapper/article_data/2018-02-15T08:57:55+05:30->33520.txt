LUCKNOW: Scores of members of Samajwadi   on Wednesday reached the chief minister's residence on 5, KD Marg to protest against  's statement that ' ' is linked to terrorism. 

 Demanding an apology from the chief minister, the members of the  's student organisation reached the main gate on the road leading to the CM's residence. A police team stopped them there and a district administration official received their memorandum of demand. 
 
 However, the workers stood there and did not leave the spot despite being asked to move.
 
 The group later took to stopping vehicular movement on the road, leading to a jam-like situation. The police were forced to cane- charge the group to dispel them.
 
 The police action created panic among the workers who ran towards Lohia Path. This added to the chaos and traffic on both sides of the road came to a standstill. Police chased the protesters and nabbed three of them.
 
 ASP (east)   Mishra said the group did not clear the road for traffic despite being asked to do so.
 
 Four members of the Chhatra Sabha have been detained and are in Hazratganj Kotwali's lock-up. A case would be registered against them, he said.
