MUMBAI: The Christian community has begun observing the annual penance of Lent which brings about spiritual rejuvenation. The holy fast began at Ash Wednesday, February 14, and will end Thursday March 29. Easter Sunday, the biggest festival of the Christian faith, will be celebrated April 1. 

 During this period, faithful Christians may abstain from things they either love or hate. Some stop eating meat, others give up alcohol. 
 
 New age temptations like social media are high on the list of items to forgo.
 
 I-T professional Roshan D'Souza, a parishioner of Holy Family in Chakala, Andheri (E), said, "My family and I give up meat for all 46 days. On behalf of the church we have offered suggestions to parishioners which will benefit not just themselves but society as a whole. For instance, they can pledge to avoid social media for a day, give up private vehicles on certain days or stop using bad language. Some people have taken all these pledges, others a combination."
 
 Fr  , parish priest of Holy Family, said they visit homebound people to enact the stations of the cross ritual. "We are organising special Lent mass every Friday afternoon for working professionals who cannot come in the evening. There is also an initiative called 'Alone with God' where we switch off the lights for some time and allow people to soak in the exposition of the blessed sacrament," he said.
 
 Meanwhile, Pope  ' rather frank warning against "fake fasting" is being discussed worldwide. He urged Christians to give up something for Lent only if it demonstrates compassion and enriches others. The holy father also warned against the temptation of "showing off" by fasting, "by making a fuss of it and letting people know that we are practicing Catholics and we do penance, so that people think 'what a good person'. This is a trick. It's pretending to be virtuous", he said.
