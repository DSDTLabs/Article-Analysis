MYSURU: Opposing the Union government’s move to pass the National Medical Commission Bill, members of the  , Mysuru chapter, held cycle and bike rally here on Friday.

 The rally, which started at JK Grounds, went past Railway Station Circle, Dasappa Circle and Metropole, reached the DC office premises. The members gave a memorandum to DC K B Sivakumar.
 
 Speaking on the occasion, Dr Sanjay said, “According to the National Medical Council Bill, 20-member National Medical Council will have only five members from the medical sectors and the rest will be from non-medical background. When the council will be represented by political heads and leaders, the sufferers will be the general public. With NMC, a bridge course will be offered in Ayurveda, Unani and  , which in-turn will lead to the decline of MBBS courses.   with limited knowledge about the subject will treat patients.”
 
 Dr Sanjay added that NMC Bill will allow 40 percent of the medial seats for the government sector and the rest will be given to private colleges. “The poor and ambitious will find it difficult to afford seats in private colleges. The Medical Council of India keeps a tab on the quality of equipment on a yearly basis. But with National Medical Council, quality checks will be done only once in five years. Further, according to the bill, students who complete the five-year MBBS course along with a year of internship will have to clear the   in order to take a doctor’s license. This will add to the burden of students,” he added.
 
 More than 50 members took part in the cycle and bike rally. Secretary of IMA, Sujatha Rao, Dr Visweswaran, Dr Rudrappa, Dr Harish were present. 
 
 The rally was held on a pan-India basis and a torch was passed on from the association’s Madikeri chapter at thebeginning. The torch was then handed over to the Chamarajanagar chapter. Representatives from across India will gather at Delhi on March 25 to stage a massive protest.
