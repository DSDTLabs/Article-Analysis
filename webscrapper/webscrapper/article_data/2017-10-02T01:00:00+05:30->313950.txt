'In 2006, Sanjay Dut's 'Lage  ' added a new word to our vocabulary –   – and sparked a trend that still shows no intention of fading out anytime soon. While handing out roses to traffic rules violators seems to be a favourite with the traffic police across the country, students and private citizen groups have also taken this route to show dissent. On this Gandhi Jayanti we take a look at how the Gandhigiri mantra has been going strong for a decade

 
 
 The traffic police departments – be it of NCR cities or Mumbai or Hyderabad – have been following Gandhigiri for years now to embarass rule breakers. Reason? "Jise challan se darr nahin lagta, usse phool de kar sharminda karo," they say. 
 Traffic cops in NCR have taken the concept further, and have not limited themselves to just giving roses to violators. From handing out chocolates to tying rakhi and painting helmets – they have done it all. Recently, while the Delhi traffic cops gave an arty makeover to commuters’ helmets to encourage them to wear them, Gurgaon’s female traffic cops tied rakhis to traffic rule violators and offered them laddoos to dissuade them from breaking rules in the future. 
 In 2009 over 80 history sheeters from four police station areas in   were assembled at a police station. They were given roses and told not to "cross the line."
  
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 Last year, when the odd-even scheme kicked off in Delhi, the deputy commissioners of various districts decided to give flowers to those violating the rule. Officials and senior cops say that the “shaming with a rose” strategy brings behavioural changes in the long run, and helps in creating a public-friendly image of the police.
 Not just with the traffic police, over the years, at various protests – be it by students or traders’ associations – across the capital, red roses and ‘Get Well Soon’ cards have become very popular.
