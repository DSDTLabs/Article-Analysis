BHUBANESWAR: None of the seven booths in  , on the outskirts of the city, witnessed a   turning up to cast votes on Monday. Responding to a unanimous decision by the entire village,   

 The villagers had been protesting the dumping of municipal solid waste by the   at a site close to their village. The village being the panchayat headquarters, there are posts of both a sarpanch and a samiti member. However, none of the villagers filed nominations. No booths were opened, therefore, for election of sarpanch, ward members and samiti member.
 
 Seven booths were created in the village for election to the post of the zilla parishad member, none of which recorded any voting. In January, the villagers had arrived at a consensus not to cast their votes or allow anyone to contest in the election. "Since solid waste dumping in our village continues to this day, we have decided to refrain from exercising our franchise. We decided not to file nomination papers for the rural poll either," said outgoing sarpanch Prashant Paikray, who has been fighting for the complete closure of the solid waste dumping site.
 
 Daruthenga, around 2 kilometres from the capital city, has 14 wards. It does not come under the jurisdiction of the BMC. The village had been selected for dumping of waste and around 150 trucks of waste is dumped every day at the site. A solid waste processing plant is also in the works there. 
 
 In a 2009 judgment, the High Court had directed the BMC to dump waste at the designated place - Daruthenga. It also said that if required, it can do so by taking help of the police.
