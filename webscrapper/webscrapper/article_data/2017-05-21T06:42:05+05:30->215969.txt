LUCKNOW: Two unidentified bike-borne miscreants looted   from a property dealer at gunpoint at Wireless crossing in   on Saturday night. The miscreants vanished in thin air after executing the crime.

  of Narhai had signed a sale deed with a Dandaiya shop owner Mushtaq some time ago. Mushtaq had asked him to come to his shop in Dandaiya on Saturday to receive the advance cash of Rs 5 lakh. Due to the scorching heat, Sujit decided to go there at night.
 
 Sujit took the Rs 5 lakh cash from Mushtaq and left for his house on his bike, he told police. Around 8.30pm, miscreants on a white bike overtook him at Wireless crossing.
 
 “The pillion rider trained a pistol at me and forced me to stop. I was trembling in fear. They took away the bag of money and fled,” he stated in the FIR. Mushtaq was also called at the spot.
 
 Circle Officer, Mahanagar, Vishal Singh said he doubted Sujit’s claim saying a loot cannot take place at Wireless crossing, one of the busiest in the city with heavy police presence. “We also quizzed many vendors but they denied any loot incident taking place. However, we will scan CCTV footage to verify his claims,” Singh said.
