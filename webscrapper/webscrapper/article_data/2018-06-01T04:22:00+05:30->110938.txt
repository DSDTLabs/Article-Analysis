Vadodara: The prevention of crime branch (PCB) arrested four persons and seized a stock of demonetised currency notes of Rs 1 crore face value from them on Thursday.

  The gang has been handed over to the special operations group (SOG) for further investigations.
 
 Police said that the gang used to circulate the demonetised notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominations. “We had got information that some persons were trying to circulate demonetized currency in the market. We sent a decoy customer to buy those notes from them. The meeting was fixed on Thursday near Bhatiji’s Temple in Manjalpur,” said H M Vyas, police inspector, PCB.
 
 Kirit Gandhi, the key accused, came on a two-wheeler and began negotiating with the decoy customer. In a while, three other persons came in a car following which the customer signalled to the police team that was waiting nearby. 
 
 The PCB sleuths nabbed Gandhi and the other persons identified as Pradeep Parmar, Rajendra Raj and Manoj Chauhan. While Gandhi and Chauhan run a garage, Parmar and Raj are drivers.
 
 The accused told police that they had got the demonetized notes from a Surat-based man identified as Raju. They had planned to sell these currency notes to those looking for demonetised notes and then divide the money among themselves. 
 
 When asked why anyone would want to buy demonetised currency notes, Vyas said that it was a matter of investigations. The police have also now launched hunt for Raju who gave them the notes and if the accused have circulated such old notes in the past.
