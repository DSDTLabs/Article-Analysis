NAGPUR: Consultant Mohan Kothekar has alleged that   illegally awarded a tender to  , Amravati, for installing 400 unipoles on both sides of traffic junctions. The tender is for a period of 11 years.

 “NMC had also proposed to amend tender conditions in the general body meeting but as it realized that the proposal was illegal, it withdrew it,” he claimed.
 
 Kothekar also claimed that the current advertisement rate is Rs600 per square feet which was reduced to Rs250 to favour the contractor. He claimed that the poles will be placed in middle of roads, which may lead to accidents. “The procedure for the tender process was not followed as NMC did not invite any tenders. It is not permitted to erect display advertisements on road which the firm has proposed,” he claimed.
 
 He has demanded that the process be made transparent to enable other companies to participate in the tendering process. “The award of this tender will lead to legal complications and financial losses to the civic body,” he said.
 
 Kothekar also alleged that the amendment in duration was made especially to accommodate the proposal of Dattaterya Advertising, Amravati, whereas no application can be entertained retrospectively until the amendment is passed in due processes. “As per Clause No. 22, the tender can be of only 3-year duration but currently the tenure has been extended up to 11 years,” he added.
 
 Kothekar alleged that the NMC was trying to approve the proposal before the election code of conduct came into force. 
 
 Municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar refuted the allegations and clarified that as per his knowledge no such proposal has been passed in the recent past.
