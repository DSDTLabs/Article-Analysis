Trichy: Despite installing   in  , the police are having a tough time in identifying the culprits thanks to the poor quality of the footage captured during night.

 It is difficult for the police to identity the criminals from the footages recorded by the surveillance cameras installed around the Central Bus Stand. A police officer said that they could hardly find out that there was a human element in the footage. Hence, they had to investigate the case in a usual way making the case pending for several months. In cases like mobile snatching, the police have to wait until the phone was used by someone to get the phone’s location.
 
 At present, the city has been being monitored with around 290 surveillance cameras in places such as Central Bus Stand, Chathiram Bus Stand,  ,  ,  , and NSB Road Bazaar. But, none of them are equipped with night vision facility.
 
 A private firm from Coimbatore installed the IP-based infrared high resolution cameras in 70 places and public address system in 41 places at a cost of Rs 75 lakh in 2016. Police also set up control rooms in four places in the city to monitor the footages. Trichy city police have sent a proposal to the headquarters in Chennai seeking approval for revamping the surveillance camera system in the city. “There was a suggestion from us for having number plate recognition cameras in order to track the accused even faster,” said commissioner of police, Trichy city A Amalraj on Wednesday.
