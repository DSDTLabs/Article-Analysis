AHMEDABAD: It turns out that the   from Borsad in Anand district, who 
  — leading to Gujarat Secondary and   (GSHSEB) cancelling his result and barring him from taking the exam — is a  .

 After failing to appear before the board’s   thrice, the boy finally turned up accompanied by his parents.
 
 Board officials said his parents were shocked to see the detailed sexual fantasies their son had written to answer chemistry questions.
 
 His shocked father, who is a farm labourer, said that the boy was hooked to his mobile phone. He said that while he was against buying his son a mobile, the mother had given in to his demands and insisted that he be bought a phone. The boy confessed that he was hooked to watching porn on his mobile.
 
 “It was sad to see that even as poor parents toil hard to pay for their children’s education, students fall prey to vices like porn addiction due to misuse of mobile phones,” said A J Shah, chairman of GSHSEB.
 
 The student had written explicit pornographic material, detailing his sexual fantasies about his sister-in-law, a film actress and even a cook, in his chemistry answer paper. 
 
 The woman teacher who assessed his paper was shocked on reading the graphic prose. She flagged the paper with the coordinator of the centralized assessment centre, who was also suitably scandalized and insisted that action be taken. A cheating case was filed against the class XII student and he was barred from taking the board exam for one year.
 
 Psychiatrist Dr Hansal Bhachech said that porn addiction on mobiles is becoming a major problem for teenage students. “Not only boys even girls are getting addicted to pornography on phones. Parents bring students to us when either their grades slip perceptibly or when they get obsessed with certain activities out of guilt,” said Dr Bhachech.
