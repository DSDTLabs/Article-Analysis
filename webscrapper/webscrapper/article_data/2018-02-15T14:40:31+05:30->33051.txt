Panaji: There is a need for   to connect conventional learning with interdependent learning, said science educator Jaya  . She was speaking on day two of the ongoing D D Kosambi Festival of Ideas at Kala Academy, Panaji, on Wednesday.

 “The education system needs to change. Schools are a great social space but teachers need to be infused with more life to be more creative. Also, learning environments of classrooms need to change to both indoor and outdoor. The process starts by investigating what changes will suit a particular school,” she said.
 
 Elaborating further, she insisted that schools must make more interesting lesson plans. Ramchandani who has worked as a teacher in China and will soon be joining an institution in  , shared an example of how she did the same. “While teaching the electromagnetic spectrum, I saw that the beginning of the unit was not starting with information on ‘what is light?’ so I got the students to investigate the history of discoveries of the electromagnetic spectrum,” she said.
 
 She suggested that more teachers incorporate history into designing lesson plans of other subjects to help students make the connection of why that subject is relevant.
 
 “We need to make children interdependent instead of dependent. This is because things in reality exist in interdependence,” she said. Ramchandani maintained that her attempt is not to aggressively change the education system by telling them to adapt this model. Instead, she said, schools need to do their own research and reach their own conclusions.
 
 “I’d encourage people who are investing in schools and spaces of learning to invest in experimentation. That will lead to even more solutions,” she added.
