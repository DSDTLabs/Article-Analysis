LUCKNOW: A   on Thursday decided to boycott the complete session of the House protesting against the “insult” of leader of   Ram Gobind Chaudhary even as Speaker Hridaya Narain Dikshit and parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna tried to persuade them to stay. 

 The Opposition alleged that Chaudhary was not allowed to speak and his mic was switched off—something “never done before”
 
 Opposition leaders said CM Aditya Nath Yogi kept threatening the Opposition on Wednesday and insulted Chaudhary. 
 
 On Wednesday, after the reply of the CM,   was not allowed to seek a clarification, leading to the dispute. Suresh Khanna insisted that the LoP was trying to give a speech instead of customarily seeking clarification. 
 
 Though the LoP requested the Speaker to let him speak, the House carried on, forcing the Opposition to stage a  .
 
 “The government’s behaviour hints that they want the entire Opposition inside jail, which is very unfortunate,” Chaudhary said. 
 
 BSP leader Lalji Verma said, “Ministers are using unparliamentary words and the CM’s speech was full of ego as they have 325 seats. When the leader of the House (Yogi) can speak, then why not the leader of Opposition.” 
 
 Congress legislature party leader Ajay Kumar Lallu said it was unfortunate that the mic of the LoP was switched off when he tried to speak. “The sOpposition was forced to take the harsh decision as the government was trying to strangulate us inside the House,” he stated.
