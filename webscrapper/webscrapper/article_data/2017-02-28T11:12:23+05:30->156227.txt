HYDERABAD: Heavy security was deployed at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) on Monday as Srinivas Kuchibhotla’s family anxiously waited to receive the body of the young engineer who was shot dead at a bar in Kansas on February 22.

 Apart from   personnel, onlookers said that teams from the Hyderabad Police (City and Traffic) too were positioned at various points around the airport to keep curious crowds at bay.
 
 An   flight (AI 619) flew in the body from Mumbai around 9.46 pm, an hour after its scheduled arrival time. Sources indicated that Srinivas’ wife Sunayana Dumala and another friend of the couple arrived on the same flight. 
 
 While the media was kept a clear distance away from the airport arrival terminal, it was learnt that P Mahender Reddy, the state transport minister, was at the site to attend to the family and facilitate the passage of the body from the cargo area into a waiting ambulance.
 
 “While Srinivas’ father, brother, wife and other relatives, who had come to the spot, accompanied the minister in his car, the ambulance transported the body to their house in Bachupally,” said a source in the know of things. The vehicle was arranged by the state government.
 
 Along with Mahender Reddy, some also spotted Malkajgiri MP Malla Reddy at the airport. They said a few other dignitaries from the state government too had travelled to the airport to meet the grieving family members of the deceased.
