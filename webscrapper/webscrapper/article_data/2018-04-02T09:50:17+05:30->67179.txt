HYDERABAD: The logjam for MMTS phase-II is yet to be broken, though suburban commuters are mounting pressure on   (SCR) to start the service at the earliest.

 Tracks on the 10-km stretch from Malkajgiri to   were electrified by   (RVNL). Even trial runs of trains were conducted in the first week of March. But the services have not yet been rolled out because the height of a few suburban platforms needs to be raised. The services would link Bolarum with Secunderabad, Hyderabad, Faluknama and Lingampalli.
 
 Sources said heights of nine platforms in the Bolarum-Secunderabad stretch needed to be raised as MMTS trains don’t have stairs like other passenger or express trains. The entire stretch has 11stations.
 
 “Many platforms are uneven due to extension works being carried out at various times as per the length of the trains that halt there,” said  , general secretary of Suburban Train Travellers’ Association.
 
 Sources said RVNL hasn’t looked into the realignment of platforms to suit MMTS trains or coordinated with SCR on checking. “Now, the realignment of platforms will consume more time even as the demand of commuters is growing,” rued Noor.
 
 On March 14, Ram  , commissioner of railway safety, South Central Circle, ministry of civil aviation had inspected the newly electrified Malkajgiri-Bolarum section of Hyderabad division for introducing the MMTS trains. “He may have certified the electric traction for the service, but the project will remain stuck till the heights of the platforms are realigned,” Noor said.
