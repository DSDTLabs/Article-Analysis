PUDUCHERRY:   -- an experimental spiritual township near   founded by Mirra Alfassa (The Mother) of   -- has brought together men and women, young and old, cutting across boundaries and identities, said   Narendra Modi on Sunday. 

 Modi was speaking on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Auroville. He paid tributes to Sri Aurobindo on his first visit to Puducherry and Auroville as the Prime Minister. "It is important today to remember the vast extent of action and thought of Sri Aurobindo," he said. 
 
 The Prime Minister said, "Maharshi Aurobindo philosophy of consciousness integrates not just humans, but the entire universe. This has been translated by Mahatma Gandhi to mean 'everything down to the tiniest atom is divine.'" 
 
 "A man of action, a philosopher, a poet, there were so many facets to his character and each of them was dedicated to the good of the nation and humanity," he said.
 
 Modi visited Auroville’s famed golden Matrimandir and poured water from the Ganga in a special vessel to symbolically inaugurate the water ceremony to be held on February 28 when water from countries across the world will be poured into a single receptacle marking the golden jubilee celebrations of Auroville. 
 
 Modi also visited Auroville’s iconic Banyan tree before speaking to a packed Sri Aurobindo auditorium at Bharat Niwas close by.
 
 The Prime Minister released a new stamp to mark Auroville's 50th anniversary. He shared the dais with a host of dignitaries including Puducherry Lt Governor Kiran Bedi, Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit, Puducherry chief minister V Narayanasamy and chairman of Auroville Foundation Karan Singh.
 
 Earlier, Modi visited the Sri Aurobindo Ashram and SAICE (Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education), the school run by the ashram.
