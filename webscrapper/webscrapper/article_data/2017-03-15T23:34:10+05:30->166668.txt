Hyderabad: In a move aimed at boosting its presence in south India, Ahmedabad-based soft drink concentrate maker   has set up its 10th manufacturing facility at Chittoor district in Andhra Pradesh.

 The plant, which has been set up in joint venture with a local player and became operational over a month ago, has been set up at an investment of around Rs 60 crore and will not just cater to the domestic market but also exports in the future, Rasna chairman and managing director Piruz Khambatta told TOI.
 
 The Chittoor plant has a capacity to make 1 billion glasses of Rasna’s new fruit-based powder concentrate offering -- Rasna Insta – as well as fruit squash.
 
 Incidentally, this facility is Rasna's sole production plant down south and also the only Rasna plant to produce fruit squashes.
 
 “Over the next three to four months we are looking at the plant catering only to the domestic market. After that we may also look at exporting to Far East, South East Asia and the Middle East markets from the plant,” Khambatta said. Pointing to the reasons for zeroing in on Chittoor, Khambatta said: “The whole idea was to have a plant in the South markets as we did not have one and Chittoor was the best bet as it is close to Bengaluru and Chennai. It is also a good location for exports. Another major factor that played a role in swinging the decision in favour of AP is that the AP government is offering some of the best sops in the country.”
