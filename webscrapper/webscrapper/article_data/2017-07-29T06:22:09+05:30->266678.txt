Nothing like this has even been recorded in the annals of Washington DC and   rivalry - and there have been several.

 When founding father   challenged Vice-President Aaron Burr to a pistol duel, he prefaced the fight by calling Burr "unprincipled both as a public and private man". When General Joseph Johnson took on Confederate President  , he accused Davis of looking to "tarnish my fair fame as a soldier and a man." 
 
 Davis responded that Johnston's concerns were "as unfounded as they are unbecoming." Lyndon Johnson called Robert Kennedy a "grandstanding little runt."
 
 To hear or read about what President Trump's new White House communication's director Anthony   said about Trump's chief of staff  , you may want to lead children and women, the prude and the prissy out of the room, and shut the doors.
 
 "Reince is a f***ing paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac," Scaramucci told a NewYorker journalist, before imitating Preibus: "Oh, Bill Shine is coming in. Let me leak the f***ing thing and see if I can c***-block these people the way I c***-blocked Scaramucci for six months.'" "They're trying to resist me, but it's not going to work. I've done nothing wrong on my financial disclosures, so they're going to have to go f*** themselves," Scaramucci added.
 
 Trump's new communication director also maintained that unlike other senior Trump administration officials, he had no interest in media attention. "I'm not Steve Bannon, I'm not trying to suck my own c***," he said in a profanity laced reference to Trump's chief strategist, adding. "I'm not trying to build my own brand off the f***ing strength of the president. I'm here to serve the country."
 
 The language was redolent of the Trump's own boasting of grabbing the female anatomy as revealed in tapes, remarks the president dismissed as locker room talk.
