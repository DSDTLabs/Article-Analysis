 While assuring to extend assistance for finishing the restoration before the holy month of Ramzan, Mohammad Saleem said, “More workers have to be employed and also paid extra money in case they are working overtime to ensure that the work is completed as early as possible”.

The renovation will be monitored by ASI officials and we have instructed authorities concerned to finish the work soon.” The officials, during the inspection, observed that major repair works like plugging the leakage on the roof and carrying out a chemical wash of the monument are still pending.

 “Mecca Masjid is a major heritage structure, and we should conserve it properly. Unfortunately, the mosque had been in a bad shape for a long time and we are happy the government started the restoration. But we should also see that they finish the works before Ramzan so that the devotees don’t face any inconvenience,” said an official of the mosque.
