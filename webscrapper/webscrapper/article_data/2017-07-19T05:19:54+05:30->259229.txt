CHENNAI: Owners of   with constructions over it will have to seek regularisation of plots and buildings separately. While the government launched a portal in May for owners to apply for regularisation of unapproved plots, another website will be opened for registration of unauthorised structures shortly.

 "The website to file applications seeking regularisation of   would be available to the public within a week," an official with the directorate of town and country planning (DTCP) told TOI. The government came out with a regularisation scheme to give relief for unauthorised structures by notifying Section 113-C of the   and Country Planning Act on June 22 this year. It mandates that unauthorised buildings constructed before July 1, 2007 must apply for regularisation within six months of the notification.
 
 The honorary secretary of the Builders Association of India, Southern Centre, Chennai, S Ramaprabhu said the issue came up at a meeting with officials from the   and Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) two days ago. "During the meeting, government officials clarified that applications for regularising unapproved plots will not cover the buildings constructed over it. Separate applications should be filed for the buildings," he said. 
 
 However, this would be a double blow for owners against the backdrop of hefty penalties for regularising buildings, Ramaprabhu said. "In places like   and Mylapore, the penalties range from between Rs. 6000 and Rs. 8000 per square foot, which may discourage people from applying," he said, adding, “The government must reduce the fine amount to regularise buildings.”
