  Sixty-year-old Harish Parmar — who was allegedly set ablaze on Thursday by his daughter-in-law Komal Parmar, her sister Madhuri and mother Manju — succumbed to his injuries on Friday morning. Police have now invoked the IPC section for murder against the accused. Parmar used to work in   and had returned to Ahmedabad eight months ago. “We also recorded Parmar’s   in the presence of a magistrate, where he said that he was first pushed to the floor by Manju and then the three poured a flammable liquid on him and set him ablaze,” said a senior  .

 “We are currently investigating the details mentioned in the FIR,” the official said.
 
 Police sources said Parmar, a resident of Vadaj, and his elder son Manish had gone to meet his younger son Arun, who was living with his wife Komal and their two-year-old son Harsh, in Sardarnagar on Thursday morning, to sort out a family dispute.
 
 Police sources said when Manish was outside the house, Parmar went in and as he was about to take his Harsh in his arms, Komal’s mother Manju rushed in and started abusing him.
 
 “Manju pushed Parmar to the floor and when he was lying down, somebody poured a flammable liquid on him from behind and set him ablaze. Manish rushed into the house on hearing his father’s cries for help and doused the flames. Parmar was then rushed to Civil Hospital, where he died on Friday,” said a police official.
