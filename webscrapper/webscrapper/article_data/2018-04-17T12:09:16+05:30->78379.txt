There’s a reason why Punjabi singer and actor Diljit Dosanjh is popular as the ‘Pagg Wala Munda’. The guy carries his turban with utmost swag and refuses to compromise on any grounds when it comes to the turban. On the official Turban Day of Oslo, Norway, the star received a special gift - a designer turban from Susanne Holzweiler. Diljit, who was overwhelmed with this gesture, took to Facebook to share his gratitude. In his post he wrote "    Feeling Honoured to be a part of the Celebration       @kavarsingh  THOSE WHO KNOW HOW TO TIE TURBAN ALSO KNOW HOW TO PROTECT THE TURBAN  ". He also shared this video: 
  
   




Every year in the month of April, Oslo celebrates the Turban Day. It’s a day when around 2,500 turbans are shared for free. The day is celebrated with the spirit to bring different cultures together and paint the city in vibrant colors. Diljit, who recently released ‘Sajjan Singh Rangroot’, is presently busy in his album’s promotional shoot and next Bollywood project ‘Arjun Patiala.’
