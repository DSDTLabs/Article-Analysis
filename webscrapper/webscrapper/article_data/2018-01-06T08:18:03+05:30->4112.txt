HYDERABAD: Justice B Siva Sankara Rao of Hyderabad High Court on Friday quashed the   case against  , accused number 13 in the Emaar Scam case. The judge stated that without establishing the criminal intention of a person and his involvement in aconspiracy, it is impermissible under law to make a person accused in a scam by citing the mere arrival of some cash into his bank account.

 The judge pronounced this order after hearing the petition filed by Madhu, urging the court to quash the case against him by contending that it was filed by the probe agency ‘without any evidence’ against him. The case of the CBI is that some of the scam money made from the sale of   at Gachibowli in Hyderabad was sent to Madhu’s Dubai bank account. His father Koneru   was already arrayed as a key accused in the case. Based on statements of two villa customers who said that they deposited Rs 4.5 crore in Madhu’s account, CBI named Madhu an accused.
 
 The judge said there was no evidence to show that Madhu instructed the two villa buyers to deposit money in his account. “Madhu has shown that a part of this money was loan and the remaining investment in some business. The loan part was repaid after registration of the CBI case against him. There was no evidence to even contend that there was conspiracy, meeting of minds, mens rea (intention to commit crime) etc. He is a resident of Dubai and there is no proof that he was part of the conspiracy,” the judge said and quashed the case against Madhu. Out of 80 villa plots sold, the money deposited in the account of Madhu pertains to only two plots and it is not even the case of the prosecution that all the scam money made from the sale of villas went to this Dubai account, the judge said.
