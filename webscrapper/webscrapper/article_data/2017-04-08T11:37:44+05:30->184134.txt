INDORE: Granting stay on   of houses for   between Sarwate and  , the Indore bench of high court has ordered the   to submit a   for the people whose houses are proposed to be demolished for the same. 

 A division bench comprising Justice SC Sharma and Justice RK Dubey passed this order in a petition moved by 44 residents of Kadav Ghat and   area, who had been issued notices by the IMC two days ago. 
 
 The petition, filed on their behalf by senior advocate Anand Mohan Mathur, challenged the master plan according to which road widening work is being carried out. 
 
 "Some of the houses which are proposed to be demolished by the IMC had received building permissions in 2014. If the master plan 2020 had been formulated in 2008, why were the people given permission to build houses on the area which was a part of the road in the master plan," advocate Mathur has said in the petition. 
 
 The petition also challenges the master plan, alleging that the plan is in violation of certain sections of the town and country planning act. 
 
 The respondents, which include district collector, divisional commissioner, joint director town and country planning department, state government and director of the town and country planning department have been granted four weeks to file their reply. 
 
 IMC has been instructed to file the rehabilitation plan by the next date of hearing. 
 
 The residents of the area between   and Sarwate bus stand were given notices by the IMC on April 5. Following the eviction notices, the residents of the area had also carried out a candle light march to protest it. 
 
 As many as 400 houses might be demolished by the IMC for the purpose of road widening as per the master plan. 
 
 Another petition challenging the master plan 2020 in entirety is also pending before the high court.
