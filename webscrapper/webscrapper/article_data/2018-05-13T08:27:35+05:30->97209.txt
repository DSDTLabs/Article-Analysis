KOLKATA:   post uploaded by a young woman travelling on a private bus that reportedly shows a   on Saturday, leading to Kolkata Police immediately filing an   and taking to Facebook to announce that the accused would be identified and arrested at the earliest. Within an hour, accused 
  was picked up from the   area.

 
 The cops traced the bus and used leads from the conductor to nab the hawker who is a resident of Baidyabati. This is probably the first case where a man found flashing in a bus has been arrested after the officers received “several messages and letters” from the public.
 
 According to the woman, she was travelling on a bus with her friend from   around noon when she caught Rai flashing. She asked the conductor to intervene. But he refused. None of the other passengers came to her rescue either, letting Rai escape.
 
 The woman also alleged this was not the first time Rai had flashed her. “About 15 days ago, he had done the same thing. I was afraid to react then. I also did not have evidence. This time though, I have evidence,” she said.
 
 The post went viral within hours and Facebook users tagged Kolkata Police, demanding action. By 6pm, cops went online stating that the case had been drawn up.
 
 “There was no legal challenge in converting this into an FIR,” said an officer.
