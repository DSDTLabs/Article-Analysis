GREATER NOIDA: Thieves escaped with cash and jewellery worth nearly Rs 45 lakh from the house of a steel trader in Dadri on Sunday night. 

 Nearly Rs 22 lakh in cash, 280 grams of gold and diamond jewellery have been stolen by the thieves who used 10-12 chairs to reach the first floor of double-storey building. The owner, Dinesh Garg (60), resides in Ayodhyaganj area of Dadri with his family. Their house is situated on the first floor while their shop is on ground floor.
 
 Around 8.30 pm on Sunday, Dinesh had gone to attend a function organised by his cousin Yogender Gupta. While Dinesh’s wife, son, daughter-in-law and grandson remained at the function, he returned home around 9.40 pm.
 
 However, to his shock, the house was found ransacked with the safe opened and money and jewellery worth lakhs missing.
 
 “Three cups, a pouch of 8 PM whisky, a corex cough syrup bottle have been found in the house. From the number of cups, we are guessing that it is the work of three persons,” inspector Azad Singh said.
