HYDERABAD: The rape of a woman at out-patient block of   drew sharp reactions from junior doctors who alleged large sections of the state-run health facility are not monitored. This, despite repeated demands for the past three years after a doctor committed suicide at the same spot - on the first floor of the OP block. Worse, some complained that the hospital campus is extremely prone to crime, even with the presence of security personnel, as these guards are seldom found at their designated spots. 

 
 "After the suicide, there were massive protests demanding better vigilance at the facility. Yet, the hospital authorities have done little to upgrade security coverage," Dr S Anand, advisor, Telangana Junior Doctors' Association and a resident at OGH, said. While   cameras installed at the hospital helped police nab the offenders, doctors claimed the existing cameras were not enough to cover the entire facility. 
 
 "CCTV cameras only cover entrance/exit points, while all other areas are uncovered. Also, there are hardly any security guards in other areas of the campus," Dr Anand added. 
 
 While the OGH management expressed shock over the rape and stressed there are at least 200 employees on duty in the OP block during night hours, they admitted that the portion of the floor, where the crime took place, was slightly secluded. 
 
 While the accused ward boy, B  , has been working at the hospital for the last 15 years - as per OGH records - the home guard (also the co-accused in the case) has been associated with the facility for the last couple of months.
