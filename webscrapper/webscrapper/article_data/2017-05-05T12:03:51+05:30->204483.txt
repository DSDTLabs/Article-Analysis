PATNA: Stung by poor ranking of Bihar’s cities in the Centre-sponsored   (cleanliness survey)-2017, the state government on Thursday announced it would now on not participate in the survey.
 
  None of the 27 Bihar cities has figured even among top 100 of the 434 cities across the country which were surveyed in January-February this year. Union urban development minister   earlier in the day declared the results of the annual survey initiated by his ministry “to foster a healthy competition among cities for improving cleanliness standards”.
  
  “This looks like a farce. The survey was conducted when Patna was spick and span for Prakashotsava celebrations. How do you justify Patna’s 262nd rank?” asked Bihar urban development and housing department minister  .
  
  Hazari alleged BJP was out to derive political mileage from the survey in poll-bound states like Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh. “That’s why the Centre is tampering with the results. The cities in BJP-ruled states, except UP, have been given better ranks. Varanasi at 32nd is an exception, it being PM Narendra Modi’s parliamentary constituency,” he said and pointed out Varanasi ranked 418 in 2015 when 476 cities participated in the survey.
  
  Hazari recalled Mysore ranked number one in 2015 and 2016 while Kerala’s Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram were among top ten cities in 2015. “Mysore has suddenly slipped to fifth position while none of the Left-ruled Kerala cities could make it to even top 200 in 2017,” he said and wondered how Agartala, arguably the country’s cleanest city, was ranked 290th this year.
  
  The Bihar minister also said he now knew West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee took a wise decision by not allowing the cities in her state to participate in the survey.
  
  Bihar’s best performer this year is Biharsharif which stood 147th. Kishanganj is a poor second with all-India rank 257. Bagaha and Katihar have the dubious distinction of figuring among the dirtiest ten cities at 432nd (third last) and 430th (fifth last) ranks.
  
  Bihar’s other participating cities included Bettiah (270), Hajipur (272), Bhagalpur (275), Sasaram (278), Bodh Gaya (293), Muzaffarpur (304), Jehanabad (307), Buxar (327), Dehri (334), Purnea (342), Ara (390), Danapur (391), Saharsa (396), Begusarai (404), Jamalpur (414), Munger (415) and Chhapra (422).
  
  Meanwhile, the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to lodge its protest against the state capital’s ranking. “We will write to the Centre, seeking detail of the parameters on which the surveyors based the rankings,” PMC commissioner   said.
