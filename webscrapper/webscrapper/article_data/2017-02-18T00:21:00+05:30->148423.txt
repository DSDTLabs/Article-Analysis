Jaipur: Holoptelea  , which affects patients suffering from nasal allergies and asthma, has been detected early this season in the city.

 Health experts asked patients to take extra care as holoptelea trees can be found in large numbers at Central Park. It is a common tree and can be seen almost everywhere.
 
 Patients having asthma and those who are vulnerable to allergies caused by holoptelea pollen should avoid places with such trees. “It’s an allergy alert and patients should take precautions while going out. They should cover their mouth and nose with cloth to prevent such pollen from entering the respiratory tract,” said Dr Virendra Singh, former pulmonologist at Sawai Man Singh Hospital.
 
 The pollen was detected at the Asthma Bhawan. Holoptelia is a notorious pollen present in Rajasthan that worsens asthma and nasal problems in susceptible patients.
 
 Such patients should avoid outdoor activities and put a wet mask while going for walks or riding a scooter.
 
 Last year, holoptelea pollens were detected on February 28. “Early pollination cannot be explained precisely. The probable reason is global warming. Every year, the pollination period is showing a small increase,” said Dr Nishtha Singh, chest consultant and executive director, Asthma Bhawan.
