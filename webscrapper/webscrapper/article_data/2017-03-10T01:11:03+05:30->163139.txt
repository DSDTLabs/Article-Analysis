MUMBAI: Kaali Peeli drivers are almost ready with their mobile app, with a control room by the month-end. At least 2,000 drivers plan to join the new City Taxi scheme as ‘aggregator cabs’ and operate with this kulocabs app.

 K K Tiwari of Swabhiman Sanghatana taxi union said, “While some drivers plan to join Ola or Uber platforms under the scheme, many have approached our union and want to use an app. We, therefore contacted developers of kulocabs to make an app exclusively for booking   here. It will be launched this month.”
 
 The transport department last week unveiled the taxi scheme, giving Kaali Peeli drivers flexibility to switch over to the app-based platform. The drivers will have to install an AC and GPS in the taxis after the switchover. 
 
 Tiwari said in the initial phase at least 2,000 cabbies will use the app. “We expect the number to increase to 5,000 in the coming months,” he said. The city has 38,000 registered Kaali Peelis, of which 22,000 ply. More than 50% are expected to migrate to   in the coming months, taxi trade sources said. 
 
 Shivkumar Singh from kulocabs said, “We are giving the app some finishing touches. We are incorporating most features provided by apps of Ola and Uber. The objective is to give commuters ease of booking taxis and ensure safe travel.” 
 
 Tiwari said, “You will not only get AC comfort of an aggregator cab but also the service of an experienced Kaali Peeli driver.” 
 
 He said hiring a taxi will be simpler, more reliable and transparent, and there will be no problem of refusal.
