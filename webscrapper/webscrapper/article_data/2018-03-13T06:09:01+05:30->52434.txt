SRINAGAR: Jammu & Kashmir chief minister   sacked her finance minister   on Monday, three days after he said at an event in Delhi that Kashmir was not a political issue.

 Speaking at the event organised by PHD Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Drabu had said: “J&K is not at all a conflict state nor is it a political issue. It ought to be looked as a society-related issue from communities not only from within but also worldwide.” He further added that the need of the hour was to rebuild the economy of J&K “more through participated efforts of civil society and institutions of excellence as Kashmir should not be looked at (from) the twin angles of conflict and political spectrum”.
 
 Sources said the PDP leadership had written to Drabu seeking an explanation for his remarks but he did not bother to reply. On Monday, the ruling party’s core committee met and decided to sack him and subsequently   sent a letter to Governor N N Vohra informing him about her move. Mehbooba will hold the finance portfolio for now.
 
 Sources said some of the decisions which Drabu took as finance minister made him unpopular in the government. Among them was replacing the existing ‘treasury system’.
