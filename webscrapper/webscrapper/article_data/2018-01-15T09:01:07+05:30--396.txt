Pant remained unbeaten on 116 off 38 balls. The knock included 12 thunderous sixes and eight boundaries. Delhi coasted to a 10-wicket win in the  .
 
 After reaching the landmark with a six, the fastest by an Indian in T20 domestic cricket, Pant told TOI: "I thought I played at least 45 deliveries today. I felt I was taking it easy. I don't exactly remember if it was a boundary or a six."
 
 His 32-ball hundred against is the second fastest of all time. Only   stands ahead off him with 30-ball feat, when the West Indian opener reached the milestone during IPL 2013.

 Sunday morning was an important outing for this destructive wicketkeeper batsman. It was his first hundred in almost a year. Struggling for runs, he fell off the selectors' radar.
 
 "I keep repeating, I play the ball according to it's merits. I play my normal game and if it comes off well, something like this happens. But my hundreds generally come at a fast rate. That's my game," he said. "Of course, my form dipped a bit. But I need to forget this now and move on," he added.
