MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday sought the response of the   (MMRCL) on whether or not “wrong” trees are being hacked for the Colaba-Andheri Seepz Metro-III corridor.

 A vacation bench of Justice   and Justice M S Karnik heard a plea by activist Kunal Birwadkar urging the court to stay the felling of trees saying otherwise “irreparable harm” will be done. 
 
 Birwadkar is an intervener in petitions, including by residents, challenging the felling of over 5,000 trees for the 33.5km line. He referred to a list prepared by the Tree Authority for MMRCL enumerating the trees to be cut or transplanted at Worli. “Trees that are supposed to be transplanted are cut,’’ he said. 
 
 The HC on May 5 had vacated its interim stay in view of an undertaking by MMRCL to replant and transplant trees affected in the same area on completion of the station construction. Senior advocate Anil Sakhare, representing BMC, said the Supreme Court has not interfered with the HC’s order. 
 
 Sayeed Mulani, appearing for a petitioner Nina Verma, said the Supreme Court has granted liberty to petitioners to place all grievances before a two-judge committee to be formed by the HC. “Since the two-judge committee is yet to be constituted, it (MMRCL) should maintain status quo,’’ he said. Mulani added that while MMRCL has already begun cutting the trees, the two persons appointed by the HC–the member secretary of   and the HC’s deputy registrar–to oversee compliance were scheduled to visit the Cuffe Parade site on Wednesday.
