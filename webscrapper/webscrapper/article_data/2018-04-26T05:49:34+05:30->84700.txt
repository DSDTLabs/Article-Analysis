 Yusuffali had been aggressively investing in real estate projects and sourcing centres in the UK. “We are investing 300 million pounds in various projects that include ‘Great Scotland Yard’, the old headquarters of the Scotland Yard, The Waldorf Astoria-Edinburgh, and a food processing plant in Birmingham,” he said.
 
 He said the   Yard will be opened as a hotel at the end of this year.
