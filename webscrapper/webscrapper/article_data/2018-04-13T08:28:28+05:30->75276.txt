KOLKATA: A day after   has arrested Suman Sinha (37), a resident of  , for allegedly trying to dupe at least three persons by promising them “artificial kidneys” by posing as an official of a top Secunderabad-based hospital, it has now come to notice that he had been camping at two of the city’s most reputed hospitals for the past 15 days, scouting for victims. Both hospitals, located off EM Bypass, specialize in kidney treatment.

 “The accused, a BCA from an engineering college in Kolkata, had resigned from his job in November 2018. He said he had come across some writings on artificial kidney by a Bangladeshi-born American scientist and engineer, who reportedly co-invented world’s first implantable artificial kidney, along with a nephrologist, based in the US. He obtained the original email id of the engineer and manipulated it in the name of the US-based engineer.
 
  
 Cops said the accused has so far deceived two patients from Medica hospital, which finally lodged the police complaint after seeing through his trick. He also deceived another patient from a Mukundapur hospital.
 
 “We have found names of seven other people, who had been tricked by the accused. We are in the process of contacting them,” said an officer.
 
 The cops said the accused has been throwing up names familiar on the internet.
 
 “He is dropping off names to pass off his attempt as genuine. But the receipts he provided after collecting Rs 1300 from each has so far proved that he is faking it,” claimed an officer.
 
 “The suspect convinced patients, Md Ismail, Sanjeet Roy and Sarmistha Ghosh, for transplantation of their damaged organs with   at the Secunderabad hospital. The suspect then produced false documents and asked them to sign up for the programme. Later, one of the patients lodged complaints of cheating and criminal conspiracy,” an officer said.
