GURUGRAM: A retired Armyman reportedly shot his 25-year-old drunk son four times in self-defence after the latter tried to shoot him first in a fit of rage. The youth is being treated in hospital and is stable now while the father is at large.

 Mor Dhwaj, the youngest of four children of retired soldier Jagdish Chandra (60), was known to come home drunk on most nights, police said. When he returned home drunk around 8.30pm on Friday, his sister, who was visiting her family in   from Pachgaon (where lives with her husband and his family), an argument broke out between them. She confronted him on his addiction and how he abused their parents, verbally and physically.
 
 As the argument heated up, Dhwaj hit his sister and parents, then reached out for the licensed revolver kept in the cupboard nearby and went towards Jagdish, as per the complaint lodged by his mother Rama Devi at the Civil Line police station. Rama snatched the revolver from him and handed it to his father. As Dhwaj turned around and was leaving the room, Jagdish shot at him on the back, said  , the officer investigating the case. But he continued walking. The father then went out and shot Dhwaj thrice — on the lower back, near the rib cage and on the neck.
 
 Dhwaj’s nephew, who also lived in the same house, took him to a nearby hospital where he was denied entry. The injured was then taken to Paras hospital. Dhwaj’s mother, in her compliant, said that Jagdish shot Dhwaj in self-defence and that their lives were endangered when their son reached out for the gun. Dhwaj is the youngest among the four siblings, two sisters and a brother, and is the only one unmarried. His condition has improved; he is responsive and conscious but not in a condition to give a statement, the officer said. 
 
 An FIR has been registered against Jagdish under sections 27 and 54 of the Arms act and Section 307 (attempt to murder) of IPC.
