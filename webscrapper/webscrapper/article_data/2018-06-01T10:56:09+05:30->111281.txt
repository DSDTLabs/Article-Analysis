 The 25-year-old Goyat was picked up by   for Rs 1.51 crore which was Rs 1 lakh more than what Indian football captain Sunil Chhetri got from Bengaluru FC (BFC) during the previous season of the India Super League.
 
 Incidentally, both BFC and Steelers are owned by Jindal Steels Works.

 Ghouse said there is no comparison between Chhetri and Goyat as the former is one of the greatest footballers India has ever produced. He felt Goyat will prove his worth in the league. “We have high hopes. He is an extremely talented player and we see huge potential in him.”
 
 “I can’t believe this. I had never expected this amount,” Goyat had said after he attracted the bid. He had made his debut with   in the fourth season and was part of the title-winning Patna Pirates in the fifth season. He is an extremely effective raider who has 250 raid points from the 39 matches at an average of 6.41.
 
 “Goyat emerging as the most expensive non-cricket athlete in the country speaks volumes of the popularity which kabaddi has achieved in the country,” PKL commissioner Anupam Goswami told TOI. “Six players getting over a crore shows the sport has become aspirational for youngsters today,” he added.
