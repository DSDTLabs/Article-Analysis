MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Friday turned down the plea for a   probe into a case of corruption involving public servants, taking into account the materials seized by the   (IT) department, and allowed the   to continue the enquiry by constituting a special team. The court also issued directions to appoint a vigilance commissioner.

  said the records show the home secretary directed the DVAC to hold a preliminary enquiry into the allegations of corruption which is in progress. The apprehension that the DVAC would not hold impartial enquiry into the   in view of the involvement of a minister and high ranking police officers has no basis, the judge said. 
 
 The director of VAC shall constitute a special team to conduct an enquiry and it should take an order only from the vigilance commissioner and not share the materials collected during investigation with any public servant. There should not be any kind of interference in the course of enquiry by political executive or public servants, more particularly the DGP or any other officers against whom allegations are made. The director of DVAC must scrupulously follow the vigilance manual in conducting an enquiry and submitting the report in time, the judge said. 
 
 As a direction to the IT, the judge said the principal director of investigation (PDIT), Chennai, shall provide the entire incriminating materials seized from the gutkha manufacturer to the director of VAC for taking follow-up action. 
 
 The judge also ordered the director to hold a detail enquiry into the missing of file from the chief secretary office.
 
 “We appreciate efforts of IT for exposing those who are dealing in illegal gutkha and pan masala trade and their patrons and well-wishers in government service and to unearth the black money and evasion of tax,” the judge said.
