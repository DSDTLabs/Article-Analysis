CHANDIGARH: Come Monday, the   (UPSC) will make it clear if it has approved the upper age limit — from 56 years to 59 years — for the selection of the director principal at the   and hospital (GMCH) 32.
 
 Even though the UPSC has already notified the upper age limit as 56 years, a representation was sent by the UT health department if it was keen on reconsidering its decision.
 
 
 The UT health department also mentioned that if it does not receive any reply from the commission till April 16, it would consider it as a ‘No’ and continue the age threshold that was already in place.
 
 “Once a notification is drafted, there is no need to appeal for reconsideration. There has been an ad hoc arrangement in the medical college since the term of the former director principal Dr Atul Sachdeva ended. Thereafter, Dr A K   held additional charge of the director principal till December 2017. As of now, Dr B S Chavan is holding additional charge,” said an administrative officer.
 
 After the UPSC notified the upper age limit as 56 years, a representation was sent by some senior doctors the commission to reconsider its decision. The representation mentioned that since they were never given a chance, their appeal too must be taken care of.
 
 Last year, the UT administration had sent a request to the UPSC to amend the upper age limit and other eligibility rules for the post. As the retirement age was never enhanced to 62 years, it was proposed that the commission could consider 59 years instead of 56 years.
 
 The proposed draft also recommended that after the director principal completes his five-year tenure, he can become the head of the department until he turns 62 years old.
