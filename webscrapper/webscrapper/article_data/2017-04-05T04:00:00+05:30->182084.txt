Vadodara/ Anand: As milk procurement has started dwindling with the early onset of summer, the Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers Union Limited popularly known as Amul Dairy, has decided to increase milk procurement price paid to farmers by Rs 20 per kilo fat. 

 With effect from April 11, the milk union will pay Rs 630 per kilo fat to its milk producers instead of Rs 610 per kilo fat which it pays currently. 
 
 “This increase has become necessary due to sudden changes in the climatic conditions. We are witnessing a decline of 50,000 litres per day procurement since last fortnight. This is usually seen in the month of May,” said Amul Dairy’s managing director Dr K Rathnam, adding that input costs like feed and fodder have also gone up.
 
 “We want to enable farmers to sustain the increase in cost of maintaining cattle with higher input costs,” he said.
 
 With this, the dairy has increased procurement price paid to farmers for the sixth time in a span of one year. In April last year, the dairy was paying Rs 570 per kilo fat of milk. After the price increase, farmers will earn Rs 1.30 per litre more for buffalo milk with six percent fat, while they will earn 90 paise more per litre for cow milk with 3.5 percent fat. 
 
 Nearly 2.60 lakh farmer members, who supply milk to the union will benefit from the move. The dairy presently collects 22.50 lakh litres of milk per day in Gujarat and 6.75 lakh litres per day from states like Maharashtra, Punjab and West Bengal. 
 
 The buffalo milk procurement price has increased by Rs 3.70 per litre while the cow milk procurement price has increased by Rs 2.70 per litre in last one year. “While the consumer price has increased by 4 to 5 % after the Rs two per litre price hike, the price that we pay to farmers has increased by 10.5 percent in a year,” said Rathnam.
