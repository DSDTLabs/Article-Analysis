Panaji: Goa witnessed temperatures within the normal range during the peak of summer from mid-April, as the mercury hovered around 34.0 degrees. The good news is that the trend is likely to continue for, at least, a week.

 The meteorological centre recorded maximum temperature of 34.0 degrees Celsius on Saturday, just a negligible 0.5 degrees above normal. The minimum temperature of 25.3 degrees C recorded on Saturday was almost a degree below normal, as nights have also been within normal range.
 
 While the rest of the country reeled under a heat wave, with the mercury soaring above 40 degrees C in some places, the cooling sea breezes setting out early kept the mercury at normal level. “The sea breezes have been providing relief from the heat,” an official from meteorological centre, Altinho, said. 
 
 A trough persisting from south Konkan to Comorin areas across interior Karnataka and interior Tamil Nadu extending upto 1.5km above mean sea level yielded rainfall in upper ghat areas outside Goa. But, meteorologists said that it would have no effect on the state’s weather, as the trough extends southward away from Goa. The met centre has forecast that weather is most likely to be dry over Goa during the next five days.
 
 The maximum is likely to be 34.0 degrees C and minimum 25.0 degrees C on Sunday.
