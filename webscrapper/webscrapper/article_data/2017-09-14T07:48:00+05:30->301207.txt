Shimla: After the brutal sexual assault and murder of a seven-year-old boy in Ryan International School in Delhi, Shimla district administration has sought immediate safety arrangements in all private and government schools of Shimla to check child sexual abuse.

 In a meeting with principals and administration of all schools in Shimla, deputy commissioner Rohan Chand Thakur on Tuesday told them to conduct special programmes to make students aware about various issues, including sexual abuse. The DC also asked them to install CCTV cameras outside washrooms at the earliest.
 
 “The schools must ensure special arrangements for children below 7 years and (they) must not be sent alone to washrooms,” Rohan said.
 
 He said that before hiring any teaching or non-teaching staff, a candidate must undergo a special procedure in which producing character certificate after police verification must be made mandatory. “The already present staff should also submit necessary information to school authorities,” he added.
 
 “The part-time workers must also submit their details like adhar card and other documents with school authorities,” he said.
