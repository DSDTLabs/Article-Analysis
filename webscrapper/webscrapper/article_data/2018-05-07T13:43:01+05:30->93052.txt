The bus stands in different areas of the city are no doubt in a pitiable shape. Complaints about bus shelters in the city are endless. Most of these bus stands are now occupied by beggars, who seek shelter under the shades. Vegetable and fruit vendors park their carts too. Bus drivers do not follow traffic instructions and are always in a hurry. None of the public buses stop at proper stoppages. Commuters complain that drivers ignore them and stop buses at random, causing a lot of inconvenience to the commuters. PT lensman went around town and look what he found...

 
 Vidyut Bhawan: There is no sitting arrangement here. City administration has paid no heed to put a route map to highlight bus arrival timings.
