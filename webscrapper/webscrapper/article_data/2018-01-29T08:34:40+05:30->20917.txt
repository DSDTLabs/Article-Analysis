HYDERABAD: Scientists have now unraveled the mystery of how the   steals iron from the human body to utilise it for survival. Iron is an important nutrient for all living beings and the iron-deprived Mycobacterium tuberculosis that causes   hijacks the iron content from the host's body to fulfil its needs.

 In TB patients, iron content is greatly reduced leading to complications. Researchers have found the mechanism of iron theft by TB bacteria. The finding would help in deprivation of iron to the pathogen through appropriate medical interventions. This would kill the TB bacteria in the body.
 
 Researchers from the Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh and the National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, SAS Nagar, Punjab, presented their findings at the ongoing   (ICCB 2018) on Sunday. 
 
 "Iron plays a crucial role in the establishment and outcome of any infection. To gain hold of iron content, TB bacteria deploys a molecule called Siderophore that binds and transport iron from the body of the human host. 
 
 TB bacteria is also able to leech iron from hosts without deploying of  , by hijacking a special type of protein (sGAPDH) to traffic iron into the infected TB cells.
 
 "There is an enhanced uptake of iron replete lactoferrin into TB bacteria infected cells. Knocking down of sGAPDH resulted in a significantly decreased delivery of iron. The study uncovered a new pathway of iron acquisition by TB bacteria by hijacking host iron trafficking machinery for maintaining its own iron nutrition," they said.
