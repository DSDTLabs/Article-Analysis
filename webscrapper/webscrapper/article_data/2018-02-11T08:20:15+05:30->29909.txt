AMRITSAR: Recent skirmishes on the India-Pakistan border have allegedly led to the cancellation of visit of Hindu jatha (group of pilgrims) to Katasraj in Pakistan to   from February 11to 17.

 “Neither the government of India has given clearance to the Hindu pilgrims’ visit nor the   commission has issued visas even as we had submitted passports and visa fee well in advance,” Shiv Partap Bajaj, president of Kendriya Sanatan Dharam Sabha (North India), told the TOI on Friday.
 
 
 The sabha had submitted to the Pakistan high commission in New Delhi the passports of 191 pilgrims from eight states for visas. The devotees had planned to gather in Amritsar on Saturday before crossing over to Pakistan via Attari border a day later, he added.
 
 
 “Under these circumstances, we will not be able to go on the pilgrimage. A few pilgrims from Kolkata have already arrived in Amritsar,” Bajaj said while holding the border skirmishes between forces of two countries responsible for their visit’s cancellation.
 
 
 Sources said the Pakistan government was not keen on the visit of   after expulsion of   Property Board chairman
