AHMEDABAD: This can’t be termed as a development model. According to the recently released figures of  , specialists, radiographers and nursing staff in rural areas,   finds itself among the BIMARU states —Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.

  The figures released by the Union ministry of health and family welfare exposed the severe shortfall of doctors in the state. According to the report, Gujarat has been witnessing a shortfall of 1,140 specialists against the required strength of 1,288 in community health centres (CHCs). Besides, the state has just 1,105 doctors working at the primary health centres (PHCs) against the required strength of 1,314. 
 
 The shortfall of doctors may become a big hurdle in coping with health-related issues in the flood-hit areas of the state where there is a strong probability of epidemic. 
 
 Activists working in the rural health sector have also come across paucity of doctors in rural areas of Gujarat.
 
 Smita Bajpai, an activist working with a voluntary organization, said that the issue is very complex. “Doctors these days prefer private practice even though the government has good remuneration in offer for them for working in rural areas,” said Bajpai. Regions like Kutch and Dang have been witnessing severe shortfall of doctors and specialists at PHCs and CHCs, she said, adding that the areas where infrastructure development is not proper, doctors do not prefer to go.
 
 Pankti Jog, who works for the rights of saltpan workers, said that there is just one doctor for three PHCs at Kharaghoda in Surendranagar district near Little Rann of Kutch, and he also has to take care of mobile health van in that area.
 
  and health commissioner J P Gupta were not available for their comments on the issue.
