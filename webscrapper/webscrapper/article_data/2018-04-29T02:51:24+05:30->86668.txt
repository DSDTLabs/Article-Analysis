JODHPUR/AHMEDABAD: Rajasthan police faced embarrassment on Saturday when a 15-minute audio clip of rape convict Asaram went viral. Asaram, who is serving life term in   for raping a minor, says in the clip that his time in prison is "ephemeral" and adds, "Achche din ayenge (Good days will come)".

 
 Jail authorities claimed on Saturday the audio may have been recorded when Asaram made a call from the Jodhpur jail to a devotee, Nishant Jadhvani, in the Motera Ashram in Ahmedabad on Friday. In the clip, Asaram says, "27 tarik sham 7 baje ka taja bulletin sab ashram mein faila do (Spread this April 27, 7pm bulletin in all ashrams)."
 
 DIG, jails, Rajasthan, Vikram Singh Karnavat said to TOI the STD facility installed for prisoners is new and has shortcomings. "Inmates are permitted to make calls on any two given numbers. These numbers are verified by Rajasthan ATS," he said. Claiming the audio was not leaked from jail, he said: "May be this communication was recorded and played on social media."
 
 In the clip, Asaram says he will first arrange for the release of co-accused 'beti Shilpi,' and 'beta Sharat' from jail.
 
 
 
 
 Hefty cash bribes, property offers and 1,600 threat letters, were some of the attempts to dissuade the Jodhpur police officer Ajay Pal probing the rape case of self-styled godman Asaram.
