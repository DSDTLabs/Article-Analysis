AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday issued notice to the director general of police, CID (crime) and investigators on a petition demanding transfer of probe in the rioting complaint filed in Kodinar town in Saurashtra against ex-BJP MP   and others.

 The HC had earlier transferred the probe to CID (crime) on a complaint by one Jetunbibi Salot, whose house was targeted by Solanki and his supporters. The petitioner has approached the HC again seeking transfer of probe from officer of ranks of police inspector and PSI to   rank officials in CID (crime).
 
 The petitioner has complained that officers of the rank of PI and PSI are not competent and courageous enough to carry out unbiased and fair investigation against Solanki, who carries political clout, money, and muscle power. Salot is now urging that the probe should be taken up by a special investigation team of IPS officers. She has argued that no investigation was carried out in this case ever since CID (crime) registered the complaint on HC order.
 
 The petitioner says the police have not provided any protection to the complainant and her family. The henchmen of Solanki had threatened everyone in the locality and told them to give statements mentioning that Solanki was not present at the time of the incident. The petitioner says Solankiâ€™s nephew,  , who is an accused in the murder of   activist Amit Jethava, has repeatedly tried to pressurize her husband Rafiq Salot to compromise with the accused.
