HYDERABAD: Indians got a mixed draw for the 108th edition of the All England Championships. PV Sindhu got a comfortable draw while her senior   is drawn against her long-time nemesis Tai Tzu Ying in the $1 million tournament which begins on March 14 in Birmingham.

 
 Since 2013, Saina has been finding it difficult to get past the world No.1 from Chinese Taipei. But facing Tai in the first round could be advantageous to Saina as she will be fresh after a long break. If she upsets Tai, Saina could easily reach the semifinals.
 
 Olympic silver medallist PV Sindhu is in the bottom half of the draw. Sindhu is expected to reach the quarterfinals without breaking much sweat. The lanky shuttler may face world champion   of Japan in the last eight. Despite a comfortable draw, Sindhu said she will be keen to give her best from the first round. “From the first round it’s important to give my best and play my game and not take any player lightly,” Sindhu said.
 
 “It is a challenging draw for us. But I am expecting very good results this time,” said chief coach  . India’s best bet in men’s singles Kidambi Srikanth is pitted against Brice Leverdez of France. Srikanth in all likelihood may progress to the quarterfinals where he may meet either HS Prannoy or Chou Tien Chen of Chinese Taipei.
 
 “It is a good draw. But I am playing All England after a long time and I have to be focused from the first round,” Srikanth said.
 
 The third Indian in men’s singles, Sai Praneeth plays a tough opponent in former world No.1 Wan Ho Son of South Korea in the first round.
