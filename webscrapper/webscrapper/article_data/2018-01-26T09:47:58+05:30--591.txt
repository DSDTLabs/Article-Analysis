CHANDIGARH:   have launched a drive to make the city less noisy at Kalibari temple   by   with the message of make the city honk free. Police said after the awareness drive, they will start issuing challans for honking near the schools, colleges, hospitals and other institutes of the city in future.

 Police said they distributed more than 1,000 stickers to the motorists to make them aware about noise pollution. Traffic police pasted the stickers with the message “I will not honk” on the steering wheels of the cars. The reason behind this was that whenever they see the stickers, they are reminded of their social responsibility and refrain from pressing the horn button.
 
 SSP traffic, UT police Shashank Anand said those who wish to join the campaign of the traffic police can go to Children Traffic Park (CTP) and collect the stickers free of cost for themselves, friends and family members during working hours. Cops said vehicles only related to emergency services like ambulances, fire tenders and police vans, should use their horns or hooters in case of emergencies.
 
 Anand also appealed to the motorists to upload the picture of steering wheels, on which the stickers are being pasted, on twitter by using hashtag #Make-ChandigarhHonkFree.
 
 This is to attract the residents of other other cities to also come forward to join the traffic police campaign.
 
 Police said it has been come to their notice that motorists often honk without any reason. They need to accept the fact that honking would not help them get out of the traffic jams they are usually stuck in, cops said. People also honk near hospitals, schools and colleges.
 
 They said they expected the campaign would make people to think twice before honking in future. Fine for honking near hospitals, schools and colleges is Rs 1,000, said a traffic cop.
