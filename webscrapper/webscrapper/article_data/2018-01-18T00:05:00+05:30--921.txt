Pune: Opposition parties staged a   after the BJP-led general body (GB) in the Pune Municipal Corporation refused to delay the approval of the 2016-17 Environment Status Report ( ) on Wednesday.

 Elected members from the Congress, Shiv Sena, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party alleged that the BJP had not given them enough time to present their views on the report.
 
 BJP had said only two corporators from each party should speak on the report, but the opposition objected to the suggestion saying that they were being deprived of their rights.
 
 “We want more time to study the ESR. It should not be approved in haste. Every elected member wants to speak on a major issue like the ESR. Putting such restrictions is wrong,” said corporators from opposition parties. They demanded that the ESR’s approval be postponed, but the BJP did not support the idea. The agitating corporators left the meeting in protest and the ESR was approved in their absence.
