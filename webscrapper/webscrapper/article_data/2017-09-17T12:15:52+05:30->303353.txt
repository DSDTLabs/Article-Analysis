PUNE: A snacks centre owner, Vijay Pandurang   (34), of Gawali Matha in Bhosari sustained bullet injuries after he was shot at by two motorcycle-borne miscreants near his shop on Saturday. This was the second such incident in two days.

 The suspects fired five bullets at him, of which four found their target.
 
 Gholap was admitted to a private hospital at Chinchwad. His condition is stable, senior inspector   of MIDC Bhosari police station said.
 
 The reason behind the attack has not been ascertained yet. The firing, according to police, took place around 6am on Saturday. Gholap was opening the shutters of his shop —   Snacks Centre — when the suspects, wearing helmets, fired at him from a close range.
 
 He sustained injuries on his arm and waist. A prima facie probe revealed that the firing was the fallout of a monetary dispute, Shingade said. He added that Gholap was associated with a political party, but recently he had turned his focus on his shop and was not affiliated to any party. Gholap did not have any animosity with anybody.
 
 Earlier on June 24 this year, two unidentified men astride a motorcycle opened fire on a 40-year-old builder in front of the Tuljabhavani temple near   bus stand around 11.30am on Saturday. One of the bullets got lodged in his thigh while the other missed the target. 
 
 The Sangvi police had then arrested the 23-year-old daughter of a former corporator of Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation for being involved in the murder plot.
