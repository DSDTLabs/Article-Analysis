LUCKNOW: Following TOI’s report, UP chief minister’s principal secretary   on Monday instructed all education departments — basic , secondary, higher, medical, agriculture, technical and vocational — to remain open on January 31 for   and celebrate the day by holding discussion

 on his (Ravidas) life and work. The order makes it compulsory for teacher and students to attend the programme.
 
 TOI had on January 25 highlighted basic education department’s order to shut schools across the state on January 24 and January 31 for Karpoori Thakur’s   and Ravidas Jayanti, respectively.
 
 The order by   secretary, Sanjay Sinha came after Yogi government had scrapped 15 holidays, most on birth or death anniversaries of famous personalities. While the list of 15 cancelled holidays included Karpoori Thakur’s birth anniversary, it had no mention of Ravidas Jayanti. Officials said, 14 out of 15 holidays cancelled fall under the restricted category.
 
 Goel, in his letter (a copy is with TOI), has asked education departments, particularly basic education to tell students about the personality and ideology of Ravidas. Soon after Goel’s order, Sinha issued fresh directives to basic education officers of all districts on Monday, stating his January 23 order to close schools on January 31stands cancelled.
 
 Last year, CM had expressed concern over shrinking academic session. The 220-day academic session has been reduced to 120 days due to many holidays and if thi s trend continues, there will be no day left for teaching in schools, he had said. Karpoori Thakur’s birth anniversary, Cheti Chand, Parshuram Jayanti, Jamat-ul-Alvida (last Friday of Ramzan), Vishwakarma Puja, Agrasen Jayanti, Maharshi Valmiki Jayanti, Chhath Puja, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel and Acharya Narendra Dev Jayanti, Eid-e-Miladul Nabi, and Chaudhray Charan Singh Jayanti were among the scrapped public holidays.
