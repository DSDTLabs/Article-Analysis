NAVI MUMBAI: Returning to a demanding sport such as powerlifting after a 26-year-old hiatus seem like wishful thinking to many, but not for   (48). The winning streak of the woman who sells sandwiches on the roadside to earn a living continues. Patekar recently won a silver medal at the national competition of Indian   held at Coimbatore. She lifted a total of 217.5 kg in the squat (82.5 kg), bench press (35 kg) and dead lift (100 kg) categories.

 Her comeback is incredible, as she stopped pursuing the sport after her marriage in 1990. “Last November, my daughter Vaibhavi (17) was keen to participate in the district-level powerlifting contest. While training her, I, too, started lifting weights and took part in the state levels, where I won the gold,” said Patekar. 
 
 Way back in 1984, she was among the first batch of girls from Mumbai to take part in powerlifting, when it was considered to be a male bastion. “My sports teacher   at Chembur high school encouraged me then. After my marriage, I did miss my powerlifting days, but was busy taking care of my family. But now, after doing well at the national games at Coimbatore, I am determined to continue,” she said. 
 
 Her daughter, Vaibhavi, an 11th standard student of a Goregaon junior college, is very proud of her mother. “I am inspired to do better in my weight category now,” she said. “If, at my age, I can win medals, I am sure that the younger girls from rural areas can also do very well. That is why, my dream is to start my gym to train future champs,” added Patekar.
