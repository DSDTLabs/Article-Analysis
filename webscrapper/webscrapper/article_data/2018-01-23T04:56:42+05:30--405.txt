CHANDIGARH: The political arm of Dera   wants its supporters across   to approach all   leaders, including MLAs and MPs, and tell them that they were in power only because the dera had backed them in the October 2014 assembly elections, just ahead of its chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim’s conviction in a rape case by a CBI court in   in August last year. 

 
 Senior BJP leaders had met Gurmeet ahead of the assembly elections after which the dera had apparently issued instructions to its followers to back the party. TOI has accessed a copy of the investigation reports of Haryana police, conducted after the violence in Panchkula in which 36 people, all dera supporters, had died in police firing. This includes transcripts of legal wiretaps by the cops in which the Dera’s political wing members are heard telling their followers to build pressure on the BJP ahead of the CBI court’s order. 
 
 One of the transcripts reads: “BJP ki local committee ko, local MLA ya MP ya phir kisi aur se Khattar ko kahlwa do ki ya to faisla hamare haq mein kar do varna aap jano ya hum, apko hamne hi banaya hai” (Go and tell local BJP MLAs and MPs that they should convey to (Haryana CM) Khattar that the decision (court order) should be in our favour. Tell them that they are in power because of us.” 
 
 The call intercepts of dera followers show they were told to contact BJP leaders to ensure Gurmeet Ram Rahim’s acquittal. Six days before the conviction, a conversation between Subhash Chander and Babru Bhan, senior dera functionaries from Hisar, was intercepted in which Bhan is heard saying, “The local BJP committee or local MLA or MP should be asked to convey to Khattar the decision should be in our favour otherwise you know that you were made CM by us”.
