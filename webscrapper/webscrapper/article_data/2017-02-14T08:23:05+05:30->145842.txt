MUMBAI: The crime branch arrested five persons for allegedly killing a marketing executive and dumping his body in Surya river in Palghar last July.

 The police said that the victim, Sachin Mohite, who was a promoter for a multi-level marketing scheme owed the accused Rs 39 lakh. The arrested persons have been identified as Satyakumar Panigrahi alias Dhirenkumar Pillai (37), Sandeep Kumbhar (39) , Kapil Jadhav (32), Mallya Jagvandu alias Babu (33) and Akhlaq Khan alias Chand(44).
 
 Officials said they had a tip-off about Panigrahi being involved in a kidnap-murder of one Prashant Patil. “Later, it transpired that the victim was Mohite, who had gone missing last July.” said inspector Sunil Mane.
 
 On going through the call detail records of Panigrahi’s cellphone, the police came to know that he had been in touch with the other accused and their mobiles were switched off since some days. When the police picked up the accused and grilled them separately, two of them broke down and confessed to Mohite’s  . The accused said Mohite had taken a soft loan of Rs 39 lakh from Pillai, Kumbhar and Khan. “When the trio came to know that Mohite had gone bankrupt and would not pay back their money, they called him to a hotel at Mira Road and beat him up.” he said. When Mohite fell unconscious and died, they got scared. They then dumped the body in the river. 
 
 The police said Patil would stay out of city for six-to-seven months a year and not inform his family. This time too, the family thought Patil was on a business trip till the police informed them that his body was found.
