NAGPUR: Teenagers   and   extended their dream run at the world-level by winning the men’s doubles title at the   tournament at Hanoi on Sunday.

 In a hard-fought summit clash, sixth seeds Chirag and Satwik registered a remarkable come-from-behind victory against fifth seeds Trawut Potieng and Nanthakarn Yordphaisong 17-21, 21-9, 21-15 in 50 minutes to capture their fourth International Challenge title within a short span of few months.
 
 Ranked 59 in the world, Chirag and Satwik, who stunned second seeds and former world No. 1 pair of Hendra Aprida Gunawan and Markis Kido of Indonesia in the semifinal on Saturday, were off to a slow start in the final against Thai pair.
 
 However, after losing the first game narrowly, the tall Indian duo bounced back splendidly to shatter the hopes of Potieng and Yordphaisong, ranked 89 in the world.
 
 The India duo, supported by GoSports Foundation, is jubilant and rated this performance as their best so far.
 
 “We’ve won three International Challenge titles before but I would rate this as the best one because right from the first round we defeated players from China, Indonesia and Thailand. There was not a single easy match for us,” said Mumbai youngster Chirag.
 
 Seventeen-year-old Andhra Pradesh lad Satwik said competition level was quite high in Vietnam.
 
 “Vietnam Open generally is one of the most difficult Challenges on the circuit. So winning this one was quite special. Last year here, we lost in the very first round so this a good result for us. We are eager to continue our good run in the India Open Super Series at New Delhi,” said Satwik.
