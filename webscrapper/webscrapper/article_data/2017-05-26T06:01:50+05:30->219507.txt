PUNE: The   for   college (FYJC) is likely to be delayed by at least a fortnight due to the ongoing chaos over the moderation policy of the Central Board of   

 While most state boards are waiting to declare their results, until the CBSE takes a decision, the process of filling up forms would also be delayed. Earlier, all the board exams were delayed by 10 days in Maharashtra due to the civic elections. While schools remain clueless, there is immense panic and confusion among students and parents.
 
 Parents said that the CBSE should have given some idea of the likely result date in advance to prevent panic. Savita Chouhan, whose son appeared for Std X examination from   number 6 this year, said, “We are checking the CBSE website every day to find out the status of results.”
 
 Another parent, Sanjeev Abhyankar, whose daughter appeared for the exam from Army Public School, said, “There is always a last minute confusion created by the board. These decisions could be taken at the start of the year.”
 
 Army Public School principal Binita Poonekar said, “Children are aware of the developments and the CBSE’s stand on the same through media and internet. We are told by the board that the result would not be announced before Friday.” Poonekar said that once the decision is made, it will not take long to declare the results as everything is computerised. “I am sure the CBSE would take a decision in the interest of students ,” she added.
 
 Dinkar Temkar, deputy director of education for Pune division and the head of Centralised   Committee, said, “We are on track as far as the first stage of the form filling exercise is concerned. However, the actual process depends on the declaration of results.”
 
 Temkar said that last year, the classes started on July 16. A delay of even one week in announcement of results would push the academic year to July-end or August first week.
