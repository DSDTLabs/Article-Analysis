PANAJI: Representatives of 21 NGOs in Goa gathered under the banner of ‘Amhi Goenkar’ in  , on Monday, to demand that chief minister   withdraw his letter to   president B S   on the   issue. They also called upon all 40 MLAs to declare their stand on the issue.

 Convener of ‘Amhi Goenkar’, advocate  , told reporters that “serious concern was raised about the fallout of the government move to share Mhadei river waters with Karnataka”. 
 
 The NGOs said that presently many villages in various parts of Goa face acute water scarcity and that the government should fulfil it’s assurances of providing 24X7 water supply to the state’s residents and farmers, who will be severely affected if Mhadei waters are diverted. 
 
 Joshi said they will commence a series of awareness meetings — on January 6 in Valpoi, January 11 in Ponda, January 12 in Bicholim, January 13 in Mapusa and January 16 in  . 
 
 ‘Amhi Goenkar’ flayed Parrikar for his haste in writing to Yeddyurappa and said the move contradicts Parrikar’s views, as expressed in 2012 when he was CM, of not compromising (on the Mhadei issue) and leaving it to the tribunal to decide the matter.
