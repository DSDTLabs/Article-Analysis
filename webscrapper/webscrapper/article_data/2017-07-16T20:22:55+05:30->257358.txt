CHENNAI: Actor   deserves to be booked under the provisions of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act for a comment on slum people by a participant in the Bigg Boss reality show,   law minister   said on Sunday.
 
  Kamal is hosting the Bigg Boss reality show on a Tamil TV channel. One of the participants in the show commented that some people staying in the Bigg Boss house were “behaving like slum people.”
  
  Addressing reporters in Villupuram, Shanmugam said the actor should take responsibility for the comment by the inmate. 
 
  
  The minister said Kamal had no right to question the functioning of the state government. “Kamal has been continuously criticising the   state government. He has no moral right to comment on people’s life and the government. He was living with a woman without marrying her,” Shanmugam said, referring to the actor’s previous relationship with actress Gautami.
  
  
 
  The minister came to Villupuram to oversee the preparatory work for an MGR centenary function he is organising here. The function will be held on the Janakipuram ground on August 9.
