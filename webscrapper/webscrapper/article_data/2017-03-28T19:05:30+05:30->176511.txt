Bollywood stars 
  and 
  may have never admitted to being in a relationship, but rumours have begun swirling that the two have now called off their alleged romance. The couple, who first met on the sets of the Sanjay Leela Bhansali film ‘Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela’, went on to make ‘Bajirao Mastani’ together and now will feature in the director’s upcoming periodic drama ‘Padmavati’. According to the latest buzz, director Bhansali has allegedly imposed a wedge between the off-screen couple, as he doesn’t want to see the two together publically before the film’s promotions.

 The reason behind this is stated to be the ongoing tension and vandalism on the film sets because certain groups believed that the film had a romantic scene between their on-screen characters of Rani   and Allaudin Khilji. The ‘Padmavati’ team however, has repeatedly assured that no such scene was ever a part of the script. 
 
 Ranveer’s absence at a recent award show in Delhi, where Deepika was present, further fueled these reports. However, a new picture doing the rounds on social media shows the two alleged lovers at the airport. Going by the picture, Ranveer didn’t look too pleased to have his pictures taken. Deepika on the other hand maintained a poised composuer as they drove around in an airport coach. 
 
 
  
 
 Meanwhile, the ‘Padmavati’ team is racing against the clock to get the film ready in time for its 17 November 2017 release.
