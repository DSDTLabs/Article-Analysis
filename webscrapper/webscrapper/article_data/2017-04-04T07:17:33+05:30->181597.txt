GHAZIABAD: Three days after a five-year-old girl was allegedly raped and murdered in Kanawani village of Indirapuram, district magistrate   and SSP Deepak Kumar paid a visit to the aggrieved family members of the girl on Monday. Noida MLA   had also visited the family on Sunday and said he would request the CM to give a compensation of Rs 10 Lakh to the family. 

 Kesarwani said the compensation would be credited to the joint account of the parents as soon as the charge sheet is filed. 
 
 “This is a very tragic incident. The family has demanded that the accused should be arrested at the earliest and he should be given harshest punishment. The entire police force and the administration is working hard to catch him and we believe he would be caught soon," said Kesarwani.
 
 TOI reported on April 2 that the five-year-old girl was allegedly raped and killed in Kanawani's Mohidinpur area on Friday night. Her body was found later in an under-construction building, nearly300 metres from her house. 
 
 Afroz, a 19-year-old mason and a resident of the same locality, is suspected to have committed the crime. He has been missing since the crime was committed. 
 
 “His family members are still in police custody and interrogation is underway. We will also ensure that even from the prosecution’s side, the charge sheet is monitored on a priority basis,” Kesarwani added.
 
 Speaking to TOI, the victim’s father said, "We only want the police to catch the accused without any further delay. We want capital punishment for him and the SSP and DM have assured us speedy probe."
