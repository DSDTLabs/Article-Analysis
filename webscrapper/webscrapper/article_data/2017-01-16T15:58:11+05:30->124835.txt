NAGPUR:   and   had played several Nagpur district finals in the last decade or so. The experienced duo extended their rivalry to the state-level now when they clashed against each other in the 35 plus men's singles final of the 25th Old Monk Maharashtra Veteran State Badminton Championship which concluded at the Modern College Sports Complex in Pune on Sunday.

 In an all-Nagpur summit clash, Dhole overcame the fierce challenge of Dayal 21-18, 21-15 in 29 minutes to clinch the title. Top seed Dhole lived up to his billing to halt the giant-killing run of unseeded Dayal, who was playing his first state veterans tourney.
 
 Dhole added another title to his kitty when he emerged champions in the 35 plus doubles. The top seeded pair of Dhole and   of Pune proved too strong for third seeds   and Sushant Nidodi 21-14, 21-17 in the final.
 
 However, Dhole had to be satisfied with the runners-up position in the 35 plus mixed doubles. Dhole and Prerana   were outclassed by top seeds Sameer Bhagwat and Deanne Rodrigues.
 
 In another all-Nagpur final, second seed Vijay   upset top seed Sharad Mahajan 21-12, 21-18 in the men's singles 60 plus category.
 
 It was a disappointing day for Kiran Makode, an employee of LIC, as he lost both his finals narrowly. In the men's singles 45 plus final, Ashutosh Pednekar shocked top seed Makode 21-18, 11-21, 21-19 in a thriller.
 
 Top seeds Ayaz Bilawala-Shailesh Daga defeated Makode and Vilas Kuvale (Mumbai) 21-7, 21-14 in the 45 plus men's doubles final.
