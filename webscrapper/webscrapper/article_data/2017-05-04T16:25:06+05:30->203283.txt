SAHARSA: The death of alleged criminal   Yadav in police custody on Tuesday has created a furore in the district, particularly in Saur Bazar, Sonbarsa and Patarghat blocks which happened to be the main operation area of deceased.

 Relatives of Navin on Wednesday refused to accept his body for funeral and paralysed traffic on the state highway near   in the town. 
 
 Despite persistent efforts by SDO   and SDPO Subodh Kumar Biswas, the irate mob refused to budge from their demands and insisted on the arrest of the policemen and lodging criminal case against the SHOs of Saur Bazar, Sonbarsa and Saharsa police station. They demanded that senior officers should first hand over a copy of the FIR lodged against police officers and then the body of the deceased will be accepted.
 
 Police sources said Navin wielded considerable influence in the area. He was accused in several cases of murder, extortion and kidnapping under different police stations. “He was arrested by Saharsa police on April 22. Soon after the arrest, he was whisked away to sadar hospital, Saharsa. Later, he was referred to Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital on April 23 where the doctors refused to admit him. He was then sent to   and Hospital. On Tuesday (May 2), he died and the body was brought to Saharsa to be handed over to the parents and family members of the deceased,” said a source. 
 
 SDO Saurabh Zorwal told this newspaper that action would be taken against those who paralysed traffic on the highway. He said the blockade was lifted in the afternoon on assurance of proper investigation by the district administration. 
 
 In reply to a question, the SDO said there was utter confusion about Navin’s health issues. Whereas the family members of Navin claimed his sudden death was a riddle for them as he was not ailing, police have different opinion. The district magistrate has constituted an inquiry and things will be clear only after the report is ready,” he added.
