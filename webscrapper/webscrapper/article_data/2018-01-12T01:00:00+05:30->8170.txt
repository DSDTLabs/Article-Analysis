It was the strong belief and conviction of the team behind ' ' that made the film happen. The sports drama, featuring   Singh, Jimmy Sheirgill, Ravi Kishan and debutante  , will see directors   and   — who belong to different schools of filmmaking — teaming up for the first time.

 From lead actor Vineet’s transformation to resemble a professional boxer to actors like Jimmy and Ravi travelling by train to get into the skin of their respective characters, every cast member has gone to great lengths to do justice to their roles. Zoya also learnt sign language from Sangeeta Gala (who has trained actors for films like Black, Barfi! and Shamitabh) for her character. Aanand L Rai, who always wanted to work with Anurag Kashyap, says, “Anurag is a fearless director and that reflects in his cinema. It was an amazing experience working with him and all the talented actors in this film.” On his part, Kashyap says, “The spirit of the movie was there in all of us, ever since we started work on it. Right from the scripting stage to the casting and workshops, to eventually shooting the film, the entire journey was memorable and I’m glad everyone supported me through it all.”
