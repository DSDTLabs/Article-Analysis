Days after vetoing a no-trust move against Panvel civic chief  , CM   on Monday shunted him out to the   public health scheme.

 An Indian   officer, Shinde was the first administrator and commissioner of the Panvel municipal corporation formed on October 1, 2016.
 
 On March 26, the general body of the BJP-controlled Panvel civic body passed a no-confidence motion against Shinde. Fifty councillors voted in favour of the motion, while 22 voted against it. Fadnavis had asked the Thakur camp to ensure that the no-confidence motion should not be passed in the larger interest of the party, but his directive was ignored. It was stated in the no-confidence motion that in view of his autocratic style of functioning and indifferent attitude, Shinde should be shifted. As per procedure, the resolution was submitted to the urban development department led by the CM for approval.
 
 On April 12, the no-confidence motion was suspended by the department, which said Shinde's continuation in the Panvel corporation was essential in the larger public interest. In a two-page order approved by the CM, it was stated that there was no substance in the charges of corruption or irregularities and nowhere had it been established that there was dereliction of duty. If the no-confidence motion is implemented, it would have an adverse impact on the administration and delay ongoing developmental works, the order said. This was seen as the CM's act of backing the civic chief. But with the transfer, it appeared that the CM had finally succumbed to Thakur's political pressure, sources said.
 
 A section of bureaucrats is upset over Shinde's posting in the state though he belongs to the IRS. "Maharashtra is seeing a new trend. Non-IAS officers are being given key assignments and IAS officers from other states too have taken plum postings. This is not good for the administration," a senior bureaucrat said.
