 The basic objective behind appointing former Congress spokesperson from Assam, Rejaul Karim Laskar, is to coordinate the activities of state-level minority cells and consolidate the minority support base, said AICC sources.

 Laskar recently compiled a report for Congress on strategies for consolidating its support base, especially among the religious minority. Among several recommendations, Laskar's report suggested the formation of a Northeast Congress Minority Coordination Committee (NECMCC), which will serve as a platform for the party to flag issues related to religious minorities.
 
 "The proposed NECMCC at the moment will focus on the common identity (religious identity) in the three states . The chairman for the proposed NECMCC is expected to be appointed from either of these three states," an AICC source said. 
 
 Laskar said he will keep a close watch on the rights and privileges of religious minority communities in non-Congress ruled states. "If there is any violation of rights of minorities in non-Congress ruled states, we will effectively make a response. We are confident Congress will come back to power in three states," he said.
