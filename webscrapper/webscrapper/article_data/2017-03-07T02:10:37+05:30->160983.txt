NEW DELHI: Accusing BJP of having “lost the plot” before the civic polls,   on Monday said that “when it comes to power” after the elections, its first task would be to launch an inquiry into the inaugurations of half-complete projects done by   over the past few days.

 “After AAP comes to power, an inquiry will be done regarding how delayed these projects are and why were they inaugurated before completion. Those found guilty will face punishment,” said AAP’s Delhi convener Dilip Pandey.
 
 Pandey said that since BJP is worried about its fate in the civic elections and is desperate to show that it has done some work, it has started inaugurating projects randomly, even those that were far from completion.
 
 “Instead of working, BJP is indulging in drama. Recently, South Delhi Science Museum was inaugurated even though it is not fit to be used. Similarly, they inaugurated an incomplete parking lot in Kalkaji,” said Pandey.
 
 The Rani Jhansi flyover, which is being constructed for the past 10 years, started with a budget of Rs 70 crore, but has now touched Rs 700 crore. “Each year the urban development department increases its budget. BJP seeks votes on ‘development’. Is the flyover not symbolic of its failure?” said Pandey.
