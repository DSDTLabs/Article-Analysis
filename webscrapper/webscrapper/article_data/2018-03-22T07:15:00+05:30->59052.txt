GURUGRAM: A year after the state government installed automated sanitary napkin dispensers and incinerators in all colleges of the state, to promote menstrual health of women and adolescent girls by ensuring availability of quality sanitary napkins, none of the machines in this city’s five colleges are working. TOI visited four of the colleges and found that none of the machines have ever been used by students.

 Suresh Dhanerwal, principal, Government College at Hailey Mandi, said, “These machines have never worked. Whenever girls urgently wanted sanitary pads, they asked me, and we operated them manually. These machines have never worked as promised.”
 
 Around 15,000 girl students of the city’s five colleges were to benefit from the scheme, inaugurated by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on January 13, 2017. Government Girl’s College in Sector 14 alone has 7,500 girl students,   in Sector 8 has 3,000, with 4,500 others spread over the remaining three colleges. 
 
 Meenakshi Arora, nurse at Government College, Sector 14, said, “The machines worked fine for a few days, but then began to break down every other day. We had to get the one in our college repaired at our own expense.”  , the head of the women’s cell at Guru Dronacharya College, said, “The machines did work for a few days, but they began to show faults since then. Girls also tend to misuse them, causing them to malfunction. Sometimes, we got them repaired with our own money.”
 
 An official of the state higher education department, wishing to remain anonymous, said, “We’ve noted the faults and problems experienced by students while using the machines. The department will look into this issue and get the machines repaired.”
