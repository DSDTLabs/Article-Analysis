 AMRITSAR: The Punjab Police on Wednesday detained   president Karnail Singh Peer mohammad and several other AISSF members outside the   complex, ahead of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's visit. 

 They were rounded up when they were heading towards the Golden Temple to handover a "1984 genocide report" and a memorandum, urging him to recognise the anti-Sikh riots as genocide in Canadian parliament. "We wanted to welcome Trudeau and hand over the memorandum to him. But we're not allowed to do so,"   said.
 
 Trudeau is on a week-long visit to India. He and his delegation reached the Golden Temple at 11:55 am. The Amritsar visit is being seen as a significant leg of his India trip. PTI
