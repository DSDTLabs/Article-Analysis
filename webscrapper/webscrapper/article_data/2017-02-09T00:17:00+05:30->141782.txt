Bhopal: ​Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Tuesday met a delegation of Dalits, who had accused police personnel of human rights violations in Bhutia and Holibayada villages of Dhar district, and assured fair investigation into the matter.

 “The police will take strict action against those involved in criminal activities. I warn all the anti-social elements and criminals to leave the state or else face the music,” said Chouhan. The chief minister also said that those patronising anti-socials will also be punished. Earlier, Congress had complained that the Dhar police allegedly raped four women during a raid in two adjoining villages that was conducted to hunt for men wanted for several crimes on January 25. Congress MLA from Gandhwani, Umang Singhar, had also brought the alleged victims of sexual assault to Bhopal and demanded a judicial inquiry into acts of molestation, rape and loot.
 
 On Tuesday, a delegation of Dalits residing in these villages led by BJP MLA from Manavar (Dhar) Ranjana Baghel met the chief minister, alleging involvement of Singhar with local criminals in filing fake complaints and demanded action against those involved in anti-social activities. The delegation also met Madhya Pradesh Human Rights Commission, which has sought a police report into the matter.
 
 Baghel has recently been given relief by the Indore bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court in two election petitions due to lack of evidence. Baghel was women and child development minister in the Shivraj Singh Chouhan cabinet in 2008. However, following the complaint of rigging against her she failed to get the coveted berth in 2013. The initiative taken by her in Dhar atrocity case is being seen as a move to establish her in the mainstream politics and stake a claim for a berth in the state cabinet.
