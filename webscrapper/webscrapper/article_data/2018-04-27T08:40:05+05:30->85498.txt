TIRUMALA: Andhra Pradesh government issued a directive on Thursday cancelling the appointment of MLA Vangalapudi   as board member of   (TTD). Following controversy over her appointment, Anita wrote a letter to chief minister   to cancel it. 

 Immediately after appointment, many   groups objected as she once in an interview claimed to be a Christian. Last Sunday, Anita sent a letter to CM Naidu as Hindu groups,  , YSRC, continued questioning her faith despite she saying she was an ardent devotee of Lord Venkateshwara.
