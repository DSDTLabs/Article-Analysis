VARANASI: Making his first trip in the holy week of Navratras to his home seat Varanasi, Prime Minister   on Friday went to pay obeisance at a temple built in 1964, dedicated to the sage Goswami Tulsidas.

 He, however, missed the original shrine where the sage had authored the epic Ram Charit Manas in Awadhi dialect.
 
  
  While the 53-year-old   temple, constructed by one Sureka family of Howrah in West Bengal, which Modi visited, is located on the Lanka-Durgakund road, the original temple – abode of saint Tulsidas -- is located on the Tulsi Ghat on the banks of Ganga.
 
 The temple on the ghat is believed to be built around 1620, nearly 400 years ago. An undated hand-written Ram Charit Manas, wooden khadaus as well as other archived items are kept here.
 
 A portion of boat which Tulsidas is said to have used to travel across the river has also been kept here.
 
 The site is maintained by ‘Akhara Swami Tulsidas’, which is said to have been started by the sage himself in the 17th century.
 
 While the prime minister tweeted. “I look forward to praying at the historic Tulsi Manas temple and Durga Mata temple. A postage stamp on the Ramayan will also be released,” scholars and priests in Varanasi, felt the PMO should have included the original Tulsidas shrine in Varanasi in his itinerary.
