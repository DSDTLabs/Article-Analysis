PANNAPPATTY (DHARMAPURI): In the global village, ‘cavemen’ is an anachronism, something that existed in the Palaeolithic age, or the stuff Hollywood movies are made of. However, a village in   has moved en masse to nearby ‘caves’ as their houses built by the government have become unliveable.

 About 120 people of Pannappatty village near Pennagaram said they are left with no other option after heavy rain and wind destroyed their houses.
 
 The forest department in Dharmapuri district constructed about 30 houses at the village in 1990 for scheduled tribe (ST) people.
 
 “Those houses started crumbling within five years,” said K Suresh Kumar, a resident. He told TOI that the houses are now in a dilapidated condition.
 
 A few weeks ago, a sudden whirlwind shattered their houses and their lives. Since then, none of the houses is liveable.
 
 The residents have vacated the houses and started living in the nearby caves.
 
 The residents of the Tamil Nadu’s Dharmapuri said the district administration has failed to take action on their petitions.
 
 The villagers are threatening to commit suicide if the district administration fails to fulfil their demands.
