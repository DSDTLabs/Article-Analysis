Incidentally, the first part had music composed by Anoop Seelin. Talking about the music of   2,   says, “I am working on a mass movie after a long time. There will be two mass and commercial numbers along with a few romantic songs, too. The songs will appeal to the audience.   and Benny Dayal has crooned tracks. We are also roping in a few big actors for a couple of narrations that is part of the screenplay.”

 Ask him about working with Milton and he says, “Initially, I was a little worried if I would be able to meet the expectations of Milton sir. But when he heard the songs, he was really happy. My style is a little different and I was unsure if that will match the screenplay, but it came out really well and I’m glad.” 
 
 Besides this, Achu is also working on an untitled film, that has RK   and Kalaiarasan playing the lead and is being directed by Sriram.
