 HYDERABAD: Plans to turn Shilparamam’s night bazaar into an international food court has now hit a roadblock with the Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP) project eating into its space.
 
 According to the architectural plan, the construction is supposed to occupy about two acres of   land—blocking its main entrance and affecting about 300 stalls and a major area of the night bazaar.
 
 G Kishan  , the special officer of Shilparamam, said that starting work on the food court has become a challenging affair as the road work will block the main entrance and disturb the market’s ambience.
 
 Expressing his concern over getting funds for this project, Rao said, “No investor will come forward now to invest in the project of international food court as it has an uncertain future. We don’t know when our idea will be actually implemented.”
 
 They had also taken a loan of ?21 crore from the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) for construction of the night bazaar, which they are now repaying with ?50 lakh every three months.
 
 Shutting down of the night bazaar for almost a year now has affected Shilparamam’s revenue majorly. The burden of loan repayment now falls on its earnings from visitors, artisans and different cultural programmes they organise.
 
  (GHMC) with the help of IIT, Hyderabad, is trying to find an alternative route to build the elevated construction, so that it causes the least harm to Shilparamam, said GHMC commissioner Dr. B Janardhan Reddy. Works for the food court are stalled till GHMC finalises the route map for the construction.
