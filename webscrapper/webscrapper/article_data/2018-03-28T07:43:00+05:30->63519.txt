Ludhiana: Income tax department’s range-6 on Monday evening conducted a survey at the city’s famous food joint Aman Chicken. The survey was conducted under the instruction of principal commissioner Avdesh Mishra and joint commissioner Manav Bansal. Following the action, the owners of the shop on Tuesday surrendered ₹56.25 lakh to the I-T department as undisclosed income.

 On Monday, the team led by assistant commissioner Amit Dahiya inspected the sale and purchase details of Aman Chicken, which is located near Shastri Nagar. They also investigated the old financials records of the shop.
 
 According to sources, the action was taken after the department received a solid tip-off on tax evasion by the owners of the shop by suppressing the sales and evading income tax by showing less profit.
 
 In the past one week, the I-T department, Ludhiana, has conducted nearly 12 surveys in which already ₹5.40 crore worth undisclosed income has been surrendered by two parties alone, out of which ₹5 crore was surrendered by a pharma company located on Dhandra Road.
 
 Meanwhile, according to the I-T department, more than 33,000 new assessees have filed income tax returns since March 6, 2018, alone, and the total tally of new assessees in Ludhiana this year is more than 2.54 lakh so far. 
 
 The department has also conducted two more surveys in the past two days. 
 
 The department on Tuesday issued an arrest warrant against an assessee in Khanna who had repeatedly defaulted in paying his outstanding tax liabilities in spite of repeated opportunities.
