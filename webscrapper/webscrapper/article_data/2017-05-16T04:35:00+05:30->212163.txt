Ahmedabad: Veteran textile designer, Anjali Mangaldas, breathed her last on Sunday at the age of 81. Anjali succumbed to a prolonged illness at her Ahmedabad residence. 

 
 A prayer meeting will be organized at Nirman Bhavan near Law Garden, early on Tuesday between 8.30 am and 10 am. Textile caught Anjali’s fancy at the age of 14 when she began collecting house textiles, which are now showcased at the gallery at The Ahmedabad Trunk, which was established by her son, Abhay Mangaldas, in December 2015. “She was aesthetically very inclined as a person. Her childhood passion led her to be a certified textile designer from Royal College of London. The collection houses textiles ranging over a century. The gallery exhibits are to be viewed as a sourcebook of textile crafts available in Gujarat and to inspire contemporary design,” said Abhay, remembering the works of his mother.tnn
