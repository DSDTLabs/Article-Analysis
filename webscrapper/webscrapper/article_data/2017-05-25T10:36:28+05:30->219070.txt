HYDERABAD: Implying that BJP president Amit Shah's support for dalits was superficial, Telangana chief minister   on Wednesday charged that the lunch that Shah had with a dalit family in Teretpally in Nalgonda was actually prepared by a member of the forward   community. 

 "The lunch that Shah had with the dalit family was prepared by  , a resident of Khammagudem village. As a result, the dalits in Teretpally are upset. Besides, dalit leader   had to stand while Shah ate at a table. Is this called 'Sahapankti' (partaking lunch together)?" questioned KCR. He said the second day's lunch was prepared at   mess and not at a Dalit's home. On the third day, fearing protests from Dalits, the BJP chief had lunch at Bhongir that was prepared by a dalit," the CM said.
