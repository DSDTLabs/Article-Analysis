PATNA: Is high membership fee of city gyms a deterrent for you? Well, you can do your workouts under the sky for as low as Rs 200 per month in the city’s Ecological Park.

 The park has developed separate gyms for men and women, for which the registration process is on. “The gyms have the capacity to allow workouts by 50 people each at a time. We will also provide two trainers,” park official Parmanand said, adding non-registered park visitors could also do workouts at the gyms, but only in the evening.
 
 The gyms will open from 6am to 9am for the registered patrons and from 4pm to 6pm for all park visitors. The gyms are to be inaugurated soon.
 
 According to state principal secretary (forest department) Vivek Kumar Singh, the open-air gyms are furnished with the latest equipment like sky walker, leg press, cross trainers, pull-up bars, rower, exercise bike, leg stretcher, sitting twister, sit-up board and shoulder builder.
 
 Singh’s department has spent Rs 11.78 lakh on developing the women’s   and another Rs 11 lakh on the men’s gym.
 
 Boring Canal Road resident Ayushi Verma is looking forward to get registered with the gym. “I go for a walk at Eco Park every day, but walking alone won’t sufficiently burn my unwanted calories. I have, therefore, decided to do workouts at the park gym,” the 35-year-old told this reporter on Friday.
 
 Retired banker Bhagwan Deen Singh is also excited. “I along with my friends have been going to the park for morning walk for two years now. I will certainly try out the equipment at the gym,” he said.
 
 Gym trainer Rohit Kumar said their main job would be to teach people how to use the equipment to ensure best health benefits. “We will also make diet charts for people to build muscles and lose calories,” he said.
