 MOHALI: Shopkeepers' encroaching upon pedestrian space in the Phase 3B2 market has pushed the shoppers to parking lots, where they are at the risk of being run over. The corridors and passages outside these shops are blocked with boutique racks, while the customers these display stands are supposed to attract can't find a way through. 
 
 Even though the problem has persisted for long, no one has ever cared to report or solve it. Phase-3 resident   said: "While the visitors never speak up against the menace, the authorities concerned find the issue too insignificant to merit any action." Senior citizens get tangled the most in the maze of racks. In summer, they have to walk in the afternoon sun because the covered corridors are all clogged."
 
 Visitor   said: "Moving goods to the corridor for a short while is acceptable but the shopkeepers have made a habit of it and hogged a bulk of the corridor space. The authorities concerned should get them to clear the passage outside the shops for free walking." A few other shoppers talked about the inconvenience of walking on a shrunken path and through the congested parking lot where now street vendors have taken over many corners.
 
 Businessman   said: "Free parking in the city makes crowded lots that seem a maze to the pedestrians. And since vendors have invaded the lots, our parking and walking space has shrunken further." Abrupt parking on roads creates a bottleneck during rush hours. Because of haphazard parking, people leave their cars on the roads and footpaths along several blocks.
 
 Phase-VII resident   said: "The markets are the most difficult place to visit these days, as logjams and petty fights drain you of energy. I have stopped using my car in the evening and instead I take a taxi."
