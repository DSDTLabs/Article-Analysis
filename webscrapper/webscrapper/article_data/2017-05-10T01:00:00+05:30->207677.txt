Maverick filmmaker   returns to show his might at the box office this Friday with 'Sarkar 3'. The third outing in the Godfather-like franchise comes nine years after 'Sarkar Raj', ending almost a decade-long wait.   is back as   aka   in his trademark angry avatar, with intimidating stares, ubiquitous fury, clap-inducing one-liners and a background score to suit the mood.
Manoj Bajpayee, Ronit Roy, Amit Sadh, Yami Gautam, Jackie Shroff and Rohini Hattangadi are Big B’s co-stars in this drama. There’s more. 'Sarkar 3', the makers claim, is not a continuation of the previous outings. 
 
  
  
 
 Here are a few interesting anecdotes about the action behind the scenes:
 
 
 
 
  “Amitabh Bachchan is the only actor who possesses the kind of magnetism and charisma to make a character like 'Sarkar' come alive. I truly believe that anger has been missing in all his films in the last decade, which I want to bring back in 'Sarkar 3'. The canvas of the film is big because its universe will not be limited to just the travails and tribulations of a family with some disturbances from outside.” 
 'Sarkar 3', presented by Eros International and produced by Alumbra Entertainment, Wave Cinemas and AB Corp, releases on May 12.
