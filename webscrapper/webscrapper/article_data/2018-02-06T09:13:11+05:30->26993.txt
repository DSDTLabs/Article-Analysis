CHANDIGARH: Even though   feel that their salaries cannot be compared with their corporate counterparts as they both teach and do research, it has come out that 74% of the annual budget of the institute is just spent on paying salary of employees.

 As for allowances, the doctors in the national institute of importance say is ever less than those paid to the babus. Moreover, the   professors –– there are 150 out of 500 faculty — get around $2500 excluding round trip business class, airport and conference venue travel fare for international conference from PGIMER every year. This is in addition to the invitations they get for the conferences.
 
 “PGI supports the faculty to attend these conferences for various reasons. First these events help them keep updated with the current knowledge and experience. Secondly,   doctors are leaders in their respective fields. PGI plays an important role in teaching private/corporate hospital doctors so that they can go back and practice with latest knowledge and expertise. This indirectly benefits not only the private doctors, but also the community,” said Dr Rajesh Chhabra, president of the faculty association, PGIMER.
  
  
 The faculty association of the institute is however aggrieved that the seventh central pay commission recommendations have not been implemented in PGI, AIIMS and JIPMER even after two years of its announcement.
