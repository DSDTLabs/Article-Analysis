NEW DELHI: One of the   in the   cash van   of 2012, Ranjeet Rumal, was   by the crime branch while plotting to execute a similar robbery. Rumal is an associate of gangster Hari Kishan Sharma who had hatched the robbery plot in which the gang had looted Rs 5.25 crore and shot dead the   guard on the BRT corridor in Defence Colony.

 The accused was wanted under MCOCA. “A police team received a tip-off about Rumal coming to Jhatikra Mod near Najafgarh and a trap was laid. The cops surrounded the area in three vehicles and the suspect was nabbed after a chase. A pistol was seized from him,” joint CP Alok Kumar said.
 
 Rumal alias Ajay told the cops that he had run out of money and was planning to execute a big robbery to fund his lifestyle. He is being quizzed to ascertain which criminals he had been in touch with. He had also sought interim relief in a case, but had jumped bail.
 
 A resident of Badarpur, Rumal had been committing crimes like murders and robberies until Sharma roped him for the cash van heist.
 
 In the first week of July 2012, the gang shifted to Sharma’s house in Khirki Extension of south Delhi and chalked out minute details of the heist. On July 5, they stole a Hyundai Verna from Kotwali area in Faridabad and procured 9mm pistols.
 
 In mid-August, the robbers got in touch with a man, Umesh, who tipped them off about the cash movements of the target company. A day before the heist, the gang carried out a mock drill.
 
 On August 20, they waylaid the van near BRT and shot the guard. They committed the robbery within five minutes and fled with the cash van. They stayed for the night at a house in Khirki Extension and split the next day after dividing the booty.
