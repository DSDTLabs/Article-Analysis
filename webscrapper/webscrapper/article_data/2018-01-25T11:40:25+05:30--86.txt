PUDUCHERRY: The public works department has proposed to develop an online software application to monitor the progress of various projects undertaken in the Union territory of Puducherry. 

 The department also proposes to geo-tag all infrastructural projects with information about the officers responsible for the projects, the timelines and sources of funding of the projects. 
 
 The department officials resolved to undertake the new initiatives after a meeting chaired by lieutenant governor   during a surprise inspection on Tuesday. The software application would usher in transparency in the administration and implementation of various ongoing projects, said Bedi. 
 
  The department also proposed to evolve a human resource management system for allocation of assignments such as maintenance of roads, tanks and drains to the staff members. It also decided to extend periodical training to the staff members. 
 
 Bedi directed the chief engineer (public works) and his team to evolve a comprehensive solution to overcome the shortage of sand, which had adversely affected construction activities in Puducherry. She also asked them to take adequate measures to prevent clogging of drains, to allocate necessary funds for the maintenance of school buildings and to evolve an effective plan for complete coordination among the departments of the territorial administration.
 
 She suggested approaching the Union government for central funds such as   (PMKSY) and climate change funds to bridge the fund-gap. She instructed the officials to make a comprehensive presentation, in the presence of public works minister A Namassivayam, on the proposed new initiatives during the last week of February.
