GURUGRAM: After the construction of Sector 14-Iffco Chowk flyover, the sector’s   has got narrowed and a part of it was demolished by builder Gawar Constructions, residents of   have claimed. They also alleged the realtor had promised that the entry gate would be reconstructed, but even after months, no repair work has been started yet. 

 The residents welfare associations (RWAs) of Sector 14 told TOI that two-and-a-half months back the builder had completed the construction of the flyover, but left the gate unrepaired, leading to traffic problems.
 
 “We encounter traffic problems here daily,” said  , president,   Sector 14. “The gate has been narrowed down. It is the only main entry into the Sector 14. Parts of the gates have been knocked down. The flyover was opened for traffic in 2017. The builder demolished our gates and promised that he would refurbish them, but once the work on flyover was complete, he vanished. We keep trying to contact them, but to no avail. Either no one takes our call or they dodge our queries.”
 
 Residents said that the situation worsened over the past few months as cars jostled to get inside. “This is a key road because it leads to  . There is also a private hospital and a few other important landmarks surrounding this area,” Akash, another resident explained.
 
 The security guard at the entry of gate too lamented the sorry state of affairs. “It’s fine during the afternoon, but during morning and evening hours, the traffic is gruelling. There is no space,” he said.
 
 However, a project officer for Gawar Constructions said that they had dismantled the gate on the instructions of the residents only. “They had been demanding that it should be widened. Then they suddenly asked us to restore the gate. We widened their road and it required carpeting, but they insisted on stationing the gate back to its place. We can still do the carpeting, but the removal of gate has to be done by them.”
