 ATMs belonging to various public sector banks, especially   (SBI), either remained closed or displayed no cash on the screens. Sudha Krishnan, a homemaker, said, “The problem is that the banks went on strike at the end of the month when one needs to make major transactions. However, I had sufficient cash with me.”
 
 Sneh Singh, a hosteller, who hails from  , said, “My parents send me money on the last day of the month. However, they were unable to deposit the money in the bank due to the strike.”
 
 U K Singh, president of Officers’ Association, SBI, Patna, said most ATMs in the city remained closed on Thursday. “The machines were stocked up on Tuesday. However, the ATMs faced the problem of cash shortage on Thursday. We will refill the ATMs on Friday. However, if our demands are not met by the government, we will have no other option but to go for an indefinite strike,” Singh added.
