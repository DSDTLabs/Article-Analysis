While   has done only three Hindi films, she has worked with the most sought-after young guns of B-Town like  ,   and  . The leading men she has worked with are all gunning for the top spot and Kriti decodes what makes each of them unique. 
She says, “Tiger wasn’t even a film old when I did 'Heropanti' (2014) with him. He used to call me a ‘senior’ because I had completed one schedule of a South film. We learnt the basics — how to face the camera and approach a scene — together. He is disciplined and would rehearse for five days before the shoot of a song to get the steps right. And, if we had a morning shoot, he’d wake up at 4 am and go for a run first. He is hungry to do well.” 
 
 Talking about Varun, who was already a star when she did 'Dilwale' (2015) with him, she continues, “It was just my second film, so I was the inexperienced bachcha on that set. He is among the few actors of this generation, who can pull off comedy. We would rehearse lines before every scene and suggest ideas to each other. During a fight sequence, he had to do a flip from a table. He wasn’t getting it right and it was also affecting his back, but he did it almost 25 times till he got it right.” 
 
 As for her co-star from her upcoming film 'Raabta', she adds, “Sushant is a methodical actor. He prepares pages of flow charts with details of the character he is playing. I have never seen anyone do this. He will do a thousand things to prepare and make himself believe that he is that character. For  , he suggested that they leave one blank page after every page of the script. My blank pages were as it is and his blank pages were full. But the most amazing aspect about him is that despite all the preparation, he doesn’t lose his spontaneity.”
