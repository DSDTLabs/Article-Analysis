The cops were put on back foot when the driver of the pick up van in which Khan was sitting, claimed that he was the sole witness in the crime and yet cops did not contact him.
 
 However, Sher Mohammad, Sadar(Head) of Meo Panchayat welcomed the transfer of IO in the case, “We welcome the decision of shifting the probe, we can finally hope for justice to be delivered,” he told TOI.
