DHARAMSHALA: With more than 100 hoteliers in this hill destination facing action for various violations, some under fear have now started getting themselves registered under the bread and breakfast ( ) scheme of the Union ministry of tourism.

 About 25 properties have got themselves registered under this scheme so far. As general practice, hotels earlier used to get themselves registered with the tourism department of the state. But now many were opting for BNB scheme after recent action on hotels in the region.
 
 Madhu Choudhary, tourism director, said here that there were about 128 hotels which have lost their power and water connections. “There were around 140 properties in the list of violators but many of them had later completed their formalities and their completion certificates were awaited from the corporation” she said. 
 
 Tourism officials confirmed that hoteliers have started opting for this central government scheme. It was learnt that a maximum of six rooms can be registered under this scheme. “One can apply directly to tourism ministry of India for this. There is a committee formed by the Centre to monitor such properties. It has one official on behalf of the tourism department too,” said a source. 
 
 The department has started scrutinizing such properties registered under BNB scheme. They were looking for the completion certificates for the buildings and revenue papers of the buildings. Most of the hotels in   and nearby areas had registered their ground floors as parking for the property. But now they have changed the land use and made the ground floors as shops or put to some commercial use. Sources said that others who had received completion certificates for the properties have also done many deviations as mentioned in their approved maps.
