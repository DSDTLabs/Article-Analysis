CHANDIGARH: Uncertainty prevails over three railway projects in   which were sanctioned during the UPA regime at the Centre, said   MP   here on Friday. 

 Speaking at a press conference, the Congress leader said the railways ministry had scrapped the   rail line project. "At the same time, the projects of New Delhi-Nuh-Alwar and Yamunanagar-Chandigarh rail lines have been pending for three and half years, as the Haryana government is dithering in giving its consent to providing land for the project at zero price," said Deepender, who had posed questions regarding these projects in the recently-concluded session of Parliament.
 
 He said the railways ministry had said that the Hisar-Agroha-Fatehabad line was found to be non-feasible on account of passenger flow. "For the other two lines sanctioned during UPA government, Haryana had agreed to bear 50% cost of projects. But, after BJP government took over in Haryana, the railways ministry added the condition of free land," he said.
