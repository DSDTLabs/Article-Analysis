MUMBAI: A month after two masked men barged into an e-commerce herbal distributor's store at   in  , tied up the manager and fled with over Rs 9 lakh, they were arrested from Delhi on Sunday. 

 Powai police managed to identify the duo-former employee Rehmat Mohammed Ali (21) and Shivkumar Singh (21)-after going through the CCTV footage between Powai and Bhandup station-the route they took to escape to Delhi on February 18 after the robbery. Police are also verifying if the manager, Sumit Rathod (22), is involved in the crime. 
 
  Rathod was transferred from the Delhi branch to Mumbai three months ago. He lived on the Powai premises. At the time of the incident, he was alone in the industrial estate with other establishments were shut as it was Sunday. "We are checking if Rathod was involved as the duo is known to him.

 Police claimed Ali hatched the robbery plan after he quit the job six months ago. Assistant commissioner of police (Saki Naka division) Milind Khetle said on February 18, Ali and Singh flew down to Mumbai, committed the crime and returned the same day.
