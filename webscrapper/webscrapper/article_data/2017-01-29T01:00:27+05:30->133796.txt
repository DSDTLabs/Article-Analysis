Meet  , Joint Managing Director,   talks about his life-work balance.
 
  
 
  I take time out for things that interest me, like travelling, watching movies and spending time with my mother. To de-stress, I enjoy a nice brisk walk or a trek. Or spend an evening with friends who make me laugh. Surround yourself with positive people.
  
  
 
  I work out 5 to 6 times a week with my trainer at home. I need someone to push me.
  
  
 
  New innovations and positive customer feedback.
  
  
 
  You need to find the right balance.
  
  
 
  A visit every Monday to my Guruji’s ashram.
  
  
 
  Don’t let either get to you. Learn from failures and resolve not to repeat it, celebrate success, but then quickly move on to the next challenge.
  
  
 
  I go to my brother first, and then we call the top management to discuss and resolve the issue at hand.
  
  
 
  It changes. These days it’s George Michael as I grew up on his songs

  Dangal, and I still feel very close to Taare Zameen Par
