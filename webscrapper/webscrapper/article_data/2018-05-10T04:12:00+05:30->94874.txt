Vadodara: The representative committee of lawyers appointed by Baroda Bar Association (BBA) to solve the issue of seating arrangement in the new court complex will meet the committee of high court on Thursday.

 The committee of the high court consists of five judges of high court appointed by the chief justice to resolve the issue of seating arrangement in discussion with the lawyersâ€™ representative committee.
 
 The committee of the lawyers was informed about the meeting by the high court through district judge on Tuesday. Five members of the committee namely Atul Mehta, Niramay Parikh, Kaushik Bhatt, Shailesh Patel and Bhumika Trivedi will be visiting the high court for the meeting.
 
 Last month, the committee was handed over the copy of a resolution and proposal passed by the managing committee of the bar association regarding the requirement of space and furniture that will be required for the lawyers. The advocates in the city, ever since they resumed the work in March after their hunger strike, have been protesting in a unique way by sitting on the ground in the lobby of the court building.
