 remains a heartthrob for Sandalwood fans, long after her sabbatical from films. And now we’ve got some good news. Rakshitha is making a comeback of sorts to films, which will also see her team up for the first time with husband   as a director. She has been dubbing for The Villain’s lead actress   for the last few days. The actress-producer-TV personality says that working with Prem, who is the director of the film, is no mean feat. “He is a complete task master and there have been times when he has had me dub one dialogue over 20 times. He wants things perfect and doesn’t resort to short cuts, like breaking dialogues into bits. He’s made me repeat long dialogues multiple times,” says Rakshitha. 
The story behind how she ended up being the voice of   for this film is quite interesting, Rakshitha tells us. “Prem was trying out dubbing artistes for a long time for this particular role, since it requires some variations. It was Anand, the engineer at the dubbing studio, who suggested to director   that I give it a shot. Mahesh had to coax me out of my house, with the help of assistant directors of Prem’s film. Prem had no idea about any of this. When they made Prem listen to my dubbing, he said it was different and that he liked it. This was how I was on board this project,” she reveals.
 Rakshitha adds, “It is different to dub for another person. I have only dubbed for myself so far. But I’m liking it and enjoying the process. I have Mahesh for support at the studio daily, because he has been there for me right from my first film.”
