NEW DELHI: A 17-year-old boy has been apprehended for murdering his two-month-old son at his house in Mangolpuri on Saturday evening. Police said that the teenager suspected his wife, a 16-year-old girl, of having an affair and presumed the   to be born out of it.

 Additional DCP,  , said that the police had come to know about the incident when the child’s mother took him to the   where he was declared dead. Doctors found strangulation marks on the baby’s neck and alerted the cops. The girl was questioned during which she told the cops that she suspected her husband of killing him.
 
 “A team led by ACP Aalap Patel Mansukh was formed to track down the teenager and he was apprehended from Mangolpuri. He admitted to have strangled the baby after thrashing him with a shoe,” said Sagar.
 
 The accused teenager and the girl had married at a temple about a year ago and were staying at a rented house in Mangolpuri. Initially, the girl’s parents opposed the relationship but later they accepted the youth after the girl conceived the child.
 
 Police said that the girl used to work as a salesperson at a cosmetic shop in central Delhi. She supported the family, since the boy was addicted to drugs. He was disowned by his family and fled from his home in west Delhi after he was apprehended twice for stealing phones from a mobile phone shop.
 
 The family members said that he used to stay at home with the baby. He suspected the girl of having an affair with a colleague at her shop and often fought with her over that.
 
 On Saturday evening, when the girl was out for work, the boy returned home drunk and started hitting the baby with a shoe when he started crying. When the child became unconscious, he strangled him with his hand and left home, leaving the body on the bed.
 
 The woman returned around 4.30pm and took the baby to the hospital. A case of murder has been registered against the teenager.
