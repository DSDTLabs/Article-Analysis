Vijayawada: The Vijayawada International   at Gannavaram is waiting for the launch of services to foreign destinations. The old terminal has been renovated to operate international flights, and airport authorities are waiting for operators to start the services.

Airport director, G Madhusudhana Rao, said: “We completed the renovation of the old terminal, where we increased the number of conveyor belts, boarding counters, and security check centres.”
 
 He said, “We have written a letter to Air India, requesting them to start international services. We are waiting for their acceptance as we are ready to handle international services. Many private airlines operators are contacting us in this regard.” 
 
 Many businessmen are urging the government to start international connectivity, which will do good for their work. Muthavarapu Murali Krishna, representative of AP Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said, “This will take trade and commerce to next level. Direct flights from Mumbai made our work easy, and we need connectivity to Dubai, which is a gateway to the world.”
