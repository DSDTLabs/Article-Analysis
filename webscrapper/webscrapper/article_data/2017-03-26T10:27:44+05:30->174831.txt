MARGAO: A fire, throwing up a trail of smoke at Sonsoddo garbage dump, on Saturday, grabbed a few citizens’ attention, but activists say burning of garbage is rampant and this unscientific disposal method makes a mockery of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) ban.

 NGT, while banning burning of waste, had stated that anyone found committing the crime, could be fined Rs 25,000. But activists point out that a few government offices, organizations and others are burning waste regularly, paying no heed to the ban.
 
 “Almost regularly, some unidentified people burn plenty of plastic, paper and leaves,” Prashant Maurya, a city resident, alleged. Maurya and a few other citizens have been petitioning South Goa collector and even government organizations to take up scientific disposal of waste.
 
 After noticing the fire at Sonsoddo, citizens entered the premises to verify the cause. “But one of the workers informed me that they were burning garbage as snakes often hide under the piles,”   told STOI.
 
 “On March 12, too, we saw black smoke emanating from this garbage dump and had clicked some photos of it,”   said.
 
 The fire and emergency services department in Margao stated that no complaint had been received.   (MMC) chairperson   and MMC chief officer   claimed to be unaware about the fire, but assured that they would send the MMC sanitary inspector to look into the matter. 
 
 Activists and Maurya, who have been monitoring the situation in the town, alleged that burning of garbage is a regular occurrence. “This is a very unhealthy practice and should be stopped immediately. But the lackadaisical attitude of authorities is shocking,” an activist said.
