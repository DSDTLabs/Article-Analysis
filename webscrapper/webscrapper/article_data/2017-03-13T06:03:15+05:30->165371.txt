ShopClues’   has publicly accused his wife and co-founder   of pushing him out of the company he founded in 2011.

 Aggarwal, who also founded Droom in 2014, made the allegation in an elaborate   post on Sunday. Radhika Aggarwal is presently the founder and chief business officer of the Gurgaon-based online retailer, while   is the other cofounder and CEO of the company.
 
  was founded by Sandeep, who handed over the reins of the company to his wife as he was allegedly involved in an insider trading case in the US in 2013. Since, then Sandeep has not been actively involved with Shopclues as both Radhika and Sethi took control of the company.
 
 Sandeep, through his post, questioned Radhika’s educational and professional credentials and alleged that she has fraudulently taken away his voting rights in the company.
 
 As per the annual report of Shopclues, for fiscal year 2016, ShopClues lists Sethi, Radhika and   as key managerial persons and directors of the company. 
 
 Shopclues is backed by the New York-based Tiger Global, GIC, the sovereign wealth fund of Singapore and early investors like Nexus Venture Partners.
 
 Sandeep did not respond to calls and messages from TOI. A statement issued by his PR agent said once Sandeep came to know about the board seat fraud by Sanjay and Radhika, and perhaps other members of ShopClues board, he filed a complaint with the economic offences wing of the Gurgaon police.
 
 Sandeep’s posts also claims that his wife is having an extra-marital affair. A statement issued by Radhika said, “I am shocked by unfounded and baseless allegations being made. 
 
 In the interest of privacy of my family, I will not be commenting on any personal matters, however, ShopClues was always a team effort and it has become a force to reckon with. I want to focus my time and energy to do what I owe to my employees, my investors, my country and myself.”
