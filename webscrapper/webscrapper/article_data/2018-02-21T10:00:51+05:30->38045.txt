CHANDIGARH: Hundreds of people residing in   (CHB) flats for the economically weaker sections (EWS) in   are being overcharged in water bills issued by the public health department. 

  According to the residents, they have been overcharged from Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000 in the annual water bills that they have received. They say that the department is charging from them water bills of the previous cycle that have already been paid by them.
 
 A resident,  , has received water bill amounting to Rs 5,013 for one year in which, she said, all previous paid bill amounts had been added. "The authorities are charging me for the water usage that I have already paid. However, when I showed them the receipt of the already paid bill, they recalculated and I paid a lesser amount," she added. 
 
  said, "I had paid Rs 4,500 to the housing board for water meter in the year 2014, but the connection was not given. I again paid Rs 1,200 to the public health department for the connection and my already paid money was not returned by the Chandigarh Housing Board." 
 
 Last year on October 10, 2017, charge of issuing water bill of   had been shifted from Chandigarh Housing Board to the public health department.
 
 Jitender Dav, junior engineer at the public health department, said, "All these problems have arisen due to communication gap with the hosing board that had not made any record of the consumers' accounts of water bills." However, a CHB official denied any miscommunication. "We had provided every detail of water bills to the public health department . It's their responsibility to resolve the issue," said the official.
