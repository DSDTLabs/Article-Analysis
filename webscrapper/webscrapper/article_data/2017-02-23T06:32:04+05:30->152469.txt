MUMBAI: Civic activists said there could be a significant difference between voter turnout and voting percentage as several names went missing from voting lists. There was chaos at several polling booths after many who had been voting at the same centre for over two decades found their names missing on February 21. Mumbai recorded 55.53% voting with 50.97 lakh people voting, as against the 91.80 lakh registered.

  resident Lillian Pais, a member of the NGO AGNI and  , said the turnout would have been higher had people not been turned away as their names were not found in the voting list. “In some cases, names had been so badly spelled out that it was impossible to find them. Voting slips had also not been delivered to many citizens, so many were unaware about their polling booth. This led to mismanagement and chaos,“ said Pais.
 
 Bandra activist   said her brother's name was not on the list. “At my booth at   in Bandra (W), I noticed the photo and name on the list was not the same. I don't understand if the names were there in the last elections, how did they disappear this time?“ said Siddique.
 
 Corporator Makrand Narvekar (BJP), who is contesting from Colaba, said that the problem of missing names was across wards. “By 9.30am, we realized that there was a problem with people finding their names and many complained they had gone missing. We tried helping as many people as possible,“ said Narvekar.
