CHENNAI: A Risso’s dolphin calf washed ashore near  , about 70km from Chennai on the   ( ), on Thursday. A member of a   rescue team saw the dead dolphin and alerted officials.

 The animal had a furrow on the head — the most striking feature of a Risso’s dolphin (Grampus griseus). Usually, Risso’s dolphins have two to seven pairs of teeth in the lower jaw and none in the upper jaw.
 
 The stranded dolphin was ascertained to be a calf as it had no teeth, a statement from the organisation said. 
 
 The stranded dolphin was 56 inches long and weighed more than 35kg. As there were no visible wounds or marks on the body, it could have died after getting entangled in fishing gear, the statement said. After a full external examination, the dolphin was buried 50m beyond the high tide line.
 
 Since the beginning of this year, TREE Foundation volunteers have recorded 28 dolphin deaths and 176 dead sea turtles along the Kancheepuram coast. Though the probable cause of these deaths can be ascertained in such cases, the exact reason is still a matter of investigation.
 
 Risso’s dolphins are widely distributed, inhabiting deep oceanic and continental slope waters from the tropics. They feed on crustaceans and cephalopods, but seem to prefer squid.
