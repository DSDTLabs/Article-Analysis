BENGALURU: Residents of Rajajinagar held a protest against the BBMP on Friday for what they called tardy progress in the TenderSURE work on the stretch linking   with Shankar Mutt.

 The 3-km road-relaying project worth Rs 34 crore was due for completion on December 31, 2016. The deadline was extended to February 28, but that too wasn't met. The broken footpaths and open holes are inconveniencing those staying, commuting and conducting business in the locality.
 
 MLA   told TOI: “Despite several inspections and meetings with BWSSB, BBMP, and the joint commissioner, we haven't received answers. Since the Palike is not in a position to give us information, protest was the only option.“
 
 Senior citizens and schoolchildren are the worst affected. Construction work sends out billows of dust into the air, causing serious health hazards. “People are inhaling dust every day and schoolchildren find it difficult to cross the large trenches,“ said Vasanth Kumar, a former IAS officer and resident of the area.
 
 Srinivas, another long-time resident, said: “The road was perfectly fine before work began. BBMP has destroyed the road on the pretext of relaying it.“

 It's a time-consuming process
 
 Work on   is slightly delayed because a 500-metre section of the 1.93km stretch is a rockbed. We cannot drill into it and have to chisel our way through. This is time-consuming. Also, the project involves replacing existing utilities like drains, water sanitary pipes. This requires coordination with Bescom, BSNL and other organizations. We hope to complete the project by June 30
