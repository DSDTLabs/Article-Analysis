LUCKNOW: Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief   on Friday joined Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president   in attacking the ruling Samajwadi Party (SP) government over killing of businessmen in Meerut and Lucknow. 

 While Shah cancelled his foot march in Meerut, Mayawati issued a statement saying that the two incidents were testimony of prevailing 'Jungle Raj' in Uttar Pradesh. Mayawati said that the law and order situation in the state has been at a low ever since the SP came to power. 
 
 "While goons and mafias gained the patronage of the ruling party, the officials remained callous," she said in a statement. Mayawati also attacked the Congress for aligning with the SP, "which is headed by a leader (Akhilesh Yadav) who is 'tainted' and responsible for 500 communal riots in the state". "This way, the prevailing crime situation in the state would be termed as 'Jungle Raj' of SP-Congress alliance," she said.
