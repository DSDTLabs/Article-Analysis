Trichy: To discuss the real-time problems faced by heavy industries and plausible solutions for the same, two days long International Symposium On Joining Of Materials (SOJOM 2018) jointly organised by Welding Research Institute (WRI) of BHEL Trichy, Indian Welding Society and Indian Institute of Metals concluded here on Saturday. Participated by representatives from power sector and eminent research institutes, the symposium discussed the need for scientific advancements in welding technology and material science.

 Addressing the gathering, R Rajamanohar, executive director of BHEL said, “Such conference on materials would provide a common platform for industry, academia, and researchers as well as inspection authorities to share and discuss the ideas on best practices on welding and joining technologies.” The need to enhance the skill set of workforce, efficient methods for safe industrial operations and development of new technologies in welding to bridge the gap between problems faced by industries and expectations were explained in the event.
 
 Participants said that welding technology and material joining practices is the need of the hour to develop impeccable practices in various fields including defence, power, and automobile sectors. Over 200 delegates from various states including from IIT-Delhi and other universities attended the two-day event during which more than 85 technical papers were presented.
 
 On the occasion, R Easwaran, a renowned metallurgist was conferred with the SK Mazumder Memorial Lecture Award for his services in welding. Dr V Muthupandi of NIT, Trichy was awarded with Dr Achar Memorial distinguished academician award for research in welding technology. At a time when industries are looking for a positive growth, application of advanced materials such as alloys in varied sectors including in the designing of Advanced Ultra Super Critical (AUSC) boilers through experimentation and evaluation were discussed by experts.
