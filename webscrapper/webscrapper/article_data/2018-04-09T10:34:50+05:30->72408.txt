CHARMINAR: In recent months, many lakes of Old City have been in the news for all the wrong reasons.

 Just a stone’s throw away from the fortified wall of the historic Golconda fort,   has turned into a stinky pond of hyacinth. That’s not all. The water body is falling prey to government apathy as authorities ignore the constant dumping of rubble, and discharge of sewage water into the lake.
 
 And if remedial measures are not taken soon, more will follow suit, activists say. Shatam Cheruvu is part of chain of water bodies created during the Qutb Shahi reign to rejuvenate groundwater levels. However, in desperate attempts to gain more land, the residents of Akbarpura, Nadeem Colony and Mohammadi Lines on the three sides of the lake and Golconda Golf course have reduced the magnificent water storage facility to a dumping ground.
 
 “The area of the lake was originally about 76 acres. Encroachers have been   into the lake from all the sides, eating up the entire area. The residents are even constructing buildings on the soft soil which could be dangerous for them and other residents in future,”  , a social activist said.
 
 Several residents gave in complaints regarding the issue. A resident of Tolichowki near Shatam Cheruvu said that some unknown miscreants are also trying to tamper the   by creating a new output channel so that water flows out.
 
 "They are doing this so that the water flows out of the lake and it will be easy for encroachment," he said.
 
 When contacted,  , superintendent engineer, lakes division, GHMC said, “Amount has been sanctioned for fencing the lake on all sides so that people stop dumping rubble into the it. The work will start soon”.
