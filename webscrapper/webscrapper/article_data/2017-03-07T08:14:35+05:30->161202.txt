CHENNAI: Five employees of a goldsmith escaped with 3kg of gold worth around 87 lakh in   in the early hours of Monday after drugging their employer and three colleagues. 

 Police said Raju Punya of West Bengal, who runs a workshop on the fourth floor of a commercial complex on  , employed eight men from his native place and accommodated them in two rooms adjacent to the workshop.
 
 They usually commenced work late at night, depending on the orders received, police said.
 
 On Sunday night, after dinner, all the employees were on the job and decided to work overnight. One of the employees brought cool drinks for Punya and the others. Within a couple of minutes, Laskar Adam, Sheik Johan and Sameed dozed off along with Punya. The men who hatched the plan - Jamal, Sikandhar, Hasik, Salman and Sheikh - had pretended to sip their drinks. 
 
 After making sure that their employer and the three others were snoring, the accused men packed the gold in two bags and left the complex at 5.01am, a police officer said. "They chose that time early in the morning as there would be very few people moving around in the complex as well as in the area," he added.
 
 Several goldsmiths operate out of the four-storey building and work goes on till early morning, police said. The incident came to light around noon on Monday after Punya and the others woke up and found the valuables and the five men missing.
 
 They lodged a complaint with the Elephant Gate police. A CCTV camera at the complex showed the five accused leaving at 5.01 am carrying two bags. They were also carrying a cricket bat, probably to overpower anyone who might be inclined to chase them, the officer said.
 
 A police team collected a few sets of prints from the spot, noted down the addresses and phone number of the suspects and launched a hunt. Their mobile phones were switched off. Police are also interrogating the three other employees.
 
 "A special team has already been sent to West Bengal," the officer said.
