LUCKNOW: She was harassed physically in public transport, as also on the street in broad daylight and looked at with hungry eyes as she walked home from school.

 The campaign triggered by the Bengaluru molesta tion incident on New Year's eve, took form of a mass movement on social media, after which it was decided to hold demonstrations, protest march and performances rai sing awareness on women's safety at 5pm on the day in each of the participating 23 chapters. For Lucknow, the 1090 crossing has been decided, drawing people from across the city.
 
 Lucknow was the seventh to join in when a young social work graduate from   Alisha Asif came to know about the movement taking form and got in touch with key organisers, bringing ultimately a large number of locals together. “It is in the spirit of a leaderless movement in which over 20 organisations have already signed statements of solidarity condemning antiquated notions of honour that confine women indoors,“ she said, coordinating with new entrants to the social media page #IWillGoOut.
 
 The page is replete with posts on work of feminists for feminism and stories of sexual harassment, while the movement is not restricted to women alone, receiving active support from men. “We will have separate monologues put together by members Maryam and Geetanjali, bringing focus to women's safety .There will also be a short self defence lesson for all as a way forward from the demonstration and a signature campaign,“ she said.
 
 Ultimately , national movement will jointly send a petition to the  , drawing their attention to maintaining safety in public places for women, drawing support from each of the chapters.
