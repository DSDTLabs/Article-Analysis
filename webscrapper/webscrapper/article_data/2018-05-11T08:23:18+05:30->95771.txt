HYDERABAD: A multi-member appropriate authority headed by   Yogita Rana recently cleared 73 applications from hospitals, nursing homes and diagnostic centres under the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act that include 33 new registrations and 43 renewals which have been long pending.

 TOI had reported in these columns on April 13 that licence pleas for ultrasound machines were caught in administrative wrangles in Hyderabad . However, applications of seven hospitals and diagnostic centres have been rejected. DM&HO Dr K Padmaja told TOI that the authority had rejected the applications of hospitals and diagnostic centres that were facing   cases. “Applications of doctors
 
 who have failed to give declaration that they will not do sex determination tests were rejected,” he said. The licences were delayed earlier as the multimember appropriate authority had failed to meet.
 
  president Dr CRK Prasad told TOI, “When the hospitals and nursing homes managements are approaching the authorities in the newly-formed districts, they are saying the data is yet to be transferred. The officials are asking us to file fresh applications both for registration and renewal of clinics under the Act as well as the PCPNDT applications.”
 
 Act says no hospital or nursing home or diagnostic can carry out sex determination test. However, hospitals and centres need ultrasound machines for the purpose of carrying medical tests for various ailments particularly to screen internal organs of the body.
