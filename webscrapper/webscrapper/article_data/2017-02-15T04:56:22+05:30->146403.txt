NEW DELHI: In an attempt to bring relief to at least 80 million patients suffering from hepatitis C virus worldwide, five new patent challenges have been filed in India and Argentina on crucial new medicines used in the treatment of the disease.

 The patent challenges, seen as major global push to ensure access to affordable treatment, could remove barriers to production and distribution of affordable generic versions of directacting  .
 
 In India, the Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge (I-MAK) along with the   (DNP+), supported by   ( ), have filed four cases — two patent challenges on daclatasvir, one on velpatasvir and a further challenge on sofosbuvir on Tuesday. 
 
 Separately, in Argentina, Fundación Grupo Efecto Positivo (FGEP) filed a patent opposition on sofosbuvir with support from I-MAK. The drugs — sofosbuvir, daclatasvir and velpatasvir — are used in treatment of hepatitis C as well as in combination with other drugs for treatment of HIV.
 
 India has the third largest population of people living with HIV in the world with as many as 21 lakh people suffering from the deadly virus. The hepatitis C virus afflicts over 120 lakh patients in India.
 
 According to public health experts, patent challenges are latest attempts to overturn the abusive strategies of pharmaceutical companies to block generic competition. “We need a wide range of combination treatments available at an affordable price. With patents blocking generic competition, treatment remains prohibitively expensive in many countries,” said Jessica Burry, pharmacist for MSF’s Access Campaign.
 
 Patents on drugs not only prevent affordable generic versions from being produced or imported, but also restrict progressive innovation that could benefit patients. People living with HIV, in collaboration with health organisations, have already filed challenges to patents on sofosbuvir in several countries.
