NAGPUR: Children tend to follow their  . But as the   found out in  , a son of a Naxalite couple aspires to become a police officer.

 Balaji (name changed), 13, recently joined the ‘Aapla Maharashtra’ tour which was organized by the tribal development department and Gadchiroli police. It was during this tour when Balaji decided to join the police force.
 
 His father Vasant was captured and has been lodged in Chandrapur jail since the last three years while his mother Kamla is still absconding. Her last know location was Dalam in  .
 
 He vaguely remembers her mother’s visit in 2011 when he was six or seven years old. Balaji met his father in jail last year and the two discussed his education and family. The father requested Balaji to tell his mother to surrender when he meets her again.
 
 After spending most of his life in his village, visiting cities like Mumbai, Pune and Aurangabad was a revelation. “Tribal children don’t get as much exposure as those in the cities. After having experienced the life outside his village, Balaji was inspired to join the police force,” said inspector general Shivaji Bodkhe. 
 
 Balaji lives with his grandparents and his immediate family comprises uncle, aunt and a cousin sister. “Members of my family are daily wage workers and that is how they provide for themselves,” he said.
 
 He studies in an ashramshala in Gadchiroli. The department also organizes a recruitment drive on behalf of the police force each year and will approach Balaji after he turns 18.
