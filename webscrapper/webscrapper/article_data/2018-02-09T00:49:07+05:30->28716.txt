Chennai:   is not a systemic malady as is being believed and perceived, but also a product of tendencies that breed causes for avoidable actions, the Madras high court has said.

 Stressing the need to decongest entry and exit points of the justice delivery system, Justice N Seshasayee slammed authorities for their ‘pachydermic insensitivity and slow-motioned response’ in implementing  .
 
 The judge was passing orders on petitions filed by seven people whose lands had been acquired by the highways department. Since authorities failed to take any action even after the apex court order in 2014, the petitioners had to once again approach the high court for solatium.
 
 Justice Seshasayee, wondering whether addressing the consequences that emanated from the order of the highest court required another order from the high court, directed the authorities to consider the representations of the petitioners in the light of the apex court order, within four weeks.
 
 “Every action spurred by lack of responsibility burdens the judicial axle, drains the judicial time and buries the cry for justice. Those who cry foul of delay should now hurry to spare concern for the congestion at every point to courts,” said Justice Seshasayee. It is imperative that those, for whose benefit courts exist, act to avoid congestions, the judge said.
