CHENNAI: The Union   has prohibited the manufacture, sale and distribution of antibody detecting rapid diagnostic tests used for routine diagnosis of   after it was found that the test was triggering false alarms.

 A notification published by the ministry on March 23 said the Centre found that the use of these tests for routine diagnosis of malaria as serological testing was not practical for routine diagnosis of acute malaria. “The ban comes into force with immediate effect,” it said.
 
 The notification was based on the recommendations by the expert committee appointed by the central government. The notification, signed by joint secretary Sunil Sharma, said the Centre felt it was necessary to prohibit the use of antibody detecting rapid diagnostic tests for routine malaria diagnosis in public interest.
 
 Although it is economical, the false positive rates in endemic areas were high. People with fever who tested positive in the rapid antibody test, were later tested negative in   test, it said.
 
 Antibodies are what the body produces against a pathogen while antigen is a direct component of the pathogen.
