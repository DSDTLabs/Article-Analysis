NEW DELHI: At least 500 metres of the   flyover stretch on   will be closed for traffic between 10pm and 6am from Monday as PWD will start the work to place girders on the pillars of the parallel flyover.

 A PWD official said the stretch between   Marg and   would be shut for the work. “We have suggested that traffic can either take a detour from Nelson Mandela Marg or ply on the other carriageway on Outer Ring Road as the traffic volume at night is less. The work will be over in a month,” he said.
 
 Traffic police officers said no diversion plan had been put in place yet. So far, only heavy vehicles have been banned from plying on the stretch. 
 
  
  
 Last August, PWD had sought permission from the traffic police to close the entire 3km stretch to place girders and reinforced concrete slabs. But the work got delayed. However, at some point, the entire stretch would have to be closed for six months, said officials. In that case, the airport-bound traffic coming from the   side will be diverted to Nelson Mandela Marg and then to Abdul Gaffar Khan Marg towards NH-8 via   and Mahipalpur bypass. 
 
 With only 30% of the work over, the project is going to miss its April 2018 deadline.
