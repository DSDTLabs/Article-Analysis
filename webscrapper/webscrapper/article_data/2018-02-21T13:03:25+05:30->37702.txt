PONDA: Goa State Election Commission has preponed the   election by a week, from May 6 to April 29. 

 Some political leaders had raised objections to having election on May 6, claiming that the date clashed with a religious function, and had demanded that the date be changed to facilitate the people celebrating the festival.
 
 Post the recently conducted delimitation exercise, Ponda has 15 wards, up from the earlier 14.
