' ' director  , who feels people in   are scared to make romantic comedies now, would love to see more such films.

 "I think there needs to be more romantic comedies. They always do well but I think people are scared of making them because there is no explosion and no car chases," Gluck told 
 "But people always love a good romance," he added.
 
 Gluck, who has also made films like 'Easy A', 'Annie' and 'Peter Rabbit', feels making 'huge action movies' is the point of focus in Hollywood at present.
 
 "The trend is to make a huge action movie or a comic movie or smaller (budget) smaller movie. The movies in middle like on human relationship are not being made any more," he added.
 
 He said it is a shame "because that is the kind of movies I like to do".
 
 Gluck's next project 'Peter Rabbit' is being brought to India. It will release in the country on April 6.
 
 The film adaptation is based on the classic tale by Beatrix Potter about Peter Rabbit and his family.
 
 It narrates the adventures that Peter Rabbit (voiced by  ) and his sisters  , Mopsy and Cotton-Tail (Margot Robbie, Elizabeth Debicki and Daisy Ridley) undergo to reclaim their home.
