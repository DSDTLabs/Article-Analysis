VADODARA/ AHMEDABAD: After associating itself with the  , Formula 1, the   and the Rio 2016 Olympic Games, home grown   will now associate itself with the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy. 

 Asia’s largest milk brand will be prime sponsor of the New Zealand cricket team in the upcoming tournament that begins June 1 in England. 
 
 The logo of brand Amul that boasts of an annual sales turnover of Rs 27,000 crore (US $ 4.2 billion) will appear on the sleeve of Blackcaps playing jerseys as well as on the training kits throughout the tournament. “We are excited about being associated with New Zealand cricket for the first time and Amul welcomes the Blackcaps to the family,” R S Sodhi, managing director of the   (GCMMF) – the apex body of all district dairy unions of Gujarat that markets brand Amul said. 
 
 “Coming from a strong farming and cooperative dairy culture, the New Zealand association is a perfect fit, reflecting our quality and values,” he said. “We are delighted to have Amul on board and hopefully this is the beginning of a long-term relationship,” said James Wear, commercial director for New Zealand Cricket. 
 
 The ODI tournament sees New Zealand ranked fourth in the world just behind India and will see one of their strongest line-ups heading to the United Kingdom with a number of key in form players fresh from IPL. 
 
  The first time New Zealand will play with Amul on the shirt is a warm up match with India on May 28 followed by Sri Lanka on May 30. 
 
 The group matches of the New Zealand team are scheduled versus Australia on June 2, England on June 6 and Bangladesh on June 9. The top two teams of both groups will advance to the semi finals. It is worth mentioning here that in a bid to engage the youth, the ‘Taste of India’ had earlier sponsored the Netherlands’ cricket team in the World Cup and the Switzerland-headquartered Sauber’s F1 team at the inaugural Indian Grand Prix in 2011.
