PUNE:   traffic will be enforced around Savitribai Phule Pune   from March 7 on account of the water pipeline laying work in the area.

 As part of the new arrangement, vehicle movement from Ganeshkhind Road and Senapati Bapat Road towards Baner Road will be closed. Traffic from Pashan Road towards Ganeshkhind Road will also be closed as part of the new plan, a statement issued by the traffic police said.
 
 As a result, vehicles going to Ganeshkhind Road from Pashan Road, will now have to turn left at the Abhimanshree Society T-point and drive further on to Baner Road before reaching Ganeshkhind Road. 
 
 Vehicles coming out the   division, Pune Rural Police, CID and ATS, Modern High School and College and Loyola School will need to follow the same traffic arrangement, via Abhimanshree Society Road.
 
 Vehicles coming from Senapati Bapat Road and Ganeshkhind Road under the flyover and heading towards Baner will now be required to first drive on Pashan Road and then turn right from Abhimanshree Society to get on to Baner Road.
 
 Traffic on Aundh Road will flow as usual. The arrangement has been worked out to aid the water pipeline work in the area. It is expected to remain in force at least till March 23.
 
 Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Kalpana Baravkar said, “We have worked out the traffic diversion around University chowk to ensure avoid chaos, especially at peak hours. We will be reviewing the situation to tweak it as per requirement.”
 
 While residents of Pashan, Baner and Balewadi have welcomed the announcement of the diversion, many expressed concerns about the likely traffic jams around Abhimanshree Society road during the peak hours.
