Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday issued a strongly-worded message that bureaucrats creating roadblocks in the government’s “ease of doing business” policy will be sacked.

 He also announced an online lottery system under which industries would be selected for routine inspection. “Officials visiting these industries would need to submit their reports within 48 hours. Babus selectively choosing industries for inspection and indulging in corruption for seeking compliances will be a thing of the past,” he assured.
 
 Fadnavis was speaking after inaugurating an industrial expo organized by the Marathwada Association of Small Scale Industries and Agriculture.
 
 “A clear message has already gone out to the bureaucracy. A handful of officials trying to obstruct the ease of doing business policy will be sent home,” he warned, while appealing to industry players to completely understand the policy. 
 
 Referring to the difficulties raised by industries in obtaining non-agricultural (NA) certificates for land purchased for setting up businesses, Fadnavis said his government has already relaxed the related norms.
 
 “Industries need not obtain NA certificates for farmland. They have to pay a designated premium with the local district-level authorities and get a ‘sanad’ instead of NA certification,” he said, adding that district collectors showing reluctance in following the newly-framed procedure would face action.
 
 Industries minister Subhash Desai said   has bagged nearly half of the foreign direct investment in recent times.
