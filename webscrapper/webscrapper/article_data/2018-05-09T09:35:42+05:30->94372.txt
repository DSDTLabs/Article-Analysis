LUCKNOW: The newly elected members of the UP legislative council took oath on Tuesday even as the two members from the Opposition and one from the   missed the ceremony due to "prior commitments". 

 BSP's BR Ambedkar and Samajwadi Party's Naresh Uttam are expected to take oath on Wednesday. There were reports that even though Uttam was in Lucknow, he missed the ceremony as the Opposition members had decided not to take oath with BJP members. 
 
 Meanwhile, the schedule is not clear for BJP's Mahendra Singh who is currently in Karnataka for the assembly election campaigning.
 
 "I am out of town on party work and will take oath on Wednesday," Ambedkar told TOI. Uttam, meanwhile, had reportedly committed to attending a bhandara on the occasion of Bada Mangal and was not able to cancel. "His programme was already fixed and he could not cancel at the last minute. He will be taking oath on Wednesday," said SP spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary.
 
 The remaining 10 MLCs, including Ashish Singh from Apna Dal who won with support from BJP, were administered oath by Vidhan Parishad chairman Ramesh Yadav.
 
 Newly elected BJP MLC Bukkal Nawab, who was formerly with SP, visited the Hanuman temple in Hazratganj before reaching the assembly with a saffron tilak. On the other hand, Lucknow's heat could not deter BJP's Mohsin Raza who took oath in a three-piece suit, replete with a tie.
 
 Others who attended the ceremony included Congress MLCs   and Dinesh Singh, the latter having joined the BJP recently. BJP state president Mahendra Nath Pandey also attended the oath taking ceremony.
