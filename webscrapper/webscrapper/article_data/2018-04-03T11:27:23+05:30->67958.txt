MOHALI: The suspension of internet during the countrywide shutdown over quota verdict derailed radio-taxi and ATM services in Mohali on Monday.

 People couldn’t call a cab, withdraw cash, or connect with each other without the internet and related social media such as WhatsApp. To withdraw money from ATM (automatic teller machine) and use the internet, they had to travel to Chandigarh. Karamjit Kaur of Mohali’s Sector 71 said: “I take a cab to Chandigarh usually but, today, it was next to impossible without the internet.”
 
 The mobilie-phone users were handicapped because even the SMS (short messaging service) was off. Retired lieutenant colonel B S Sandhu said: “Protests pushed by political motives only bring harassment to the general public. Just to withdraw Rs 10,000, I had to drive down to an ATM in Chandigarh, since all banks in Mohali were shut.”
 
 The state transport buses also did no ply. The harassed commuters criticised the Dalit organisations for opposing the   verdict of amendment. Those coming over to Mohali via flights and trains called up their relatives or local journalists to know the status of law and order. Lieutenant colonel   called TOI from Delhi to say: “I am scheduled to arrive in Chandigarh by air but someone told me the situation was not appropriate. Is it safe to land?”
 
 The panicked enquiries came from as far as   in Rajasthan. People were looking for a safe passage to Chandigarh.
