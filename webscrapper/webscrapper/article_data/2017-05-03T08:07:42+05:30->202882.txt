KOHIMA:   on Tuesday sought an early solution of the   saying that "  for too long" due to this.

 "Nagas have been suffering for too long and we want to see an early solution which is amicable and honourable," Liezietsu said.
 
 He was addressing a gathering of Ao Naga and Angami Naga tribes in Mokokchung town on the occasion of Moatsu, a festival of Ao Naga community.
 
 "Let's do our best to be in a position of a civilised state because fighting for supremacy in a family can never help a family move ahead," he said hinting at fragmentation of Naga political groups into various factions.
 
 "Each one of us need to contribute our best to see that it (the Naga political issue) is solved once and for all. Each one of us has a role. If there is no peace, there cannot be progress and development," he said.
