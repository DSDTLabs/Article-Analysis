NEW DELHI: Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s sister   Vadra lost her cool during a midnight protest march in Delhi against the   and   rape incidents.

 After being pushed and jostled, Priyanka rebuked the unruly crowd, saying people should “at least respect the cause” for which they had come together, reported ANI.
 
 “Nobody will push each other,” said a visibly miffed Priyanka.
 
 “You should all know the reason for which you have gathered here. If you cannot behave, go home. Now, all of you will silently walk,” she said.
 
  
  
 Priyanka’s husband   and their children were also present at the march along with other Congress leaders, party workers and students. Protesters shouted slogans against the Narendra Modi government for its alleged failure to prevent crimes against women in the country.
 
 "We are here against crimes being committed against women, against rapes, violence and murder and the government must act on this. This is a national issue and not a political one," said Rahul at the march towards the India Gate.
 
 The issue transcends political lines, said the Congress president.
 
 "This is about our women. Thousands are present here including the common people and people from all parties. This situation in the country is such today that one after another incident of murder, rape and violence is taking place. We are standing here against that and we want the government to act," he said.
