CHENNAI:   removed by   ( ) from   last week, returned to occupy pavements, much to the dismay of residents.

 The GCC on February 10 cleared several roadside hawkers from the pavements and freed spaces for pedestrian movement along roads including  ,  ,   2nd and 3rd Avenue roads. But according to residents, within a few hours, the encroachments were set up again.
 
 “The encroachments were removed at 11.30am last Saturday with the help of traffic police and after they left the shops were back in the next hour,” said C Ramakrishnan, a resident of Gandhi Nagar. The encroachments were removed by the civic body along with the traffic police in Adyar. Another resident and a civic activist, Shanthi Kamalasekaran said the residents had been trying for years to make pavements free for pedestrians.
 
 “Many of the shops and roadside hotels are occupying not only pavements but also come onto the roads in many areas. Electricity generators, gas cylinders, and stoves are placed on the roadside without putting a thought into human safety,” said Kamalasekaran. She added that the zonal officer blamed residents for ‘patronizing’ vendors and thus ensuring that they pervade public spaces in the first place.
 
 An executive engineer from Zone 13, when contacted, said the traffic police had removed the encroachers and had been asked to ensure that they are not back. “We are doing rounds daily to see if encroachers are there but have not seen any. The traffic police barricaded the areas using tape so they won’t return,” said the official. “Will ensure action to remove those that are back,” he added.
 
 Residents of nearby areas, however, called the removal of encroachment an eyewash and claimed that no action has been taken by the civic body or the police to penalize the vendors who are back on roads.
