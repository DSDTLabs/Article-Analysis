BHOPAL: Rats have once again managed to hinder patient services at   (GMC). This time, rodents sneaked into nuclear medicine department and bit off part of cable of Spec- CT machine. 

 For past 10 days, machine tomographic imaging technique is also being used to conduct CT-scan. Over 10 to 15 cases were being regularly diagnosed at the centre. 
 
 Under pressure to deliver services after chief minister   visited the hospital last month, nuclear medicine department agreed to conduct CT-scan, too. Incidentally, rats nibbled part of cable that connects gamma camera to take CT-scan imagery. Sources said other functions of the Spec-CT machine were in use. 
 
 "We have identified problem and pest control has been ordered. New cables are being sourced from Bangalore. We expect equipment to be functional in next two days," said Dr KS Peepre, Professor, department of nuclear medicine, Gandhi Medical College (GMC). GMC and its associated hospitals Hamidia, Sultania and   are under pressure to improve patient care ever since CM's visit which came in the wake of alleged incident wherein rats nibbled dead woman's eyes. She was found lying in open on hospital campus.
 
 The department of nuclear medicine facility is in Kamla wing of the medical college campus.
 
 One of the reasons for rat infestation is heaps of garbage between open space of the six-storeyed building. 
 
 Sources said the department has never been inclined to conduct CT-scan as it falls under trauma and emergency care. Earlier, CT-scan machine bought by the state government-run   was utilised. That machine has been not functional for months. 
 
  (SPECT, or less commonly, SPET) is similar to conventional nuclear medicine planar imaging using a gamma camera. However, it is able to provide true 3D information.
