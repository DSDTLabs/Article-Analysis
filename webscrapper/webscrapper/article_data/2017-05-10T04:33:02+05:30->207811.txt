New Delhi: A 21-month-old girl was sexually assaulted by her   in   in northeast Delhi. The survivor was admitted to   in central Delhi and underwent a minor surgery on Tuesday. She will remain at the hospital for the next 10 days.

 Around 8pm on Sunday, the child’s mother left her outside the house to play while she took care of her eight-month-old brother. Her father, who owns a grocery shop nearby, kept an eye on her while she played on the entrance stairs. However, a few minutes later he got a call from a customer and went to his shop to fetch milk and soft drinks.
 
 Sensing an opportunity, their neighbour Hari Ram (40) picked up the girl and took her to his apartment. About 15 minutes later, the girl was found crying with pain in her abdomen. 
 
 “My wife presumed that she wanted to relieve herself and took her to the washroom. She found my daughter bleeding from her private parts,” said the child’s father.
 
 The child’s mother called her husband and neighbours and they took her to Chacha Nehru Hospital from where she was referred to JPN Hospital. Doctors confirmed sexual assault and informed the police.
 
 The girl’s family found Hari Ram in his apartment and he tried to feign ignorance about the crime. He later blamed it on a relative of the girl. He confessed to the crime after getting thrashed by the family members.
 
 Police said when the accused started the sexual assault, the child started crying. Hari Ram panicked and dropped her back. The accused, a native of Bihar, is tailor at a shop in   clothes market. He was often seen playing with children in the locality. 
 
 “He came to live here a year ago. He is a drunkard. We suspect that he has sexually assaulted other children as well,” said another neighbour.
