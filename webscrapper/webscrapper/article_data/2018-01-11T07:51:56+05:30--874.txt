JAIPUR: In a big blow to   education in the state,   ( ) has yet again recommended to the Centre to not give permission for the establishment of seven proposed government medical colleges in seven districts of the state.

 The state government here was hopeful of starting academic session from 2018-19 in at least five districts - Bhilwara, Bharatpur, Churu, Pali and Dungarpur. However, all applications for the proposed colleges were rejected by the MCI. The state government had little hope for Barmer and   as it was not prepared for beginning with new session.
 
 MCI released its report at the executive committee meeting, held on December 14, 2017 in New Delhi, during which applications for new medical colleges and increasing the number of seats at the existing medical colleges in the country were discussed.
 
 The MCI team had inspected the proposed medical colleges in the state in November. The assessment report done by the MCI team was presented before the executive committee. The executive committee found that these medical colleges do not have adequate facilities leading to failure to meet the eligibility criteria for commencing as medical colleges from 2018-19.
