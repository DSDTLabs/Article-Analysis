BHOPAL/JABALPUR: Two   were suspended on Friday for allegedly releasing the   of a   who was raped by eight men earlier this week. Only two days ago, the cops were rewarded for quick arrest of the suspects.

 The leaked video, where the girl narrates her ordeal, has gone viral and police are trying to stop its circulation.
 
 
 The 15-year-old had gone with a friend to a deserted place on a hilltop on Monday evening where seven others joined him, and they took turns to rape her between 4pm and 6pm. She confided in her parents, who immediately went to police. Cops from Ranjhi police station took rapid action and nabbed all eight accused within a couple of hours. The top brass lauded the team and Jabalpur SP Shashikant Shukla awarded each of them Rs 10,000 on February 7.
 
 But a day later, a video surfaced on   showing the girl recording her statement. As soon as information reached senior officials, they launched an internal probe and identified two cops — head constable Rameshwar and constable Bahadur, who had played a key role in the arrests. They were suspended.
 
 “The act of making a video and sharing it is wrong and the two policemen were suspended today (Feb 9). We are investigating the incident,” the SP told TOI.
