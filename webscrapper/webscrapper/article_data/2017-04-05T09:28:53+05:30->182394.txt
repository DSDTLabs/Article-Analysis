JABALPUR: If Congressmen do not improve now, then no one can save them, said   (AICC) general secretary Digvijaya Singh while addressing media persons in Jabalpur town on Tuesday.

 When asked about the internal groupism in the party’s state unit, without naming anyone, he said, “Congresi ab nahi sudhre toh inko koi nahi bacha sakta (if Congressmen do not improve now, no one can save them). Congressmen will have to reach out to public and work. Everyone in the party should be respected.”
 
 He said that Congressmen had fought for freedom of the country, now will fight for providing basic facilities to the people of this country. 
 
 Talking about Goa results and allegations against him that ‘the party could not form the government because he had gone to visit Goa’, he said, “If I had not gone to Goa and not worked for the party there, the party numbers in the assembly would not have increased from six to 19.” 
 
 Addressing the press conference, he said, “The party will start a systematic series of agitations against the corruption prevalent in the civic bodies. Civic bodies receive huge funds and an entire city can get a facelift if it is properly utilised, but corruption eats up the money.”
 
 Talking about the recent controversy with regard to CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s comments on Scindia family, Singh alleged, “It has exposed the dual character of  . He had become chief minister with the blessings of Rajmata Vijaya Raje Scindia. Several other BJP leaders have got top posts only because of her. But they have all forgotten it.”
