NEW DELHI: Kirari’s AAP MLA  , who allegedly featured in a sting operation conducted by a former councillor from Kirari,  , in which he is allegedly talking about collecting money from people involved in gambling rackets and cuts from factories illegally operating in Kirari, has claimed the video is doctored. It was recorded six months ago and run on a local TV channel, Darpan TV. 

 “I was there in an informal meeting where the video was shot. My face is shown in the video but the voice is of somebody else. It was doctored by people who are politically opposed to me,” he told TOI.
 
 In an another audio recording, allegedly featuring Rituraj — released by Pushpraj, who won the 2012 civic polls on a BSP ticket from Kirari — a man is heard abusing and threatening Pushpraj. The man seems to be drunk. “Please note that the man is speaking in a Haryanvi accent while mine is that of a Bihari. Somebody else's voice has been used to defame me,” Rituraj told TOI.
 
 Rituraj belongs to   district of Bihar and has been living in Delhi for the past 10 years. He said he will lodge a case against Pushpraj. “I am exploring legal recourse,” he said. Pushpraj, too, threatened to lodge a case against Rituraj on Monday.
 
 In Kirari, which is dominated by migrants, gambling is an old issue. Before he became an MLA, Rituraj had himself taken up the issue. A police officer said raids are conducted and accused held regularly when information against gambling is given to the police. “No formal complaint against the MLA’s involvement has been lodged,” said a police officer.
 
 AAP functionaries Ashutosh and Sanjay Singh did not respond to calls and SMSes sent to seek comments on the controversy.
