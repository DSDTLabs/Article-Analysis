CHENNAI: After a delay of over two years, the city corporation is pushing ahead with temple tank restoration project but the funds will be drawn out of the coffers of Chennai Smart City Limited.

 According to corporation sources, the project executed under the ‘Sustainable Water Security Mission’ will see 15   restored at a cost of Rs 2.28 crore.
 
 The temple tanks included in the project are Gangadeeswarar Koil tank in Purasawalkam, Virupaacheeswarar temple in Mylapore, Biragi Madam Venkatesa Perumal Koil, Angala Parameswari Koil, Ekambareswarar Koil and Kasi Viswanathar Koil in Royapuram zone, Prasanna Venkatesa Perumal and Peyazhvar Koil in Saidapet, Kandasamy and Aathimottaiamman Koil in Kuyapettai, Chenna Malleswarar Chenna Kesavaperumal Koil and Mallikeswarar Koil in George Town, Kalyana Varadaraja Perumal Koil in Kaladipet, Thiruvetteswarar Koil in Teynampet zone, Kasi Viswanathasamy Koil in Ayanavaram, Sengazhuneer Pillaiyar Koil and Katchaleeswarar Koil in Royapuram zone.
 
 “The project would involve removing garbage found in the temple tank and then desilting it to increase its water storage capacity. We will form bund and strengthen the structure because a few tanks in the   neighbourhood are in a really bad shape,” a corporation official said.
 
 The corporation also intends to capture rain water from roof tops of houses and buildings surrounding the temple tank and re-route the water into the tank’s bed. “Sunken wells too will be provided to help ground water recharge process,” the official added.
 
 The proposal would be placed before the upcoming Chennai Smart City Limited board meeting for approval, officials said.
 
 Initially, the corporation identified 17 temple tanks for restoration. The final list, however, does not include the Thyagaraja Swami temple in Thiruvottiyur and the Madhava Perumal temple in Mylapore with the civic body providing no explanation for the exclusion.
