 The state machinery is in an overdrive since the time the intelligence wing of UP Police warned them about the expected presence of several Dalit leaders at the event.

While the chief of Bhim Army remains in prison, about three dozen members of the outfit have been granted bail and some are expected to participate in the event.
 
 Based on the inputs, the DGP headquarters on Thursday sounded an alert. ADG (law and order) Anand Kumar said, “Police chiefs have been asked to keep a watch on trouble-makers in their districts. Some people are trying to vitiate the atmosphere by creating caste conflicts. Some incriminating videos have come to our notice and teams have been constituted to nab the culprits.”
 
 Among the disturbing posts is a video of Lokesh Katariya, founder of Bhim Yuva Sanghathan, tearing posters of religious figures.
 
 The report also states sub-inspector in crime branch of Delhi Police Ravikant Ambedkar and Muzaffarnagar DySP Rajiv Kumar Singh as participants.
