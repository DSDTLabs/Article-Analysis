PUNE: A fresh policy aimed at providing incentives to drivers and conductors of buses on routes whose revenue exceeds the income target is being formulated by the   (PMPML).

 “Earlier, 20 to 25 profitable routes were identified for the incentive scheme. If there were five buses plying on one such route and they exceeded the target of Rs 5,000 on a single shift, 10% of the income was given in the form of incentives to drivers and conductors. For meeting the target, the buses had to ensure that they stopped on all bus stops, were punctual and carried enough passengers”, an official told TOI.
 
 Now, this system has been abolished. It was felt that a new incentive system on all   bus routes should be formulated so that there was competition to work in an effective way and achieve the targets. The targets for different routes will be decided soon, a transport official told TOI.
 
 With stress on bringing more buses on roads, sources said that a deadline till April end had been given by  , chairman and managing director, PMPL, to ensure that 100 buses, which have technical faults, hit the roads soon.
 
 “Instructions have been given to ensure that buses with minor faults are repaired and made operational this week. Action will be initiated against depot managers, engineers and other concerned staff members if the 100 non-operational buses do not start running within the deadline,” an official pointed out.
