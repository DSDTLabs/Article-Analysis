Reports about  's comedienne   tying the knot with co-star   have been doing the rounds in the media. However, while speaking exclusively to the TimesOfIndia.com, both the actors rubbished the rumour.
 
  "I am getting calls from my friends and family from all over the world to ask me about this. My mom doesn't stay with me and she called me up to clarify the same. She knows   and was shocked to hear that I have decided to get married without even informing her. But everything is cool at home now. I made her understand that this is a false news and we had a great laugh over it. I think the report is a bad joke and lacks content. It's a very bad thing that people cook up a story and don't even clarify before publishing it," said Sugandha.
  
  
  
  A multi-talented artist Sugandha, who is known for her singing and comedy prowess, feels since she shares a good rapport with Sanket, and they work and travel together for live shows, somebody must have cooked up this story.
  
  Sanket also denied the news and called it a figment of someone's imagination.
  
  "I don't know where this news is coming from. Whoever has written this has not tried calling anyone of us. We are just good friends and we are not getting married. I think this story is a figment of someone's imagination", clarified Sanket.
  
  
 
  
  Sanket and Sugandha, who played boyfriend and girlfriend on TKSS, have known each other for a long time. "Sugandha and I have worked on different shows, but that doesn't mean we are dating or seeing each other. I think this is a big misunderstanding," says the actor who is popular for mimicking Sanjay Dutt.
  
  "We are good friends and nothing is going to change between us because of this false news. We will continue to work together in future, too," concludes Sanket.
