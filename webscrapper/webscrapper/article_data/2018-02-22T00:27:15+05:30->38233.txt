MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday said it could not order the closure of   dumping ground, the only one in Mumbai that complies with solid waste management rules.

 A division bench of justices Abhay Oka and   said it could not pass such a “drastic order”. However, it asked the   Pollution Control Board (MPCB) to inspect the site and verify if the dumping ground complied with all conditions for environmental clearance.
 
 The court was hearing petitions filed by Kannamwar Housing Society Association and NGO Vanashakti on alleged violation of pollution norms at the dumping ground. The association claims odour emanating from the site is a health risk to residents.
 
 The bench pointed out that the dumping ground with a daily capacity to handle 3,000 metric tonnes of solid waste is the only one in the city that has all its clearances in place.
 
 “No drastic interim order to stop dumping of garbage at the site can be granted. Compliance with environmental clearance conditions has to be ensured,” said the judges adding they would look into “steps to be taken to minimise inconvenience to residents staying in nearby localities.” 
 
 The court directed MPCB officers to visit the site and ascertain compliance. Advocates   and Abhijit Rane, counsel for the association, pointed out that the last inspection report had revealed destruction of mangroves and that authorities were not maintaining the buffer zone around mangrove plots. Further, the bio-reactor plant was not operational.
