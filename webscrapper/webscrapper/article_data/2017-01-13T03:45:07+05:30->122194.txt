MEERUT: A Dalit man who was critical of controversial BJP   Sangeet Som’s performance as MLA, was allegedly beaten up by supporters of Som on Tuesday.

 Satyapal Bhundi, a resident of Peshawali in Sardhana, 25 km from here, criticised Som during a meeting in the village for staying away from the constituency for five years and only appearing during polls. He was then beaten up by supporters of the MLA and thrown out of the venue. An FIR was registered by Sardhana police against two persons under the SC/ST Act.
 
 Bhundi specified in the FIR that when Som entered the village, he criticised the BJP MLA’s performance over the past five years and accused him of only seeking votes and not working for the people.
 
 “We received Bhundi’s complaint on Tuesday and have registered a case against two persons. We will investigate the matter and only then can we issue a statement about it,” Manoj Kumar Mishra, station house officer, Sardhana police station, told TOI.
 
 Som claimed he was not in the village on Tuesday. “I was not even there... It is a false case which has been registered to tarnish my image,” the MLA alleged.
