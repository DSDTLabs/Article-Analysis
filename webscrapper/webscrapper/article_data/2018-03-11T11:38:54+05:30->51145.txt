JAIPUR: The forest department officials at   (STR) on Saturday finally pressed a panic button after no traces of   ST-5 were found even after 15 days. 

 The department has failed to track the missing tigress despite searching for last one week. Its disappearance has fuelled speculations of poaching and has added to the forest department’s worries.
 
 In a letter, the STR administration has also informed the chief wildlife warden about the missing tigress. 
 
 On March 3, the administration started a massive hunt and teams were sent in five ranges, including Tehla, Akbarpur, Sariska buffer,   and Sariska range. Forest department is also having sleepless nights as radio-collar of the tigress ST-5, who was relocated eight years ago from   stopped functioning. 
 
 According to the official, the pugmarks of this big cat were last recorded by the authorities in Khetra region near Umri village of Akbarpur range. 
 
 DFO Sariska, Balaji Kari, said, “The pugmark of the tigress was last found on February 24. Three days later, in Tehla range, another pubmark was found, which could be possibly of same tigress. To trace the tigress, we have installed trap cameras on all locations,” he said. 
 
 The forest officials are assuming three possibilities after ST-5 went missing. Many claimed, that the tigress has moved to a safer place (in cave) to give birth to the cubs, or it has changed its territory. However, as per reports, the tigress on February 19, had mating with ST-11.
 
 “The movement of the tigress was witnessed after five days of mating. Also, if tigress was found mating, by any chance it cannot litter. It is been reasoned that ST-5, moved out as there were four other tigresses in her territory. However, for the past 15 days, no movement has been recorded. Also, big cat didn’t kill any animal,” an official said.
