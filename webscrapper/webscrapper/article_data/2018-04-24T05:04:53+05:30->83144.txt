MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday directed the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Mumbai police to get a forensic audit done on assets of builder Jaycee Homes whose director Dipesh   is in judicial custody in a case of cheating homebuyers. Justice S J   also directed the civic administration to inform by Wednesday whether construction of Bhagtani Krishaang, a project in Powai, is approved and as per sanctioned plans and how much of it is unauthorized after a lawyer for the buyers said the BMC has served demolition notice for top three floors of the 23-storey tower.

 The HC also directed Bhagtani to give status of all his assets by Wednesday. His counsel   said it would be difficult as Bhagtani is in jail. Justice Kathawalla ordered Arthur Road jail officials to produce Bhagtani in court on Wednesday when EOW officials have to inform what steps had been initiated against his father and brother who, the HC observed, “have left the country with the intention of evading their arrest, after their anticipatory bail applications were rejected".
 
 “The Directors of   have cheated several flat purchasers by collecting crores of rupees from them and not completing the project as promised," Justice Kathawalla had said earlier this month while hearing a plea by a set of buyers. The other two directors of the firm—Mukesh and   left the country with their family members and are in Dubai.
