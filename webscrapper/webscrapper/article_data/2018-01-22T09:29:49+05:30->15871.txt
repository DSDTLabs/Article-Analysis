To give an idea of the distances involved, the moon is 3.84 lakh km away from Earth. Scientists have predicted that this giant rock from outer space will fly past our planet at a speed of over 1 lakh kmph.US space agency Nasa describes asteroids of a certain width hazardous if they come within 74.8 lakh km of Earth.
 
 
 
 
 
 In the early years of its formation (4 billion years ago), Earth was bombarded with asteroids and comets. The last of the five known events of mass extinction on Earth (65 million years ago) was caused by an asteroid crashing near modern day Mexico, the impact of which resulted in the extinction of nearly 75% of Earth’s plants and animal species, including dinosaurs. It resulted in widespread change in the Earth’s climate. The   crater located in   town is the proof of that event.
