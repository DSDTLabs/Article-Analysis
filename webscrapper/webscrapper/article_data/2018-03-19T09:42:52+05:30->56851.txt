PUNE: The state education department’s claim of improving facilities at schools has fallen flat with a distinct drop in meeting infrastructure norms set under the   for  .

 The state economic survey has revealed that out of the seven indicators, there has been slight improvement in only one parameter that of providing computer laboratories while there has been a drop in all the other parameters, including providing separate toilets for girls.
 
 The ministry of   has set an annual deadline of March 31to improve the quality of schools in every state by upgrading their facilities in compliance with the key provisions of the  , including drinking water facilities, libraries, toilets, buildings, etc. 
  
 
 Educationists said the government had promised to fulfil the infrastructure requirements that were prescribed in the RTE. However, that hasn’t been done and due to this, the quality of education is being affected in state schools. Now, the government is shutting down schools for lack of quality.
 
 Educationist Nihal Kirnalli said, “The most shocking aspect of the survey is the decline in functional toilets for girls in schools. It has gone down to 96.8% from 99.4% in the last three years. How does the state even claim that it is empowering the girl child? This is ridiculous and it seems the government is lying. The facts on the ground prove it.”
 
 Kirnalli said sports is an important factor in a child’s development and the reducing number of playgrounds is a worrying sign. “Surely, there is some improvement in providing computers, but it is of no use if there are less number of libraries than before, drinking water facilities have reduced and there are no toilets,” Kirnalli added.
