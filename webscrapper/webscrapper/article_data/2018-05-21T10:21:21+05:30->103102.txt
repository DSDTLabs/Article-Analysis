BENGALURU: Senior leader DK Shivakumar, who ensured   threw in the towel ahead of the motion of confidence on Saturday by keeping the flock of   MLAs safe from alleged BJP poaching, admitted that the Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) combine has a stiff task on its hand to keep the coalition stable. In an interview with the Times of India, Shivakumar said the Congress-JD(S) alliance was forged with a larger political picture in mind.

 
 
 
 
 It was both a torture and a pain which is difficult to imagine. The BJP made attempts to poach 60 per cent of Congress MLAs, but it was the collective efforts of Congress leaders which prevented this from happening. I should thank AICC president   for the decision to draw up plans A, B and C even before the results were announced. The sole motive was to keep the BJP out.
 
 
 
 Shah's statement is clear evidence of what the BJP was up to with its unethical plans. They wanted defections to happen. Congress efforts to keep the BJP out were not just for the sake of Karnataka, but were done keeping the entire country in mind.
 
 
 
 I agree that differences between the two parties exist in Mandya, Mysuru and Chamarajanagar areas. Beyond Tumukuru and Davanagere there is no issue between workers of both parties. My task now is to go around Mysuru and other regions to convince our workers to mesh with the JD(S). I also have to provide protection to them so that they are not harmed in any manner.
 
 
 
 In the interests of Congress, we have to swallow differences within the party and with the JD(S). There will be pressures and pulls, but we have to stay united.
 
 
 
 This magnetic personality is the confidence I carry and which I infuse among the workers. If I do not have this why would the Congress leadership entrust me with the responsibility of hosting the Maharashtra MLAs in 2002, or the legislators from Gujarat in 2017? This is my strength.
 
 
 
 I don't want to discuss this now.
