New Delhi: In a boost to the private operator running Delhi’s international airport, the high court on Monday cleared the decks for it to   for commercial purposes.

 A bench of Chief Justice G Rohini and Justice Sangita Dhingra Sehgal set aside a policy decision taken by the Centre to exclude   from the ambit of its 2016  . The policy liberalised the use of non-flying related land strips in an airport for commercial use.
 
 “Accordingly, the letter dated 10.10.2016 of the Respondent No.1 (government) is hereby set aside and there shall be a direction to the respondents to take the necessary further steps in terms of the findings recorded by us in this order and to extend the benefit of liberalised use of airport land under clause 12(d) of NCAP, 2016 to the Petitioner (DIAL) in respect of IGI 0Airport on par with the existing and future airports of AAI as well as future projects under PPP,” the bench ruled, granting relief to  .
 
 The private operator had approached HC challenging IGI’s exclusion from the benefits of new aviation policy on the ground that only future private-public partnership projects are covered under the new scheme.
 
 In its defence, the government maintained that NCAP has been initiated and issued in the national interest, keeping in mind domestic and international passenger traffic for overall growth of national civil aviation.
 
 But HC pointed out that exclusion of existing PPP airports from availing the benefit of the policy which would enable to develop the existing airports and to increase revenue to the public exchequer, “would be completely arbitrary and discriminatory.”
 
 It added that “exclusion of existing PPP airports is also against the interest of the public at large since while the liberalised use of airport land by the AAI airports and future PPP airports will promote wider economy in the vicinity and benefit the passengers and the public at large in terms of overall development, the economic activity in the vicinity of the existing PPP airports would remain stagnant and deprive the passengers the same benefits.”
 
 The court also reminded the government that DIAL is operating IGI Airport on behalf of AAI, rejecting the Centre’s stand that IGI Airport is different from “AAI Airport.”
