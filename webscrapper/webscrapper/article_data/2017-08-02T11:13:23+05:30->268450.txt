The petitioner challenged the GO 379, issued by the AP government in May 2017, and informed the court that the MLA is an accused in a case of burning a police jeep. 
 
 Ashok Reddy was elected on a YSRCP ticket, but he switched over to TDP. It was only after joining the ruling party that the case against him was withdrawn through a GO, Vedula Venkata Ramana, counsel for the petitioner said.
 
 The bench too found the language deployed in the GO objectionable. Can you issue a direction to the PP, the bench asked the state counsel, Krishna Prakash, and gave him two days to come back with details. A lot of debate is going on such   of prosecutions, the bench said.
