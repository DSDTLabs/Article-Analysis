 The court told the states to speed up the process of setting up monitoring stations, asking them to ensure the entire network is strengthened ahead of next winter. The body, at a meeting on Wednesday, also said that they will officially write letters to the Haryana and Uttar Pradesh   over the missed deadlines and asking them to set a target, which can be met.
 
 “I will call a meeting of the chief secretaries. We want these stations to be up and running as soon as possible. You were given a deadline of February end. Where are these stations now?” said EPCA chief Bhure Lal at the meeting, adding that the states required to set up a timeline, which was realistic and needed to be met.
 
 EPCA member Sunita Narain, who was also present at the meeting, asked authorities to ensure that the stations were set up as soon as possible, following which they could be connected to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) network and can be checked if they are functioning properly or not. “We have been asking you time and again to do this but you still haven’t met the deadlines. We are tired of chasing after you,” Narain said.
 
 The capital, meanwhile, has 24 stations operating currently, however, nearly 20 are yet to be connected to the CPCB’s website.
 
 NCR’s   monitoring network is all set to be strengthened further with 13 new stations coming up in Haryana, while UP will get 10 more. Currently, Haryana has just three monitoring stations — Gurgaon, Faridabad and Rohtak. UP meanwhile has just two functioning stations currently — Noida and Ghaziabad, both of which have been showing high readings and were regularly in the “severe” category of CPCB’s index during this winter.
