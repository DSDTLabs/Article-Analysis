A recent fashion show held in the city saw models acing the ramp walk, and slaying it with their matchless sense of style and glamour. The attires that caught the eye were the long and short floral dresses, in pastel colours. While these fashionistas stole the show, the ones off the ramp too made a statement of their own. Actress   was spotted in a turquoise blue designer wear. Anchor and model Shanu Suresh too looked every bit a quintessential beauty in her traditional get-up. Others, who managed to strike a pose, were mostly in sherwanis and saris.
