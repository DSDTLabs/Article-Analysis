 Gagare, who is from the Yerawada traffic division, told TOI, “I returned to the place after sometime and searched for the machine, but could not find it.” He later lodged a theft complaint with the Airport police. 
  
 An official from the traffic branch said the equipment can be traced with the help of its IMEI number and that the machine cannot be used for any other purpose. 
  
 Senior inspector S B   said, “The equipment was lost because of the policeman’s negligence. A public appeal has been made to return the machine.”
