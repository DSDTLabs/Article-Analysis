Two marks are all that separated this quintet ­ Navya Venugopal, Sathwik K, Priya Nayak, Prajna Jangam and Akash S Bharadwaj ­ from scoring a perfect 625 in the 2017 SSLC examination. However, they are not lamenting their failure to touch the magic number.

 Navya of Stella Mary's High School, attributed her success to her rigorous study schedule ­ she spent 10 hours daily pouring over books and notes. “I was keen on doing well in the examination, and spent several sleepless nights preparing,“ said Navya, whose mother Ramya quit her job as a HR professional when her daughter joined high school.
 
 “I can always go back to work, but my daughter couldn't have written this exam again,“ said Ramya. Maternal presence was vital to Sathwik's success as well.“I am really grateful to my mother. She helped by getting printouts of old question papers,“ said Sathwik, who lost two precious marks in maths.A VVS Sardar Patel English High School student, Sathwik wants to become a scientist.
 
 Prajna, a student of Poorna Prajna Education Centre at Sadashivanagar, never counted the number of hours she spent studying. “Sleep well, eat well and stay healthy. I started reading seriously only during the study holidays,“ said Prajna.
 
 “My teachers were the best,“ said Priya, a student of Holy Child English High School. She also thanked her parents and sister for their continous support.
 
 A student of Little Angels English Medium High School, Akash said he always stuck to his timetable. “I set myself a daily target, and made sure I met that at any cost,“ he said.
