NEW DELHI: The government has justified its decision to not participate in negotiations for a treaty to ban nuclear weapons, saying this treaty did not in any way constitute or contribute to the development of any “customary international law”.

 This comes even as the government reiterated that India remained committed to “universal, non-discriminatory and verifiable nuclear disarmament”.
 
 The treaty, the first multilateral legally-binding instrument for  , was adopted last week at the   in New York. The negotiations for the treaty were concluded earlier this month under UNGA rules of procedure pursuant to a December 2016 resolution on which India had abstained, said the government. None of the other countries possessing nuclear weapons had participated in the negotiations.
 
 “These negotiations were conducted under   rules of procedure, pursuant to UN General Assembly Resolution 71/258 of 23 December 2016. India had abstained on this Resolution and provided a detailed Explanation of Vote,” said MEA spokesperson  .
 
 In its Explanation of Vote, India had said it was “not convinced” that the proposed conference could address the longstanding expectation of the international community for the comprehensive instrument on nuclear disarmament.
 
 “India, therefore, cannot be a party to the Treaty, and so shall not be bound by any of the obligations that may arise from it. India believes that this Treaty in no way constitutes or contributes to the development of any customary international law,'' said Baglay. India and other nuclear-armed nations —the US, Russia, Britain, China, France, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel — had not participated in the negotiations.
