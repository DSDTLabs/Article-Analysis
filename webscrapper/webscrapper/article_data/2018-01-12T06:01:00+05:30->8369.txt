GHAZIABAD: The   administration has undertaken a project to increase the height of dividers along the   by around 2 feet and seal illegal cuts to reduce traffic congestion on the stretch.

 Estimated at over Rs 5 crore, the project is being implemented by the Public Works Department.
 
 According to officials, a number of illegal cuts will be closed a long the 40km stretch between T-Point and   and two new U-turns constructed. The stretch was part of NH58 until it was de-notified by the National Highways Authority of India two years ago.
 
 “An estimate had been submitted by the PWD following a survey of the road. The budget has been sanctioned. The purpose behind increasing the height of the road divider is to close the illegal cuts and make the traffic movement smooth,” said district magistrate  .
 
  
  
 The project will be implemented in two parts. Officials said the first component had been estimated at Rs 1.25 crore and would involve increasing the height of the dividers and closing the illegal cuts. A total of 76 illegal cuts has been identified by the PWD.
 
 The second portion of the project is supposed to involve the construction of the two U-turns along the road dividers on either side of the Raj Nagar Extension crossing. Two spots at 500 metres each from the crossing have been identified for the U-turns.
 
 The officials said the road from Ghaziabad to   is also being widened on the right by around 7.5-10 metres to avoid traffic congestion. A cost of Rs 4 crore has been sanctioned by the   for the second part of the project.
 
 Sources in the PWD said the construction agency had spoken to different departments regarding the uprooting of trees and electric poles at the points where the U-turns would be constructed. The administration is also planning to plant saplings along the stretch.
