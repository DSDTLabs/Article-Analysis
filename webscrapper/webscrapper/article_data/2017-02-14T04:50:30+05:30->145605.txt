PATIALA: The gangsters who escaped from   on November 27 last year were being directed from a “control room” in Honk Kong to remain out of police’s reach while staying in touch with each other. 

 This fact was revealed by the jailbreak mastermind   and his three accomplices after they were nabbed from a village in Moga on Sunday.
 
 Police officials told TOI that one of their aides,  , who had slipped out of the country after jumping bail in June last year, was manning the control room and using internet telephony to communicate.
 
 Sekhon told the sleuths that each gangster was in touch with Romy and it was through him that they were sharing information. “It became difficult to track their movements as they were using internet telephony and were not communicating directly with each other or with their families. Romy coordinated their movements,” Patiala range DIG   said. Romy kept the gangsters informed about the latest developments.
 
 Choudhary said that it was Romy who funded the entire jailbreak operation and was providing funds through various channels to the gangsters for their daily needs and even for buying weapons. Punjab police have approached   to get a red corner notice issued in Romy’s name so that he can be extradited to India.
 
 Choudhary said that while Sekhon, his cousin Manvir, Sultan and  , were planning to flee the country using fake passports, they had also planned to attack gangsters with whom Sekhon had an old animosity.
 
 The DIG said the four had returned to Punjab on February 5 and were spotted by informers. “As Sekhon had trimmed his beard and changed his looks, it took some time for us to ascertain that these were actually the same gangsters who had escaped from Nabha. Once we were certain of their identities, we swept in and arrested the accused without giving them any leverage to retaliate or attempt an escape. Some bullets were fired in the air,” the officer said.
