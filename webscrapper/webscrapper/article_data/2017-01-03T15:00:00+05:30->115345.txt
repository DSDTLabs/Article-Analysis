 The wedding will be solemnised in Rohtak, reveals Satyawart and adds, “There are around 8000 guests expected at the wedding on April 2.

Invitations will be sent to all the leading politicians,   stars and other VIPs.”
 
 
 
 Quite intrigued to see his ladylove in the bridal finery, Satyawart reveals, “Sakshi will wear a red and gold ghagra for the wedding, which is being designed in Delhi. I plan to wear a sherwani for the wedding and maybe a bandgala or a suit for the tilak. But I will finalise my wedding attire once the wrestling league is over. In fact, we were supposed to get married in January, but with league being shifted to January, we postponed our wedding date to April.”
 
 
 
 Being an extremely sensitive man, Satyawart realises his responsibility as a future husband and adds, “I will ensure that Sakshi stays happy forever. I don’t want to see tears in my wife’s eyes and together we want to bring medals and laurels for the nation. Her victory and joy would make me the happiest, and I am sure, we will always remain each other’s biggest strength and motivation.”
 
 
 
 Interestingly, the groom-to-be has already decided on the special gift for his future wife. “I want to give a diamond set to Sakshi on our wedding night. As far as the rest of the trousseau is concerned, my mother has already started shopping for jewellery for her bahu. She has picked up some beautiful gold pieces for Sakshi,” says Satyawart.
