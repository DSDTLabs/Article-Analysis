 Fears that the 36th   in Goa would be postponed in the wake of chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s ill health were allayed by Sports Authority of Goa executive director VM Prabhudesai.
 
  “Preparations for the Games are moving smoothly and the honourable chief minister Mr Parrikar is monitoring activity on a regular basis from the US where he is undergoing medical treatment (for a pancreatic ailment),” Prabhudesai elaborated.
  
  Prabhudesai added that the sports minister  , on his part, is forceful in persuading functionaries to complete procedures and projects that would enable the National Games meet the November 4-17 dates.
  
  “As a matter of fact, the Games could start a few days earlier so as to help us hold more disciplines at major venues,” Prabhudesai said.
  
  The oft-postponed Games were given a lease of life when the CM assured the   last year that the Games would be held during the aforesaid dates.
  
  His assurance, keeping the Games infra-structure firmly in mind, has translated into feverish activity that sees the bureaucracy and the sports administration working zealously to meet the commitment, affirmed Prabhudesai.
  
  Tenders have been issued for the Games projects, chiefly upgrading of venues, and work orders should be issued next month according to a senior SAG official who expects work to be complete within a five month time frame.
