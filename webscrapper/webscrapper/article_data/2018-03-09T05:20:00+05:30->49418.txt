MUMBAI: Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday suspended a three-year sentence recently awarded by a special Sebi court to former stockbroker   and granted him bail. The   (Sebi) judge had convicted Parekh and his relative in a securities scam for violating the Sebi Act.

 The HC, after hearing Parekh’s counsel  , suspended the sentence, pending his appeal hearing and directed his release on two sureties. Sebi counsel   said more cases were pending against him. The court asked if there were any of grave offences like murder and   said there weren’t. An appeal hearing and disposal could take years, even the court observed, and granted bail. The Sebi had found that acquisition of shares of Shonkh Technologies International was made in violation of the Sebi Act.
