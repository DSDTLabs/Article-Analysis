MUMBAI: The   on Thursday slammed the Thane Municipal Corporation's Tree Authority for its complete non-application of mind while permitting 5,326 trees to be felled. 

 A bench of Justices Abhay Oka and Riyaz Chagla is dictating its order on petitions challenging an amendment to the Trees Act which empowers the municipal commissioner to permit up to 25 trees to be cut. Beyond 25, it will go before the Tree Authority. For Thane, activist Rohit Joshi challenged the TA's constitution, including appointment of nominated members and special invitees. In December 2017, the HC temporarily stayed all permissions given by it and a month later restrained it from functioning.
 
 The judges had examined the decision-making authority of the authority. Out of 37 applicants for the post of nominated member, five persons found eligible by the scrutiny committee were "surprisingly" not appointed. The judges said "ex facie, the entire process of appointing nominated members has been completely vitiated".
 
 They said the appointment of five persons as special invitee members was "backdoor entry" and "this is nothing but a gross abuse of power". The scrutiny committee had found four of the five special invitees ineligible.
 
 The judges referred to 21 proposals approved in one meeting on October 17, 2017, when the authority permitted cutting of 1,537 trees and transplanting of 3,789 others. "This is prima facie indication of the fact that there was complete non-application of mind by the Tree Authority," they said. The Act contemplates procedure to be followed, including that the tree officer makes an inquiry and submits a report. The "minimum" expected was that the authority ought to have considered the report in each case, they added. The dictation will continue on Friday.
