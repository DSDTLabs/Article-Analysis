MARGAO:   (GVP) on Friday announced its first list of four candidates for the constituencies of Pernem, Cortalim, Navelim and Sanguem.

 Addressing a press conference on Friday, GVP president Lyndon Monteiro welcomed three new entrants – Nelly Rodrigues,   and Rakhi Naik, who recently quit the Nationalist   (NCP), along with their supporters.
 
 It was a homecoming for Rodrigues, who had earlier quit the GVP to join the NCP. The trio expressed strong displeasure about NCP’s delay in announcing their candidature, “despite having worked hard for the NCP in their respective areas”. While Barreto lashed out at his arch-rival and   president Luizinho Faleiro, Rodrigues defended herself against the allegations of having received bribes not to contest the Cortalim bypolls in 2012.
 
  The GVP manifesto, along with the next list of party candidates, would be released shortly, Monteiro said, adding that, “GVP will also contest from Benaulim, Cuncolim, Velim and Nuvem, besides another one or two seats in North Goa”. 
 
 Firmly ruling out the possibility of the GVP having any alliance with other political parties, Monteiro said, “GVP is not affiliated to BJP anymore and the question of supporting BJP in the assembly elections does not arise, as both GVP MLAs have resigned. The support extended to the BJP government is infractious and now ceases to exist,” Monteiro said.
