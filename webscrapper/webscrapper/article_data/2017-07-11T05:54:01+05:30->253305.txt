Kolkata: There are reasons to worry why   is suffering communal   when the state has a legacy of Hindus and Muslims living peacefully together, Nobel laureate   has said.

 “Why is it happening? Is it because someone is inciting it? We are all worried. How much is political mischief to be blamed for this? We have to ponder over these. There is a reason to worry over this,” Sen told reporters here on Monday. 
 
 Sen was also not willing to endorse cries of ‘helplessness’. “Being helpless is an excuse. If we are failing to achieve something, it is because we are not trying. It is not because we cannot try,” the economist said. He held that there was need to find out to what extent political misdeeds were responsible for communal flare-ups. 
 
 “Bengal has a rich legacy of Hindu and Muslims staying together … and for a long time this co-existence was possible without any communalism, and suddenly this returns. In this context, why suddenly problems are erupting needs to be understood,” he said. “Hotash hoye chere dewa ta theek hobe na (One shouldn’t give up in frustration). We have to take measures to get rid of these things,” he said. 
 
 While saying so, the Nobel laureate didn’t lose sight of the Bengal riots during Partition. “We know that democracy doesn’t guarantee that it will go on without any problems. There were riots in Bengal before. We have seen terrible times when newspapers were completely communal. That is not the case now,” he said later at a question-answer session at Nandan 3 following the screening of Suman Ghosh’s documentary ‘An Argumentative Indian’. 
 
 Sen’s comments without naming any political party come at a time when the ruling   is locked in a fierce war of words with the BJP over communal flare-ups that has even pitched   and Nabanna, the state secretariat, against each other.
