The glimpses we are offered of upcoming Mammootty-starrer   hint that it is set against the backdrop of a vintage-style revolution. 

 The film’s musical team features an impressive line-up of time-tested talents. But how do they fare on this rarely-explored musical turf in the current times? We listen in.
 
  The first song Chuvanna Pulari, a modern take on the age-old KPAC songs on the need to raise voices, has an uplifting effect on the listener. Composer Sharreth has given the track an acapella treatment and Vijay Yesudas’ spirited voice adds to its charm.
 Shaktishree Gopalan and   sing together the next song Ilakalai Pookkalai, composed by Elvyn Joshua. A romantic ditty, Shaktishree’s voice in it is as soothing as the murmur of a flowing stream and Vijay’s rendition only adds to the romantic sparkle. That slight jump in the instrumentation of the song, in the second stanza, is particularly good. 
 
 Sharreth composes and sings the next song Theyyaram Thaalam, which has an age-old harvest festival ambience. The singing has a contemporary tinge at a few places and it’s one of those songs that’s enjoyed best with a spirited visual. 
 
 In his signature style, Aristo Suresh renders Parole Kaalam and he effortlessly brings a playful mood to the composition. While it’s highly unique, it does balance the right amount of police station fun and storytelling, within its ambit. 
 
 The Arabic song Iyaa Kanaubudu composed by Sharreth and sung by Jithin is the final song listed in the album. With dollops of rueful lines, it’s a track you might silently listen to at moments of solitude and otherwise, it’s just a quality one-time listen, unless you are a diehard fan of Middle Eastern tunes.
