 “All the state governments have been asked to create additional posts of women constables and subinspectors by converting the vacant posts of male constables. The states have been advised to increase the tally of women personnel up to 33% of the total strength,'' minister of state (home) Hansraj Ahir informed the Lok Sabha on Tuesday .
 
 Ahir said all state governments have been directed to emulate Haryana's system of Mahila Police Volunteers (MPV), where personnel act as a link between law-enforcement officials and the community to help women in distress.
 
 However, while the home department led by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is yet to set up an all-women police station, the records compiled by the Bureau of Police Research and Development, show that Maharashtra has the maximum number of female police personnel.
 
 Out of 1.22 lakh woman police personnel in the country , 21,249 are in Maharashtra, followed by 14,280 in Tamil Nadu, 7,589 in Uttar Pradesh, 7,004 in Delhi and 6,710 in Bihar.
 
 Ahir said that the actual strength of women police personnel is 7.1% across India, while the percentage of women personnel in the Central Armed Police Forces is 2.36%.
 
 So far as Maharashtra is concerned, one woman has been bestowed the rank of director general, two are ad ditional DGP, one inspector general, 31 assistant inspector general, 40 police superintendent or additional superintendent, 220 inspectors, 1,060 sub-inspectors, 271 assistant sub-inspectors, 1,197 head constables and 18,424 constables. There are DGP-rank women officials in just about seven states.
 
 “A few years ago, a proposal for an all-women police station was moved by the commissioner, but it was never implemented. Instead, now we have quite a large number of women personnel in each police station," said a senior police officer.
