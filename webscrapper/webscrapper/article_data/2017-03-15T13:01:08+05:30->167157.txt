 and Shivaay continue to tease each other by throwing water and playing the 'aww' game. Elsewhere, when Priyanka meets Ranveer, she thanks him for saving her family's grace. 
 
 Ranveer then reveals his true colours to Priyanka by telling her that he is doing all this to take revenge from her. He further adds that he wanted to gain Shivaay's trust and hence, he stood by her. Just then, Ranveer spots Shivaay again and begins his pretence of looking after Priyanka.
  
 With Ranveer's act, Shivaay feels convinced that he will take care of Priyanka. He tells this to Rudra and the two get emotional about Priyanka's leaving the house after marriage. 
 
  
 Talking about marriage, Rudra gets emotional thinking about Soumya, who left him and his house. He leaves. Anika enters and tells Shivaay that she feels Rudra and Soumya should give their marriage another try. 
  
 Meanwhile, Pinky calls kinnar women from Haridwar to stay at their place. When they come, Tej gets upset. They predict about all the events that are going to happen in the coming days, including the fact that Shivaay is going to be in a big trouble.
