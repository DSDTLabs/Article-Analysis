VADODARA: The   ( ) will discuss the issue of the land reserved for the M S University ( ) in its general board meeting later this month. 

 The MSU may not be able to acquire the land as its original owners have sought that the designation of the land to the university should be lapsed. 
 
 The 14.64 hectares of land at Nagarwada behind the posh VIP Road was designated to the university in the year 1986. 
 
 After a couple of owners moved the Gujarat high court (HC), it had in 2015 given December 2016 as deadline to the university to acquire the land or surrender it.
 
 VUDA officials said that since the university could not abide by the high court’s directions, the owners also filed a contempt petition in the HC. 
 
 VUDA also sent a missive to the university asking it to clarify its position failing to which the land will be demarked. The university had recently written to VUDA on the   seeking time. MSU is also approaching the state government to seek funds for acquiring the land. VUDA officials, however, said that they were in a little position to help the university as they will have to abide by the HC orders.
 
 “The HC gave the university one year to acquire the land, but no action was taken by the university. It has swung into action only recently. The issue has been put on the agenda of the VUDA general board that will meet on March 30,” said a senior VUDA official. 
 
 The university fears that if the Nagarwada land slips out of its hand, it may also stand to lose another parcel of land 20 hectares land which has been earmarked by VUDA on the prime Rajmahal Road. MSU has formed a committee to look into the issue of these two parcels as well as others in the city.
