PANAJI: Five   didn’t get respite within four months last year despite the   at Goa directing the electricity department and the   (GPSC) to initiate regular promotions to the posts of executive engineer.

 The high court on August 4, 2016, had directed the government authorities to proceed with the process that has been initiated for regular promotions to the posts of executive engineer before December 31, 2016.
 
 The assistant engineers knocked the doors of the high court in 2015 challenging the process of appointment of executive engineers on ‘officiating’ basis as a stop-gap arrangement in super-session of the  , sidetracking their eligibility.
 
 Five assistant executive engineers were given appointment orders in July and August 2014. One refused to accept the order while another has retired. Three of them continue to enjoy all the powers of executive engineers and have been continuing as executive engineers on officiating basis for the past two and a half years as their seniors continue to hold the posts of assistant executive engineers awaiting for their promotions.
 
 In January this year, the advocate representing the five engineers issued a notice to the department over failure to issue orders for regular promotion despite directions from the high court. The notice stated that the department has willfully disobeyed the HC’s order and called upon it to take appropriate action in compliance with the order, failing which they will be constrained to initiate contempt proceedings.
 
 A senior official in the department told STOI that vigilance clearance had expired and this caused the delay. “The department has received fresh vigilance certificates now and has referred the matter to Goa Public Service Commission (GPSC) for conducting departmental promotion committee (DPC).”
