Chennai: Birders, ornithologists and avian lovers – get ready this Sunday with a pen and paper and jot down the birds in your neighbourhood as the Madras Naturalists’ Society (MNS) is organising the 11th edition of the Chennai   this weekend.

 The bird race is a dawn-to-dusk event, said MNS president K V Sudhakar. Online registration can be done with MNS website on: http://blackbuck.org.in
 
 A large number of experienced as well amateur and budding birdwatchers will spend a whole day spotting and identifying birds in an attempt to record as many species of birds as possible.
 
 A four-member team will fan out and visit various birding spots in Chennai. Each team will consist of one expert and three novices, so that the tyros get a chance to learn the finer points of birdwatching from experts.
 
 V Santharam, director, Institute of Bird Studies, Rishi Valley, and Sudhakar are the coordinators for the race. The event has been attracting a number of participants since the first edition, they said.
 
 The MNS would like to invite people to use this occasion to learn more about birds and to develop a new hobby. All you need to have is enthusiasm and perhaps a pair of binoculars, Santharam said.
 
 The Chennai Bird Race has eschewed competition. It wants participants to study birdwatching for the pleasure of it as also to sensitise them to the environment around themselves. No prizes will be given, but at the end of the day the participants can meet and discuss the ‘finds’ of the day and regale each other with the encounters and experience they had. Participants are encouraged to become ‘green birders’, that is, practise eco-friendly ways of birding, using public transport, cycling or walking to take up this hobby, they added.
