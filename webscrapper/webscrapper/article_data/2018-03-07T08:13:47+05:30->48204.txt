KOLKATA:   (ER) officials on Tuesday said that no further capacity augmentation in the   division is possible and people will have to start looking for other modes of transport to reach the Kolkata from the suburbs.

 “We can’t introduce any more trains in the Sealdah division. Neither is any capacity augmentation possible. One of the major reasons for this is encroachments along the tracks. Once capacity is reached, people will have to opt for other modes of transport,” ER GM   said.
 
 
  
 
 Many officers questioned what capacity means in Sealdah’s suburban section that carries around 10 lakh commuters daily and nearly all trains are bursting at the seams. While encroachment may be a hindrance to capacity augmentation, the officers are dismayed at ER’s decision to scrap plans for a rail flyover that could make suburban travel in the division more comfortable for commuters. Interestingly, Rs 20 crore was sanctioned for the flyover in 2018-19.
 
 “The flyover will be very expensive and not too beneficial for us. We’ve studied the project and decided not to go ahead with the construction. The gradient of the flyover will also be very steep if it is built and the Commissioner of Railway Safety will never clear it,” Rao said.
 
 Some officers don’t agree with this though. The flyover was planned to reduce congestion beyond Dum Dum Cantonment where suburban trains get bunched up to allow others to cross. The flyover would divert trains along different sections, thereby reducing this congestion and discomfort for commuters. They believe the flyover is possible but the cost could be a constraint. The sanctioned cost for this project is Rs 136.46 crore.
 
 “While the Mumbai and Bengaluru suburban rail links received special attention during this year’s rail budget, there was no mention of Kolkata. The city also didn’t get any plans unlike the   for development of its transportation network,” an official said.
