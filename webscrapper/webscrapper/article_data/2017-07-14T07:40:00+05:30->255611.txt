GURUGRAM: Panic gripped residents of   and   in   after few   went   from the villages on Wednesday. Residents suspect the presence of leopard in the area and have raised concerns over no tracking of movement of big cats during the monsoon, as the wildlife department have uninstalled all camera traps.

 “There have been two instances wherein pets went missing overnight. It happened last time, just before a leopard attack on November 24, 2016. We are extremely worried about our safety,” Sumit, a local resident, said on Thursday.
 
 “Even the wildlife department team is present in the village, we have formed groups of villagers who would guard the area at night. Not just our village, neighbouring villages are also doing so as someone or the other have reported leopard sighting in the last two days,” said Kanishk, another resident.
 
 The wildlife department, on the other hand, said that no complaint has been registered with them. “It seems to be only fear among villagers. No leopard sightings have been reported to us. We have a guard in Kherki Lala village and no pugmarks have been spotted in the area. Many a time, villagers mistake civet cat or hyena for a leopard, especially at night,” said a wildlife inspector, on condition of anonymity. 
 
 Some alleged that there has been no tracking of leopard movement during monsoon in the area, as the authorities have uninstalled all camera traps. “All the camera traps have been removed. That makes us more worried as the department will not be able to track leopard movement in the area. We are extremely worried about our security,” said a villager from Harchandpur.
 
 When contacted, MD Sinha, conservator of forests (  Circle), said, “Camera traps are always removed during monsoon. Also, the leopard sightings are least reported during rains as water is easily available in the forest. However, a proposal is under submission with the government to again install the camera traps.”
