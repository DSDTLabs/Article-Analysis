NEW DELHI: The   ( ) will hold its elections on June 30. The embattled association has been working under the supervision of Delhi High Court-appointed former judges for the last two-and-a-half years.

 
 In a first, one candidate is allowed to contest for one post only, a directive clearly laid out in the nomination form guidelines. The Supreme Court appointed Justice   had stressed on the one-person-one-post clause in their recommendations to avoid conflict-of-interest issues.
 
 Two new posts have been created in the executive committee, one for a woman member (director) and one for a cricketer who has played first-class cricket. Incidentally, Indra Nooyi was appointed as the first independent woman director at   three months ago. The   (MCA) had also brought in a woman treasurer.
 
 “The initiatives taken by Justice Sen are in the interest of the game. It’s good to have stronger representation of women in the association,” BCCI’s acting president CK Khanna said.
 
 The elections will take place as per Lodha committee recommendations and will be conducted by  , the current administrator at DDCA, during the association’s executive-committee meeting. DDCA has had no member in charge of operations since ex-president SP Bansal was charged with embezzlement of funds.
 
 Given DDCA’s notorious proxy system, more emphasis has been placed on transparency in the voting process. The guidelines clearly state, “Candidates will not use vehicles to bring members to the voting venue on the date of polling.”
