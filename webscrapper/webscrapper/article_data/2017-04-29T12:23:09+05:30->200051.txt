MOHALI: The cattle pound in   is a picture of misery .Overcrowded and badly-maintained, the shelter, in the city's Phase-3 industrial area, is in a pitiable condition. The pound's permissible strength is 550 animals, but it currently houses 760 cattle with no space to rest.
When TOI visited the pound on Friday , four stray cattle, who were under treatment, were left in the open. One cow, quite immobile, was lying on the floor, out in the Sun.
 
 But even inside, it's not that different. At several places, the roof is missing, and thus the cattle have to bear the full brunt of the summer Sun.
 
 Attendants at the pound told TOI that it's not unusual that cattle, who are brought to the pound in bad health, die under treatment while there. Meanwhile, deputy mayor Manjit Singh   has alleged that the Mohali municipal corporation doesn't maintain records of fodder donated and milk generated at the pound. He further alleged that milk-able cattle are sold instead of being nurtured at the pound. “The pound is marred by scams,“ Sethi said.“I have written to the   several times about these malpractices, but no action has been taken so far.“
 
 Sanjay Gupta, a former ca retaker of the pound, made a similar allegation. “The contractor has been selling stray cattle at the behest of senior MC officials,“ he said. “A thorough inquiry into the matter must be conducted.“
