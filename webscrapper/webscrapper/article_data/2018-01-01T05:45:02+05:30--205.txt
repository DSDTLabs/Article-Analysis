KERI:   is set to resume work on the Kattika nullah dam in Virdi of Dodamarg taluka in January 2018 to divert water from river Mhadei, sources said. The development comes even as the issue of sharing the river’s water remains pending before the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal.

 “Recently, officials of water resources department had visited the site and informed us that they will resume the work from January 2018,” said employees of Hubli-based V I Shetty Construction, the contractor for the dam.
 
 Construction work on the dam had commenced in 2006. However, it came to a halt following a visit from a team of officials from the tribunal.
 
 
  
 
 Local MLA   was initially opposed to the damming and diversion of Haltara project in Karnataka. However, after becoming a minister in the   government, he attempted to secure funds for completing the long-pending work of building the dam across Kattika nalla, a tributary of Valvonti, joining it in Virdi.
 
 Through the construction of the Kattika nullah dam, which measures 736 m in length and 48.375m in height, Maharashtra wants to create live storage of 14.138mcm of water.
 
 In 2006, the proposal of dam at Pavalachi kond which was just 500m away from Goa's border was agreed to in principle by the chief minister on the condition that the water was to be utilized in the Mhadei basin and efforts should be made to raise the height of the dam and divert additional water to the Anjunem dam.
 
 Without informing Goa, Maharashtra changed the location of dam and unilaterally began work on the Kattika nalla dam.
