The tribunal observed that it had ordered a ban on felling of trees but despite that, the officer wrote letters to the developer for carrying out developmental activity.
 
 When contacted, CCF (hills) Kumar said, “I had issued letters as per the Punjab and Haryana high court orders and did not allow anyone to go for development against the norms after the PLPA notification came to an end. I did not give NOC to anyone. I have not received the   yet, and I will file a reply once I get it.”
