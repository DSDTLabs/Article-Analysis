Hyderabad: Hard selling Andhra Pradesh at the ‘Sunrise Andhra Pradesh’ investment summit, Union railway minister Suresh Prabhu said on Friday that one of the major reasons investors must pump in capital into AP is because of its strategic geographical location.

 “AP is the gateway to the east. Asia is going to grow at a rapid pace but the regions that are expected to see maximum growth in Asia are South Asia, East Asia and Southeast Asia. Just imagine the strategic location of AP, it is located right at the hub of the growth engine of the world. Therefore, investing in AP is not only about investing in the state but also in the region,” Prabhu said.
 
 He pointed out that AP had an advantage as the maritime states are expected to grow at a much faster pace due to the central government’s thrust on port-led development. The state has one major and 14 minor ports dotting its coastline. TNN
