CHANDIGARH: The decision of the   (NHAI) to setup two toll collection points from Zirakpur to Patiala has come under the scanner of Punjab and   high court, which issued notice to the Union government and the   on Wednesday.

 The petitioner has mainly challenged the decision on the grounds that setting up of two toll collection points within 44km was against the NHAIâ€™s own rules. The matter reached before the HC in the wake of public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocate Rajbir Singh.
 
 According to the petitioner, the National Highway (free determination of rates and collection) Rules provides that a toll plaza could not be established within 10km of municipal or local town area limit. It was further informed that   could also not be established on the same section and in the same direction of the national highway within a distance of 60km under the same rules.
 
 Petitioner stated that despite these rules, the NHAI has set up its first toll plaza within 10km of the municipal limits of Zirakpur and second toll plaza within 44km distance, which is completely in contravention of the rules.
 
 Petitioner has sought directions to quash the notification, issued in June 2017, on the grounds that both the two new toll plazas were being constructed within the municipal or the local town area limits of Patiala and Zirakpur. The case would now come up for hearing on May 30.
