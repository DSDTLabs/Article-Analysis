MUMBAI: Although the   chief   and chief minister   claims that they are 'positive' for the alliance to go for February 21, civic poll, Sena leaders at   meeting urged party chief not to go with  , which constantly targeted Sena instead opposition. Sources said that CM Fadnavis and Thackeray will take a final call on Wednesday and planned to meet at a secret venue to keep media away.

 On Tuesday, Thackeray met senior party leaders where leaders urged and strongly opposed to pre-poll tie up with the BJP. "They (BJP) cannot take us for granted. We cant tolerate allegations made over 'Matoshree' by the local leaders. Few leaders from the estranged partner (BJP), deliberately made an attempts to spoil the chances of pre-poll alliance to put CM Fadnavis' position at risk," a Sena minister told TOI. The move comes after a BJP MP from eastern suburb constantly attacking Sena and the Thackeray family for alleged corruption in the civic body.
 
 Explaining the politics behind the BJP list of 114 seats, Sena minister said that they deliberately claimed on Sena's 40 sitting corporator seats through the list, which was obviously unacceptable.
 
 Considering cardinal relations between top two leaders it has been decided that even after the official break-up, no Sena leader would attack on Fadnavis, below the belt. "The allegations made against each other in the Kalyan Dombivali civic poll, won't be repeat. Sena as of now, made up mind, going soft on top leadership," minister added.
