 Commenting on NCLAT judgment, Rajesh Tibrewal, spokesperson of Binani Operational Creditors’ Forum (BOCF), said, “The last mile in Binani Cement Insolvency Proceeding has stretched longer than expected because of appeals made by almost all stakeholders in SC, NCLT and NCLAT. We hope the preferred bidder will get finalized in the next CoC meeting and process related to completion of insolvency proceeding becomes faster, going forward.” 
 
 Earlier, the RP had cancelled CoC meeting scheduled on May 10, 2018, in view of objections raised by Rajputana Properties (the subsidiary firm of DCB) related to eligibility of UltraTech Cement under Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, to be a resolution applicant for Binani Cement.
