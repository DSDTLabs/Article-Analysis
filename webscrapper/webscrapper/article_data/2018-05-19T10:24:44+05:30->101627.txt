VARANASI: The district administration on Friday began the work to remove two beams and debris of Chowkaghat-Lehartara flyover from the accident site, but later called it off abruptly to facilitate inspection by a technical team coming from Delhi. The concrete beams of the under-construction flyover, each weighing 55 tonnes, had crashed on May 15 killing 15 people and injuring 11 others. Several vehicles, including a bus, cars and auto-rickshaws were crushed under the beams. 

 Officials said the project's executing agency,  , had engaged workers to break the beam and remove the debris, but the work was soon called off. 
 
 "Though the work was started in the morning, we later called it off as a technical team from Delhi is likely to visit the site for inspection," chief project manager   said. 
 
 Though he did not give any timetable of the visit, he said the work would be restarted after inspection.
 
 The site has already been examined by forensic experts and also by a team set up by chief minister   to look into the case of the accident.
 
 Yogi and his deputy   had visited the site on the night of the mishap itself to take a first-hand account of the situation. Meanwhile, the construction site has been barricaded to restrict vehicular movement. The traffic has been diverted to other route.
