THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Former chief minister and late   leader   might have played a crucial role in sabotaging a   berth in the Chandrasekhar government at the Centre in 1990, said Kerala Congress (M) chairman  . The veteran leader, who is turning 84 on Jan 30, got candid about his political career in an extensive interview with TOI on Thursday .
Mani was invited by Chandrasekhar to be sworn in as minister and travelled to Delhi for that. But something went wrong and Mani didn't feature in the final list. “At that time, our party decided not to join the cabinet“, was Mani's initial response when asked what really transpired. When prodded on the involvement of leaders from Kerala, he said, “Karunakaran might have“.Mani however said he never broached the subject with Karunakaran.
 
 On the current political situation, Mani said there is no reason to change the party's decision to stay equidistant. “We left UDF as there was no unity and mutual trust. Congress was trying to weaken us and thus gain entry to our strongholds in the central Kerala“, he said. On KC (M) joining  , Mani said “they might long for that. I am not committing anything“.
