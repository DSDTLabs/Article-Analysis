HYDERABAD: The   (HGCL), which had taken loans for constructing Outer Ring Road (ORR) and has been paying back instalments, has paid over Rs 15 crore in excess to the concessionaire (contractor) of ORR. The Comptroller and Auditor General ( ) in its report on Thursday said  , a special purpose vehicle floated by   (HMDA) for  , had entered into a concession agreement in August 2007.

 The agreement stipulated semi-annuity payment of Rs 33 crore to the concessionaire for construction, operation and maintenance of expressway. The annuity payment was for a period of 12.5 years from the date of commercial operation date (COD). The agreement also provided bonus for early completion and reduction for delays.
 
 The CAG said the audit scrutiny of HGCL records showed while the scheduled date of completion was noted as June 9, 2010, the actual COD was determined as March 1, 2011. As per agreement, the first semi-annuity payment of Rs 33 crore (due on December 6, 2010) was not due and hence not made. The second semi-annuity payment due on June 5, 2011 amounted to Rs 17.95 crore (being the proportionate payment for 97 days from March 1, 2011 to June 5, 2011). However, full semi-annuity payment of Rs 33 crore was paid (June 2011) to the concessionaire. This resulted in excess payment of Rs 15.35 crore, which had not been adjusted (as of June 2017) from subsequent semiannuity payments made till June 2017.
 
 â€œNon-recovery and adjustment of excess payment for over six years resulted in blocking of company funds. This also entailed loss of interest of over Rs 7 crore (8% as per applicable rate of borrowing of government). When the matter was pointed out in the audit, the firm confirmed in June 2017 that excess payment was made.
 
 CAG also said the HMDA incurred a revenue loss of Rs 21 crore due to non-allotment of 355 shops in five commercial complexes for periods ranging from 5 to 105 months. Besides, rental arrears of Rs 6.16 crore is yet to be collected.
