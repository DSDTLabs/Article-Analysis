In what seems like a first of its kind instance, the chartbuster Sundari from the Chiranjeevi-starrer   No 150, made an appearance on popular   show, Showtime at the Apollo. Yes! And if you thought the Megastar’s dancing in the song was cool, you must see what a Delhi-based dance troupe, Team   did with it on the show, which was aired on March 1. And the five-member troupe left the audience wonderstruck, with what was a breathtaking break dance performance. Gravity defying moves, very neatly executed moonwalks with a twist, and surreal stunts that almost looked as if the dancers are levitating, won the group wolf whistles and cheers throughout their set. At the end, when they took a bow with a namaste, the impressed American audience gave the troupe a standing ovation. 

 A video clip of the show hosted by popular comedian, actor and author Steve Harvey has gone viral and even found its way to  's timeline, much to the glee of the Mega fans, who’ve been going ga ga over it. “#khaidino150 song on #SteveHarvey show with standing ovation from American audience for their outstanding performance. Too good Megastarchiranjeevi (sic),”   posted on his social media page on Sunday.
