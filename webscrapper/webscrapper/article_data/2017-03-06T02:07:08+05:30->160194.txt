GURUGRAM: Inspector  , who was found dead in the Sadar police station retiring room on Saturday, was cremated on Sunday. But the mystery surrounding his death haunts his colleagues and the department.

 Fellow cops ruled out the possibility that Kishore committed suicide due to work pressure. Kishore, who had joined the Sadar station five months ago after being promoted, was deputising in place of SHO Vijay Kumar, who is on leave. “Kishore was found dead at around 1.15pm on Saturday, minutes after he had gone there “to take rest”, cops said. 
 
 ACP Anil Yadav, who was visiting the police station around the time, had asked for a glass of water for which two junior officers had gone to the retiring room and found Kishore lying in a pool of blood.
 
 Yadav said it can’t be conclusively said if it was a case of suicide or accident. The forensics team has taken CCTV camera footage and Yadav’s phone for further investigation.
 
 When asked if cops have questioned anyone, Yadav said, “It’s not the right time. They’re shocked and sad.” He added that a CCTV camera captured Kishore entering the retiring room, but what transpired inside is not known.
 
 He, however, said it was difficult to imagine the possibility of suicide. “Kishore was under no additional pressure. He was just looking after the station in the absence of SHO Vijay Kumar, and it wasn’t a lot of responsibility for an officer like Kishore,” Yadav said.
 
 Yadav added the expectation regarding suicide is that a person shoots himself in the head. But Kishore had a bullet injury on his chest. This has opened up a new angle to the probe.
 
 A retired Indian Air Force officer, Kishore joined Haryana Police in 2008 as a sub-inspector. He was a native of Narnaul district and is survived by his wife and two sons.
