Chandigarh: It was a time of agony and ecstasy for thousands of people scrambling to get their children enrolled in the four coveted  . 

 St John's High School (all boys), Carmel Convent School (all girls), Sacred Heart School (all girls) and St Anne's Convent School (co-ed) opened only 341 out of 640 seats for draw of lots in the general category, even though they received thousands of forms. 
 
 In St John's High School, nearly 521 applications were received for 160 seats in Upper Kindergarten. But only 94 were left open for draw of lots. In Sacred Heart School, nearly 981 forms were received against 160 seats but only 97 were open to the general public. In Carmel, around 820 forms were received against 120 seats and only 50 were offered to the general category and in St Anne's, 2,196 forms were received for 200 seats out of which 100 (40 to boys and 60 to girls), were open for draw of lots.

 --- Their magical moment
 
 Niharika Sharma, a parent whose child made it to Sacred Heart Convent School was so happy that she could not hold back her tears. "It is a magical moment. I got my daughter after 11 years of marriage, so she is very special to me. Besides, Sacred Heart was my dream school and she made it here."
 
 Another parent, Rashim could not believe that the chit she took out from hundreds of others mentioned the registration number of her daughter. "It feels like a dream, she said. Her daughter is also a student of Sacred Heart Convent school. 
 
 "I can't express what it feels like. I am relieved for next 12 years," said Sonia Dang, a parent whose son got enrolled in St John's.
 
 "My daughter is in the school next door so I wanted my son to get admitted in St only and he made it. Feels like a dream come true," said Seema Mann, a parent.
 
 Ashwani Gupta, a parent whose child got a seat St Anne's was extremely happy, particularly as his son had not made it to St Kabir's in Tuesday's draw. "Yesterday my son's name was not announced the Kabir's list. So we were worried but now all the tension has gone as my child's future is secure," Gupta said.
