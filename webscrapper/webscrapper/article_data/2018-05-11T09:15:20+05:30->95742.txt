CHANDIGARH: To improve the quality of roads without increasing the height, the Chandigarh administration has roped in Central Road Research Institute ( ). 

 Over the years, roads have exhausted 12-inch height of plinth due to re-carpeting. As a result, rainwater floods residential areas. Besides, a large number of manholes have been covered due to re-carpeting without removal of existing layers, which further adds to the waterlogging woes. The administration has asked CRRI to suggest ways of re-carpeting without compromising on the quality. 
 
 The roads in the city have been classified into seven categories, called 7 Vs. V1 (fast roads connecting Chandigarh to other towns), V2 (arterial roads), V3 (fast vehicular sector dividing roads), V4 (meandering shopping streets), V5 (sector circulation roads), V6 (access roads to houses) and V7 (footpaths and cycle tracks). There are a total of 56 sectors in Chandigarh that have further been divided into four parts — A, B, C and D — by V4 roads.
 
 A team of the institute on Thursday carried out an inspection at   and collected samples from various spots.  , who was heading the inspection team, said they would help the administration improve quality without raising the level.
 
 The experts will focus on recycling bitumen instead of adding layers. Murthy said the collected samples would be tested in a laboratory and based on the report, they would prepare a design capable of taking vehicular load. The team will submit a detailed report to the administration.
 
 Talking to the TOI,   chief engineer   said the problem of increased level has led to flooding. “We will implement the CRRI suggestions,” he added.
