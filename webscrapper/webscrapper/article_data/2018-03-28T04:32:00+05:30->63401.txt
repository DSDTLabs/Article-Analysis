Ahmedabad: As the maximum temperature crossed the 40 degree celsius mark on Tuesday in the city, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) is gearing up to implement Heat Action Plan (HAP). Health department officials of the civic body confirmed that the preparation is underway and with effect from next week, HAP will be fully implemented. There have been no new initiatives as yet, and the modules and measures under HAP 2017 will be effectively implemented, confirmed civic authorities.

 Sharing more details, Bhavin Solanki, medical officer of health, AMC, said, “Urban Health Centres (UHCs), civic body-run as well as private hospitals and clinics have already been prepped up to cater to heat-related emergencies. Doctors, paramedical staff and medical officers will be trained for prompt treatment to patients of acute heat-related emergencies. That apart, every hospital and UHCs will be reporting the cases of heat-related illnesses and emergencies to the civic body’s health department.”
 
 “We’re also in talks with several non-government organizations and private firms to support the initiative of setting up water booths across the city to give clean and fresh drinking water to denizens amid the sizzling heat,” he added.
 
 As part of HAP, warning signals on heat wave-like conditions will be issued in advance along with an advisory for necessary precautions and outreach programmes to be undertaken by civic authorities.
