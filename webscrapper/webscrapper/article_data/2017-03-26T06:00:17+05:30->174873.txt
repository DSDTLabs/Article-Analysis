Vadodara: The   police conducted investigations at least two places since Friday evening and recorded the statements of several persons in connection with the leakage of the English question paper of the class X board exams on Friday morning. Officials claimed that they were close to reaching the source of leak that is likely to be outside the district.

 The searches have largely been taking place outside the district indicating that while the incident had come to light in   in Mahisagar distrct, the source of the leakage may be outside. According to sources, the police had conducted investigations at a school in Vanakbori in Kheda district on Friday evening. Investigations continued here till past midnight. School authorities, however, claimed that the school was not a centre for examinations and none of its staffers were involved in the exam process elsewhere too.
 
 Sources said that a team from Mahisagar police also visited a village located near   in   district on Saturday looking for a man. “But the man had absconded and could not be reached,” said a police source. Sources added that teams had visited more locations to gather evidence and record statements.
 
 Mahisagar assistant superintendent of police  , who is supervising the probe said that the police had some concrete leads and was working on them. “We are backtracking the images of the question paper to identify their source. We should have some developments in the case soon,” he said.
 
 Sources said that prima facie it seemed that the leak had taken place outside the Mahisagar district. But the offence was registered at Mahisagar as the district education officer there was informed about the leak and provided evidence regarding it.
