HYDERABAD: Residents of MIG colony located at   accused a contractor of collecting money for laying sewage lines in the area. They said the contractor, who has been awarded the work of laying sewage lines, has instructed the labourers to collect money from the residents. Pointing towards the labourers asking for money from residents, they said if all the 2,472 houses pay the amount, then it will be a scam of 2 crore.

 "The labourers laying the sewage lines are demanding 4,000-5,000 from each house. The government should take some action," said  , a resident of MIG colony.
 
 According to   officials, the residents should pay charges to the   and linking of pipelines from their home to the main sewage line is the responsibility of the resident itself. According to the norms, if a water pipeline or a sewage pipeline has to be laid, the contractor is responsible, but the connection from a household to the newly laid pipeline is the responsibility of the resident.
 
 However, the residents said that the existing pipeline are being replaced with pipes of larger capacity and hence the households should not be asked to pay additional charges. "Why are the workers asking for money when the pipes from our households are already connected to the line? The government should fund the work or fix a standard amount and provide us a receipt for the money we paid," said another resident.
 
 In some areas, when a new water or sewage line is being laid, the residents pay money to the contractor and ask him to connect the pipeline from their house to the main line. But in this case, the residents said that the existing pipes are being replaced, so they are not bound to pay to the contractor.
