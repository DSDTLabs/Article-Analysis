VADODARA: Rumours on   regarding meter reading done by power distribution companies have forced the   ( ) to clarify its stand. 

 Since quite some time, messages are being forwarded on social media groups including WhatsApp claiming that if the power distribution companies carry out meter reading after 30 days, the electricity consumption charges gets doubled and tripled. Such messages further claim that the power distribution companies should be forced to give bills within 30 days and consumers should not let the electricity distribution companies employee carryout meter reading after 30 days.
 
 GUVNL on Wednesday termed such messages “totally misleading, baseless and far from the facts.” 
 
 “It is to be noted that all four electricity distribution companies of GUVNL charge tariff as fixed by the   (GERC) for different categories of consumers for monthly consumption,” a release issued by GUVNL stated, adding that for the residential consumers, billing is done for two months’ consumption owing to administrative reasons.
 
 “The computer programme is made accordingly that it calculates two-month charges as per the slab fixed for monthly electricity consumption. For instance, the monthly energy charge for residential consumer consuming 0 – 50 units is 305 paise per unit which in two-month bill considers slab of 0-100 unit,” GUVNL explained.
 
 GUVNL officials said that the programme itself takes care that consumers are not required to pay any extra tariff or any other charges. 
 
 “There is no base in messages that consumers are charged two times or three times if billing is carried out after 30 days,” said an official.
