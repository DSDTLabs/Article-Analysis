SHILLONG: Meghalaya is waiting with baited breath as the results of the February 27 assembly elections will be declared on Saturday. While leaders of the ruling Congress are hopeful of a victory, there is uncertainty in the air as the party is facing anti-incumbency. The party is also nervous after the exit polls predicted a hung assembly with BJP and   ( ) faring well. 

 An aspiring BJP and an energetic NPP have this time provided a viable alternative to people even as the issue of religion was raked up by Congress. Leaders of the Grand Old Party are also aware of the fact that the party had failed to cobble up a majority in Manipur and Goa last year even after emerging the single-largest party as BJP played spoilsport at the last moment. 
 
 "The political equation in Meghalaya is different and people here cannot be taken for a ride," says a senior Congress functionary. On the other hand, NPP leader   said people voted for a 'better Meghalaya' this time. The regional parties, prominent among which are   and Hill State People's Democratic Party, are also poised to play a significant role in the post-poll scenario.
