BHUBANESWAR: The   has proved to be a big stumbling block for those aspiring for   and wishing to work for the development of their areas. 

 Sanjukta Parida, 40, who was elected ward member from   on the outskirts of the city, will not be able to contest this time despite her good work and public support. She has three children. 
 
 "People in my village knew about it when I contested for the post of ward member. They supported me and also wanted me to contest this year. But I cannot violate the law and if someone lodges a complaint I have to step down and it would be very humiliating. I want to work for the development of my area and people but it is not easy without joining," she said. 
 
 The norm has evoked protests. "This is unfair and we have strongly protested against it several times but in vain. If the rule is not applicable for MPs and MLAs then why us? We have been victimised. Giving 50% reservation to women at the same time enforcing two-child norm is self-contradictory," said Archana Sahu, a former ward member of Balianta gram panchayat. 
 
 There are several instances of aspiring politicians giving their third child for adoption to their relatives or not disclosing his/her birth. Many elected PRI members have stepped down from their posts for violating the norm. 
 
 PRI members from across the state have written several times to the state government requesting it to repel or amend the rules, which has been causing more harm to the society than solving the purpose of population control. 
 
 "The rule is violation of article 21 of the constitution and also has many adverse effects on the society. This has led to increase in   cases. It has also increased violence against women as husbands demand at least one of the first two children be a son," said  , another PRI member. The norm was introduced in 11 states in 2013 but eventually states like  ,   and Chhattisgarh repealed the laws while Uttarakhand and Bihar implemented it in urban polls only.
