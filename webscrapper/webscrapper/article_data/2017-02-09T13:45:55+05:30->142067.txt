CHENNAI:   on Wednesday seized from a school in Adyar several   and mammals, including a grizzled giant squirrel and Alexandrine parakeets. 

 Based on specific information that the school was keeping the mammals and birds, covered under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, the officials raided the premises in Gandhi Nagar and took into custody a Malabar giant squirrel, a grizzled giant squirrel, four Alexandrine parakeets, one rose-ringed parakeet, four plum-headed parakeets and muniyas. They were later taken to the wildlife headquarters range office in Velacherry.
 
 Hariprasad, the school's cricket coach, said the squirrels had been gifted about two years ago when they were very young. "When cyclone Vardah hit Chennai, they escaped from the enclosure, but returned the next day. The cyclone damaged the roof which was later replaced," he said.
 
 Animal welfare activist Antony Rubin said it was not correct on the part of the school management to keep the endangered wildlife. Under the act concerned, first time offenders can face a fine of up to 25,000 with imprisonment, while habitual offenders can be fined up to 7 lakh and imprisoned for three years, he said. 
 
 Wildlife (Headquarters) Range officer Murugesan said many institutions and people, without realising the consequences, buy such animals and birds either to exhibit them or to rear them as pets. Such an attempt can have dangerous consequences and those having such animals and birds as pets should hand them over to the wildlife officials. They can call 044-22200335 for clarification, he added.
