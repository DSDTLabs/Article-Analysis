GUWAHATI: Four more districts of the state will be covered by the Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine campaign for adults (15-65 years) from the second week of February. The four districts - Morigaon, Nalbari, Bongaigaon and Cachar - are vulnerable to JE. 

 With this, a total of 18 districts in the state will be covered under the programme.
 
 "The vaccination drive will be based on case load. This means that the focus will be on areas that have reported the maximum number of JE and   (AES) cases. In Assam, adults, not kids, have been facing the brunt of the disease," a   official told TOI on Sunday. 
 
 Globally,   more often than those of adults.
 
 In 2014, Assam became the first state in the country to administer the JE vaccine to adults. Since then, Lakhimpur, Dibrugarh, Sivasagar, Tinsukia, Jorhat, Dhemaji, Golaghat, Kamrup, Nagaon, Sonitpur, Darrang, among others, have been covered.
 
 "Cases of JE commonly occur among children. The shift from children to adults being affected was noticed only in the last few years," said a JE expert.
 
 Till December 31, 2016, the state witnessed 92 JE deaths. It recorded the maximum number of deaths as compared to other endemic states like Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal which saw 42, 73 and 30 deaths, respectively. In the same period, Assam also reported 427 JE and 1,713 AES cases.
