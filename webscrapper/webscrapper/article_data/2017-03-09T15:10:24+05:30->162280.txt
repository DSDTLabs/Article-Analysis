Filmmaker   and actress   Kusruti’s first collaboration ended up with the much-talked-about short Memories of a Machine. Now, the duo is teaming up for a full length as-yet-untitled feature, which will mark Kani’s debut in   films too. 

 They recently released a first-look poster, which looked quite interesting and got people talking about the same. About the script,   says, “I’ve been working on this for five years. There has been a lot of research and layering that has gone into it. A large part of the film deals with animal behaviour and genetics. Like Memories of a Machine, it will be shot in guerilla technique. The film will be shot 90% in Bengaluru and also in Hampi. In fact, we have a character who is introduced from Hampi in the film, which will make us relook at our perceptions towards external beauty and gender roles.”
 
 The team plans on releasing a trailer by around early April, which will give viewers a clearer idea about this experimental film. “This film has a lot of people who have been a part of Memories of a Machine. B Suresha sir has been a constant moral support and has looked at my script. Another source of encouragement and support has been in the form of BM Giriraj sir. I’ve been working closely with Dr  , who has extensively researched on animal behaviour and has supported with inputs for my script,” adds Shailaja.
