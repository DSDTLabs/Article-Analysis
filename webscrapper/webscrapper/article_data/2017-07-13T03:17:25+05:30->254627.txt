Mumbai: A  , Sandeep Yeole, on Wednesday said   had offered him Rs 11 crore to keep silent on alleged   in the developer’s project at   in Parksite  . Yeole, who was addressing a press conference, said he did a sting operation on the   and had “proof” to book the builder.

 A spokesperson for Omkar Realtor said Rs 40 lakh was paid to Yeole as advance rentals for 88 slum tenants to be rehabilitated by the developer. Omkar is undertaking a slum rehabilitation scheme and the money was meant for the rent for their alternative accommodation.
 
 At the press meet, Yeole displayed the Rs 40 lakh he allegedly received from the builder, saying he had been given Rs 1 crore and had spent the remaining Rs 60 lakh on the project. Yeole said he would donate the Rs 40 lakh to the CM’s relief fund.
 
 “The builder said I should keep my mouth shut by accepting my share of money, Rs 11 crore,” he said. “Kaushik More, MD of Omkar, has told us that he will take care of others. We have everything recorded.”
 
 Yeole said there were 2,500 slums in Hanuman Nagar. “We, through RTI Act, procured documents and found that the builder is not eligible to carry out this project and despite this he is using his muscle and money power to press on slum-dwellers. The builder does not have permissions, 80 % of slum-dwellers have not agreed to  ...,” Yeole said.
 
 The Omkar spokesperson denied the charges and said the social worker was misleading slum-dwellers that they could themselves take up the project. “The defamatory attempt by Yeole to present twisted facts is purely a matter of ulterior motives and his failure to influence the slum community from going in for self-redevelopment,” he said.
