KOLKATA: Capital markets regulator Sebi is assessing the impact of demonetisation on flight of foreign funds from the country during the October-December quarter.
 
  Sebi chairman   on Tuesday said that net outflows aggregating $11 billion by foreign portfolio investment ( ) during last quarter was being analysed to assess the extent of impact ‘demonetisation’ has had on this.
  
  “We will take three to four months time (to come to a conclusion),” Sinha said while addressing a seminar on ‘Developing the   — Sebi’s Role, Issues and Challenges’ in Kolkata organised by the   (BCC).
  
  He added that there were a few other global developments, including the US presidential election results and a hike in   reserve rates, which coincided with India’s decision to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes.
  
  Quoting data from the   (IMF), Sinha said demonetisation is likely to have a short-term effect on the economy. “Although the international organisation has scaled down its growth projection by 100 basis points to 6.6% for the current fiscal, growth for 2017 is pegged at 7.2% and the projection for the year is intact at 7.7%. If these projections are anything to go by, the country will see GDP growing steadily. Hence, the impact of demonetisation will be short term and mitigated by the next two-three quarters,” he added.
  
  Demonetisation, from the academic point of view, would lead to more money coming into the formal system. This would be good for the economy. And IMF’s projections show just that, he pointed out.
  
  Sinha also said the country’s capital market is now more resilient “with our dependence on foreign flows getting lower compared to few years back”.
  
  Despite the outflows, Indian capital market and the rupee remained stable. “Had it been three-to-four years ago, the market and rupee would have been hurt badly,” the Sebi chief said.
