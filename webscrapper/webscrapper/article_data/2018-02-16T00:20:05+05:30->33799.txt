Thiruvananthapuram: Water being an essential service,   ( ) officials often receive criticism over their work and rarely get appreciation.

 However, members of   Residents’ Association have invited officials of KWA to their annual day event on Sunday as a token of appreciation for their efforts to resolve water crisis in the area.
 
 Areas including Ambalamukku and Ambalanagar have been facing acute shortage of water for the past two years. According to Ambalamukku Residents’ Association secretary Mohanan Nair, the area has been receiving insufficient water, mainly during odd hours. “Sometimes we receive water at 2am and it will stop by the morning. It was really tough for us. We ran from pillar to post to get things right,” he said.
 
 On February 11, KWA initiated interconnection works of a 900mm diameter JICA line from Peroorkada to Medical College to ensure enough water for these areas. The JICA line was connected to 400mm premo pipes which supply water to the areas. Ambalamukku, being a high-lying area, has been receiving only a limited amount of water. KWA assistant engineer Joy Jones said that around 300 families in the area were benefitted by the work.
 
 Mohanan Nair said that immediately after KWA charged the line on Monday, all houses in the area received water. “However, it will take some time to normalize the situation as KWA officials are clearing issues of leaks in several lines,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, the water authority is progressing with works to replace premo pipes with mild steel pipe in Ambalamukku-Kesavadasapuram stretch.
 
 The KWA has done similar interconnection works recently at Chalakuzhy too to ensure water supply in areas facing shortage. “In Chalakuzhy, we are facing issues of leakage. Works to solve leakage issues are being taken up now,” said an official.
