GHAZIABAD: Five pollution display   will come up in city soon. The pollution control board has already started the process to issue tender for the same.

 “The five spots selected include Vaishali metro station, Mohan Nagar, Old Bus stand and collecterate. We are contemplating to install the fifth one near the elevated road in Raj Nagar Extension area,” said UPPCB regional officer Ashok Tiwari. “Each panel will cost nearly Rs 6.50 lakh and in one month we hope to complete the tender process while another month will be required for installation,” added Tiwari.
 
 The display panels will be connected to real time online server which is installed at pollution board’s regional office in Vasundhara, and the online   will be fed from there.
 
 However, experts have pointed out that since the display panels will be linked to the only online pollution monitoring system in Vasundhara, it will not reflect the pollution levels in the area where the display panel will be installed. “To get a real sense of pollution level in different parts of the city, it is important that the pollution data is taken from the vicinity where the display panel is installed. However, under the present arrangement, all five display panels will reflect pollution data of Vasundhara only,” said Sushil Raghav, a city-based environmentalist. 
 
 “It is true that all display panels will exhibit pollution data of Vasundhara area only but this is just the start and in days to come four additional online servers will be installed. These display panels will be linked to the closest online server,” said Tiwari.
