CHENNAI: As part of its Farming 3.0 vision of expanding global footprint and introducing cutting edge technology into the farm equipment sector, Mahindra & Mahindra is investing just over $5 million (or Canadian $6.63 million) for a 10% stake in Canadian technology company  .

 
 The investment is an all-cash deal that will allow M&M to use the Canadian company’s technology — a combination of computer vision, machine learning and big data analytics to offer insights into crop health – both in key global markets as well as in India. M&M will acquire around 800,402 Class C preferred shares of   and the deal should be sealed by May

 M&M has been aggressively investing in a series of global companies with an eye to either gain critical products or marketshare or technology. The Resson Aerospace deal is a technology driven investment.
 
 “The deal is in alignment with everything we’ve been saying about advanced technology farming or Farming 3.0 and the Resson Aerospace technology will be useful for us globally,’’ said a senior company source. “We have ambitions not restricted to India.’’ M&M’s Farming 3.0 vision is about the use of digital technology to change the way farming is done. The company has showcased technologies like driverless tractors as part of this larger vision.
 
 In the past couple of years, M&M has invested in a number of global companies. In early 2017, it acquired 75% stake in Turkey-based farm equipment manufacturer Hisarlar Makina Sanayi ve Ticaret Anonim S irketi and followed it up with the acquisition of Turkish tractor maker   later that year. M&M plans to double its global revenue from the farm equipment sector to $5 billion by 2019, targetting that 50% of its total farm equipment sector revenue comes from global markets.
