CHANDIGARH: The Chandigarh district convicted two persons and acquitted one in a case related to abetment to suicide on Friday.

 The court of additional district and sessions judge   awarded three years of imprisonment to deceased’s mother-in-law Leela Devi and sent the husband, Praveen Kumar, to six-year jail. However, the brother-in-law, Parvinder, was acquitted by the court due to lack of evidence. A case was registered against Pinjore residents Leela Devi, Praveen Kumar and   alias Vicky under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the Sector 49 police station. The court imposed a fine of Rs 1.05 lakh on Praveen and that of Rs 55,000 was imposed on Leela Devi.
 
 The matter dates back to 2017 when they all were booked on the complaint of Prem Singh, a resident of Sector 51, Chandigarh. As per the complaint, his daughter Inderjit Kaur was married to Praveen Kumar in 2007. However, due to some matrimonial dispute arising out of harassment by her in-laws and husband, she hadn’t been staying with them for the past four years. She had been staying in her parental house in Sector 51. Prem also alleged that his daughter went into depression due to the behaviour of her husband and in-laws and committed suicide by hanging herself at her home on February 16, 2017.
 
  A case was registered against Leela Devi, Kumar and Parvinder. During investigation, a suicide note was also recovered by the police, wherein Inderjit had held her husband and in-laws responsible for her condition.
 
 However, it was argued by the defence counsel that they all were falsely implicated. It was also argued that she was not staying with them and a false case is imposed on them. After hearing the arguments of both sides, the court convicted both of them.
