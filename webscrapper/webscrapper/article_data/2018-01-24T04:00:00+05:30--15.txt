Surat: Aditya Sonavane, a professional runner and hotelier, is running non-stop with the national flag from Mumbai to Surat with a message of connecting Gujarat and Maharashtra as sister states on Tuesday. 

 Sonavane (26), a resident of Diva in Maharashtra’s Thane district, has been regularly participating in Surat Night Marathon organized by the city-based Destiny Group for the last couple of years. With a view to promote Surat Night Marathon being organized in the city on February 24, Sonawane decided to run nonstop with the tricolour to spread the message of connecting Gujarat and Maharashtra as sister states. 
 
 This is the first non-stop running of Sonavane. He started 274 kilometre-long running from National Park in Borivli East at about 7.30am on Tuesday and intends to reach Surat on the night of January 26. 
 
 Talking to TOI over phone from Palgarh, Sonavane said, “I am on a mission to connect the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra. While Surat is the economic capital of Gujarat, Mumbai is the financial capital of India. Both the states can do wonders not only in the country, but in the world. I started with regular marathons and have run six ultras-more than a 100km each. Earlier, I was running for myself, now I feel like running for a cause.” 
 
 Last year, Sonawane ran an ultrathon from Mumbai to Jaipur covering 1,142km to create awareness about female foeticide. 
 
 Surat Night Marathon promoter Chirag Shah told TOI, “Sonavane discussed with us his mission of connecting Gujarat and Maharashtra through his non-stop running of 274km and we were impressed. He is also promoting our Surat Night Marathon event to be held on February 24.”
