 is here and so is the sunny tan to make us look a shade darker than we already are. While sweating is considered to be really good, none of us likes to see tan lines on our bare skin in summer. And don’t we just love to wear less in the sunny Delhi? Follow this five quick and easy ways to say ‘nay’ to tan.

 
  Take a cup of mashed papaya and add a tablespoon honey. Mix this pack and apply on the tanned zones of your skin. Keep it for half an hour and wash it with plain water.
 
 
 A combination of yogurt and tomato extract can rid you of tanned skin. Mix it up, just a tablespoon of each of these ingredients; smear this paste on the tanned areas. Wash it off after half an hour.
 
 
 This one is really easy. Just place cabbage leaves on the tanned areas for 20 minutes every day until you get rid of tan lines.
