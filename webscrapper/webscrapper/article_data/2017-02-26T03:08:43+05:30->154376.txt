Rajkot/Ahmedabad: Rajkot city police, while investigating a cheating case, unravelled a fake currency racket and arrested two persons on Saturday.

 Nitin Ajani (45), a resident of Shree Ram Park on   in Rajkot, had lodged a complaint of cheating on February 24 against Ketan Dave (30), a resident of Punit Nagar on Gondal Road and Shailesh Patel (40), a resident of Ramnagar on Kothariya Road.
 
 According to Ajani’s complaint, Dave and Shailesh, who run an accounting firm, had transferred Rs 50 lakh through RTGS from his bank account to the account of BK Enterprise a few weeks ago. However, when the accused did not return the amount, Ajani filed a complaint of cheating with the police. Police arrested Dave and Patel and launched a probe. 
 
 During questioning, Dave told police that he had the cash lying at his office in   on Gondal Road. On basis of this information, police searched his office and recovered a packet containing Rs 2,000 currency notes. 
 
 However, on first look, the cops suspected genuineness of the currency notes and sent it to forensic lab for analysis. “The FSL report confirmed that out of 2,864 notes of Rs 2000, 2,858 notes were counterfeit while only six were genuine. The accused had scanned the original note and printed it on high quality paper. We have now added another section 489 of Indian Penal Code against Dave and Patel,” police said.
 
 According to police sources, the accused had brought the counterfeit notes from Ahmedabad. Police suspect that the notes were also printed in Ahmedabad. Police is probing involvement of one man from Ahmedabad who is also suspected to be running a fake currency racket.
