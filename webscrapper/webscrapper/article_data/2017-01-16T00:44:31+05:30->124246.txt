NEW DELHI:   has asked   ( ) to restore the size of plots allocated for senior secondary   in the capital to four acres as he felt the biggest casualty of the decision would be playgrounds.

 Keen to give sports in the country a boost, the minister said he was also finalising a comprehensive plan for utilisation of school infrastructure after school hours.
 
 The move came as DDA decided to reduce the size of plots allotted to schools to two acres, citing shortage of  .
 
 “I have written to DDA to reverse the decision to allot two acre plots for senior secondary schools. In case of reducing the size of land allotted, schools are going to do away with playgrounds,” Goel told TOI.
 
 Lacking in infrastructure, most schools have few sports facilities and even lack teachers for physical education. Playgrounds give way to school buildings due to shortage of land.
 
 As most schools in big cities lack playgrounds, the sports ministry believes that even though the country has a population of more than one billion, it fails to win Olympics medals because games and sports get very little attention at the school level.
 
 With sports neglected in schools, the minister wants to impress upon state governments and local authorities to make land available for use as playgrounds in all schools and colleges.
 
 Batting for sports to be included in the school curriculum, Goel had earlier said that to impart desired importance to sports, it should be made a compulsory subject at the school level. He said marks should be given to students for their involvement in sports activities.
