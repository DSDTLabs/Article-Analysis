KOCHI: Officials with   said that the first phase of implementing green protocol at offices and premises of   collectorate has been successfully completed.

 Sujith  , district coordinator of Haritha Keralam Mission, said that as part of embracing an eco-friendly system, vertical gardens and flower pots have been placed on the collectorate premises.
 
 “Our idea is to make government offices greener by adopting guidelines under the green protocol proposed by the mission. The implementation of the green protocol at government offices will set a new trend. In the first phase, the programme has been implemented in select government institutions, including the collectorate. In the second phase, it will be extended to all other departments,” said Karun.
 
 “The significance of sustainable and eco-friendly living is increasing ever than before. While there are many ways to adopt green-friendly practices, we found that having a green wall in the form of vertical garden — made of 600 succulent and indoor plants — as a good option as it requires lowmaintenance. The vertical garden is now installed at the visitors’ lounge in the collector’s chamber and in the ground floor. In addition, flower pots are placed on the collectorate premises,” said an official with the   Mission In the second phase, we would start small-scale organic farming in the backyard of the collectorate, he said.
 
 Along with the green protocol enforcement, those working in government offices have to adopt measures to stop wastage of water and electricity. The departments will have to save money on electricity and water bills.
 
 The deputy directorate of panchayats in   is one such office which is spearheading the green movement.
 
 Preethy M D, deputy superintendent, directorate of panchayat, Kakkanad, said that their department has banned plastic and have also set up a separate facility to segregate waste materials.
