CHANDIGARH: Imagine someone dressed in white dhoti kurta, white turban and thick gold chain, riding a bicycle with a signage reading ‘Clean City, Green City’ on Valentine’s Day. The cycle is also decorated with heart shaped balloons. 

 Harpreet Singh, a 25-year-old sociology student from DAV College, Sector 10, has taken up the task of spreading the message of cleanliness. Singh had been to Sukhna Lake, Sector 24 and Sector 17 on Wednesday.
 
 Singh wants to see Chandigarh on the top of the list of clean cities in the Central Government’s   survey. “In the last two surveys, Chandigarh didn’t fare well. I want to spread awareness and would like to see my city’s name at the number 1 spot,” he said.
 
 Though the usual V-day vibe was missing on Wednesday, people stopped to click selfies with a crimson red car, which was decorated with heart-shaped balloons. “I had purchased this car on my birthday almost three years ago,” said RK Mahajan, the owner of the vehicle.
