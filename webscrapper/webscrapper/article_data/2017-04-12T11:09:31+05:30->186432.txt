LUCKNOW: Officials at   are a worried lot. While dense sugarcane fields usually provide a shelter to tigresses and newborn  , this time, it is not the case. 

 As the crop has been cut, the   are in the open. Many of them have been frequenting the buffer area of the reserve. 
 
 Two tigresses who attained motherhood this year have been frequenting the buffer zone within 1km radius of each other along with their cubs. The situation has put authorities on their toes because ensuring the safety of the mothers and their cubs is a 24-hour job. 
 
 The buffer area is the periphery of the dense core area. Tigresses move to this area to protect their cubs from strong, dominant tigers which live in the core area. In the tourist season, the reserve gets a large number of visitors, causing more disturbance than usual. Therefore, the buffer area has been cordoned off.
 
 “It’s not only about these two tigresses. Even other tigers have been frequenting the buffer zone,” said   Tiger Reserve deputy director Mahaveer K. 
 
 As the two tigresses accept each other’s presence quietly in a close range, tiger enthusiasts and visitors believe the two are related. Mothers are usually extremely protective of their cubs and would charge at anyone getting close to the newborns.
 
 “It’s possible that the two are raising cubs fathered by the same tiger,” said former field director GC Mishra.
 
 “Tigresses nurse cubs amid dense sugarcane fields but as fields in the terai region have been cleared, it makes many of them search for a safe den,” said tiger enthusiast Sanjay Narain.
