CHANDIGARH: On the last day of self-declaration scheme,   residents on Thursday thronged the municipal corporation office to deposit their residential and commercial property  . 

 Around 800 people deposited their property taxes - both commercial and residential - on Thursday. The tax branch remained open till late to facilitate the people. Besides   office, various e-sampark centres and banks were seen depositing tax money.
 
 The MC had earlier declared that the taxpayers, who would deposit their dues during self-declaration scheme (from April 1 till May 31), would get 20% rebate on residential taxes and 10% on commercial. As many as 42,677 people availed the benefit under the scheme, helping MC generate Rs 23.67 crore revenue.
 
 Now that the last day of self-declaration scheme is over, the tax branch will start sending notices to the taxpayers, who are yet to pay their dues. Besides the calculated tax amount, the defaulters will have to pay penalty charges. If they fail to pay the money, serious action would be taken against them, which may also result into sealing of their respective properties.
 
 The municipal corporation had setup a special desk in the last two days to facilitate more and more people. Since property tax is one of the biggest source of revenue, the Chandigarh civic body is also in the process of making this system online. An IT company has already been hired in this regard.
