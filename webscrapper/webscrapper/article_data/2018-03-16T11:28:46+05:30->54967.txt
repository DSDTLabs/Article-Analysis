ERODE: As many as five students from a government school at Gobichettipalayam in Erode district did not return to their homes after the school hours on Wednesday night.

 The parents of the students, two from Class X and others from Class XI, launched a search after the boys failed to return home even after 7pm. “Our kids’ classmates said they went with a boy after the school,” said the father of one of the five students. “The boy with whom they went was a school dropout,” he added.
 
 When their search failed, the parents approached the Gobichettipalayam police on Thursday morning and lodged complaints with them. Based on the complaints, the police have registered a ‘missing’ case of six boys. 
 
 After the preliminary investigation, the police suspect that the students might have went out of the homes fearing their board exams. 
 
 “The boys told their friends that they were going to Chennai. We are looking at   footages of Erode bus stand and railway station. We will find them soon,” said a police officer.
