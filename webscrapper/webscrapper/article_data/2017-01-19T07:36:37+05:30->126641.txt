PATNA: Nepal police initiated on Wednesday the process to extradite from Dubai the operative of Pakistan's spy agency   who had engineered, through subversion by Indian links, two major train accidents in India last year. Over 150 passengers were killed and 200 injured in the accidents near Kanpur.

 The move to extradite Shamshul Huda, a Nepalese, follows the arrest of six people in Motihari and Nepal. Huda operated through fellow countrymen Brij Kishore Giri alias Baba Giri, Shambhu Giri and Mujahir Ansari, who were arrested in Nepal. Brij in turn gave Rs 3 lakh to three Bihar criminals, Umashankar Patel, Motilal Paswan and Mukesh Yadav, to engineer the   and   accidents.
 
 The three Bihar criminals had confessed that they had worked for an ISI agent in Nepal. Inspector Arun Kumar Kushwaha, the investigating officer told TOI from Bara, Nepal, "We have initiated the process for extradition of Shamshul Huda, who was handling Brij."
 
 
 
 
  and   sleuths reached Motihari on Wednesday to interrogate the three terror suspects who had confessed to their involvement in engineering train accidents.
