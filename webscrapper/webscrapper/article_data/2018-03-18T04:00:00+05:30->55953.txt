Surat: Twenty-year-old Ruzbeh Gav Master has made it to the India Book of Records for designing a dual propeller all-wheel drive motorcycle inspired from the engine of a car. 

 Ruzbeh, a third year BTech student of automobile engineering, was working on his innovation ‘Hammerhead 800’ for the past one year. His motorcycle has an 800cc car engine, which transmits power through propeller shaft to front and rear wheels and can be manoeuvred in reverse direction as well. 
 
 Last year in November, Ruzbeh had participated with his motorcycle in India Bike Week, a national festival of modified motorcycles held every year in Goa, and bagged the first prize for his macho motorcycle. 
 
 Ruzbeh, son of technician Gav Master, who is employed in the mechanical engineering department of Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT), told TOI, “I have started working on the compact version of this motorcycle. This is the only bike in the country which can be driven in both the directions and has maximum speed of 200 kilometre with four speed forward and one speed reverse manual transmission.”
 
 Asked about his dream, Ruzbeh said, “I want to earn a name in the automobile world. From a very small age, I had a passion for bike modification. Few years ago, I had modified a 100cc motorcycle and also the diesel motorcycle of my father.”
 
 Ruzbeh has filed an application for patent protection with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) under Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) for his innovation and that it has been published in the website of WIPO too.
 
 “My international patent in WIPO has been accepted and soon I will be getting the patent for this motorcycle. My innovation will get an international stamp and I am looking forward to working with international motorcycle manufacturing companies,” Ruzbeh said.
