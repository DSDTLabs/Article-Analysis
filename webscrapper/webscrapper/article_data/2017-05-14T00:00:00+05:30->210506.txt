There are 24 hours in a day and I like to plan everything well in advance. I imagine my entire day and figure out whether it is practical for me to fit in what I want to or not; then I prioritise – from planning the menu to meetings, chatting with the kids on extracurricular activities, car pool, or even a date with Shaan, everything is planned! I have to-do notes all over my cabin (in the office) and on the fridge (in my kitchen). 
 
 
 
 Going home and sitting on the hammock with Soham and Shubh, asking about their day, laughing with them. When Shaan joins the party, it’s more fun. Also playing with Chowder, my pug. Shaan and I have been married for 16 years, but we still have date nights... that anchors me a lot.
 
 
 
 Don’t get work home.
 
 
 
 I have removed the treadmill from my gym and placed it in the living room. Every time I decide to even become a couch potato the treadmill stares at me.
 
 
 
 Shaan and my sons. If you throw me in the most beautiful place on earth and I don’t have them, it wouldn’t appeal to me.
 
 
 
 Gratitude! I thank God every single day for giving me this day. I also believe what goes around comes around.
 
 
 
 I’ve learnt this from Shaan. He is so humble and down-to-earth in spite of all the success and adulation. Although I have a long way to go, I don’t let success get to my head, nor do I let failure pull me down. The only thing standing between you and your goal is you telling yourself you can’t do it. 
 
 
 I think on my feet and – I honestly think any situation can’t be so overwhelming that it can’t be dealt with. I have a crazy do-or-die attitude.
