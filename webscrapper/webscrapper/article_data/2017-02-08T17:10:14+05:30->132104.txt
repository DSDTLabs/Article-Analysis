All eyes were on Shah Rukh Khan on January 25 as his much-awaited film ‘Raees’ hit theatres across the country. What made it all the more interesting was that ‘Raees’ was clashing at the box-office with Hrithik Roshan’s ‘Kaabil’. SRK fans thronged the theatres to see their favourite star and King Khan did not disappoint.

 
  
 SRK’s ‘Raees’ took a fantastic opening – the film collected Rs 20.42 crore on Day One in the domestic market. Considering the Rahul Dholakia-directed film released on a weekday and did not enjoy the benefit of a holiday, the figures are quite impressive. If all goes well, the numbers will only rise dramatically on Thursday since it is a holiday on account of Republic Day. Combine that with the weekend and the film is expected to rake in the moolah.
  
 The opening day collections of ‘Raees’ are higher than SRK’s last two releases – ‘
 ’ and ‘
 ’.
 
 
 
 While the numbers are a good enough reason for Shah Rukh to rejoice, he has another reason to smile. The superstar has received appreciation for his nuanced performance in the role of a bootlegger in  . While SRK plays   in the film, Pakistani actor   plays his love interest and Nawazuddin Siddiqui, a tough-as-nails cop who is out to put an end to Raees’ criminal activities.
 
 
 
 As far as collections go, Shah Rukh had promised “Aa raha hoon main” and looks like he has truly arrived. After the strong opening, one will have to see if ‘Raees’ sails through the weekend.
