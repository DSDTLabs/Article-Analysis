Filmmakers Khushboo Ranka and   had informed Mirror on Friday that chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification,  , had asked them to get NoCs from Prime Minister  , Delhi Chief Minister   and former Delhi CM Sheila Dixit, among others, before clearing their political documentary, 'An Insignificant Man'.

  
  
 They added that after the Examining Committee had referred them to the Revising Committee without offering any reason, they had approached Nihalani for an explanation and he "threw them out of his office".
 
 Objecting to this allegation, Nihalani said, "I met them at the theatre during the Revising Committee screening and after it, I suggested some mute cuts (beeps) with reference to certain political parties. I also told them that since they had used footage of certain real politicians, they would need to get NoCs from them. They told me they had already taken NoCs during the shooting, and said I would clear the film subject to the NoC. Their allegation that I threw them out is completely untrue."
