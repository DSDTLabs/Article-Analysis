MANALI: As many as 50% calls received by 108 Emergency   (ERC) in the state have been recorded to be fake or ineffective calls which is severely affecting handling the actual emergencies, an official said.   (EMRI) state head   said ineffective calls they receive included prank, abusive, silent calls, wrong numbers and poor signals. “Surprisingly, we have received more than 150 such calls from single numbers as well. This clogs the lines for those who are in real emergency. This has resulted in increased in unanswered calls from 0.19% in 2019 to 0.27% in 2017. We treat every call received at 108 and 102 as “life saving” call. But mischievous persons are affecting the whole system,” he said.

 Officials said they cannot ignore any call and had to attend each of them. They said many calls seek breaking news, weather report and pre-paid mobile recharge and many people call them out of frustration.
 
 Officials claim their operators are trained to collect all information from caller within 90 seconds and they respond to 99% of calls within 4 seconds. The emergency service has handled one million emergency calls in last seven years.
