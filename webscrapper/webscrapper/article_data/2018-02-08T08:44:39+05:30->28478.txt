LUCKNOW: Railway budget 2018-19 paves way for   as a satellite station and decongestion of Charbagh. Once   is developed, trains will move via Moradabad, Alamnagar, Transportnagar and Utrethia towards Allahabad or Varanasi bypassing Lucknow station.

 Also, Lucknow will get at least six new platforms including the projects sanctioned in the current and last year’s budget. The works are, in fact, part of the plan to decongest Lucknow station. The budget this year has sanctioned Rs 26.7cr for augmentation of passenger amenities at Alamnagar. This will propel development of Alamnagar as a full-fledged station. “A new station and an extra platform will be built,” said divisional railway manager, NR, Lucknow,  .
 
 
  
  
 
 Aseparate, single line between Utrethia and Alamnagar was laid in 1992 for the movement of a goods train. But the line is saturated now and some of the goods train move through Lucknow station. The doubling of the line was sanctioned to decongest the route. Besides, two island platforms have already been sanctioned at Charbagh. In all, Lucknow will get six new platforms in a year’s time. Charbagh has only nine platforms against the requirement of 16 to operate more than 300 trains daily.
