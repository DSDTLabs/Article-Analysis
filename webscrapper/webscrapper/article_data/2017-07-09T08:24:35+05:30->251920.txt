PUNE: The collective water stock in the four dams   to the city surged to 26.7% on Saturday evening, but the state   is apprehensive about the increase in their storage in the days to come because of drop in rainfall in catchments.

 According to the state irrigation department’s records, the rainfall in catchments of Temghar, Varasgaon, Panshet and Khadakwasla was almost nil on Saturday. None of the dams in the   recorded rain. Officials of the department said the sudden drop in rainfall had led to little inflow of rain water in the reservoirs.
 
 On Saturday morning, the collective water storage in the four dams was 7.7 TMC. It increased to 7.79 TMC in the evening, registering a rise of only 0.09 TMC. In the past 36 hours, Temghar recorded 25mm rainfall, while Panshet and Varasgaon registered merely 9mm and 4mm rainfall, respectively, in their catchments.
 
 On July 2, the water storage in the four dams stood at 5.31 TMC. In the past six days, they have added only 2.48 TMC of water following rainfall.
 
 A senior official said the   in catchments changed every year. “This year, the dams recorded heavy rainfall in the last week of June. But it seems that rainfall activity is weak in the entire region for the past few days. All the major dams in Pune district have registered drop in rainfall. Last year, catchments of the dams had recorded   of rain in July. It had pushed up the water-level to a comfortable position,” he said.
 
 The dams had 6.76 TMC water in the same period last year — almost 1 TMC less than this year’s stock of 7.79 TMC. The maximum storage capacity of the four dams is 29.15 TMC.
