NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court directed the Centre on Thursday to allow students to opt for   language as a medium to take the common medical entrance examination, NEET, from next year onwards. A bench of Justices Dipak Misra, A M Khanwilkar and M M Shantagoudar, however, turned down a plea of students seeking its direction to allow Urdu for   this year saying that it was too late to direct the authorities to introduce Urdu as all preparations had been done for the test scheduled for May 7.

 The Centre has allowed medical aspiring students to take the test in one of the ten languages--Hindi, English, Gujarati, Marathi, Odiya, Bengali, Tamil, Telegu, Kannada and Assamese-after holding consultations with various state governments. It, however, left Urdu language and the government’s decision was challenged in the apex court by Delhibased Student Islamic Organisation along with a group of aggrieved students.
 
 Pleading the court to include Urdu language for NEET 2017, the petitioners contended that a large number of students study science in Urdu medium in states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and they would suffer if they would not be allowed to take test in Urdu language Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar assured the court that the Urdu would be introduced from next year. “We are not opposed to it but the problem is for this year,” he said.
