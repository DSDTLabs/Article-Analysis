GHAZIABAD: Around 12.40am on Tuesday, a Renault Duster car would have been stolen in   in   but for an alert security guard who foiled the bid by miscreants armed with a huge metal road and a stone.

 “One of the security guards raised an alarm when the miscreants broke the windscreen of the car. The thieves then ran away,” RWA president Mohit Dwivedi said. In the past two to three months, increasing incidents of robberies and snatchings in the area have spread panic among the residents in the area.
 
 Six days ago, an elderly man’s mobile phone was allegedly snatched in Tikona Park, where he had gone for his morning walk. “I kept crying out for help,” he said. Two weeks ago, two wheels of a car parked near Krishna Apra Garden Society were stolen by, a resident said.
 
 The residents of societies like HRC, Express Gardens and Amrapali Green said that the law and order situation in Vaibhav Khand has deteriorated as there are no PCR vans near Tikona Park. Neeta Sharma, a resident whose friend lost three of her mobile phones to snatchers, said, “This entire place becomes deserted after sunset. Most incidents are reported on the stretch near Tikona Park. The police have been alerted several times, but they have not been able to help so far. The area has become unsafe for women too.”
 
 Residents have also expressed concern over the increasing number of encroachments near the boundary walls of the residential societies by tobacco vendors. “The shops selling cigarettes have become a haven for drug peddlers and thieves,” a resident said. 
 
 While residents complain of police apathy, Balram Singh Yadav, chowki cncharge, Shipra, said, “We admit that there have been a few incidents of chain, wallet and mobile phone snatching in Vaibhav Khand but we have been doing our best to curb them. From 5am to 8:30pm there is a PCR that is parked right outside of Tikona Park.“
