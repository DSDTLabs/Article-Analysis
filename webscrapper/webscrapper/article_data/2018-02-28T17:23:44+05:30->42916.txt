LUCKNOW: Prominent Shia and Sunni clerics have altered timings for Friday prayers at two of the biggest mosques here for   on March 2 to maintain peace and harmony. They have extended the timing of the congregational   (Friday).

 
 While Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawad has extended the namaz timing at Asafi (Bada) Imambara by 30 minutes, Sunni cleric Maulana Khalid Rasheed   has requested Muslims to shift Jumah timings by halfan-hour this Friday. A day ago, chief minister  , while reviewing security for Holi, had asked officials to talk to Muslim clerics to see if namaz timings could be changed to ensure peaceful Holi celebrations. Farangi Mahli, who is also the executive committee member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, on Tuesday urged mosques in mixed population areas to postpone prayer timings until after 1pm, keeping sentiments of Hindus in mind.
 
 On March 2, Friday prayers at   will be held at 1.45pm as against the regular 12.45pm. At Asafi mosque, Namaz-e-Jumah for the Shia community will be held at 1pm instead of regular 12.22 pm, said Jawad.
 
 
 
 
 
 The official permission to play colours is till 12noon but people generally go beyond that time. We thought it will be best if all mosques, especially those in mixed population areas, push their prayer timings by half-an-hour so that both events can be held peacefully,” Farangi Mahli told TOI.
 
 
 The cleric said that Hindus last year had postponed the Jagannath Yatra passing through Eidgah area by two hours on Bakrid to respect the Muslim festival.
 
 
 “There were changes made in the yatra’s route as well. So, it will be good to respect one another’s religious sentiments,” he said.
