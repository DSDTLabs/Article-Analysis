Vijay Sethupathi, who has a slew of films this year, is going to start work on his film with cinematographer-turned-director  , ’96, from the end of this month. We hear that the actor will be portraying the role of a travel photographer and will be travelling extensively during the shoot.

 Confirming the news, the director says, “Though he is not sporting any new look for the photographer role, he has a major change in his look in the latter portions of the film. He will go for a makeover after completing the first schedule.”
 
 Ask him about the title and Premkumar says, “The film revolves around characters who belong to the same batch — 1996. The years during which one does their schooling and college define their character. The year ’96 plays a key role in this romantic film, and hence this title.”
