 - Roopesh Peethambaran starrer   is one of the much awaited vintage campus films of the year.

 The official title of the movie, directed by Tom Immatty, was launched recently and it looks like the film has a strong foundation of yesteryear campus politics as its theme, from the looks of it. Neeraj Madhav also plays a key role in the movie.
