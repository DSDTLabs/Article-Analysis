Panaji: Tourism minister Manohar ‘Babu’ Azgaonkar has denied having any problem with Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC) chairman Nilesh Cabral.  “Who said we have problems? There may be some differences of opinion on certain issues, but we both have a lot of ideas and are working in the interest of tourism in the state,” Azgaonkar said on Tuesday. “Cabral is young and energetic and a very resourceful person. I am sure, he will perform better in his second term of chairmanship of GTDC,” he added, while rubbishing speculations of simmering tension between the two. During the monsoon session of the Goa legislative assembly in August, it was apparent the tourism minister and the BJP’s vociferous Curchorem MLA, were not on the same page. The duo had heated arguments on more than one issue in the assembly.  Azgaonkar and Cabral clashed over the leasing of GTDC properties with the former declaring in the House that all GTDC decisions on leasing of its properties would be reviewed. Cabral, who retained chairmanship of GTDC in the coalition government, has favoured leasing of GTDC properties, some of which are located in prime locations.  Though the tourism minister has not changed his stand on the issue, he said he is open to reviewing and re-examining any proposal in the interest and benefit of the state but it will be done after consulting Cabral.  “I will discuss it with Cabral so that whatever decision has been proposed to be taken by them is in the interest of the corporation and tourism,” said Azgaonkar.  Cabral feels fund-staved GTDC has no option but to take the help of private investors to develop its properties, some of which are in a dilapidated condition. Within a few months of Azgaonkar assuming charge as tourism minister, marketing and promotion activity which was in the domain of GTDC was entrusted to the tourism department.
