GUWAHATI: With no sign boards, bus stops in the city offer no clue to visitors who are not familiar with the geography of the city. "Travelling within the city on a bus is very difficult. Figuring out where you are should be easier. In other cities, names of the places are displayed clearly. That is not the case here," said Ramen Deka, a retired school teacher.

 Most of the sign boards that do display the name of the area are covered with advertisements, obscuring them. "When I first got here, it was very difficult for me to locate places. I have to keep looking out for addresses written below hoardings and sign boards of commercial establishments. It is a huge problem. Sometimes, I just ask people around me for directions," said Aparajita Talukdar, a student visiting the city for the first time.
 
 The problem is a crucial one in a city that aspires to be a 'smart' one. Taking this into account, the Kamrup ( ) district administration has decided to have new sign boards installed. "We have decided to install new sign boards, with names of stoppages spelt out clearly in Assamese and in English," said Kamrup (Metro) DC M Angamuthu. The project will be implemented by the Guwahati Municipal Corporation. 
 
 Meanwhile, several new city bus stoppages and new routes have been identified by the transport department. The DTO has identified 22 spots on NH-37 from   to  , according to press statement issued by the district administration. Transport associations will also be asked to ply city buses on new routes -   (Paltan Bazar), Garchuk-Fatasil Ambari, Gosala-Maligaon and Narengi-Six Mile.
