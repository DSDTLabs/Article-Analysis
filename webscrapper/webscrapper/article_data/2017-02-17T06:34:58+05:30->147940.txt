CHENNAI: The   on Thursday dismissed a PIL seeking declaration of the   residence of former   as a memorial.

 Citing similar memorials for the one-time residences of leaders such as Rajaji, Kamaraj, Annadurai and MGR at various places in the state, the PIL said the Poes Garden home of Jayalalithaa should be converted into a memorial and maintained by the Tamil Nadu government.
 
 However, a bench of Justice Huluvadi G Ramesh and Justice R Mahadevan dismissed the plea, saying the high court's Madurai bench had already dismissed a similar PIL .
 
 “It appears that seeking identical relief WP (MD) No599 of 2017 was filed with the Madurai bench of this court and, by order dated Ja nuary 12, 2017, the writ petition was dismissed as not maintainable. In view of [this], nothing remains to be reconsidered in the present writ petition,“ the bench said.
 
 In his PIL, S Parthiban of Saidapet said O Panneerselvam, who was chief minister till Thursday since December 5 when Jayalaltihaa died after 75 days of hospitalisation, had made an announcement that her residence would become a memorial. Despite the announcement, pri vate individuals are still crowding the site, the petition said, adding that it was the wish of AIADMK cadres as well as the general public that it should become a memorial.
 
 Faulting officials for remaining unresponsive to representations and suggestions, the petitioner said the cost of construction of a memorial for could be considerably reduced if her own home was converted into one.
 
 Since Jayalalitha was a mass leader who had no family and also did not leave behind any will, authorities should not ignore demands from the public, the PIL said, adding that it should be built within a time frame.
 
 The government [and its agencies] had a bounden duty to consider a representation of the people in this regard, he said, adding that he was constrained to move the court because there was no response from officials despite to his suggestions.
