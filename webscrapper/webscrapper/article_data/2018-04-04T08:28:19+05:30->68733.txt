 BHOPAL: The Madhya Pradesh government is considering a new scheme under which it would share part of   of accredited journalists, and is also rolling out a law to protect scribes, said sources.
 
 The proposal to help out journos with home loans was submitted before a senior minister recently, and he has given his nod, say sources. "A notesheet related to this scheme was send to the minister in the last assembly session," said a senior bureaucrat, adding that if everything goes well, an official announcement would be made next month. 
 
 Under the proposed draft, only journalists buying their first home would be eligible for this scheme, said the officer. “As of now, only accredited journalists will be covered under the scheme in which government will bear the interest on loan and the journalist will only have to clear the principal amount. The quantum of loan has not been decided,” he said, asking not to be named.
 
 Journalists are often denied loans by banks. “Supporting the interest component of their loans will give them great respite,” said an officer.
 
 The   is also working on a new law to protect journalists. “The process to enact a law for security of journalists will be initiated in the state,” chief minister   Chouhan had said while addressing a session of   in Bhopal recently. 
 
 In 2015, the MP government had sanctioned personal health insurance of Rs 2 lakh and accident insurance of Rs 5 lakh for journalists. Media representatives between 21 and 70 years of age are eligible for insurance. It includes cashless treatment of up to Rs 2 lakh in hospitals identified by the insurance company.
