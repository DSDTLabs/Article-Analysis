Chandigarh: The Opposition is targeting Haryana agriculture minister Om Parkash Dhankar over his son’s alleged threat to a sarpanch in Mahendergarh district. On the other hand, BJP MLAs are reportedly making efforts to broker peace among both sides.

 The incident occurred on January 8 when Dhankar’s son Aditya Dhankar, who allegedly owns a company involved in lifting of gravel from Satnali Khurd railways station, threatened Satnali Khurd sarpanch Udai Singh over phone in case he did not withdraw the agitation against his company. Udai had approached Satnali police station and a DDR was lodged in the matter.
 
 Former finance minister Ajay Singh Yadav termed the incident as one that had exposed the real face of BJP ministers and their kin. “This is the second such major incident which has come in public. There may be many more case which may have gone unreported and unheard. If BJP leaders cannot set their house in order then what do you expect for the common man,” alleged Yadav.
 
 Former chief parliamentary secretary Ran Singh Mann of the Congress accused the government of suppressing the voice of the poor. “The entire government is bent upon pressurizing the poor sarpanch, who had raised the common man’s voice by opposing a wrong. This shows that their arrogance is at its peak. Anyhow, it is a matter of few months now,” he said.
 
 On Tuesday, BJP MLA and former CPS Shyam Singh Rana had met the aggrieved sarpanch to sort out the matter. Mahendergarh SP Kamaldeep Goyal told TOI on Wednesday that since there was no cognizable offence, the police did not proceed further. “We have provided the complainant a copy of the DDR,” he said.
