HYDERABAD: There's bonhomie in the KCR household. Information technology and municipal administration minister   has described his nephew, irrigation minister  , as 'generous' for saying he would be willing to work under him. 

 Harish Rao in an interview to TOI had said that if his 'boss', that is TRS president and chief minister   directs him, he would be willing to work under his cousin K T Rama Rao. On Saturday, KTR said the remark of Harish Rao was indeed generous. "But boss (KCR) will lead the state for another 10 years. Now is not the time to discuss about it (who will be next CM). I think it is too far fetched and too early to talk about any such thing," he told TOI. 
 
 
 
 Harish Rao has also been reiterating that KCR would continue to lead the state for another 15-20 years. 
 
 The TRS government completes four years in office on June 2 and KTR said it has been a 'happy story' of governance since the formation of the state. "I think we've touched every sphere of life. All round development has been the focus. The satisfaction levels are quite high," he said.
 
 KTR has set goals for himself and on Saturday, released a report card on IT. He said in the next few days, he would release a report card on industries and municipal administration and other portfolios he holds.
 
 The minister credited the chief minister for coming up with new ideas for the welfare of the people, though no such promises were made in the TRS manifesto. Asked how these new schemes got to be formulated, he said, "All thanks to our boss (KCR). He's come from the grassroots and who knows and understands the needs of the common man."
