NEW DELHI: The   directed the Centre on Wednesday to frame a fresh media briefing policy for probing agencies to guard against prejudicing an accused and violating the rights of a complainant or victim in criminal cases.

 After a detailed presentation by amicus curiae Gopal Sankaranarayanan, a bench of Chief Justice   and Justices D Y Chandrachud and Sanjay Kishan Kaul said the media briefing policy for central investigating agencies were framed in 2010 and it was time to frame them afresh taking into consideration the issues flagged by the amicus.
 
 Appearing for the Centre, advocate K Radhakrishnan said the government had received inputs on this from the CBI, National Human Rights Commission as well as  .
 
 For independent news broadcasters, advocate Anup Bhambani said journalists look for information on their own because of the absence of “credible dissemination of authentic information” at various stages of investigation into a criminal case.
 
 The bench said, “The Union government through its office memorandum of April 1, 2010 had framed a media briefing policy. The OM deserves to be updated appropriately. When Bhambani attempted to give reasons why media sniffs around for more information, the bench said, “We are not saying what media should do, sniff or not. The government should finalise the draft guidelines to protect the rights of both the accused as well as the victims of crime. The government has got inputs from the amicus as well as from other bodies.”
