NOIDA: Two elderly persons were injured when a speeding   rammed against a car near Dalit Prerna Sthal on the Noida-Greater Noida expressway on Tuesday morning. 

 The bus, owned by a contractor who requested anonymity, providing service for Mayoor School, Noida Sector 126, was allegedly not on duty at the time of the accident. The driver was identified as Sanjay, who fled the spot. 
 
 Manish Kumar (35), a havildar in the Indian Army, said that he, along with his parents Jairam Rana (65), Rani Rana (60), wife Suman (30), two sons Arnab (2) and Aryab (1), were going from Faridabad to Shimla in their red Tata Zest. Kumar was driving, while his wife and children were sitting next to him and his parents were sitting in the back seat.
 
 Kumar said, “I was waiting at the traffic signal near Sector 15 when a speeding school bus rammed against our car. The collision was severe and my parents sitting at the back fell down from their seat and received head injuries,” he said.
 
 The injured were taken to Kailash Hospital. Kumar’s mother received stitches on the head, while his father was discharged after primary treatment. A police team reached the spot and both the vehicles were taken to the police station.
