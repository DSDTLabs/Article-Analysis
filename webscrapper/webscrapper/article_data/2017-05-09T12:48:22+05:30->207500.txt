JHARSUGUDA: In spite of being 69-years-old, Vidya Prasad   of Belpahar in Jharsuguda district, considers it his reponsibility to quench people's thirst in the heat. 

 The retired   employee has opened a water kiosk in front of his house, through which he offers free water to all. 
 
 "I once saw a couple with a small kid walking down the road in front of my house. They were totally exhausted. I asked them to rest on my porch and offered them water. I saw the contentment on their faces while they drank. On that very day, I decided to open a kiosk for those who might need it," said Sharma. Sharma keeps two earthen pots in an old cooler on his porch to keep the water at a cool temperature all day.
 
 "Earlier, we use to have lots of trees by the road but due to road widening, thousands of the trees were removed. This results in pedestrians facing the harsh sun in summer," he said.
 
 Sharma's small gesture has resulted in great popularity for him in Belpahar.
 
  "We really appreciate the good work of Mr Sharma. Today in this materialistic world who has time to think for others?" said Subash Pradhan, a social worker of Belpahar. 
 
 Loknath Tiwari, executive officer of the   said the civic body has already provided several water kiosks.
