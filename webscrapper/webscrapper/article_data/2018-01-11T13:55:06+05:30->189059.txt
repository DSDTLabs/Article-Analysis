Whether it's her make-up or her fashion style, 
  likes to keep it minimal. Her choices have always been fuss-free and elegant. Recently for an event, Katrina was spotted in an   ensemble. She looked resplendent as ever in the white maxi dress paired and embroidered cape. But thatâ€™s not it! She owned this look with a pair of juttis and kundan jewellery. 

  The diva is known for her glamourous roles in movies, but this simple look is just drop-dead gorgeous!
