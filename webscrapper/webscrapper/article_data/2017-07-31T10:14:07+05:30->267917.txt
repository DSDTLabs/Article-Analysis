VADODARA: Panic spread near   on Saturday midnight after two cars suddenly went up in a blaze. 

 Sources said that fire broke out in one of the cars due to short-circuit and engulfed the one parked adjacent to it too. The cars were completely gutted in the fire. Fortunately, no one was injured as both four-wheelers were parked at a distance from the food market, which witnesses heavy footfall during weekends.
 
 Owner of one of the cars, Bena Chauhan had gone to Raatri Bazar with her family, in their hatchback. However, there was short-circuit in the headlight and fire broke out in the vehicle. Within minutes, it was engulfed in flames. Immediately, the fire spread to another car parked nearby. 
 
 Meanwhile, a   (PCR) van that was passing from the area stopped by. Chauhan’s family members asked them for a fire extinguisher which they reportedly refused to give. 
 
 “We requested them to give a fire extinguisher which they had in their car but they refused saying that the bottle is small and it would help us in dousing the large blaze,” said Chauhan. She added that the PCR van then drove away from there.
 
 Chauhan’s nephew then went to a nearby hospital seeking help but he was turned away by a security guard. “The security guard of the hospital told my nephew that they do not have any fire extinguishers in their hospital,” alleged Chauhan, who works as a teacher in Maharani High School. 
 
 By then, their entire car was caught up in flames and a car parked beside it too was caught up in fire.
 
 However, a passer-by had informed   (VFES). Chauhan said that after the fire fighters came, the fire in both the cars was doused in about 30 minutes.
 
 “If the policemen in PCR van would have given us the fire extinguishers, the fire might not have been doused but at least we could have brought it under control and saved the other car too,” Chauhan told TOI.
