MUMBAI: A day after the death of a 27-year-old Thane man who was allegedly bitten by a rat while he was in coma at Bal Thackeray Hospital, Jogeshwari, the preliminary autopsy has given credence to the family's accusation that Parminder Gupta was bitten on the right eye at the   hospital on April 23. 

 The authorities had vehemently denied the allegation, claiming that a series of checks, including one by an ophthalmologist, didn't suggest anything like a rat bite. After Gupta died on Thursday afternoon, an autopsy was carried out at the Siddharth Hospital, Goregaon on Friday. A source told TOI, "There are traces of a healed injury near his right eyebrow. It could be a bite."
 
 The autopsy revealed that he had bleeding in the brain and also that a craniotomy (temporary removal of skull bone flap to access the brain) was carried out in the past. But experts said the bite is unlikely to have had an impact on his health condition or the outcome. The final autopsy report is expected in a week's time after the histopathology reports arrive from JJ Hospital.
 
 "We had conducted an inquest panchnama and did not find any injury caused by a rat. The family hasn't complained either," said senior inspector Rajendra Nikam, Jogeshwari police.
 
 Medical superintendent Dr HS Bava said that the patient was critical and died of cardio respiratory arrest. Commenting on the scar, he said, "In a normal person, a wound takes seven days to heal before it becomes a scar. In a person who is ailing, it would take longer."
