  A memorandum which included demands to stop the teacher-on-call scheme and appointment of trained teachers against the vacancy of the teachers, was submitted to the chief minister Naveen Patnaik and school and mass education minister Badri Narayan Patra, through the RDC. Several students organisations, including Democratic Students Organisation (DSO) extended their solidarity to the agitation. 
 
 "The scheme will jeopardize the recruitment of the teachers in the state, where more than 35,000 trained teachers are waiting to be employed," said Bighnesh Parida, the president of the Association. Retired teachers may not be physically fit to teach in schools, he said.
 
 "After much agitation, the government had issued notifications to recruit 14,500 teachers in December, last year. We demanded the number of posts for recruitment should be increased as around 35,000 teaching posts are lying vacant," said Parida. The Association has also demanded the publication of the draft list for engagement of Sikshya Sahayaks in the state.
 
 On May 3, trained unemployed teachers staged a demonstration at Bhubaneswar and held a discussion with then minister Debi Prasad Mishra. "He had assured us that he will look into the matter and take suitable steps. As the government did not heed our demands, we have staged a rally here. We also have plans to stage a rally at Bhubaneswar on Wednesday," said Parida.
