KOLKATA: City schools, affiliated to the  , called the board’s decision to frame classes IX and XI annual exam question papers “yet another experiment” and preferred to “wait and watch”.

 So far, all CISCE-affiliated schools followed the syllabus framed by the board from class VIII onwards, but the question papers—barring that for classes X and XII—were set by individual institutes. The council now felt students should be given standardised question papers in classes IX and XI to prepare them for their boards exams next year. It also claimed a lot was left to chance, especially the completion of the syllabus in these classes, if framing of question papers was left to schools. But the institutes felt such a system might compromise their students’ standard.
 
 “We must check out the first lot of questions and then arrive at a conclusion…,” said  , a senior teacher at MP  . She pointed out that many CISCE-affiliated schools in the city offered superior standard of education and often, the questions set internally were of a higher level than the boards questions.
 
 The schools now wondered if the marking pattern would also be sent along with the question papers of classes IX and XI.
 
 The boards papers notwithstanding, some institutes even considered to have their own question papers for a separate exam “to maintain their standard of education”. “Preparing the children for higher education, we try to maintain superior standards though we know the students will have to write a standardised paper at the boards exams. The marks they get in the boards is not what we aim for. We aim to prepare them for what lies beyond. We try to give Class IX students ahead start over others in plustwo. Similarly, our class XI students are prepared for the   and undergraduation level,” said  , senior teacher at St James’ School.
