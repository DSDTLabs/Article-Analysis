 The items are part of ASI’s huge collection of artefacts and antiquities, a majority section of which have been kept in storage for lack of display opportunities. “ASI has a huge collection of artefacts, over two lakh, collected from excavations and other places. As of now, these were available only for study or research purposes. Over 400 stone objects, coins and other objects will be displayed. Our aim is to finish the project in the next six months,” said an official. The official added, “The antiques will be radio frequency identification (RFID) tagged and documented before being put on display.”
 
 The ASI, which conducts a survey of antiquarian remains, has a lot of pottery and artefacts stored in various offices. While it has museums at its exploration sites and has also contributed to collections at various museums across the country, including the National Museum, it has never displayed the pieces at a central repository for public viewing. The Central Antiquity Collection Centre at Purana Qila is for scholars and researchers only.
 
 A part of the collection on display will be artefacts and pottery acquired over a period of time from various sources, including excavated and explored antiquities, those confiscated and seized by enforcement agencies, and others found as chance discoveries and those that were donated.
