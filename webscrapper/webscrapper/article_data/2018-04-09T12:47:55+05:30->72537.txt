There’s nothing unusual about elder sisters watching over their siblings but   has gone a step further. After ensuring that her little sister   gets the spotlight in their first ever photo-shoot together, it’s believed that Katrina is now helping her sister take her baby steps into the professional arena. Sources close to Katrina reveal that she hired a tutor for Isabelle to get a grip over her Hindi even before she landed her first mainstream Bollywood film. As a London-based girl, Katrina had faced difficulties with the language in her initial years in Bollywood, which she clearly doesn’t want her sister to experience while she gears up to make her debut. 

  “After a few months of training, Isabelle’s command on Hindi is as good as Katrina’s,” observes a close friend of the actress, adding that the 'Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara' actress has also been carefully hand-picking staff for her li’l sister, starting with a set of experienced make-up and a hair-dressing professionals. In the meanwhile, Isabelle has been prepping for her part in her debut film that also features Sooraj Pancholi. She has been training in various dance forms for the film which is creatively helmed by choreographer-director Remo D’Souza.
