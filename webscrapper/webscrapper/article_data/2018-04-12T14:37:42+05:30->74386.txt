SURAT: A   of experts from the Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT) will conduct a survey of 24 road junctions of the city. 

 These junctions cause major jams on the roads of the city. The exercise to redesign old junctions will be carried out in another six weeks. Manual count, videography, bluetooth and Wi-Fi will be used for data collection on traffic density. 
 
 The city has a network of 3,200km of roads with about 286 junctions. While the growth rate of population over a decade has been 60%, for vehicles it has been 80% putting a lot of load on road infrastructure in the city.
 
 “Some major junctions have become redundant due to their geometric design, significant increase in mass transport facility and doubling of traffic volume in past one decade. There is need to redesign junctions to make some additional space for traffic,” an SMC officer said. 
 
 SMC standing committee had recently passed a proposal for carrying out a survey by experts from SVNIT. The   comprises of Dr G J Joshi, Dr Shrinivas Arkatkar and Dr Ashish Damaniya. 
 
 Joshi told TOI, “Selection of junctions was done on the basis of number of traffic streams converging there, delay, crash statistics and severity of traffic operations. Priorities are based on these criteria besides opinions of civic officials and police.” 
 
 Roads have been divided into large, medium and small categories. Intersections have been divided into four different categories. Intersections like Athwa Gate have been placed in multi-legged intersection category. 
 
 “Analysis will be done according to the Indian Road   (IRC) and Indian highway capacity manual of 2018,” Joshi said.
 
 The survey of road junctions in the city was last done in 2005.
