Jaipur: Bundiâ€™s PCPNDT court on Saturday rejected bail application of three accused, including a radiologist, arrested by the PCPNDT cell on charge of conducting sex selection activities during a decoy operation conducted on Friday.

 The three accused, including radiologist Abdul Rahim Ansari, and his two agents Rukmani Prajapat and Parwati Devi.
 
 Court observed that the charges levelled against the three accused are serious. Violating right to live of girl child is a heinous crime. At present, there is a rise in such crimes, which is making adverse impact on the society leading to imbalance in sex ratio in the country. In such a situation, benefit of bail to the accused cannot be given in public interest.
 
 PCPNDT cell officials said that they were looking for an opportunity to nab the accused of sex selection in Bundi. At the time when state supervisory board meeting was in progress on Friday, the PCPNDT cell officials conducted the decoy operation to keep it secret. Officials said that they had been trying to unearth the nexus of doctors and agents in Bundi involved in sex selection four times but all their efforts went into vain. They got success on fifth attempt.
