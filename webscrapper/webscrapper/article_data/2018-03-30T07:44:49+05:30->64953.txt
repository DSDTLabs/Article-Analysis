Broad was criticised for deciding not to walk after edging Ashton Agar to slip. “I just hope the Australian public give it to him right from the word go for the whole summer and I hope he cries and he goes home. I just hope everyone gets stuck into him because the way he’s carried on and the way he’s commented in public about it is ridiculous,” Lehmann had said.
