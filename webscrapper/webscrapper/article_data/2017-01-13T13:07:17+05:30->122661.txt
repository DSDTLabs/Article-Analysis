PANAJI: If Thursday afternoon was meant to be a sampling of culinary delights, the evening gave Portugal’s Prime Minister Antonio Costa a taste of Goa’s varied diversity and history. 

 From the Basilica of Bom Jesus at   to the 456-year-old Manguesh temple in Mangueshi, Costa got a glimpse of Goa’s religious heritage and  . 
 
 Following a nostalgic meal with his relatives in Margao, Costa, along with the Portuguese delegation, arrived at Se Cathedral, Old Goa, where he was received by archbishop patriarch of Goa and Daman, FilipeNeri Ferrao.
 
 Ferrao, along with his secretary Fr Loiola Pereira, gave Costa a guided tour through the church, all the while conferring in Portuguese. 
 
 Costa was amazed by the rich Christian heritage that remains vibrant in the state and expressed his hope that both Goa and Portugal could work together to conserve the shared heritage. It was only apt that Costa pay a visit to the Basilica of Bom Jesus, where the body of St   lies in spiritual repose. The saint left the shores of Lisbon, Portugal, in April 1541, and Costa, whose father grew up in Margao, probably owes his faith to the early missionaries. Costa, who was on a three-day visit to the state, was quite comfortable with his Goan roots and even took time out to pose with locals, tourists and church staff. 
 
 The Mangueshi temple offered Costa a chance to understand Goa’s Hindu culture. Appearing well at ease, Costa listened patiently as the temple priests and leaders explained the significance of the temple.
 
 Costa was pleasantly surprised to hear even the temple leaders greet him in Portuguese. 
 
 Se Cathedral and Bom Jesus Basilica are protected and recognized as   sites. Ferrao presented Costa with a coffee table book on the Church in Goa and the Church’s contribution in Goa.
