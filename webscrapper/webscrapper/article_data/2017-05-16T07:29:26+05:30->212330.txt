GREATER NOIDA: Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development   (YEIDA) on Monday said that Jaypee ( ) had paid it 15% of the total outstanding amount due for the 1,000hectare plot on which the company has developed a sports city. The Jaypee group has paid Rs 100 crore out of the Rs 600 crore, YEIDA said. The Authority had issued a final notice to the builder in March this year after which the realtor had paid the Authority Rs 10 crore. The next instalment due from Jaypee is Rs 384 crore, which it has to pay by August 31, 2017.

 According to Arunvir  , chief executive officer, YEIDA, the developer had been defaulting on its instalments for the past five years. “The land in question was allotted to the developer in three pockets under YEIDA for constructing residential units under Special Development Zone (SDZ) category,“ he said.
 
 “Owing to the default by the builder, the allottees are suffering. Currently, the builder has not even started construction on the land. Hence we issued a notice as they did not pay us Rs 90 crore in March. However, we extended the date after they paid us Rs 10 crore. The last date for paying the balance Rs 80 crore was May 15“ he explained.
 
 The developer still has to clear outstanding dues amounting to Rs 300 crore towards the 165-km expressway, which connects   to Agra besides Rs 1,200 crore, which has to be distributed as enhanced compensation of 64.7% to farmers in lieu for lands acquired. “However, the matter is sub-judice,“ Singh said.
