Actress   says her career has turned out very differently to what she expected as she initially hoped to make romantic comedies like 'Pretty Woman' star  . The ' ' actress jokes that her timing was terrible when it came to launching her movie career. 

 "I actually wanted to be Julia Roberts, and then they stopped making romantic comedies. My timing was terrible. I came into this business and everyone was like, 'We're gonna make bromances now!' and then every movie suddenly stars Jason Segel and  ," Banks says. 
 
  
  
 But the actress is happy that there is now "some really interesting non-traditional women in comedy, women like Melissa McCarthy and Amy Schumer". Banks, however, does not have any complaints with her life. 
 
 "And I have a lovely life. I'm not complaining. But I do feel like all planning goes out the window. Actually, I think that's probably why I produce and direct, because I really felt like the opportunities for me - especially compared to my male peers - were so limited and uninteresting."
