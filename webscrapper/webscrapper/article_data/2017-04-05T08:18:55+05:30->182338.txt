LUDHIANA/MUMBAI: A Ludhiana police team, sent to Mumbai following a court order to arrest actor   for allegedly making derogatory statements against   during a 2016 TV show, failed to locate her on Tuesday.

 An assistant sub-inspector and a woman head constable from Ludhiana reached Mumbai on Monday and visited a few spots in Oshiwara where the actor owns a flat, but failed to locate her. The team left for Ludhiana on Tuesday.
 
 A Ludhiana court had issued an arrest warrant against the actor on March 9 after she failed to appear before it following a petition filed by advocate   in July 2016 over the alleged derogatory remarks.
 
 “We did not arrest Sawant,” Dharuman Nimbale, deputy commissioner of police (Ludhiana), told TOI on Tuesday. The police will submit a report before the court during the next hearing on April 10, he added.
 
 Amandeep Singh Brar, assistant commissioner of police (Ludhiana central), said, “The property in Oshiwara, Mumbai, is owned by the actor. However, she does not live there. The police team has taken statements of the neighbours that will be submitted before the court during the next hearing. Further action would be taken as per court orders.”
 
 Satyanarayan Chaudhary, Mumbai deputy commissioner of police (Zone IX), said the actor no longer stays in his jurisdiction that falls between   and Andheri in the western suburbs. “The actor has a flat in the Oshiwara locality of Andheri. However, the flat is rented out and she does not live in it. Also, we don’t know of any team that has sought help to track her down on Tuesday,” said an Oshiwara police officer.
 
 The court had earlier summoned the actor, but she did not turn up. Later, it issued bailable warrants but she failed to appear before it. Following this, the court issued a non-bailable warrant against her. She was also booked in Jalandhar under Indian Penal Code Section 295A for hurting religious sentiments.
