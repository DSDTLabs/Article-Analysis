Following the   terror attack at the   concert, UK visas are now more difficult to get. Two Bengali films,  ' and `Tui Shudhu Amar, will be shot in the UK from June 3 but least 10 technicians are worried about their visas. Although the shoot is not scheduled to be be held in Manchester, UK is under high alert. If visas don't reach technicians on it, the shoot schedule can go haywire.

 With UK visas, typically issued in two weeks, now take around six weeks, the film team fears the blast might delay the process further. Visas of Soham, Om, Mahi and Biswanath Basu have already been granted. But actor Parthsarathi Joardar's visa is pending,“ said producer Himanshu Dhanuka. Chalbaaz stars   and Bangladeshi actot   in the lead. They have recently applied for their visas and will leave for UK on June 19.
 
 Mukherjee's assistant director Rajdeep Ghosh hasn't got his visa yet. “I am supposed to leave on May 25, but I am still awaiting my visa. A second team will leave for June 2, I hope I can make it to the UK with them,“ Ghosh said. Om said, “We will avoid locations close to Manchester."
 
 The mahurat of the film was held on Tuesday and Subhasree took to Twitter to share her excitement.
 
  
  
 We wish the team all the luck!
