THANE: The   has set a target of planting as many as 15 lakh saplings in the district in seven days as part of a  . The   will be carried out from July 1 to July 7.

 The mega drive initiated by state forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar will see a   of four core saplings, out of which the Thane district has been given a target of nine lakh.
 
 The Thane forest department has, however, raised this bar to 15 lakh trees, most of which will be planted in the forest area.
 
 Speaking about the campaign, deputy conservator of forests Jitendra Ramgaokar said, “We have identified a cumulative stretch of 594 hectares of land at 29 locations—including Murbad, Badlapur, Bhiwandi, etc where the drive can take place. While a major part of the drive will be carried out in the forest zone, there are a number of urban and rural pockets that have small vacant spaces as well.”
 
 “Like last year, the forest department will be reaching out to all government bodies, NGOs and citizens to participate in this drive,” he added.
 
 As opposed to buying saplings from nurseries, the Thane forest department, this year, has begun planting seeds of local species and creating saplings which will be used during the mega green campaign.
 
 “We have nine of the department’s own nurseries in Murbad taluka and one nursery in every taluka. We have already begun raising a total of 38 lakh seedlings across these nurseries.’’ 
 
 ‘‘We have ensured that all of these are local plants and 10% of them are fruit-bearing plants. Another 10% are bamboo plants that will be planted in rural pockets and will benefit the locals there economically,” said DCF Ramgaokar.
 
 “Of the 38 lakh saplings, 15 lakh will be planted during this year’s drive, while the other 13 lakh will be used during the 2018 and 2019 drive,” he added.
