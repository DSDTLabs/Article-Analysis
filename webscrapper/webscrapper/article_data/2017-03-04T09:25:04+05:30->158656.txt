BHOPAL: In a bid to get their “message” across, around 25 candidates, who had cleared   attempted to do Veeru act of Sholay by climbing atop a water tank at Jail Road on Friday. Before their grievance could reach officials, cops put them in a van and whisked them to police station, bringing to an end a high-voltage drama. Obviously, their act failed to work with authorities. 

 The protesters were later booked for disrupting security protocol in sensitive area when Assembly session was on.
 
 In April 5, 2015,   had conducted examination through which the appointment of Lekhpal in seven departments of the state government for 2,519 posts was to be done. Result was announced in July the same year. Selected candidates were then appointed in six departments except   ( ), which had 2,208 vacancies for Lekhpals.
 
 To fill up 2,208 posts, counselling began on January 5 this year, but stopped abruptly on January 8. Next round of counselling had begun on February 6 and would continue till March 7 in which only 1,190 are being appointed, said Vinod Dhakad, one of the candidates, who had climbed the water tank. 
 
 The candidates alleged that there was no clarification on 1,000 candidates candidates waiting for posting. They alleged that 151 Lekhpals had already been posted at Rajya Shiksha Kendra (RSK) through back door.
 
 Merit list of previously selected candidates were given to RSK, but now they are making appointment as per new list provided to them, which was the main reason for us to take to water tank, he said. “We are finding it difficult to survive,” said Dhakad. 
 
 The candidates continued to raise slogans against the RSK and the state government while they were being taken to MP Nagar police station.
