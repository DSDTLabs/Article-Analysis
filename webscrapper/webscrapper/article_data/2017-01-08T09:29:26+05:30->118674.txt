DEHRADUN/ROORKEE: Even as   announced his exit as Team India captain in the shorter formats, Uttarakhand lad   made his entry into the team with many claiming that the team may have got a new MSD.

 Both cricketers are from the hill state ­ the parental village of Dhoni is Lvali in Almora while Pant belongs to Roorkee ­ and have quite a few things in common. They are both wicketkeeper-batsmen with an affinity to knock the ball out of the park. They both hail from modest backgrounds and have fought their way into the team after periods of intense struggle.
 
 Most significantly, they both refuse to kneel under pressure. It's a trait which has earned Dhoni the title ' '. Many here are now hoping that Rishabh too goes on to make a mark for himself.
 
 In a recent interview with TOI in December, Pant had termed Dhoni as his role model. Like Dhoni, whose periods of struggle as a railway ticket checker in Kharagpur have been well-documented, Pant too has had his share of ups and downs.
 
 For instance, his father Rajendra recalled that Rishabh used to eat in the Moti Bagh gurdwara in Delhi and sometimes even slept there while preparing for cricket matches on his visit to Delhi from Roorkee. "He has struggled a lot to achieve his dreams," said the father.
 
 Rajendra added that Rishabh had since childhood declared that he would play for the Indian team one day. "He was in the junior school when he came up to me and shared his dream. He has now made it a reality. I am really proud of him," he said.
