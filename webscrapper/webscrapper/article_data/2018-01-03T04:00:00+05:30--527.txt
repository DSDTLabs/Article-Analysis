Surat: Residents of Ramnagar in Rander of the city came out against a councillor and some media people alleging that have taken protection money to support illegal structures in the area. They submitted a complaint with 40 signatures to city BJP unit president Nitin Bhajiyawala. “It is not a complaint against any councillor but agents and anti-social elements. However, we will inquire into the matter,” Bhajiyawala said.

 People alleged that owners of illegal constructions were giving protection money to this particular councillor and thus their properties were not being demolished by the civic body. State government had provided land to refugees in Rander. tnn
