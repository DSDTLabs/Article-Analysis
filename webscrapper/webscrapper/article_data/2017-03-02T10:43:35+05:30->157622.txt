 Donations are no longer being accepted as in a matter of just five days, a total of $6,83,781 was collected. The target was 1,50,000 dollars.
 
 “Some of you shared ideas on starting a charitable foundation to help victims, provide scholarships and celebrate Srinu's life. I will be encouraging Sunayana to do the same as well,“ she said on the platform, announcing that the campaign was closed.
 
 When the campaign was initiated, it was mentioned that the amount was being collected for Sunayana and family `who are now faced with incredible grief and a multitude of expenses'.
 
 Since the family is in grief, Muthuramalingam feels they should be given enough time for themselves and then address issue of the fund.
 
 At Austin's bar and Grille, Olathe, Kansas, Srinivas was allegedly killed by a gunman, Adam Purinton, in what is being probed as a hate crime. Srinivas' friend Alok was also injured. An American Ian Grillot was also injured when he rushed to help the two Indians.

The fund was initiated by Ian's sister Maggie Grillot who lives in Olathe. Ian is still in hospital recovering from a bullet wound.
