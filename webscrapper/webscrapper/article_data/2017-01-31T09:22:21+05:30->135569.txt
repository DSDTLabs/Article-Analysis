CHARMINAR: Space-saving wooden and iron furniture is the new fad in   and it is   that has taken a beating. 

 Willow chairs and cradles can still be seen in a few homes but overall there has been a fall in demand for cane furniture. Lack of interest of customers has forced many   makers to down their shutters.
 
 "I have been making willow furniture for the last 25 years. It was in great demand till some time back, but these days willow furniture business has taken a huge hit from wooden and iron furniture. Due to lack of customer response, many owners are forced to call it a day, leaving scores of workers in the lurch," Syed Ghouse Pasha, a willow furniture maker from Chandraangutta in Old City, told TOI. 
 
 About 10 years ago there were around 50 willow furniture workshops across the city, which now has come down to nearly 15. 
 
 A willow furniture maker makes 300 per day and now workers are making just two to three chairs a day. Work is scarce. Most willow furniture makers now a days sit idle or look for other job opportunities to make ends meet. 
 
 "I am fed up doing this work as there is no growth in this business at all. Nobody is buying. The good old days are gone. I hardly earn anything by making three willow chairs. The amount that I make is insufficient for me to provide for my family and I have no option but to try my hand in something else,'' another furniture worker,   said.
