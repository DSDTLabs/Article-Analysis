GURGAON: Metro services were interrupted on the Yellow line on Sunday afternoon between   and   stations, causing inconvenience to commuters travelling to Gurgaon from the capital. The disruption started around 3pm, and lasted almost five hours.

 Owing to delay in the frequency of trains between the two stations, the number of passengers inside the stations increased substantially. This led to chaos at the Qutub Minar station, as no train was going towards Gurgaon from there. 
 
 As trains took 45-50 minutes to arrive, a lot of commuters had to wait outside the Metro station, trying to look for autorickshaws, cabs and buses. “I was on my way to a family wedding. I had to order a cab, which took more than an hour to arrive. With the increase in demand, there was surge pricing too,” said Yuvraj Singh, who was going to Gurgaon. 
 
 Commuters also complained that Metro officials did not inform commuters about the snag. “They kept announcing that we should wait for the next train, which didn’t arrive. A few minutes later, the place became very suffocating,” said  , who was travelling from Okhla to Sikanderpur. The situation returned to normal by 7.45pm, DMRC officials said.
 
 “Train services on Line 2 were also affected around 3.17pm owing to a problem with the pantograph of a train, which damaged OHE strands while going towards Chattarpur. The affected section was repaired, and in the meantime service was maintained by running trains in loops,” a DMRC spokesperson told TOI.
