Barely four days before the Ghatkopar building crashed, BMC’s ‘N’   officials had visited Sunil Shitap’s premises over his application for cancellation of the maternity home  . This revelation comes at a time when   officials have claimed that there was never any complaint against illegal work in the building. 

 Bhagyashree Kapse, assistant municipal commissioner, N Ward, said, “We received an application from   on June 20 for cancellation of the maternity home licence and as per our procedure we visited the site a month later, on July 21. A report was submitted to us by the   who visited stating that no activity was being carried out in the premises and that the hospital was shut.” Residents, though, said work was on for a fortnight before the crash. A senior civic official said a sanitary inspector is not expected to give a report on renovation. Kapse denied having received any complaint from residents.
