NEW DELHI: Half of Delhi’s   will disappear if the 131 tonnes of dust being generated by the capital each day is tackled, Union environment minister Harsh Vardhan said on Thursday ahead of the launch of the “Clean Air for Delhi” campaign.

 The two-week campaign will run from February 10-23. The minister said that the exercise is not merely symbolic, but a serious effort to drastically bring down pollution levels in the city.
 
 Seventy joint teams of officials from the ministry of environment, CPCB, Delhi government, DPCC and corporations will set out in different parts of the capital once the campaign kicks off. The teams would monitor causes of pollution, initiating remedial measures and issuing penalties against offenders.
 
 The campaign however comes at a point when Delhi’s air quality has improved to around two times the safe standard. Delhi saw its worst pollution period this season from November 7-13 when it recorded seven straight days of “severe” air quality with an AQI over 400. The AQI on Wednesday was recorded at 288, which is classified as “poor”.
 
 Anumita Roy Chowdhury of CSE, meanwhile, feels Delhi needs more concerted efforts and the campaign can provide that, if it is continued in the same way and spreads across other states as well. “The ministry needs to step up their action and build support in the form of stakeholders so there is better coordination. It can only be effective if it becomes a nationwide campaign and long term efforts are put in,” said Chowdhury.
