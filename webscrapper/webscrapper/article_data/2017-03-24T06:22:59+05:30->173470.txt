JAIPUR: Overlapping of health   introduced by chief minister   and former chief minister   has forced the health officials to issue new directions to prevent “duplication”.

 IN 2009, Gehlot had launched Mukhya Mantri BPL   (MMJRK) for BPL families. 
 
 Under the scheme, the BPL patients are still getting free medicines and free diagnostic facilities in out-patient department. But, Raje’s flagship scheme —   (BSBY) —launched in 2013 benefits BPL patients admitted to government as well as private hospitals.
 
 National Health Mission (NHM) mission director and secretary to government, medical, health & family welfare department, Navin Jain said, “We are not going to stop MMJRK. We are just finding ways to prevent duplication in the two schemes.”
 
 However, the MMJRK provides free treatment to BPL patients at OPD. But, in BSBY, the BPL patients get benefit only after getting admitted to the hospital. “At  , the MMJRK scheme will continue to benefit the BPL patients. We are conducting a study on all these aspects to prevent duplication in two schemes when a BPL patient gets admitted to the hospital,” Jain said.
 
 At present, the hospitals have two options of schemes — BSBY and MMJRK, under which a BPL patient gets benefit. Now, the health department is planning to give only one option, which is BSBY to the hospital. Under BSBY, insurance companies pay the bill of the patient, while under MMJRK, medical relief committees spent on treatment of BPL.
