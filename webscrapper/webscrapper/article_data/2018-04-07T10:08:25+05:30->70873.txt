AHMEDABAD: A team of Mehsana police arrested a couple from Sabarmati in connection with the murder of a senior citizen early in March. The murder had taken place over a debt of Rs 50,000 incurred by the accused, said investigators.

 According to Mehsana police, the body of a woman in late fifties was found near railway lines on   in Kadi town on March 9. As the victim’s identity could not be established, the body was sent to Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad, for forensic postmortem and strangulation was established as cause of death.
 
 “The case remained unsolved for long as the victim’s identity could not be established. Nearby districts were intimated about the find. Using both human and technical intelligence, it was eventually established that the victim was Jiviben Patel, 60, a resident of Ranip,” said an investigator.
 
 Investigators then learned that Patel used to lend money. They then started probing those connected with her and got details about  , a resident of Sabarmati, and his wife Valiben. Salat had taken Rs 50,000 from Patel and did not have means to pay the interest or principal amount. Working on a tip-off, police apprehended the duo and also recovered Patel’s ornaments from them.
 
 “Salat told us that he had asked Patel to accompany him and his wife to Kadi to get money and got her from Acher to Chhatral. Near cotton market on the highway, she was strangled to death and her body was later dumped near Kadi so to evade detection,” said an official.
