BENGALURU: Prof  , who has been closely studying Indian politics for over four decades, said the   in several states have begun to accommodate Dalits and make adjustments, but there is no change of heart as yet.

 Stating that he has visited more than 12 states, Manor, professor at the  , University of London, said if increasing dependence on   has seen political parties negotiate for better treatment in some form, laypersons have come to ac commodate Dalits as they find violence too expensive. There is status quo of some sort, he said, but the general way in which a Dalit is looked upon has not changed.
 
 He said: “What Gandhi wanted to achieve with the villages has not been achieved, but what Ambedkar wanted to achieve through law and police has been somewhat achieved.“ He said his tours have revealed that today, elders from both the oppressed and other castes are working together to maintain civility.
