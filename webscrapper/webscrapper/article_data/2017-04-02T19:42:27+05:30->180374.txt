 "The whole country is united against terrorism. The Muslims have realised that terrorism is an attempt to defame Islam," he told reporters here when asked about the violence perpetrated by militants in   and Kashmir.
 
 He said the security forces were giving befitting reply to militants who are creating trouble in  .
 
 The Home Minister had on Friday said that Pakistan was using the social media to incite youths in Kashmir to storm encounter sites and help holed-up militants.
 
 The strife-torn region had seen a "new trend" of late in which youths from nearby villages gather at the sites of encounter between security forces and terrorists and pelt stones to help the militants escape, he had said.
 
 The Home Minister and Defence and Finance Minister   had also held a high-level meeting on Friday to review security situation in Jammu and Kashmir.
 
 Director General of Jammu and Kashmir Police S P Vaid had said on Thursday that youths who storm the encounter sites in the Valley to hurl stones at security personnel are committing suicide.
 
 Last month, Army Chief General Bipin Rawat had said that local Kashmiri people creating hurdles by throwing stones at the security personnel during anti-terror operations will be dealt as anti-nationals and will face "harsh" actions.
