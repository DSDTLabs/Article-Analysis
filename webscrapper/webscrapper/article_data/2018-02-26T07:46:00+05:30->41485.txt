Amritsar: Cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu visited children who were injured in Saturday’s cylinder blast at the private hospital where they are being treated. He announced that the state government would bear the medical expenses. 

 On Saturday, 11 persons, including eight children, were injured after a gas cylinder used to fill gas in balloons exploded at Ghanpur Kale village during the annual fair of Baba Darshan Singh.
 
 "It was very sad to see children injured. I met them and assured them that the state government would pay all expenses. Even post-treatment, if any equipment is needed to ensure a smooth life for them, the government will provide it,” said Sidhu.
 
 On Sunday, Sidhu also inaugurated “Listening Ears,” a centre that helps with early intervention for hearing-impaired and uniquely abled children. He spent some time with special children at the centre and interacted with the families. He said such places are doing a great service to people.
 
 According to him, there are about 12,000 hearing impaired children in Punjab and places like these could be a game-changer for them. "These children are very special. They do not need sympathy. They need full respect and equality and we must ensure we stand by them in thick and thin,” he said. He also announced a grant of Rs 5 lakh for their needs. 
 
 Mourns Sridevi 
 
 On the demise of Bollywood icon Sridevi, Najot Singh Sidhu said she ruled the film industry by dint of merit for decades. “This is a national loss and the void created by her demise can never be filled,” he said, describing her as a jewel of the likes of Kohinoor.
