LUDHIANA: An NGO has brought relief to three convicts, who were forced to remain in jail even after completing their jail term. Apparently, the three persons failed to pay their respective fine amount and hence were not being released. The NGO paid off their fine amount and helped them come out of the prison.

 President of the NGO advocate   said that one of the convicts, Rajan, was in the jail as he was failed to pay a fine of Rs 12,300. It is because of this amount, Ranjan had to spend another year in the jail.
 
 “Another inmate,  , was also forced to stay in the prison because he did not have any relatives to pay his fine worth Rs 2,900,” Singh said.
 
 “Similarly   was being forced to stay in the prison till March as he failed to pay fine of Rs 2,900,” he said.
 
 Deputy superintendent   said that the members of the organisation have paid the fines of inmates, who were unable to pay due to poverty. “More people should come forward to help such inmates,” he said.
