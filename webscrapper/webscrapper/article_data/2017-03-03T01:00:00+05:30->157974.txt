 received death threat from an unidentified caller on Wednesday, demanding that `50 lakh be deposited in a Lucknow-based bank’s branch. Reportedly, he threatened to kill the filmmaker and his family, including his daughter   and wife  , if they failed to meet the demand. 
Bhatt Sr lodged a complaint at the Juhu Police station, after which he also tweeted about the threat and timely help by the cops. The tweet reads, “A bolt from the blue in the form of an extortion call & threat to my family was nipped in the bud by the MH & UP police in tandem. Gratitude!” (sic).
 His post was retweeted by his eldest daughter Pooja. Later, Bhatt Sr was flooded with calls and messages from well-wishers. Later, he tweeted again, connecting this to the collective threat against his family — ‘All of us is better than one of us !!’
 When we contacted the Juhu Police Station, Rajendra Pawar, Police Naik, Crime Branch, said, “Investigations are on and we will be able to give news on the culprit by today evening.”
 The latest threat comes two years after a group of 13 people were arrested on November 2014 for plotting to kill Mahesh Bhatt. 
 When contacted, Bhatt refrained from saying anything more than he had already shared online.
