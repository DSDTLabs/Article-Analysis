AHMEDABAD:   (GU) authorities on Wednesday announced the cancellation of its   scheduled for January 10, after the chief guest home minister   became unavailable to attend it.

 M N Patel, vice chancellor of GU, on Tuesday said the convocation was cancelled and the new date would be declared later.

 As the home minister is next to the Prime Minister in the hierarchy, he will have to stay in Delhi to manage the country’s affairs. Besides this, Gujarat governor O P Kohli, who is GU chancellor, and education minister  , will both be attending VGGS, so they will not be able to come to GU’s convocation, sources said.

 The printing of the 50,000-odd degree certificates will be started after the new convocation date is fixed.
