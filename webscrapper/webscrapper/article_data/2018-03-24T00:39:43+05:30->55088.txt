In a series of educational reforms that the Tamil Nadu government has been working on to implement from the next academic year, the school education department will be embedding QR codes in books for   students. One tablet will be provided for every five students in all government elementary schools across the state from the academic year 2018-19.

 "It is to inculcate   with a child-friendly pedagogy," said a senior official from Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), the body in-charge of implementing the changes across the state. 
 
 The official said changes were being made almost half a decade after the implementation of Simplified Activity Based Learning â€“ Active Learning Methodology (SABL-ALM). "With more than 70% of 37,999 government schools in the state having only two teachers, the students are forced to wait for the availability of cards of SABL-ALM as only a set of cards are distributed per school and duplication of the cards is not possible," the official said. The QR code and tablets will ensure the students can access lessons online without any delay. 
 
 To check feasibility of the new technology 826 elementary schools in 14 districts have been selected where tablets were distributed, the official added. Based on the funds granted, tablets would be issued to all the elementary schools in a phased manner, the official said.
