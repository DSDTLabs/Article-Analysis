BHOPAL: City girl Bandana Kumari blends spirituality with colours. She says painting is like music that flows like a river, the clearer the heart of the painter, the more melodious and shiny their paintings become. The artist, who fell in love with colours and wanted to sketch various shades of the human psyche with them, is all set to hold her next exhibition in   from July 22. Her journey started as a teenager.

 “I am an ardent believer in the panch-tatva theory. The human body comprises the five elements of nature: air, water, earth, fire and space. My paintings also have an earthly touch. Not all humans are spiritually and intellectually awakened. At times, the animal instincts creep inside their mind. I find that extremely interesting and convey those dark shades through colours,” Kumari said.
 
 Kumari has a bachelor degree in fine arts and has won several painting competitions. She travels around different cities and exhibits her paintings.
 
 Staring July 22, the young artist is exhibiting her art work themed ‘Hidden Aspects’. The exhibits will be about symbolic and mythical representations of women as the strongest creatures on earth. Elucidating the symbolism in her paintings, she said: “I present women as the strongest creature of the God. I have shown women as a birds, moon, stars etc. In the present scenario, when we witness so many cases of crime against women, I wish to convey the message more loudly.”
 
 Bandana has won several awards, including the   from Lucknow, Bihar State Award, Bihar Yuwa Kalakar Samman. Her paintings are displayed at the Konsult Art Gallery -New Delhi, D P   –Srinagar and West Zone Cultural Centre- Udaipur among others.
