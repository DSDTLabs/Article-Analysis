NEW DELHI: After China strongly protested the presence of a Taiwanese parliamentary delegation in India, the government sought to soothe Beijing saying that political meanings should not be read into the visit by an “informal” group. 

 China had earlier objected to the visit by a delegation of women parliamentarians from Taiwan asking New Delhi to be more “prudent” in its dealings with Taiwan. Beijing had only last week forced US President   to endorse US’ ‘One China’ policy, bringing to an end the ambiguous position which Trump had earlier sought to maintain. 
 
 MEA described the visiting group as that of Taiwanese academics and business persons, including “a couple of legislators’’. “Such informal groups have visited India in the past as well for business, religious and tourist purposes,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Vikas   said.
 
 “I understand that they do so to China as well. There is nothing new or unusual about such visits and political meanings should not be read into them,” Swarup added. India’s reaction came after Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson   said his government had lodged a diplomatic protest with India for hosting a Taiwanese parliamentary delegation. 
 
 “We are always opposed to any forms of official contacts and exchanges between countries that have diplomatic ties with China and Taiwan (simultaneously) and we are also opposed to the establishment of any official institutions,” he said responding to Taiwan's announcement that it plans to upgrade its office in India. Geng said, “the Indian side has made a commitment on the Taiwan-related issues.”
 
  A three-member women’s parliamentary delegation from Taiwan visited India earlier this week amidst signals of increasing engagement between the two sides. Taiwan currently has a Taipei Economic and Cultural Centre located in New Delhi. India’s office in Taiwan is called India-Taipei Association.
