MUMBAI: Most of the city’s   are, rather unsurprisingly, to be found in ‘A’ ward, which comprises the popular shopping alleys of   and Fashion Street, and two of the city’s busiest stations, namely   and Churchgate. Little wonder then that residents believe they are worst affected by non-implementation of the government’s hawking policy. 

 The hawking policy was cleared by the state cabinet in the first week of January. Under the policy, every urban local body will have to form a town vending committee and conduct surveys, demarcate zones into hawking, no-hawking and restricted hawking ones, besides alloting pitches to hawkers. However, the town vending committee is yet to be formed.
 
 ‘A’ ward resident and NAGAR trustee, Nayana Kathpalia, said the entire Fort area, right from CST, is taken over by hawkers. “The hawking policy is still on the table of the state government and nothing is now likely to happen till the elections are over. One finds hawkers have only proliferated in the ward over the past few years. It clearly appears hawkers find this ward highly lucrative considering it’s a commercial hub as well. There was a point when hawkers at Fashion Street had taken over the maidan too and we had to get them out,” said Kathpalia.
 
 Activist Gerson da Cunha, a resident of Churchgate, too said hawkers have become a major problem. “There is no containing their numbers. In the ward, this has reached a stage where it is difficult for residents to walk on pavements,” said da Cunha.
 
 Nariman Point Churchgate Citizens’ Association vice-president   reiterated that the absence of a hawker policy does affect residents. “Every building in the ward seems to have to guard its front portion considering the manner in which hawkers are proliferating,” he said.
