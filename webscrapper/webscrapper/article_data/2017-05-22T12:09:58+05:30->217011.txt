AURANGABAD:   in   and many others parts of the city was severely disrupted on Sunday due to power failure at Jayakwadi dam. In other localities, residents received tap water for a very short period that too at low pressure.

 Municipal authorities said that power supply failed twice in the morning because of which quantity of water reaching the city dropped significantly. Although authorities claimed to have restored water supply by 11.30am they could not prevent shortfall of water. According to a rough estimate, the city could receive only 95-100 MLD water against the normal demand of about 130-135 MLD.
 
 People in many localities faced severe   throughout the day as most of the elevated storage reservoirs (ESRs) could not be filled. “Power supply went off at Jayakwadi on two different occasions. Thus, both the main pipe lines (1400 mm and 700 mm thickness) were non-functional. We could not operate all the heavy duty pumps and this created a big gap in supply and demand of water in the city,” said U G Shirsat, deputy engineer in the   (AMC).
 
 Shirsat, however, said the impact of the power failure would not last till Monday. “The system has been restored and consumers will start receiving tap water. There might be delay in some parts,” he said.
 
 Power failure at Jayakwadi is one of the perennial problems that affect the water supply system. It has become a routine affair especially during May and June when the demand for water is at its peak. In addition to this, it takes hours to normalise even if the power supply fails for a very short time.
 
 Meanwhile,  , a housewife, told TOI that disruption in water supply has become a perennial problem. “The municipal authorities pass the buck on the power distribution company,” she said.
