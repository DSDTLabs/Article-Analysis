Chennai: Cab aggregators Ola and Uber are allegedly changing their incentive pattern so fast that drivers are finding it difficult to catch up. Just this week, incentives at Uber changed to Rs 1,800 for 48 trips from Rs 2,400 for 40 trips. At Ola, drivers say even if they work from 3 AM - 12 midnight it would still be impossible to achieve their new targets. Such changes come in the light of drivers going on strike en masse in Bengaluru. Chennai also saw a strike with smaller strength in February. For instance, in the case of Vivek Krishnan (32). “Last January, I was earning as much as Rs 75,000 - Rs 1 lakh a month working 12-13 hours a day with Ola. But this January, I have to work nearly 15-16 hours a day and I’m barely making Rs 40,000-45,000 a month,” said Krishnan. Ola and Uber did not respond to requests for comment. In the current scheme, Ola drivers get Rs 1,500 (minus operating expenses, 20% Ola commission) if they do trips worth Rs 800. For Rs 1,500 worth trips, the incentive is Rs 1,800; for Rs 2,300 its Rs 4,750; for Rs 2,550 its Rs 5,570.  Ola driver C Parthiben said, “It is near impossible for anyone to do Rs 2,550 worth trips given city traffic and the number of trips. An average trip of 7-10 kms in Chennai traffic takes 45 mins. Now that means we can on average do only 13 trips even if we worked 16 hours. Also minus operating expenses and Ola’s commission, we only get a half of the incentive.” Even in the trip-based incentive model, drivers say the targets are too high. For 7 trips, the incentive is Rs 1,200 and it goes upwards to Rs 2,000 for 11 trips; Rs 3,500 for 15 and Rs 4,750 for 18 trips. On days, when the model shifts to tariff from trip-based, city drivers have now resorted to paying their customers to achieve targets. For instance, one driver paid Rs 140 to his customer so that he could achieve his target of Rs 2,300 for the night. “It was 11.30 PM and the driver said it would be very difficult for him to get another ride and achieve his target by midnight, so he paid me extra so that he could drive for some more kilometres before cutting the trip. In the last one month, this is the third time a driver is paying me money to achieve targets,” said a commuter. The tightening of screws in the last few months, seems to paying dividends to long-time player Meru. The cab company, which on average on-boarded 1,000 drivers a month has been witnessing a steady increase in the last six months. In March alone, as many as 12,000 drivers joined Meru ranks. Meru CEO Nilesh Sangoi said, “The need for incentives come up because of rates offered to the consumer. The rates are kept below cost price, fuel cost, maintenance, licensing cost and insurance; barring this money needs to be give to the aggregator. Now if the driver needs to take home money, the rate cannot be less than Rs 14-15 per km. In the fight for market share, unrealistic incentives were doled out. What is needed is a price that works for both the consumer and driver.” In 2014 for a short span of time Meru also tried the incentive model, but withdrew it. “Our drivers make a minimum of Rs 2,500 per day from commuters. In certain cities they can earn more than Rs 3,000. The top 10% of our drivers earn over Rs 85,000-90,000 per month.” Uber’s car finance scheme is proving to be a trap for some drivers. “I am the owner of my car, so I can leave the platform anytime I choose. But several of my friends, who have come from remote villages in Tamil Nadu, have taken cars on lease from Uber. They are now stuck as they can't leave till the loan is fully repaid,” said a Uber driver in the city.
