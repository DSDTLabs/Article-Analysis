 A division bench headed by Chief Justice Subhro Kamal Mukherjee passed the order after the government advocate informed the court that the government is neither conducting nor sponsoring the event on January 15.
 
 Counsel for Shanthinagar MLA N A Harris informed the court that a proposal was mooted to conduct the event and it has been kept in abeyance. The bench ordered notice to the BBMP on the PIL filed by C Dinakar, former DG&IG of the state.
 
 The petitioner claimed that the proposed festival on the 100 Feet Road â€” an arterial road for residents of KR Puram, Whitefield, and runs through a residential area would cause inconvenience to the public, throw life out of gear, apart from causing damage to the road as shamianas and stalls would be put up. 
 
 He said the Shanthinagar MLA organizing this festival has no jurisdiction as the area does not fall under his constituency. Indiranagar residents, represented by many associations, had last month voiced their opposition to the event.Already angry about the commercialization of the area, residents feared the event would lead to traffic snarls. iChange Indiranagar, which represents members of eight RWAs, had written several letters regarding the event to the BBMP and the tourism ministry . An interaction in December which involved citizens and civic officials failed to address the residents' concerns. They reiterated their fears that the event would only glorify 100 Feet Road, which had become very commercialized.
