CHANDIGARH: The   on Sunday alleged that the Congress government’s four months in the state had brought no respite to   and as many as 129 of them had committed suicide during this period. The BJP vice-president, Harjit Singh Grewal, and secretary Vineet Joshi released a ‘report card’ of Amarinder’s fourth month in office.

 “While the chief minister betrayed farmers by not waiving their loans even after making an announcement during the budget session, the cooperative societies and small banks have come on the verge of being shut down as they haven’t received the loan amounts either from the government or farmers. Weather also played havoc with farmers as thousands of acres of farmland lie submerged under water,” said the BJP leaders. 
 
 “Backing out from his promise of full loan waiver, first Amarinder announced a partial loan waiver in the vidhan sabha and later finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal allocated a meager Rs 1,500 crore in the budget, but ever since that the government hasn’t given anything in writing to the banks. Till the government gives it in writing to the banks, the loans will not be waived. Even Manpreet has stated that this will take at least two months. Then why make false announcements,” asked Grewal and Joshi.
 
 Leaders of the BJP said that, “Over 129 farmers have committed suicide during Capt’s 120 days of rule. What is more disturbing is that after the CM made the announcement of partial loan waiver in the assembly instead of full loan waiver, as promised by him during elections, 49 farmers have ended their lives. Citing the poor financial condition of the state, Capt has shown helplessness to waive these loans completely, but what about such promises where huge finances are not involved.”
