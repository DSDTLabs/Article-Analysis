She met senior academics and reportedly suggested IISER teachers be encouraged to stay on the institute’s Kalyani campus with their families.

Mukhopadhyay will give her detailed feedback to IISER on each of these issues.
 
 A wary IISER had asked all 170 students who were set to appear for their mathematics paper on Thursday to take a break if they wanted to.

However, all three batchmates implicated in the FIR in connection to Sagar’s death took the test. 
 
 CPM MP Ritabrata Bandopadhyay on Thursday reached out to the victim’s family — on the day Sagar’s shradh ceremony was being held at his home. The local Trinamool Congress leadership also reached out to the family by promising them a home under the Geetanjali scheme and a job for Sagar’s elder sister Rekha.
