PANAJI: The   has asked Tata Consultancy Services ( ) to develop an app for smartphones so that monthly   bills can be sent to power consumers in Goa through the app. Consumers will also be able to pay the bills through the app, said power minister Pandurang Madkaikar on Wednesday.

 “We have appointed Tata Consultancy Services to develop an app so that customers can get the   on the mobile and the bill can be paid from the mobile itself. The online system already exists but with the app, it will be much easier for customers,” Madkaikar said.
 
 The power minister accepted that the online bill   facility had yet to reach all corners of Goa and that digital infrastructure remained incomplete.
 
 “The online system is not ready. Once the system is completed, then the online payment will be rolled out across Goa,” the minister said. He stated that local industries and users of high tension electricity connections were already getting their bills online.
 
  “For them bills are generated online and delivered to them. The meter reading is also done online,” Madkaikar said.
 
 Madkaikar said that the state had sufficient power supply but due to inadequate or old infrastructure, certain parts of the state face power problems.
