NEW DELHI: AIMIM president   today said that the Supreme Court verdict, in the   dispute, will be based on evidence and not on religious belief even as he reaffirmed his commitment to the construction of   at the disputed site.

 
 "Our mosque was, is, and will 'inshallah' (God willing) be once again constructed at the same place, when the Supreme Court delivers the verdict in our favour. I am confident that the verdict will be based on evidence and not on the basis of religious beliefs," Owaisi said while speaking at an event in Delhi.
 
  
  
 The AIMIM president said that Muslims will never relinquish their claim to construct a mosque at the disputed site in Ayodhya.
 
 "The people who are trying to frighten us and are raising their voice against our 'shariat', asking us to leave the site. I want to tell them we will never leave our mosque...," Owaisi said.
 
 Owaisi also targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and questioned his association with Gitanjali Gems owner Mehul Choski, who is one of the accused in the multi-crore Punjab National Bank scam.
 
 "People, who call us Pakistani, I would like to question them if Harshad Mehta, Ketan Parekh, Nirav Modi were Muslims? The people who our Prime Minister calls 'Bhai' have robbed our country," said Owaisi.
  
 The leader further said the Muslims in India are being reduced to second-class citizens.
 
 "We believe in the idea of 'Hindu-Muslim Bhai', but this has never helped us. The country is now heading towards a Hindutva country. We (Indian Muslims) are being reduced to second-class citizens in this country," Owaisi added.
