Shreeranjani, a Chennaiite and an associate of Selvaraghavan, is making her debut in   with the film Rangula Ratnam, which has Raj Tarun, Chitra Shukla and   in lead roles. “Though the film revolves around a mother, her son and his lover, it has a multitude of emotions — mother sentiment, friendship, romance, brother-sister sentiment,” says the director, who has worked with   for nine years, right from his 7/G,   days.

 Congratulating his associate, the director had tweeted the trailer of the film on Wednesday, and   says that his wishes meant more than the trailer’s release itself. “I was doing BCom in SIET, but since mine was an evening course, I worked for an European Tamil channel in the morning. Selva sir had come as a guest and that is how I got introduced to him and began assisting him,” she 
 recalls.
 
 Quiz her why she chose to make her film in Telugu first, and she says, “I was initially planning to make it in Tamil, but things were not working out. That is when cinematographer Madhie sir, who heard the story, suggested that I make it in Tollywood. And art director   sir put me through to Nagarjuna’s production house. They liked the script and agreed to make it in Telugu.” She admits that she still hopes of making it in Tamil as well. “Let’s wait and see how it does in Telugu before thinking about a Tamil remake. But I’m confident that it will work in Telugu,” she signs off on a hopeful note.
