HYDERABAD: Blaming the opposition parties for washout of the Budget session of the Parliament, Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Panchayat Raj, Parushottam Rupala, said despite the government being ready for debate and discussion on issues such as granting of special category status for Andhra Pradesh, Opposition parties, including Congress disrupted the session.

 Addressing party leaders and workers during the ‘oneday fast to save democracy’ taken up by Secunderabad MP and former union minister Bandaru Dattatreya coinciding with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s oneday fast in Delhi, Rupala said the Opposition parties were trying to destablise the government. He called upon the party leaders to expose the true colours of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha.
 
 At the event, Dattatreya said it was historic that a prime minister, annoyed with the way the entire session of Parliament got disrupted, sat on a day-long fast.
 
 Stating that Parliament is a sacred place for Indian democracy, Dattatreya said unfortunately both   (TDP) and Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) fell into the trap of   and did not allow the Lok Sabha to conduct business. While the Congress, TDP and TRS are family parties, BJP is the only party that has the true spirit of democracy, he said.
 
 Addressing the gathering, Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president K Laxman said some political parties were trying to destabilise the NDA government by creating disturbances like communal clashes and violence in the country.
 
 BJP floor leader G Kishan Reddy, Hyderabad BJP president N Ramchander Rao, Khairtabad MLA Chintala Ramachandra Reddy, BJYM president Bharat Goud and party leaders Baddam Bal Reddy, Chinta Sambamurty and Venkata Ramani were among others present at the event.
