NOIDA: A 23-year-old man has been found in Nepal, more than a month after he had gone   from the Yamuna expressway. 

 According to preliminary investigation,  , a CA student, had gone to Nepal on his own and was teaching children in a school when he was traced.
 
 Shubham’s sister Richa Maheshwari tweeted: “Good News: We were successful in #findingShubham yesterday evening. I sincerely thank you for helping us in this period of distress.”
 
 
  
 Shubham had boarded a bus from Anand Vihar to his hometown Hathras at 6.50am on February 18. He last called his mother around 9.30am from the Jewar toll plaza on the Yamuna expressway where the bus had halted for a tea break. However, after that his mobile phone was switched off.
 
 When Shubham had not reached home, the family members launched a search. The family first filed a complaint at the Shakarpur police station in Delhi. The following day an FIR was registered at the Jewar police station in G B Nagar. During investigation the Jewar cops found that the phone was switched off around 10.05 am and the location was tracked to the Tappal area of Aligarh. A Jewar police team visited several neighbouring districts and also in Lucknow to trace him.
 
 Sujata Singh, SP (rural) G B Nagar, said Shubham visited Lucknow and from there he went to Nepal. “Now the student’s family members are in touch with him. They visited Nepal and they are on their way back to Hathras. I have talked to his family members. They will visit Noida with the student soon. We will talk to him and then share more information,” she said.
 
 Ambrish Maheshwari, Shubham's father, confirmed his son’s return but turned down requests to share any more details. “The family members have not talked to him about the sequence of incident. We are not in a condition to share the details right now,” he said.
 
 Shubham’s family members and friends had launched a social media campaign with the hashtag #findingShubham on Facebook and Twitter.
