Every   should realise that if you don’t ponder and decide what is necessary for the country and the society and if you don’t  , then you don’t have the moral or ethical right to question if they do something wrong later. You should realise that every policy decision made by the people you elect affects every single second of your life. So you are in politics, whether you know it or not and that is the place where you need to understand whether you should demand a change or not. One should understand the present political situation, where as much as parties and leaders since independence have been corrupt, we citizens are also responsible for the system to become corrupt in the first place. This is done by either taking sides and money or because you know them or because you have decided not to vote, where you have let someone come to rule you and command every second of your life without your permission. It is very important for us now in   not to have a fractured assembly and for you to realise what are the most dangerous things today and bring them down one by one. You have the power to stop one person, and you also have the power to tell the other person coming in that you can change him too. It isn’t just one day but one must be continuously politically active for the next five years as a citizen. One must question whoever comes to power, because in this country, the voters are the majority and all political parties and their followers are a minority. As long as you don’t have the power to tell them that they are answerable and accountable, they won’t do their jobs.
