NEW DELHI: While thousands of   are sitting on a dharna demanding regularisation and other service benefits, the cash-strapped north corporation and east corporation is expected to cut their engagement with the   for the next four months.

 “The contracts of the breeding checkers with the civic body are slated to be over by March 31. We are planning to re-engage them when the monsoon season arrives in July. A lot of money is wasted on the checkers as fumigation is not required during this season. As we are undergoing an acute salary crisis, this will help us a lot in terms of revenue,” a senior north corporation official, privy to the move, said.
 
 The   (DBCs) have been sitting on a dharna outside the civic centre for last six days. Corporation officials said that the current strike has been called to build pressure on the civic body to discontinue this plan.
 
  and   have not been able to pay salaries of 55,000 employees from January and December onwards, respectively. There are 3,500 mosquito-breeding checkers engaged with the three civic bodies as daily-wage labourers. They are not only entrusted with the task of checking the breeding sites such as water coolers, fountains, water tanks inside houses, but also work in fumigation drives supervised by the anti-malaria staff.
 
 Delhi is expecting a surge in mosquito-borne disease and courts have been coming down heavily on the civic bodies for laxity. Over 15 dengue cases have been reported so far in the capital. DBC workers, who form the primary foot soldiers of the corporation in the fight against the mosquito-borne diseases, argue that they are an exploited lot. “We are demanding regularisation, leave, provident funds, bonus and other medical facilities through this strike. Some of us have been working with corporation for over two decades. Where else can they go?” members of Anti-Malaria Ekta Union argued.
