Erode: The spot death of a 28-year-old woman after a private   ran over her at Perumalmalai sparked tension on the Erode-Bhavani highway near Chithode on Friday morning. People pelted private buses with stones and thrashed the bus driver involved in the  . 

 The deceased has been identified as G Kowsalya of Amaravathi Nagar in R N Pudur near Bhavani. She was a house wife and her husband Gnanasekaran is a daily wage labourer. 
 
 On Friday morning, Gnanasekaran was on way to drop his daughter in a private school in a motorbike with Kowsalya riding pillion. 
 
 When they neared Perumalmalai, a speeding car hit the bike from behind. “While all the three fell on the road, Kowsalya was run over by a private bus coming in the opposite direction,” the Chithode police said. Kowsalya died on the spot and the other two sustained major injuries.
 
 Meanwhile, a few people who witnessed the accident severely beat the bus driver, P Sampath, 41. They also threw stones at the bus and damaged the windshields. A few minutes later, seven other buses belonging to the same private company that came on the road were also damaged by the public. They also deflated the tyres of all the buses. 
 
 Later, the protesters sat on the Erode-Bhavani state highway demanding action against the bus driver for causing the accident. They also demanded the district administration to construct a bridge or to lay a speed-breaker to avoid accident at Perumalmalai.
 
 The Chithode police rushed to the spot and initiated peace talks with the protesters. They also promised to lay a speed- breaker. Convinced over this, the protesters withdrew their protest. The traffic on the stretch was resumed after two hours. A case was registered against Sampath and was arrested for causing the accident.
