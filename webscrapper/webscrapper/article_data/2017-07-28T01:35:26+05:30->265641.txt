NEW DELHI: An applicant to a BCom (Hons) course at DU’s Swami Shraddhanand   was allegedly sent back on Thursday for failing to submit an income certificate to “corroborate his status as a non-creamy layer   student”.

  officials said the move was “not within the law” and colleges were not required to ask for income certificates.
 
 The aspirant, Gopal Swami, reached the college on Thursday after making the cut in the seventh list, only to be asked by the administration to submit an income certificate. “The non-creamy layer category was already mentioned in my certificate. I had to then rush to the SDM office to get a proforma and will visit the college again on Friday for admission,” said Swami 
 
 College principal PV Khatri said that he was unaware of Swami’s case. “However, we were demanding an income certificate so undeserving candidates do not get the benefit”.
