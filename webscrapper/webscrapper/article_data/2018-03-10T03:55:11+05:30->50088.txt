NEW DELHI: The opening week of second leg of budget session was washed out as both Houses of   did not transact any business for the fifth day in a row on Friday. Following unabated protests from various political parties including two allies of NDA—TDP and AIADMK—Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day soon after it met in the morning and the   was adjourned in the afternoon.

 “One week has gone waste. This is no good. This is sad,” Vice-President and Rajya Sabha Chairman M   said. 
 
 But this did not have any impact on the protesting members, who trooped into the well. Soon after the House resumed in the afternoon, some of the members started shouting slogans and rushed into the well. Deputy chairman P J Kurien was forced to adjourn the proceedings of private members’ bill.
 
 While opposition Congress and Trinamool Congress were up in arms against the government over the Rs 12,700 crore Punjab National Bank fraud, TDP and YSR Congress continued to press for special status to be granted to Andhra Pradesh. The TDP had on Thursday pulled out its two ministers from the Narendra Modi government, though the party continues to be an NDA ally.
 
 The members of AIADMK continued their demand for setting up of the Cauvery Board to settle water disputes with neighbouring states in both the Houses while few others were seen holding placards of Dravidian movement founder Thanthai Periyar, whose statue was defaced recently in Tamil Nadu. 
 
 When the   met for the day, Speaker   welcomed a parliamentary delegation from South Korea. Tributes were also paid to three former members who died recently. Soon thereafter, the protesting members trooped into the well carrying placards and raising slogans. 
 
 Members from AIADMK, TDP and YSR Congress were in the well holding placards.
