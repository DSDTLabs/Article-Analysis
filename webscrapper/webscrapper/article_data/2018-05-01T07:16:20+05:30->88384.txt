KOCHI: Putting an end to the controversy that no CPM leader visited the house of S R Sreejith, who died in police custody on April 9, the party state secretary   visited Sreejith's kin on Monday.   was in   to attend the political explanatory meeting of the party. He met Sreejith's father, mother, wife Akhila and daughter Aryananda. The family conveyed to him that the RTF personnel who took   into custody assaulted him badly at the house itself. 

 Balakrishnan said that the government should announce financial aid to the family of the deceased and adopt a positive approach on giving government job to Sreejith's wife Akhila. On chief minister   not visiting the victim's family despite being in Kochi on Saturday, he said, "It may not be intentional wherein the CM did not visit the house of Sreejith". 
 
 "Sreejith's death is unfortunate. CPM is with the victims and not with the hunters. The court will decide whether CBI should probe the case," he told reporters. He also visited the house of Vasudevan, who committed suicide following a gang attack at his house. Sreejith was nabbed alleging connection with  's death.
