NEW DELHI: In a new subsidy for low-end power consumers, the Delhi government has decided to give those consuming till 100 units per month an additional discount of Rs 100 on the overall electricity bill. This is in addition to a Rs 2/unit subsidy that will now be provided to every domestic consumer using till 400 units. 

 The Rs 100-discount is expected to benefit about 12 lakh consumers, said a source. The discoms claim up to 41 lakh consumers get subsidy benefits in the city. For consumers who use up to 200 units, the rate will be Re 1 per unit. From 201-400 units, it will be Rs 2.50. No subsidy will be given to the consumers using over 400 units.
 
 According to a government statement, the cabinet on Wednesday approved the power department’s proposal for the revised extension of subsidy. Power minister Satyendar Jain said that when the new tariffs were announced, the cabinet had decided to revise the subsidy scheme to benefit the maximum number of consumers. “This will benefit a large number of economically weaker consumers,” said Jain.
 
 Officials said the government won’t pay the discoms for these subsidies as the amount would be adjusted against their dues to it. “The discoms continue to owe a cumulative amount of Rs 8,000 crore to the Delhi government-owned DTL and IPGCL-PPCL,” said an official.
 
 The cabinet also approved a special subsidy for lawyers using chambers inside the court complexes by deciding to treat them as domestic consumers. Earlier, they were being charged at commercial rates for their chambers. 
 
 The cabinet has also asked   (DERC) to conduct a special audit of subsidy amounts through an external auditor to ensure it reaches the actual consumers.
