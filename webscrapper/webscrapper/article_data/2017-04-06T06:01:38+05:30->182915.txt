 "I always wanted to be a doctor, but I began to to feel that I would not be able to succeed. Recently, I met a counselor and after going through some tests, I realiSed my inclination towards Maths.

 Not just students, even parents consider counselling as the best way forward.
 
 "My son wanted to join in MPC just because all his friends were opting for the subject, but I know he would be good at finance as he shows lot of interest in the subject. Luckily, when I took him to a counsellor, he got the same feedback. Even he is happy with the decision," said Rakesh D, a parent.
 
 "Getting help is important, but students must ensure that they make an informed career choice based on the support they can get from four essential pillars - counselling, technology tools, university connects and alumni guidance," said Jaideep Gupta, CEO & founder, Univariety, an education startup. 
 
 Counsellors also said that age-old conventions such as 'hit-and-trial', popular opinion, and parental or peer influence are hardly the way to make career choices.
 
 "Career counselling helps students (and parents) broaden their thought spectrum and explore fresher opportunities. It keeps the student at the core of the process but also helps break old stereotypes associated with certain careers," said  , CEO and founder, Mindler, a startup which uses a machine learning platform to help students choose their career path.
