Trichy: Two back-to-back incidents of house break-ins shook the rural part of Trichy district as burglars decamped with gold ornaments and jewellery from two residences in Thuraiyur and Manapparai on Sunday. 

 In the first incident, burglars struck at the house of one Nambirajan, 38, from Saminathan nagar in Thuraiyur on Sunday midnight. Nambirajan was running a medical shop while his family had gone to their relative’s house at the time of the incident. 
 
 On returning home from his pharmacy around 12 midnight, he spotted a couple of men jumping from inside his house. Nambirajan raised an alarm and tried to catch them. But, the alert burglars fled the scene in a car parked in a hidden place near his house. 
 
 An unfazed Nambirajan took his two-wheeler and followed them. The angered burglars even hit his motorcycle resulting in his fall to the ground. But, not someone to give up easily, Nambirajan got back and continued his chase but he suffered two more hits by the burglars car. Eventually, they escaped from the spot. 
 
 When Nambirajan returned home, he found 40 sovereigns of gold jewellery and Rs 35,000 cash missing. He lodged a complaint with the Thuraiyur police. 
 
 In another incident, burglars poisoned a dog to death in a house and escaped with valuables in Manapparai. The burglary took place at the house of a rice mill owner Kalimuthu when he and his family members were in Dindigul for his son Rajalingam’s marriage on Sunday. 
 
 One of his relatives visited his house to feed the dog on Sunday evening. But he found the dog dead and a small bag of poison. On getting the information, Kalimuthu rushed back home from Dindigul and found that main door of the house broken. He also found that the home appliances in the house were stolen. The Manapparai police are investigating.
