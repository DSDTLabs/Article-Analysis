MUMBAI: With pressure of installing speed governors in taxis with immediate effect, the Mumbai Taximen's Union on Sunday announced it will move the Bombay high   for a stay on the transport department notification.

 Union leader A L   said, “We will file a petition on Tuesday morning.The transport department has been unfair and not given us enough time to set up to the system. How can we install speed governors overnight in more than 30,000 kaali peelis in Mumbai?“ A senior official said, “We cannot make changes to the rule or defer it. The Centre has amended motor vehicle rules and made governors mandatory for taxis. The rule is in force and we will have to direct all cabbies and those plying tourist taxis, or operating fleetcabs and aggregator cabs, to install governors at the earliest. We cannot set any deadline.“
 
 Quadros had on Friday threatened a protest at four city RTOs if implementation of the rule was not deferred. “But we have decided not to hold a protest, and instead will fight the battle in court,“ he told TOI on Sunday.
 
 Quadros also said the department must publish a list of authorised dealers for speed governors, as there were fears of black-marketing. “The governors are expensive (Rs 10,500-15,000),“ he said.
 
 Sources said that in some latest car models, there was an in-built electronic control unit which receives impulses from a speed sensor and restricts fuel supply when the speed limit is touched. “ All one has to do is go to the dealer and get the settings adjusted to a speed limit of 80kmph,“ the sources stated.
 
 Tourist bus operators are petitioning the government to demand that the limit for long-distance buses be increased from 80kmph to 100 kmph on national highways.
