NEW DELHI: What's in a name? A lot of ad revenue, as the   (DMRC) has discovered in the last couple of years.

 DMRC has partially renamed 15 Metro stations by auctioning the naming rights to companies and public sector undertakings. The highest bidders for semi-naming rights get to prefix the name of their company or organisation to the Metro station's name.
 
 Most stations that have been partially renamed or co-branded are in the neighbouring states, but now it will be done at more stations in Delhi.
 
 DMRC has put on offer 18 stations for co-branding.Green Park and Noida Sector 15 stations are already in the process of getting a new name. Once this process is complete, the number of partially renamed Metro stations would stand at 35 in the whole of NCR.
 
 Metro has tweaked its policy on semi-naming rights by offering them for underconstruction stations as well. These include Pink Line's   and IP Extension stations; Magenta Line's Sukhdev Vihar, Rajendra Nagar and Modern Industrial Estate stations that are extension of Line 1 (Dilshad Garden-Rithala); and  , which is an extension of Line 3 (Dwarka Sector 21-Noida City Centre).
 
 Co-branding of Metro stations is a good source of revenue for DMRC. Though Metro does not talk about the revenue generated from it, sources said that it earns about Rs 2 crore per station every year. This means about Rs 70 crore per annum from the 35 stations that have been renamed or are in the process of getting a new name.
