GANDHINAGAR: If key sources in the state BJP are to be believed, 17 to 18 Congress MLAs are likely to resign and join BJP before the Rajya Sabha elections on August 8. Three of these already resigned as Congress MLA and joined BJP on Thursday.

 While all senior leaders of Congress avoided making any comment on the resignations of three MLAs, spokesperson of   Congress, Manish Doshi, accused BJP of political horse-trading. Doshi said, “Instead of taking care of flood-affected people, BJP is busy in horse-trading of Congress MLAs by coercion and other means.”
 
 “Around 17 to 18 Congress MLAs from present 57 are likely to join BJP before the Rajya Sabha elections, so Congress president Sonia Gandhi's political advisor, Ahmed Patel, will fail to get minimum required votes,” said a source in state BJP. “Our third candidate for Rajya Sabha, Balwantsinh Rajput, will win the elections with BJP's surplus votes and 2nd preference votes,” the source added.
