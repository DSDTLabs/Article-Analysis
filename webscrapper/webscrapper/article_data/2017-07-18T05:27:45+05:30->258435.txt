AHMEDABAD: The   police personnel of Ramol police station were accused of thrashing a lawyer on Monday. The Family of the lawyer, Jayesh Ramanuj, claimed that he had gone to secure bail for clients arrested in a gambling raid.

 The lawyer’s wife,  , told TOI that her husband had to be rushed to   with injuries to face late on Sunday night. “We have lodged a complaint against Ramol police with the police table at LG Hospital,” she added. According to Shilpa, her husband got a call from his clients and rushed to Ramol police station. “Jayesh told the cops that as theirs was a bailable offence, his clients should be released on bail. He said that instead of hearing him out, personnel of the surveillance squad abused him and threatened to get his licence cancelled,” added Shilpa.
 
 Shilpa alleged that when her husband was leaving the police station he was dragged inside by two cops and slapped several times. “My husband was held by two policemen and the others were beating him. He returned home with bruises on his face. At first he declined to seek treatment, but fell unconscious and had to be rushed to LG Hospital later that night,” Shilpa said.
 
 Ramol police sources said their team visited LG Hospital on having received a message from the police table there. They said the allegations levelled against are baseless. “The lawyer was himself rude. However,   of the police station will be checked to verify the allegations levelled against the surveillance squad personnel,” said a senior police official.
