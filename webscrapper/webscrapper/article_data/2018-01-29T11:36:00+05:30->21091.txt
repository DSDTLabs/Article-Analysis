HYDERABAD: A   numbed the   on Monday morning as a   was found placed at a conspicuous place on the road. 

 The victim has been identified as Palakuri Ramesh of Kanagal mandal. Locals identified him as a tractor driver in Nalgonda. 
 
 The body was not anywhere in the vicinity but the severed head was placed on at Bottuguda Janda, Prakash Bazar under One Town Police station. Coming close on the heels of another murder that rocked the district, this murder has come as another shocker.
 
 It may be recalled that during the intervening night of January 24-25, Boddupalli Srinivas, husband of the municipal chairperson Laxmi, was murdered by a group of people in Nalgonda town. It was only on Sunday that the district Superintendent of Police D V Srinivas Rao announced the arrest of eight out of the 11 suspects. The murder of Boddupalli heightened tension in the town as the ruling   and Congress engaged in a war of words accusing each other of the crime. The district SP, however, had said there was no political motive behind the murder.
 
 This being the situation in Nalgonda – a hotbed of politics – the murder of another youth has created ripples. Not only was the murder barbaric – with the head sliced off from the body – the head was displayed at a public place, ostensibly for all to see. Police, who reached the spot on being informed about the severed head, are scouring the area to find the body.
