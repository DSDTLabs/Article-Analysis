NEW DELHI: The   has asked   (SDMC) to consider “in a positive light” a traffic police proposal to erect   in   of South Delhi to ease traffic congestion.

 The court noted that the civic body should work towards coordinating with other statutory authorities and make an effort to implement the proposal that calls for either a multi-level parking or alternatively an underground parking should be constructed in the market at Green Park to accommodate heavy flow of vehicles.
 
 In its report filed before the HC during an ongoing hearing to resolve traffic woes of the locality, the traffic police informed the court that approximately 1,500 vehicles visited the market every day and the number escalated to 2,500 on weekends. To take care of parking chaos created due to the influx of vehicles, a multi-level parking was much needed as a long-term solution, it recommended.
 
 "Before parting with this petition, this court emphasises the need of a multi-level parking in this (Green Park market) area which is a suggestion of respondent number five (police) as well,” Justice Indermeet Kaur said.
