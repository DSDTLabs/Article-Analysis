MANIPAL: The  , Manipal, successfully removed a stone weighing 530gm from a kidney of a 46-year old person from Karkala. 

 The patient was admitted to the hospital complaining of abdominal pain and losing control over urination.  , HoD, Urology, who led a team of doctors in the operation, examined the patient and suggested investigations. Surprisingly, the X-ray showed a stone measuring 10x8 cms in his kidney.
 
 Dr Padmaraj along with Dr Zeeshan Hameed, Dr Manjunath (both urologists) and Dr Ramkumar, an anaesthetist performed a open cystolithotomy surgery and removed the stone which was bigger than a tennis ball in size. What surprised the doctors was the size of the stone in a patient who is not old and had no symptoms just five days before he admitted to the hospital. 
 
 “Medical literature records only three stones bigger than this one from China, Hungary and Brazil,” Dr Dayananda, medical superintendent of the hospital said.
 
 In recent urological practice, bigger bladder stones are rare, especially those greater than 100 grams. Journals for articles on this topic in the last 30 years yielded less than 85 relevant articles. Available literature from India does record a single bladder stone weighing 800 grams from Ulhasnagar.
 
 Dr Dayananda, said early detection is the key to a better surgical outcome. Advanced facilities at the urology OT Complex of the hospital such as laser energy system is capable of breaking the hardest of the stones, in an endoscopic method.
