SHIMLA: After bagging 20 seats in the Punjab assembly polls, it is time for the   (AAP) to gauge the viability of contesting in the state elections due to be held later this year. With no prominent face to lead the party in the state, AAP has decided to take people’s views before deciding on contesting. 

 Senior AAP leader Sanjay Singh said that there was a growing demand from party cadre in HP to contest which was evident in the meeting held on Friday.
 
 “Many party leaders felt that AAP should contest the elections to give the option of a third front to people. At present it’s all about two parties, BJP and Congress,” he said. Singh also said that a seven- member committee would review all the assembly constituencies within a week and would submit a report to national leadership.
 
 He said that the report would delve into the number of seats the party should contest for or whether it was prepared to fight given the paucity of time. 
 
 AAP may be the main opposition party in Punjab, but in HP, it would be a different ball game as the hill state has always reinstated its confidence in the two-party system. In 1998 the Himachal Vikas Congress was floated by Sukh Ram which won five seats but later it merged with the Congress.
 
 In the state AAP has no strong leadership. Former BJP Kangra MP,   who had contested the 2012 assembly election as an independent lost and was appointed the party’s state convener ahead of 2014   election. Sushant contested the Lok Sabha election against BJP’s   in 2014 but faced defeat. Having quit AAP, Sushant is expected to join BJP again.
