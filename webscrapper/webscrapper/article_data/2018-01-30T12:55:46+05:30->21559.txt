Airpocalypse II: Assessment of   in Indian Cities, a study by Greenpeace organization for 2015 and 2016 shows that the air quality is going from bad to worse. Around 63 crores were surveyed in 280 cities of 20 states. The particulate matter10 data shows 228 cities have not been complying with the annual permissible concentration of 60μg/m³ prescribed by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) or the 20 μg/m³ by the World Health Organization. The survey also revealed that 18 crore live in areas where the air pollution levels are more than twice the stipulated standards. This includes 4.7 crores children under 5 years of age living in areas where the standard is exceeded and 1.7 crores in areas where the air pollution levels are more than twice the stipulated standards. Also, 58 crore Indians live in districts with no air quality data available, including 5.9 crore under 5 years of age. It is evident that the cities and states have not taken any measures to improve the standards. TOI analyses the report and speak to the people who conducted the study

 Out of 63 crore Indians covered by a study, 55 crore are living in areas where levels of PM10, a prominent air pollutant, is beyond the permissible limit. Moreover, 180 million are living in areas where the air pollution levels are twice more than the stipulated standards.
 
 This was revealed in the second ‘Airpocalypse’ report which was released by environmental group Greenpeace India on Monday. Assessing air quality of 280 Indian cities for 2015 and 2016, the report is based on data gathered from state pollution control boards through their websites and Right to Information (RTI) queries. 
 
 In January 2017, the NGO had released the first report which stated that there were 12 lakh deaths in India annually because of air pollution. 
 
 The Greenpeace report states that more than 80% of these cities are not complying with the annual permissible standard of PM10 which is set down at 60 micrograms per cubic meter (mpcm) by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). “None of the surveyed cities have been found to adhere to the standard set by the World Health Organization (WHO),” the report added.
 
 Stating that particulate matter affects people the most than any other pollutant, the WHO had stipulated a permissible limit of 20 mpcm for PM10, which is a particulate matter of size 10 micrometers or less in diameter.
 
 Out of the 55 crore population living in polluted areas, 4.7 crore are children below five years. And out of the 18 crore living in areas where air pollution levels are worse, the number of such children is 1.7 crore, as per the report which also highlighted that 58 crore Indians are living in districts where “no data regarding air quality is available”.
 
 Comparing air pollution in India with other countries, the report points out that PM2.5, which is particulate matter having a diameter less than 2.5 micrometers, has been increasing steadily in India for the past ten years. “2015 was the worst year on record and the best for China,” it stated. 
 
 PM2.5 are reportedly the biggest health concern as they can pass through the nose and throat and be absorbed deep inside the lungs. 
 
 In countries like China, US, Taiwan, South Korea and  , concentration of PM2.5 have either been stable or on a decline.
 
 Focusing on thermal power plants, the report mentions that 95% of the plants in China have a basic pollution control system including desulphurization mechanism. In India, the percentage is as low as 10. 
 
 TOI has been repeatedly reporting how most of the plants in the country have not installed the mandatory flue-gas desulphurization (FGD) to control the emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2). As per Nasa reports, India is on its way of becoming the highest emitting nation of SO2.
 
 Like other countries, India does not have a set target for PM2.5 or a deadline for meeting national air quality standards. 
 
 The report also gives a wake-up call to Maharashtra “before it becomes another Delhi”. According to it, 67 lakh children (below 5 years) are living in polluted districts across the state. Moreover, none of the 24 monitored cities of the state are complying to PM10 annual prescribed standards.
 
 Sunil Dahiya, senior campaigner at Greenpeace India, said the report raises an alarm for regions like Maharashtra where the air pollution is increasing day-by-day. “The state is not too far from Delhi in terms of health impact,” he said, adding that the population exposed to severe air pollution “will increase when more areas are monitored”. 
 
 FINDINGS 
 
 1. Out of 630 million Indians, 550 million live in areas exceeding national standard for PM10 and 180 million live in areas where the air pollution levels are more than twice the stipulated standards. In this population, there are 47 million children under 5 years of age living in polluted areas and 17 million children living in areas where air pollution levels are twice more than the prescribed standards
 
 2. 580 million Indians live in districts for which no data on air quality is available
 
 3. Real-time air quality data is available for only 190 million Indians or 16 % of the pollution
 
 4. Delhi remains the topmost polluted city followed by nearby towns like Faridabad and Bhiwadi
 
 5. Unlike North, cities in South do not need emergency response plans but most of them need long-term action plans to bring down the pollution levels
 
 6. Pollution problem not confined to Delhi-NCR region, more than 80% of the monitored cities not complying with permissible standards
 
 STATE-WISE ANALYSIS
