After playing a socially-concerned law student in a recent Manju Warrier film, actress   is all set to play a Class 12 student in Ranjith’s   movie, Puthan Panam. 

  Niranjana tells us, “I will be playing Mia, a Plus Two student, and will be playing my age in the movie. I am cast opposite Ganapathy and am a girl from a middle-class family, you would find in metro cities. Hence, the character is modern yet naadan.”
  The actress who debuted with Mohanlal-starrer Loham, says that acting along with the three superstars was like studying in Stanford, Cambridge and Oxford universities. “I am wonderstruck at how they pull off their characters. All I had to do was to react to their moves and it is really awesome,” she adds. 
 
 On working with Mammootty in Puthan Panam, Niranjana says, “We had real fun during the film’s shoot in Goa. The climax was shot there — an isolated area with few people and no boats. There we got a chance to interact with each other well. Mammootty uncle cracked a lot of jokes and we used to laugh out loud!” 
 
  Niranjana says her partners in crime on the sets were Ganapathy and Aanandam fame Vishak Nair. “We were after Mammootty uncle’s perfume. Its fragrance was such that we kept on pestering him for it. One day, he took some Oudh and applied it on our faces. Its fragrance lingered on even after we had our baths.” However, she adds that once the shot was ready, Mammootty would instantly get into the skin of the character.
  The actress, who is currently busy with her Class 12 exams, says that she plans to take up commerce for her graduation. “I also want to continue dance and acting along with my studies,” she says.
