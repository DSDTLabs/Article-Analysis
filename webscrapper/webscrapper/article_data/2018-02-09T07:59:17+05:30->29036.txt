LUDHIANA: The fire brigade personnel had another challenging day when a hosiery factory in street number 5 of Bajwa Nagar went up in flames on Thursday. There was no casualty in the incident, but entire goods of the factory were reduced to ashes.

 For fire brigade men, first it proved difficult to reach the accident site as dangling wires created hurdles in the movement of fire tenders. They were fortunate as there was another way to road to reach the factory. Then it was narrow stairs at the building which made their task difficult.
 
 The fire brigade had received the call at the control room at 9.20am. Thick smoke and flames made it hard for fire officials to enter the building and jumbled wires restricted the movement of fire tenders outside.
 
 The fire had broken out on the first floor of  , but the fire brigade controlled the fire before it could spread to the upper floors of the building.
 
 After the flames were put off, the fire officials said they found it tough to get to fire site because of the narrow staircase at the building. Moreover, black and thick smoke coming out of the factory blinded them. But they were successful in controlling the fire in the first floor itself, they said.
 
 They informed that the building had developed cracks due to the fire that lasted for almost four hours.
 
 Senior fire officer Srishti Nath said exact reason behind the fire is still not known and they would find out the cause after checking the building. He said they noticed only one fire extinguisher in the factory and as of now it is not clear whether the owner had procured the   from the fire department or not.
