HYDERABAD: Day after   chief Bipin Rawat's remark on influx of migrants from Bangladesh into Assam and rising political graph of AIDUF, a local party with a Muslim base,   Asaduddin   crossed swords with the General. In tweets on Thursday, Owaisi reminded the Army chief the force was apolitical and said - politics in the Army is poison. 

 Owaisi demanded to know if the   government agreed with the Army chief's statement. He said government's silence would mean he had made the statement at its behest and "with its blessings".
 
 "Politics in the Army is poison. Keep off it," he said, sharing a page from  's book 'Army and Nation'. He said it was worth reading the reply of Field Marshal Sir Claude Auchinleck to Nehru and also to General KM Cariappa in January 1949.
 
 Owaisi said, "If illegal migrants are entering from Bangladesh what is the Modi government doing? Who would question the Border Security Force (BSF)? Internal security is dealt by IB and police, not military. We have seen the draconian consequences in our neighbouring countries when Army got involved in domestic politics."
 
  Owaisi said Hindu nationalist and 'Janedharu' parties say that Muslims should be brought into mainstream, but when AIUDF strengthens democracy, a baseless allegation is made.
