KOCHI: As of December 2017, over 100 schools in the district have fibre optic internet connection, which can provide the high-speed internet with no limits on download.

 The state education department intends to extend this service to all government and aided schools in the district.
 
 Currently with the exception of the 18 schools, all schools in the district, at least provide a broadband connection at schools. “The reason, why these schools do not have an internet connection is because they are remotely located,” said  , district coordinator of   ( ).
 
 He said the Kite has placed special orders with   and Rail Wire to extend optic fibre internet connectivity for these schools.
 
 Presently, schools that have broadband internet connections have a download limit of 4.5 GB, once the fibre optic internet connection is established in these schools, all of them will have unlimited data access.
 
 “The main reason for establishing this high-speed internet connection at schools is so that students have access to   an online digital portal, for students where they can access textbooks and other study materials online with having to bring the textbooks to school,” said Jayadevan.
