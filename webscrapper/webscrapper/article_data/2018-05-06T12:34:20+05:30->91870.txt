NAGPUR: The state government has clarified that the education officer (primary) can take a decision in pay disputes between principals and school managements. A state circular issued last week ended the confusion created by a GR issued almost eight years ago. 

 In 2010, the state had issued a circular which mentioned that in case of pay disputes, the education officer (primary) can intervene. However, the Marathi wordings of the circular led to an interpretation that a final decision could not be taken by the officer, only intervention can happen.
 
 Dipendra  , district education officer (primary), said, “The aggrieved party in the dispute would claim only the education officer (secondary) could take a final decision. This led to time consuming paperwork, even though there was no confusion within the education department.” Now. the amended circular clearly mentions that the education officer (primary) can take a final decision in principal-management disputes, and forward the same to higher authorities.
 
 Lokhande said this decision holds importance for Nagpur because of the high number of aided primary schools. “We have almost 400   where the primary section is aided by the state, compared to hardly 50 or 80 in adjoining districts. This decision will help us resolve many disputes much quicker, because the unhappy side now cannot use a ‘misinterpretation’ as an excuse to delay things,” said Lokhande.
 
 Since the concerned schools are under private management, though receiving financial aid from the government, there is often friction with the principal over the way things are run. Lokhande said, “Sometimes, the friction is very high and spills over to salary and other financial benefits of the principal. In such cases, it is important for a neutral party, like the education department, to not only intervene but also resolve the problem.”
