Ahmedabad: It was a decision akin to the mother of all ironies for Gujarat, when the Centre on Friday approved the proposal for a single engineering and architecture entrance exam at the undergraduate level from 2018. This academic year, the state government had thrown out the common test — Joint Engineering Entrance Exam (JEE) — for admission to engineering colleges.

 The state government made JEE optional and reintroduced the Gujarat Common Entrance Test (GujCET), justifying the move on the grounds that a large number of students who want to study in Gujarat are forced to take the national exam. It also decided that engineering admissions in state colleges will be given on the basis of performance in GujCET.
 
 Now, with the approval of the common national exam, the state will be mandated to again agree to a common exam over JEE for admission purposes.
 
 “The state government agreed to grant admissions on the basis of class XII and JEE merit marks in 2012. Students got used to the national test and their performance even improved. Just when everything was on track, the state took the regressive step of making JEE optional and reintroducing GujCET. Such flip-flops unnecessarily play with the minds of students,” said J R Dave, former dean of the Technical Examination Board. 
 
 Dinkar Raval, a parent, said the government has no roapmap. “Policies are decided by protests and pressure applied by parents. The government should take tough measures and prepare a roadmap which prepares its students for any national level exam,” Raval said.
