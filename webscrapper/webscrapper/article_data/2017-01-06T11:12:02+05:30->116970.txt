 Ahmed has so far admitted in writing that he had sold off the sculptures for Rs5 lakh to Rana. The sculptures were made by veteran artists Dhruva Mistry,   and late  . It was Mistry who had raised the issue before the university authorities after Rana showed him his sculpture. The probe panel which had registered Mistry’s complaint and grilled Ahmed, on Thursday registered statements of Rana apart from two lecturers of sculpture department -   and Rutvij Mistry.
