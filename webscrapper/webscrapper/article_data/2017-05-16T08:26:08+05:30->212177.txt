Nagpur: Joint general secretary of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Dattatreya Hosabale, inaugurated the ‘trutiya varsh varg’ (third year course) for   workers at their Reshimbagh facility here on Friday. The annual camp held every summer in Nagpur completes a RSS workers’ three-year training programme. This time 914 swyamsevaks from across the country are attending it.

 ‘’The journey of learning is never ending. The Sangh Shiksha Varg — Trutiya Varsh is a great opportunity to learn various aspects of RSS,” said Hosabale in his inaugural address. 
 
 “This place has special significance as it is here the founder of RSS Dr Hedgewar and the second RSS Sarsanghchalak Guruji have actually worked with thousands of Swaymsevaks. We get a true national perspective in this varg as participants live together in the camp,” he added.
 
 “Today there is great curiosity about RSS. Industrialist Ratan Tata visited this premises as he wanted to know how a Shakha functions. People have great expectations from the RSS and we should live up to their expectations,” he summed up. 
 
 Dr Prithivraj Singh, the camp in-charge welcomed participants. Anil Oke, the palak adhikari of the Varg emphasized on training. “ Let’s dedicate these 25 days for the cause of the nation,” he said. 
 
 The camp will conclude on June 8.
 
 The first and second year courses are conducted in respective regions of the participating swayamsevaks but the third and final year course is specifically held in Nagpur. Despite the extreme summer of the city, the participants in the age group of 21 to 45 go through a hectic daily schedule from dawn to dusk.
