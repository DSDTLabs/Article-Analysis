NEW DELHI: Joining hands with anti-GM groups, senior   lawyer   wrote to environment minister   on Saturday, urging him to withhold his approval of genetically modified ( ) mustard’s commercial cultivation.

 Bhushan’s letter comes two days after the central biotech regulator,   (GEAC), gave its green signal to the commercial release of GM mustard. 
 
 The final decision is now on the environment minister’s table . It is learnt that the ministry will go by the Supreme Court’s ruling in a case challenging cultivation of GMmustard.
 
 Bhushan, who had appeared in the apex court for a petitioner against commercial release of GM mustard, flagged all the issues in his letter which are being raised by anti-GM groups and questioned why the ‘self-assessed’ safety dossiers by the developers of the transgenic mustard are kept secret by the regulator.
