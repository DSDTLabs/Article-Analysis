NEW DELHI: Cricketer Steve Smith’s father, Peter, dumped his son’s cricket kit following the   row that saw Smith being banned for 12 months from international cricket by Cricket Australia along with chief conspirator David Warner. 

 
 
 
 
 Peter, who was standing besides his son during the press conference where he broke down, told ‘Seven News’ channel that he will be fine. 
 
 The news channel released the footage showing Peter taking out Smith’s kit from the car and dumping it in the garage and he went on to say, “ "He'll be fine, he'll survive, he'll survive." 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 Earlier, while addressing the media after his arrival in Sydney, Smith had stated that he is sorry for his actions and is absolutely devastated. He went on to add that there is no one to be blamed except him.
 
 “I don't blame anyone,” said a teary-eyed Smith. “I'm the captain of the Australian team. It's on my watch and I take responsibility for what happened last Saturday.”
 
 While all the three accused in ball tampering row - Smith, Warner and Cameron Bancroft - have had a tough few days since the incident, it has also affected their families members as well, as evident from Peter’s actions. 
 
 Warner's wife Candice on Sunday said that she blamed herself for his part in the ball-tampering scandal, adding that the taunts they faced in South Africa took a huge toll.
 
 "I feel like it's all my fault and it's killing me -- it's absolutely killing me," Candice Warner told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph.
 
 The Test series was already fractious before the ball-tampering affair, with a row between Warner and Quinton de Kock during the first Test which the Australian said was sparked when the South African insulted his wife.
