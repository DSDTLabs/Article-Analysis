 Picture this: A 100-metre-long road that connects   to   lane in  , a 650-meter stretch of road opposite Aparna Sarovar D block in Gachibowli and several areas in Malkajgiri and Uppal were still flooded with rain water on Wednesday. Many roads were also found to be riddled with potholes that appeared in the last two days, courtesy the unexpected showers.
 
 At Harijan Basti lane, the drainage problem was fixed a month ago, but thanks to the sudden rains the road is back to being filled with rainwater and potholes, leaving residents worried about what will happen when the monsoons arrive.
 
 Citizens of areas plagued by waterlogging said they have already lodged complaints with GHMC about the problems they are facing every day but to no avail.
 
 "After fixing the drains, the road re-surfacing work has not been done properly. We tried to talk to the civic authorities about the pathetic condition of the roads in our area but nothing has worked till date. If such a small quantum of rainfall can cause problems now, the situation when the monsoons hit the city will be terrible," said a local Ravi Kumar.
 
 "Whenever it rains, water starts clogging here due to the slush. The road plan has been sanctioned three times now, but a proper road is yet to be built," lamented 38-year-old Malkajgiri resident, G Ramakrishna.
 
 Asked about the response of civic authorities, he said whenever the residents tried to talk to civic officials and contractors, all they got was excuses.
 
 Traders at Madhapur's   said life has become difficult."In the past seven years that I have been doing business here, I have never seen the number of customers hit such a low. This is due to the foul smell emanating from the clogged road," said Nemichand Saini, 45, a grocery shop owner.
