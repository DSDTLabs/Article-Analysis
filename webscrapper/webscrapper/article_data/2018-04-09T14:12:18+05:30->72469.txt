 The survivor had tried to immolate self on Sunday near the chief minister’s house in high-security zone alleging that police were not acting on her complaint against local BJP MLA, who, she said, raped her last year. The security personnel present there got hold of the woman before she could light the fire after pouring kerosene oil on her body and handed her over to the local Gautam Palli police.
 
 The woman alleged that the BJP MLA and his aides had raped her in May 2017, but police took no action on her complaint. The MLA on the hand told media persons on Sunday that some rivals were at work to tarnish his image and he had also appealed to the police for a thorough probe. “She was trying to implicate some local youths and I supported them,” he said.
