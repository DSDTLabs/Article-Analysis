Hyderabad: Stalemate continued on Day 4 of the Gandhi Hospital private nurses strike, with no dialogue taking place between the hospital management and outsourced nurses association over the issue of regularization of their services. 

 As a result, the nurses, on Tuesday, decided to extend their strike further till a clear solution is reached. Many of the outsourced nursing staff, who have been working at the hospital for over a decade, fear that their years of experience at the facility would be rendered useless if they are not considered for regularization.
 
 The nurses are also protesting the non-payment of promised salaries. They claim they have been receiving a pay of Rs 17,500 even though they are entitled to a salary of Rs 28,000. “The strike will continue till our demand for regularizing all the 210 outsourced nurses working at Gandhi Hospital isn’t met. If this is not possible, we have requested the government to give them appointment on direct contract instead of using them as outsourced staff,” said M Narasimha, president, Gandhi Hospital contract nurses association and Hyderabad general secretary of the All India Trade Union Congress, which is spearheading the  .
 
 While they have no positive assurance on their demands, they are hopeful of receiving some ‘political support’.
