NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed   leader Jagdish Tytlerâ€™s plea challenging framing of charges against him in a corruption case lodged against him and controversial businessman   for allegedly using a forged letter addressed to then Prime Minister   in 2009. 

 A bench of Justices   and M M Shantanagoudar dismissed the appeal filed by   challenging the Delhi high court order which had refused to quash the case against him. It, however, directed the trial court to complete the proceedings within a year.
