BHUBANESWAR: The state capital on Sunday at 12.6 degree Celsius experienced the coldest day of the season, as cold wave like conditions swept most parts of Odisha affecting normal life. 

 According to the weatherman, the temperature in the city dropped three degrees below normal. Bhubaneswar had recorded its second lowest minimum temperature of 13.3 degree Celsius last on January 24, 2016.
 
 A similar lowest minimum temperature of the season was also recorded at several places in the state, including the coastal pockets. Cities which experienced the lowest temperatures include Cuttack (10.6oC), Paradip (12.8oC), Chandbali (11.5oC) and Balasore (9.4oC). The influence of the drop in night temperature in the city along with the felt presence of chilly winds blowing in from the north, is visible in the thin attendance at public places like markets, parks, gardens and in the fewer numbers of morning or evening walkers on the sidewalks.
 
 "Like many, I too have decided stop walking in the mornings for the next few days until the biting cold blows over," admitted Prafulla Tripahty, a retired government employee. For the urban poor, the city railway station and night shelters turned into refuges against the cold. 
 
 The   spells persistent cold wave-like conditions with minor variation in minimum temperatures will until January 19. "Thereafter, temperatures may again witness a rising trend," said the director of the regional IMD centre, Sarat Chandra Sahu. Sahu said dry cold wind sweeping in from the Himalayas and clear skies have favoured the drop in minimum temperature in coastal pockets. The temperature may continue to drop by two to five degrees for the next few days, Sahu said. Sundargarh recorded the lowest temperature of 7oC in the state.
