In a matter of 24 hours, 'Judwaa 2', featuring Varun alongside   and Taapsee Pannu, will be playing in cinemas. The revamped and rebooted version of the 1997 comedy, also directed by  , brings   bhais,   and Prem, back on the big screen after 20 years. Previously, these characters were played by  , in the film produced by Sajid Nadiadwala. Apart from an entertaining promo, and colourful songs, here’s what the September 29 release entails… 

 
 Prem is a softspoken timid boy, born and bought up in London. He’s a singer who loves his profession and enjoys imparting music lessons. Dressed in casuals and semi-formal outfits, Prem wears geeky glasses, loves his routine life and runs far from adventures.
 
 
 Prem is in love with Samara, played by Taapsee (the part formerly played by  ). She’s a student of music, has the girl-next-door vibe but is also a go-getter. She’s the sunshine in Prem’s otherwise dull life.
 
 
 Raja is an opposite of Prem — rowdy and carefree. This tapori takes each day as it comes. A devotee of Lord Ganesha, he dances with all his heart, dares to face challenges and doesn’t shy away from fighting for what he thinks is right. Given the character’s traits, Varun went in for long locks and a loud wardrobe.
 
 
 Raja’s lady love is Alishka, portrayed Jacqueline (Karisma Kapoor from 'Judwaa'). Alishka, like her beau, is loud and gutsy. She loves him unconditionally. These two Mumbaikars are funny, naughty and adventurous.
