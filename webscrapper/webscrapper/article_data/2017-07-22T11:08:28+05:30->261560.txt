DARJEELING: Members of  , which is in alliance with the GJM in the movement for  , on Friday lodged a 'missing' complaint about S S Ahluwalia, the BJP MP from Darjeeling, at the Sadar police station. The Darjeeling town was also plastered with posters (in Nepali and dripping with sarcasm) of Ahluwalia along with his details, requesting the public to launch a simultaneous operation along with the statehood movement to track down the MP.

 Ahluwalia, who won from Darjeeling in 2014, has been conspicuous in his absence in the troubled Hills throughout the agitation. This has angered a big section of the population in the Darjeeling region. With the Hills observing over a month-long strike that has started taking a toll on daily life, education, availability of food and other essential commodities along with death of eight statehood supporters, people have started to raise the issue of Ahluwalia's absence in the region.
 
  
  
 
 
 “He showed us a dream and promised Gorkhaland and became an MP from Darjeeling.But the BJP minister has never raised this issue in the   or visited the Hills. We want to know where our MP is when he is needed the most,“ said M G Subba, chief convener of the GNLF Darjeeling branch committee that lodged the diary on behalf of the party.
 
 The stunt has also laid bare the sharp differences between GNLF and GJM, which criticized the move. The GJM, which had lodged a similar missing complaint against former BJP MP from Darjeeling  , came out in Ahluwalia's defence, saying the Darjeeling MP was working in Delhi and chided the GNLF for lodging the complaint. “The MP and the party in power at the Centre is in full support of us. GNLF had lost all credibility in the Hills but we gave them a lease of life by letting them join us. If they are serious about it, they should quit such stunts and participate seriously,“ said Prakash Gurung, president of the   of GJM.
