MANALI: Unlike last few years,   in January have prevented early bloom in   and growers are expecting to reap a   this year.

 Kullu district is the main plum grower in Himachal. Bloom in plum is expected in March but it was coming in February in entire district. According to scientists with horticulture departments, rise in temperature was its main cause. As the temperature is still stable due to frequent rain and snowfall on hills, the bloom is still to come in the next two weeks in most of the orchards in Kullu.
 
 “We are sure to get bumper crop this year,” said a plum grower, Amit Bhardwaj. He added, “Premature flowering has destroyed crop in last few years. Scientists term global warming to be the main cause. Earlier, people used to send plum to Delhi and other states but the production has decreased now because of which it is sold only in local fruit markets.”
 
 Plum has become most ignored fruit species in Kullu in last few years. Sometimes, the plant gives less production and other times there are extra fruits. The extra bumper crop results in small size of fruit that fetches less price. Fruit growers, out of frustration, have cut a large number of plum trees in recent years and replaced them with apple plants.
 
 “Generally, maintenance of plum orchard is easy compared to other plants as it doesn’t need sprays of pesticides and fungicides. We used to plant apple and plum in equal number so that if one crop is destroyed by weather, the other can support us economically. Everybody, including government, emphasized upon production of apple and plum lost the race,” said another fruit grower from Kullu, Vimal Sharma.
 
 Meteorological department is forecasting   this month. Growers fear that hailstorms might destroy the crop. Given the good snowfall and chill, apple growers also expect a bumper crop this year.
