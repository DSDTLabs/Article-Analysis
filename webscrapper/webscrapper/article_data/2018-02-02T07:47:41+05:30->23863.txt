HYDERABAD: With senior citizens now being able to claim tax deduction benefit of 50,000 for any medical insurance and deduction of 1,00,000 for critical illnesses, healthcare experts say the elderly in   stand to benefit. 

 More than 40% of senior citizens from the city and elsewhere in the districts do not have access to proper health facilities and many do not have health insurance.
 
 The Union budget 2018-19 has enhanced deduction for medical insurance under Section 80 D for senior citizens from 30,000 to 50,000. To further protect senior citizens from rising medical costs, the deduction limit for critical specified illness has been enhanced to 1,00,000. "This would definitely ease tax compliances for our elders who would be hassled by excess deductions. They would be forced to file tax return just to claim refund of such excess TDS," said  , partner and head,   - tax,   India. 
 
 In another development, a   to provide health insurance cover of 5 lakh per family per year has been announced. "This insurance policy will help people below poverty line to go to private hospitals and get treatment without worrying about costs or waiting time like in government hospitals," said Dr  , MD, MaxCure group of Hospitals. 
 
 But funds for scheme are less. "For National Health Protection Scheme, a token allocation of only 2,000 crore has been made... With 10 crore families, nearly 13,000 crore will be the possible cost," said a official from state health department.
