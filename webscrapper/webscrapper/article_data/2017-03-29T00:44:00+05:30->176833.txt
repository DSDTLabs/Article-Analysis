 Coimbatore: The forest department is planning to use drones to monitor the movements of wild animals to curb man-animal conflict in Coimbatore forest division. They tested a drone for half an hour in the Solakkarai forest beat in Madukkarai forest range on Monday evening.
 
 “This is a pilot project and we are going to provide drones to the Coimbatore and Dharmapuri forest divisions to help them monitor the movements of wild animals,” said P Jagadhish, additional principal conservator of forests.
 
 The forest department plans to provide one drone to Coimbatore forest division and another to the Dharmapuri forest division soon. On Monday evening, Jagadhish, district forest officer S Ramasubramanian from Coimbatore forest division, M Senthilkumar, ranger, Madukkarai forest range and a few experts from a private company, tested the drone for half an hour in the Solakkarai forests.
 
 “We selected the Solakkarai forest beat as wild elephants often cross the railway track here. A high resolution camera was fixed in the drone. This would help us prevent man-animal conflict and monitor the movements of wild animals,” said DFO Ramasubramanian.
 
 The state forest minister C Sreenivasan had announced in the assembly last August that the state government would provide drones for Coimbatore and Dharmapuri forest divisions. “The forest department is going to introduce the system for the first time in these two divisions. Standing at one spot, we can monitor for a radius of 1km. The drone can fly at a height of up to 500m, said Ramasubramanian.
