MUMBAI: Rapping majority trustees of   (BPP) on Thursday by asking if it was a “dictatorial regime“, the Bombay high court asked them to give   access to documents to enable them to function as trustees. Minority trustees Armaity Tirandaz and Viraf Mehta, elected last April and October 2015 respectively, moved the HC complaining of high-handedness by the majority trustees in their refusal to share documents of meetings.Their contention was that the majority trustees were flouting a scheme sanctioned by the HC in1910 that lays down how trustees are required to govern and manage trust properties. Their case was that majority trustees have since last August, after differences arose between trustees, stopped giving information to the duo about affairs of the trust, its properties, finances and legal matters.

 Their counsel J P Sen did not have to say much as the judge, Justice S J Kathawala, took off on the majority trustees. “You are nobody to take decisions against them... where do all these powers stem from? Follow due process... no court can tolerate this... is this a  ?“ asked the judge.
 
 Senior counsel Janak Dwarkadas who appeared for BPP said, “There are grave apprehensions that the documents are not being sought for management of the trust but to influence criminal proceedings filed and pending against Dinshaw Mehta, in some form or the other and to influence proceedings.“ Dwarkadas, who appeared for the majority trustees including Yazdi Desai, Noshir Dadrawala, Kersi Randeria and Zarir Bhathena, said every Tuesday the agenda items are made known and the documents are available.
 
 Ordering the majority trustees to hand over documents, as sought, the judge said if the majority feel documents pertain to criminal complaints filed against former BPP chairman Dinshaw Mehta, those alone may not be given. The court posted the matter for hearing on Friday.
