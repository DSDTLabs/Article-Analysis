THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   leader and Union minister for urban development M   here on Thursday ruled out any deliberate attempt by the BJP to lure Congress leaders in Kerala to the party. 

 "All are welcome to the BJP, no wise man can stay in Congress. It's a sinking ship.   is an intelligent man. I don't know whether he is politically wise or not," Naidu told reporters when asked about the rumours that several prominent leaders in the grand old party in the state were preparing to flock to the BJP.
 
 He was in the state capital to kick start the programmes aimed at preparing the party rank and file for the 2019   elections.
 
 Though he refused to comment on the party's prospects in the Lok Sabha polls, Naidu said the BJP would focus more on the assembly segments where its candidates performed well in the last assembly elections. "The target, of course, is to win all the seats. But the focus would be more in segments where we fared well in the last election. I would be attending meetings of leaders from Thiruvananthapuram today. Block level meetings would be held to discuss about the strategies," Naidu said.
 
 To a question, Naidu said the NDA had once selected O Rajagopal as the Union minister, but now the people will have to elect the party representatives if they wished to have Union ministers from the state. "There are places where people gave overwhelming support to BJP in election. What will they think if we ignore them and select someone to as Union minister from Kerala," he asked.
 
 Naidu said the party would accord top priority to expanding NDA's base in Kerala. But strategies cannot be discussed or announced in news conferences, he added. "Yes, we would like to reach out to the minorities. Our policy is equal rights for all. No appeasement or discrimination towards anybody," he said when asked whether the party has plans to reach out to the state's Christian community.
