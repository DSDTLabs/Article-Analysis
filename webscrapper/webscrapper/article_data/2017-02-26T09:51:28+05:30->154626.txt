NAGPUR: Training for two groups of teachers, who have completed 12 years and 24 years of service, will commence from May onwards giving them a shot at increasing their pay. The cut off date for calculating the years of service is June 30 of last year, and for those complete 12 years are categorized as senior grade whereas those with 24 years plus service are categorized as selection grade. 

 Sriram Chavhan, joint secy of Nagpur divisional board said, “This is an in-service training programme which helps teachers to upgrade their skills. At the end of the training sessions they are given project work which is then evaluated. If they clear it then they are eligible for an increase in the salary.” 
 
 This year the state board has invited applications from teachers only through online mode. Chavhan said, “We have now extended the deadline to Feb 28 and have been receiving a lot of applications online. Going paperless is a decision kept in keeping with the times and has definitely helped everyone.”
 
 While the above was for teachers who have been there for a long time, the   has already started putting plans into motion for the Gen-X teachers. Since last year the education department has been collating data on techno-savvy teachers and also gathering information on how they leverage technology for increasing quality of education in classes. The state’s Pragat Shaikshanik Maharashtra (PSM) campaign is striving to bring teachers who are comfortable using technology on a common platform and share their best practices. A major part of the process is already underway and teachers are coordinating through WhatsApp groups and now the state has asked them to register at a special portal where the limits of number of members in a group won’t be restricted.
