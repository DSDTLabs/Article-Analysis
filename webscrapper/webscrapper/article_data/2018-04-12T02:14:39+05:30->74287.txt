GREATER NOIDA: Four men were arrested on Wednesday morning for allegedly looting a truck transporting a   jewellery consignment on the   last week. Police have recovered over 500 kg of the   jewellery from their possession.

 The accused have been identified as Hashim Mulla (28), Abdullah (30),   (30) and Shoaib (25), all residents of Delhi. Hashim and Abdullah had already booked their flight tickets to Dubai to lead “a luxurious life” with the stolen money, cops said.
 
 The crime took place on April 3 when the truck belonging to a courier company was transporting a 618 kg silver jewellery consignment of several jewellers from Agra to Delhi. As soon as the truck reached near Jewar on Yamuna Expressway, three criminals in a blue beacon-fitted   waylaid it and demanded papers from the driver. While Hashimposed as a cop in a police uniform, others identified themselves as sales tax officials. 
 
 Prashant Kumar, ADG (Meerut zone), said police got the first lead when they found the criminals had snatched the truck guard’s phone and also made a call from that number.
 
 “We got a tip-off that the criminals would be coming to Aligarh from Delhi to sell the stolen valuables. We had formed three police teams that were deployed near Highway Masala on the Yamuna Expressway. The criminals were intercepted and arrested after a brief exchange of fire,” ADG Kumar said.
