PUNE: Around 50,000 people in Dhanori and Tingrenagar are irked with irregular water supply with the civic administration replacing a 150hp pump on its tank with a one with 50hp capacity. 

 The 150hp pump, installed on the tank supplying water to Tingrenagar, Dhanori and the adjoining areas in the city’s eastern part, had developed a fault and stopped functioning around six months ago. 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 Local corporator Rekha   said the civic administration replaced it with a pump of 50hp capacity. “The low-capacity pump can’t lift water with adequate force from the tank. The result is erratic water supply, a big concern for the citizens. The civic authorities need to look into the issue at the earliest,” she said.
 
 Tingre said along with the local residents. she has been following up the issue with the administration. “But the matter is yet to be resolved,” she said. 
 
 Ajay Shinde, a local resident, said supply has been low and people are getting water in taps even around midnight. “People living in the area are already getting water on alternate days. Some areas are getting water in the afternoon, when most people are out for work. In some areas, water is being supplied as early as 4am. The administration needs to streamline supply,” he added.
 
 On Tuesday, a team of civic officials visited the area to take stock of situation. Tingre said the officials promised to install a new pump of 150 hp capacity at the storage tank. “We have asked them to speed up the work,” she said.
 
 The citizens blamed lack of coordination among various civic departments for the situation. “The water department ensures supply, while the electrical department looks after installation of the water pumps. Both the departments need to work in coordination,” a citizen said.
