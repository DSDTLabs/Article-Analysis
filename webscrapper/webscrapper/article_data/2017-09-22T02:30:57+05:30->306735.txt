PATNA: Only 17% candidates have passed the Bihar Teacher Eligibility Test (BTET), the results of which were announced by the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) on Thursday.   BSEB officials said only 16.07% candidates passed paper I, which was meant to test the eligibility for appointment as lower primary teachers (Class I to V) and 17.84% cleared paper II, meant to assess the eligibility for appointment as upper primary teachers (Class VI to VIII).    The results are available on www.bsebonline.net and www.biharboard.ac.in.    Altogether 43,794 aspirants wrote paper 1 and 1.68 lakh paper II, which were held on July 23 at 348 examination centres across the state.    The pass percentage of women was poorer than that of men. While 10.8% and 19.53% women and men respectively passed paper I, 12.18% and 22.51% women and men passed paper II. The total percentage of women and men clearing the BTET stood at 11.93% and 21.85% respectively.    BSEB chairman Anand Kishor said answer sheets of 11,351 examinees of the two papers were declared invalid due to several reasons, including use of whitener.    The cutoff was 60% for general category, 55% for women and backward class I and II, and 50% for SC, ST and handicapped candidates.    Kishor admitted there were few wrong questions and options in the question papers. “We factored in these gaffes while totalling the marks of candidates and determining their score in percentage,” he said.
