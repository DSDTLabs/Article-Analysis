HYDERABAD: After successfully using the new Cured In Place Pipe (CIPP) technology to restore the sewer trunk line between Secretariat and  , the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) has decided to take up work on another 3.5km stretch soon. 

 The works on the 1.5km stretch between Secretariat and NTR Garden were completed over a week ago. Now, the technology will be used to strengthen the sewer trunk line between Divya Shakthi Apartment on   and   statue at Imax Circle. 
 
 CIPP is a trench-less technology that does not involve digging, making it more cost-effective and less disruptive than traditional methods. The process involves inserting a resin-impregnated fabric (felt or fibre) liner tube by an inversion process into the sections chosen for structural strengthening. The liner is cured to become a self-supporting pipe.
 
 "The sewer trunk line can be rehabilitated with this technology without any digging. Though the Raj Bhavan road is one of the main VIP stretches in the city, all measures will be taken to avoid any inconveniences," HMWS&SB managing director M   told TOI. In fact, CIPP is a boon for the Nizam-era sewer network in the city. Once the CIPP process is over, the life span of the sewer trunk will extend by 30 years. 
 
 The water board is spending 35 crore to take up works under the new proposal. The work is likely to take three months, but officials are targeting to complete it by the onset of monsoon. 
 
 Earlier, Water Board had proposed to rehabilitate the entire 5.5km sewer trunk at one go, but the plan was dropped based on a study conducted through CCTVs on strength of the pipe and the difficulty in barricading a huge stretch of road. 
 
 Though the water board is ready to extend CIPP technology to strengthen the entire sewer network in the city, it has not been able to do so due to financial constraints, said an official.
