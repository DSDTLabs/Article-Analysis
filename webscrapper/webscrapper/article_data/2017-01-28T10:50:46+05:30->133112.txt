PANAJI: The   (AAP) on Friday raised an alarm of a potential nexus between the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Nationalist   (NCP) for the upcoming state assembly elections. The theory originated after NCP leader and former Union minister   was conferred the Padma Vibhushan. Pawar had stated that his party is open to supporting the BJP at the Centre as well as in Maharashtra. 

 “If the NCP is open to ally with the BJP in Maharashtra, then it is possible that Churchill Alemao, Nelly Rodrigues and Jose Philip D’Souza will join hands with them here in Goa. Voting for the NCP is voting for the BJP only,” AAP senior leader Oscar Rebello said, claiming that national honours are usually given to people who are close to the Centre. 
 
 Responding to the remarks made by senior Congress leader   over AAP dividing Congress’ votes, Rebello said that the Congress is not the only party that will be losing its vote share. 
 
 “The AAP will be detrimental to all other political parties, not just to the Congress,” he added. 
 
 The party also voiced its displeasure of the date of the annual budget, which will be announced just four days before citizens in Goa and Punjab cast their vote. 
 
 “Ethically, it is not right to release the budget just before states go to polls, but the   has assured that no additional sops will be announced by the government for poll-bound states, and we respect the ECI and the Supreme Court’s decision,” Rebello said. 
 
 The party reaffirmed its priority to conserve the culture and heritage of the state by claiming that it will creating world-class museums and bring out a heritage policy that will aid the conversion of heritage buildings into museums and monuments.
 
 “No forceful land conversion will be done and we will be bringing out the state regional plan within the first year of our government,” Rebello said, adding that the party will restore the status of the coconut tree as the state symbol in the first three days.
