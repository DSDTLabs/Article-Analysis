Colva: The medical report of the home guard and two policemen, attached to the Margao police control room (PCR) van, who were alleged to be drinking while on duty, has come negative. South Goa superintendent of police (SP) Arvind Gawas had severely reprimanded the trio namely police constables Suraj Badkar (driver), Hireshwar Bhutwadkar, and home guard Anant Naik for being in possession of beer bottles while on duty at Amrutnagar, Gogol. Late Friday night citizens from the locality noticed the PCR staff holding beer bottles and raised an alarm. The public was enraged that the police on night patrol were drinking even as the number of burglaries were increasing. Margao town police inspector C L Patil sent the trio for medical examination to Hospicio. The report does not indicate consumption of alcohol. Patil told reporters that referred the report to Gawas, who, taking cognisance of the conduct of his subordinates, has admonished them and asked them to conduct themselves properly.
