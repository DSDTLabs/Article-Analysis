NOIDA: At least 12 FIRs were registered for different violations of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) in the three constituencies of   since the announcement of the poll schedule on January 4, when the MCC came into effect.

 According to the data from the district administration, two of the FIRs were registered against BJP leaders including the party’s Noida candidate, Pankaj Singh and Dadri candidate Tejpal Nagar.
 
 Other FIRs include the one against Rashtriya Lok Dal’s Kamal Sharma for holding a public meeting without permission in Jewar.
 
 Going by the records, it turns out that only the candidates concerned have been named in the FIRs whereas there are hundreds of supporters involved in an offence and they are named as “others”.
 
 Home minister Rajnath’s Singh son Pankaj Singh has also been booked for MCC violation for carrying out a “procession without permission” under Section 188 of the IPC.
 
 So what happens to these FIRs lodged for breach of the model code? Experts said that the process of conviction after a violation is reported is extremely slow.
 
 Major Gen Anil Verma, (retd) head of Association of Democratic Reforms, which conducts election watches and scrutinises affidavits of candidates contesting elections along with the National Election Watch, told TOI that many cases of MCC violation were dropped as soon as the party concerned came to power with the court observing that the complaint was “politically motivated”.
 
 “The data for the conviction rate in the MCC violations has not been collated as it is a tedious process. However, an MCC violation case goes to the district court which takes cognisance after initial inquiry by the local police. Conviction takes a long time,” he said.
