NEW DELHI: Two days after a   inspector committed suicide at the CR Park police station, his family members claim that they wanted a CBI   into his death saying that he had allegedly gone into depression after “casteist slurs” were hurled at him by an IPS officer. However, police said they have not received any such complaint from the family members and are conducting an enquiry into the whole incident.

 The inspector, Kaushal Gangoli, allegedly committed suicide by shooting himself in the head using a service pistol.
 
 His wife Loveleen said that he had started facing problems at work after his promotion earlier this year. “That’s when the senior officer started harassing him.”
 
 “He has received excellence awards throughout his career. I don’t understand how they are saying that he was depressed due to poor performance,” added Loveleen.
 
 His daughter   demanded a CBI probe into the cause of death. 
 
 She claimed that Kaushal had told her a senior police officer had been “harassing” him publicly and in front of his juniors due to which he had felt insulted. “He threatened to dismiss my father when he told him he couldn’t do a particular piece of work,” she said.
 
 Police officials said that an inquest is being conducted. “It is a hard time for the family and we are standing with them. It’s our loss as well as we have lost our man,” said DCP southeast Romil Baaniya.
