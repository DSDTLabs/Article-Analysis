NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has sentenced a man to   for   a   in   in 2013, and came down heavily on the conduct of Uttar Pradesh Police by ordering action against its prosecutor and a   for “lack of sensitivity” in handling the case.

 Additional sessions judge Gurdeep Singh observed that UP Police had turned away the victim and her parents, who were Delhi residents, and asked them to approach Delhi Police even though the incident took place in Ghaziabad. “The conduct of the UP Police is a matter of concern as in this case,” the court said.
 
 The court awarded life term imprisonment to an autorickshaw driver for abducting and raping the minor girl in August 2013. It said, “I think it appropriate that the above conduct of the prosecutor in-charge be brought to the notice of the IG Meerut Range who shall take appropriate action against the errant police officials.”
 
 The shifting of burden by sending the child and her parents to a Delhi police station, the court observed, not only showed insensitivity but also an offence. A fine of Rs 40,000 on was slapped against the 40-year-old autorickshaw driver Om Prakash for the offences of rape, kidnapping and criminal intimidation.
 
 On August 31, 2013, the survivor was picked up by the convict and taken to a deserted area in Ghaziabad where he raped her and threatened to kill her if she told anyone.
