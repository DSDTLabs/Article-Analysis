Vadodara: Cash-strapped Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), which is working to reduce expenses, is looking to fill up vacant as well as new posts in the fire and emergency services department through outsourcing.

 The proposal that was turned down earlier has been brought again to the standing committee of the civic body .
 
 VMC was looking to start integrated fire services in the city at five locations. The services were to include personnel of the city police and health department of the civic body apart from fire brigade personnel. VMC needs 90 personnel of the fire department itself to begin these services.
 
 The fire services are already plagued by vacancies with 161 positions lying vacant. In order to fill these along with the 90 new positions for integrated services, the VMC needs 251 personnel in all. A proposal in this regard was moved earlier in August, but was turned down by the standing committee.
 
 The standing committee had stated at that stage that the personnel should be given regular appointments and not roped in using an external agency. The administration has, however, put up the proposal again stating that if the personnel were employed through the outsourcing route, it would lead to less financial burden on the civic body now and in the future.
