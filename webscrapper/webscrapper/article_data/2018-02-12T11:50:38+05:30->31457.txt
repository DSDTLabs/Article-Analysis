The   star also said it was difficult to film stunts with horses as they had no idea how the animals would react to explosions. 
 
 "Nicolai wanted this to be as real as possible. But how much can you ever prepare an animal for an explosion?" Hemsworth said. "We were all prepared, with our earplugs and all that, but we're on these horses, some of whom were surprisingly chilled, but some were definitely unnerved and freaked out," he added.
