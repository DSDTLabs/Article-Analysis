As a filmmaker,   — the younger brother of Vijay Kiragandur of   — prefers to stay out of the limelight, letting his product do the talking. But, as a connoisseur of good cinema, he is always at the forefront and he is now taking his love for films to another level. Karthik, who turned to distribution with his last home production,  , is now bringing another film —   which has young actors Rishi and Shraddha Srinath in the lead roles — to theatres under a sister concern,  .
“I have known director   for a long time and have been a fan of his work. With Operation Alamelamma, it was the first teaser, in which the hero is introduced, which intrigued me. He followed it up with an equally interesting teaser about the heroine, after which I spoke to him in the hope of a collaboration. He suggested that I watch the entire film and then take a call, which I did, and almost immediately figured out other formalities with the producer and Suni. Operation Alamelamma is a start-to-finish entertainer that will have audiences laughing out loud throughout its two-hour runtime,” explains Karthik.
 Going forward, Karthik is looking at supporting deserving good cinema and bringing them to audiences. “I want to grow KGS Studios into a brand that is associated with quality cinema. This doesn’t mean that I will release a film every week, but I will back any project that excites me as a member of the audience,” he signs off.
