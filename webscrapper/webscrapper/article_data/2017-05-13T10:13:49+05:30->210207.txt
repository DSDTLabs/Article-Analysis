VARANASI: China too has worked to present itself as central to Buddhist traditions but its appeal suffers from a history of anti-religious policies and its economic aid is often seen as attached to conditionalities that can be restrictive. On the other hand, sites closely linked to the life of Buddha in India such as   and Bodh Gaya give it a credible claim to Buddhist traditions. 

  In Varanasi, joint secretary of   and incharge of Sarnath unit Medhankar Thero told TOI that initially Sri Lanka had operated flights for Varanasi. "Now India is starting its flight for Colombo from Varanasi, which will facilitate Sri Lankan Buddhist pilgrims to reach Sarnath without wasting time and also increase the flow of Hindu pilgrims to Sri Lanka to visit places associated with Ramayana age," he said . 
 
  Industry stakeholders say a visit to Sarnath and   is very significant to Buddhists around the world. "This is going to be a win-win situation for pilgrims who will have to pay at least 40% less than before," said Prateek Hira, state president,   in India. 
 
  Various tours and travel websites suggest that a pilgrim from Colombo to UP and Bihar has to spend at least Rs 25,000 on airfare per person if bookings are made four weeks in advance . "Bodhgaya is just a five-and-a-half-hour drive from Varanasi. The move will eventually turn Varanasi-Bodhgaya into a twin-city tour for pilgrims," Hira said. Those looking for a leisurely stay can pick an eight-night trip to Varanasi, Bodh Gaya, Rajgir, Vaishali, Kushinagar, Lumbini, Kapilvastu, Sravasti and Varanasi. 
 
  Tourism department statistics also hint towards higher footfall. Over 55% of foreign tourists who visit Varanasi go to Sarnath and Kushinagar.
