  According to the information from the  , currently, there are 1,150 genuine gun license-holders, the permit for which has to be renewed every three years. Speaking to us about the gun culture in the city, a top cop says, “There is a slight rise in the number of genuine gun license holders, but we have to keep a tab on those who hold weapons illegally. Even if a person has held a valid license and then fails to renew it, his gun will be considered illegal. At the moment, we are allowing only people above the age of 21, who cite valid reasons that are verified by the jurisdictional police the permission to have a gun. The person has to attend civil riffle training tests, which are conducted every three months by the police. Most people who own guns in Mysuru are businessmen who have cash,   and other valuables in their possession or people living in the outskirts of the city which are vulnerable areas for dacoity and robbery.”
