INDORE: A major fire broke out in the basement of a   in South Tukoganj on Wednesday evening destroying more than a dozen   parked in the area.

 SDRF team was on the scene immediately and rescued the people who were trapped in the building’s lift. “The door of the lift was broken and five people trapped inside were taken out from the first floor,” said fire official Santosh Dubey.
 
 The blaze was triggered around 3:30 pm at   after a suspected   in the basement. Some of the employees of the offices in the building noticed smoke coming out of the area and they raised alarm, following which the fire tenders were called in. But the waste took no time in catching the fire and high flames started rising from the basement.
 
 Five fire tenders were rushed to the spot soon after the fire broke out and more than four water tankers were used to douse the flames.
 
 Even though the exact cause of the fire was not known, it was learnt that there was huge quantity of waste in the basement because of which the fire could have spread in the entire area rapidly. It took half-an-hour to bring the blaze under control.
 
 The reason behind the fire is yet to be ascertained but sources claimed that there is a possibility of short-circuit.
 
 No casualty was reported but the destruction was huge, said police. A major untoward incident was averted as all the employees of the bank on the mezzanine floor and the students at the tuition on the second floor along with all the offices staff were evacuated immediately.
 
 The locals claimed that the smoke spread in the entire building and people faced breathing problems. The fire could not be controlled for some time. It took several tankers and foam to put off the flames.
