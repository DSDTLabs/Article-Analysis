MUMBAI: Lines of over 15,000 MTNL broadband customers across SoBo, and especially those in the central suburbs of Dadar and Parel, were down on Thursday for around six hours after the central router developed a technical snag. 

 G Savitri, a financial consultant who operates out of her Lower Parel office, could not conduct transactions for clients from around 10.30am to around 4.30pm.
 
 A senior MTNL official said a main router in Prabhadevi developed a technical snag.
 
 Officials claimed the router was repaired and connections were restored by 3.30pm. tnn
