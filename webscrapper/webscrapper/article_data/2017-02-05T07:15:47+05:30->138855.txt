HYDERABAD: Religious leaders are all set to appeal to the people to   for minorities using the platform of the   or Friday sermon.

 At a meeting on Saturday at the headquarters of the Telangana Minorities Residential Educational Institutions Society (TMREIS) in  , both officials and around 100 such religious leaders from across the state agreed to work in tandem to encourage enrolment of both boys and girls in the state run residential schools for minorities. The Friday sermon in mosques is perhaps the largest gathering of Muslims. It is this medium that the TMREIS wants to utilize to reach out, far and wide, to the community. A focal point is the enrolment of girls in these schools. 
 
 Speaking to  , secretary, TMREIS, B Shaifullah said, “The religious leaders were very open to the idea of spreading information about the schools and how they can greatly benefit the community. We are using all networks to encourage the spreading of information. The masjid network is very important as well. The 201 schools require around 54,000 students.” Schools under the TMREIS teach Urdu and have health care infrastructure, he added.
 
 Shaifullah pointed out that several parents had expressed concerns about the safety of girl students which is why teachers in these schools are women. The TMREIS has also tied up with the SHE Teams, headed by additional commissioner of police (crimes) Swati Lakra, to keep a watch on schools. “Officials of the SHE Teams conducted some spot checks at three schools. In addition to this, we have installed   cameras,” he said.
 
 There are around 13,800 students studying in 71 operational schools. Out of this, around 6,500 are girls.
