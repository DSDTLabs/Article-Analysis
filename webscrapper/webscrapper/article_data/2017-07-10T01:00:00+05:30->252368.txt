KHAGARIA: Incessant rain since Monday has paralysed normal life in the town. The downpour has also exposed the tall claims of the district administration that it has improved drainage facilities in the town.

 Deprived of basic civic amenities like better roads and functional drainage system, life has become miserable for the residents of the town. Several roads in the town are reeling under ankle to knee-deep water following intermittent rain. Slush and garbage could be found almost everywhere here. The situation has further worsened due to potholes and ditches causing inconvenience even to the pedestrians. 
 
 The ongoing construction of rail overbridge at eastern railway crossing in Gaushala Road locality has added to the woes of the people. The road leading to Officers’ Colony and sadar hospital has virtually become a death trap. Almost all the drains are either choked or non-functional as cleanliness work is not being carried out regularly.
 
 The residents of the town have accepted this as truth of life and think that they have no other option but to live with it. They don’t even raise voice against the problem.
 
 “Every year during the  , we have to undergo the same situation and nothing has changed. We don’t think things will ever improve here,” said Jainendra Kumar, a dentist of the town. 
 
 District administration officials said they are trying to improve the situation and things would improve in coming days.
