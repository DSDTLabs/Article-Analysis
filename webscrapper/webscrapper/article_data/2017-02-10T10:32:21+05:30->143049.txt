RANCHI: Chief minister   is all set to give a new meaning to the ancient proverb “If wishes were horses, then pigs would fly”.

 Having conducted road shows in Mumbai, Kolkata and on some foreign shores recently, Das is now using the huge potential of the state to attract domestic and international investors during the first ever Global Investors Summit to be held here on February 16 and 17. Nearly 5,000 delegates are expected to take part in the event. Business honchos such as  , Kumarangalam Birla,   Shashi Ruia and Sanjiv Puri have confirmed their participation.
 
 “I want to reverse the label of a regressive state that is tagged to   into one of the most progressive ones in the country,” the CM said. For this, he has quite aptly chosen a flying elephant as the summit’s mascot, indicating the giant leap which the state intends to take towards poverty elimination.
 
 “Jharkhand has been bestowed with plenty of natural resources and rich forests, but has only got poverty, unemployment and migration in return,” Das said, adding, “To reverse the scenario, the government has evolved various policies to develop not only the agriculture sector but industries and forests too.”
 
 Medium and small scale industries are his thrust areas and investors have promised to go in partnership with them in their projects. Jharkhand is now ranked 7th in the country in ease of doing business.
