PUNE: The   ( ) will distribute two garbage bins each, free of cost to 9,000 households in the cantonment area as part of an exercise to promote segregation of wet and dry waste.

 The PCB has completed the tendering process and issued a work order to a private supplier recently. The aim is to segregate garbage at the source by disposing of or recycling the dry waste (inorganic) at the garbage depot and use the wet waste (organic waste) for composting and organic manure.
 
 D N Yadav, the PCB’s chief executive officer, told TOI on Sunday, “The board has been paying extra attention towards garbage collection and segregation over the past one-and-half years. This will help us maintain the cantonment areas.”
 
 As of now, two private agencies collect garbage on a door-to-door basis. Also, these agencies often find mixed garbage as people don’t pay attention to segregation. About 65 tonnes of garbage gets collected daily from the cantonment areas. 
 
 “We feel that once people get separate bins, they will get into the habit of segregating garbage.” Yadav added.
 
 A section of board members said the PCB ought to have taken this step earlier.  , a board member, said, “The board never gave bins to cantonment residents in the past. Otherwise, segregation would not have remained a challenge till now.”
 
 “The board’s health and sanitation department workers are not trained to segregate waste. The department doesn’t have the required inventory as well. Therefore, the board had to rope in private agencies to collect garbage from the cantonment areas,” a senior official from the board told TOI.
 
 Vice President   said, “After distributing bins, we will carry out awareness drives about garbage segregation in the cantonment areas.”
