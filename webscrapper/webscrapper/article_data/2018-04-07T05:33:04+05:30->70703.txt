GURUGRAM: Ajay Chaudhary, a senior   at Gurugram court, became the president of the district bar association on Friday following an election which saw over 2,200 advocates casting their vote in the day.

 Chaudhary bagged 801 out of a total of 2,265 votes to beat his closest   Meer Singh Yadav by 65 votes. Apart from Chaudhary and Yadav, two more candidates were in the fray for the bar president’s post.
 
 Rajesh Yadav, on the other hand, won the post of vice-president with 669 votes — 107 more than runner-up   — while Hemant Sharma became the bar secretary with 893 votes. The post of the   was won by  .
 
 After the results, a jubilant Chaudhary, speaking to TOI, said his first priority as the bar president would be to make proper seating arrangements for all the advocates on the court complex. “There are over 5,000 advocates and there isn’t space to set up chambers for more than 500 people. We will ensure that the advocates get enough space,” he said, adding the work on the new building was in progress.
 
 Earlier in the day, a huge rush caused   snarls on the lane connecting Old Railway Road and the mini secretariat. The court complex is situated between the two. Sources said lack of parking space for advocates and litigants coming to the court, and ongoing work on the new court complex added to the chaos. 
 
 Chaudhary said he would coordinate with traffic officials to make some changes on the road for the benefit of both advocates and litigants.
