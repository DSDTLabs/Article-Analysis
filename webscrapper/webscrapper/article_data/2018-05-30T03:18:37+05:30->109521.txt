MUMBAI: The state cabinet has approved 100% subsidy to landless Scheduled Caste ( ) labourers who fall in the below poverty line ( ) category for the purchase of up to 2 acres of irrigated or 4 acres of non-irrigated land under the Karmaveer Dadasaheb Gaikwad Sabalikaran va Swabhiman Yojana. The move comes a year before the   and the assembly polls. 

 So far, an SC farm labourer was given 50% subsidy to buy up to 2 acres of irrigated land with a cost cap of Rs 3 lakh per acre, and up to 4 acres of non-irrigated land with a cost cap of Rs 2 lakh per acre. As land prices rose, the scheme was affected. The state social justice department proposed a subsidy hike and an increase in the amount to be paid to Rs 8 lakh per acre for 2 acres of irrigated land and Rs 5 lakh per acre for 4 acres of non-irrigated land.
 
 The state also sanctioned payment for land at double the ready reckoner rate. "A committee under the district collector will start bargaining and will start with a 20% hike initially, which can extend up to 100% of the current RR rate and will hand it over to the landless," said an official.
 
 The department has made a provision of Rs 40 crore for the scheme for 2018-19.
