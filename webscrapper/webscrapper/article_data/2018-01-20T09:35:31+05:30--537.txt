LUCKNOW: Classmates and teachers of the 11-year-old girl student who has been booked for assaulting her junior described her as an introvert and a mediocre student. 

 The victim, a class I student, is in hospital since Tuesday. The girl, who was in a child reformative home since Thursday, was granted bail by the juvenile justice board on Friday. Both are students of   Inter College. 
 
 Set to turn 11 on Sunday, the girl continued to deny her involvement in the case during her counselling sessions. 
 
 A classmate of hers whom TOI visited said that the girl was an introvert and did not interact with others. She used to sit in a corner silently and never indulged in chatting or group work.
 
 Another student from her class said that once during half-yearly examination, the girl had slit her wrist with a blade. When caught bleeding, she told teachers that an invisible person had done it inside the bathroom, the girl told this reporter. 
 
 She also said that the girl often skipped exams. 
 
 The school's discipline in charge   said that the suspect was an average student. She took no interest in extra-curricular activities. He also recalled the incident when she had slashed her wrist. 
 
 Meanwhile, counsellors at the   observation home spoke to the girl for an hour on Friday. She continued to deny the allegation of stabbing the class I boy on Tuesday. 
 
 A counsellor told TOI that the mentally sound and alert girl showed no signs of aggression. 
 
 "On being asked about playing the blue whale game, she said she had not even heard of it," said the counsellor. Another counsellor said that the girl was showing all signs of a normal girl of her age. 
 
 She denied slashing her wrists ever and could not recall any such incident.
