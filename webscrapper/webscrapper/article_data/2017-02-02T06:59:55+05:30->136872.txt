CHENNAI: The city corporation has prepared an estimate of '  to repair the parks, pavements and nameboards damaged by   on December 12, 2016. Tenders were floated on Tuesday for the project under the State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF).

 “Using funds under the SDRF has strict guidelines where we can carry out only urgent restoration work and not capital work for a long duration,“ said corporation commissioner D Karthikeyan. “We had to compile the damage and prepare estimates to fit the guidelines, which is why it has taken so much time.“
 
 The most number of steel nameboards uprooted or broken were in Madhavaram, while Teynampet and Kodambakkam recorded no damage. The maximum number of parks damaged were in Adyar and Alandur, while Kodambakkam accounted for the most number of damaged footpaths.
 
 To make up for the loss of the city's green cover, the corporation has formed a committee comprising experts to identify tree planting spots. Saplings will be ordered from the forest department and   and avenue trees will be planted from July when survival rate is higher. “We don't want to plant in a rush but plant in places which are best fit to allow trees to grow without being vulnerable to natural calamities,“ said a senior official. “Since the state is facing a drought, we do not want to start a planting drive now when there is shortage to water our existing greenery.“
 
 A majority of the fallen trees have been stored in 78 open spaces, including playgrounds and parks, making them out of bounds for children. On Tuuesday, when DMK working president   raised the issue in the assembly, municipal administration minister S P Velumani said the delay in removing the tree debris was because of the poor response to the auctions. Senior corporation officials said the tree debris had been cleared across the city in early January.
