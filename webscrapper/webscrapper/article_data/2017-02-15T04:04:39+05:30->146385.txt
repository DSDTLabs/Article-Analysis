GURUGRAM: An intelligence report leak hinting at the ongoing Jat agitation in the state turning violent after February 19, has thrown the entire Haryana Police into a tizzy. 

 An inquiry has been ordered into the matter even as the police are in a damage control mode trying to remove traces of the report from the social media where it went viral soon after it was leaked.
 
 A senior district administration official told TOI on Tuesday that borders to Delhi will be sealed from February 18 midnight in view of the rising protests to maintain law and order in Gurgaon.
 
 The letter written by the criminal investigation department (CID) of Haryana Police to all DGPs, additional DGP (law and order), district police chiefs and deputy commissioners (except Panchkula and Mewat) on February 12, signed by SP (CID) Rakesh Arya, was leaked within 24 hours of it being sent.
 
 The letter says there is a rising dissatisfaction among the community members after their meeting with the government panel on February 11 did not yield the desired results.
 
  Not only this, the intelligence agencies fear the protests may turn violent after February 19. Also, the demonstrators want to observe February 19 as ‘Martyrs Day’, and more people are likely to join the agitation on this day. 
 
 Notably, 30 people had died across the state after the quota stir turned violent, of these 19 were Jats who died in police firing on February 19, 2016.
 
 The letter gives details of the nine sit-in sites, along with the number of people protesting there — around 18,000 to 20,000 in Jasia, Rohtak; 11,500-12,000 in Joli-Lath, Sonipat; 5400-5,500 in Rasalwala, Jhajjar; 4,400-4,500 in Ikkas, Jind; 1,000-1,100 in Devban, Kaithal; 2,200-2,300 in Dadri; 900-950 in Ramayan, Hissar; 330-340 in Dhanana, Bhiwani; and 555-575 in Ugra Kheri, Panipat. The letter also states that more women, youths and children are joining the demonstrators with each passing day.
 
 Sources said the department has taken the leak as a “breach in the communication system” and ordered an inquiry. A senior police officer said, “Fearing an outrage by the demonstrators, state DGP K P Singh even skipped an event in Gurgaon on Tuesday to review the law and order situation in the state.” 
 
 Inspector general of CID, Anil Kumar, has ordered an inquiry into the matter.
 
 “This is not classified information because these are common apprehensions, but it is information from an intelligence point of view. But there has been a leak from a unit and such lapses are not healthy for the organisation,” said Kumar. Meanwhile, the district administration and the police are devising a security plan to maintain law and order in Gurgaon.
