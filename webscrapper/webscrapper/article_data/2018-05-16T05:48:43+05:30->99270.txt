MUMBAI: Arrivals and departures at   were delayed on Tuesday after a private aircraft suffered a tyre burst on take-off, forcing a brief shutdown of the main runway. It led to flight diversions and go-arounds. 

 
  Around noon, a Bombardier Challenger CL-30 aircraft, VT-JSE, bound for Jammu, was on take-off roll from the main runway, a source said. "It suffered a tyre burst during take-off and was stranded on the runway. With the main runway occupied, flight operations into the airport had to be temporarily suspended," said an air traffic controller, adding that the closure did not last for more than 10 minutes.
 
  Iran Air's Tehran-Mumbai flight IR-180 did a go-around, while   flight 9W302, scheduled to land at 12.20pm, was diverted to Vadodara, where it refuelled and eventually landed in Mumbai around 2.30pm. VVIP aircraft movement due to President  's visit to Mumbai aggravated delays. Flightradar 24, a site that tracks air traffic movement in real-time, said the average delay for arrivals was 30 minutes and for departures around 50 minutes.
