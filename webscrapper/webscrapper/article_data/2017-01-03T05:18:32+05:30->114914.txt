LUCKNOW: On January 1,   patriarch   issued two orders: first, declaring CM   Yadav’s SP convention unconstitutional; and, second, a letter addressed to party vicepresident Kiranmoy Nanda, sacking him from the primary membership of the party for attending the meeting. 

 Issued a few hours apart, however, Mulayam’s signatures on the letters do not match, which has given rise to chatter over which of the two is genuine. Justifying his coup against his father, Akhilesh had said on Sunday that “some people” had taken control of Mulayam, getting him to sign documents and take decisions, some flagrantly against the interest of the party. 
 
 While Akhilesh made several oblique references to an “outsider” meddling with the Yadav family’s affairs and influencing Mulayam, this was perhaps his first public reference to Mulayam’s failing health. Akhilesh had added, “There are only three months left (for the election results). There’s no telling what documents some people may get him to sign, or what decisions they may get him to take. In the greater interest of the party, I had to intervene. In the end, if the Samajwadi Party forms the government, there will be none who’d be happier than Netaji. He has been my leader and father, and I will continue to respect him. No one can hurt this fatherson relationship.” 
 
 Smarting over Mulayam’s decision to remove him from the post of party president in September, Akhilesh had also referred to the “typewriter that scripted the SP’s unravelling”. Holding Amar Singh responsible for the feud and for influencing   against him, Akhilesh alleged the Rajya Sabha MP had practically dictated the letter announcing his removal as state president.
