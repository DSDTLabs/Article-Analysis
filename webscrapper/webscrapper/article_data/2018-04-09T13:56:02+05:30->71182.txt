JAIPUR: Noisy scenes were witnessed at the   when a flight from Jodhpur to Delhi made an emergency landing here on Saturday evening after aircraft developed a technical snag.

 According to   authorities,   flight started from Jodhpur at 3.50 pm and landed at the Jaipur airport at 4.10 pm. 
 
 “It was informed that the flight had some technical snag and it was thus grounded at the Jaipur airport safely,” said a senior officer of the Jaipur airport.
 
 Thereafter, the passengers created a ruckus and asked the airlines authorities to arrange for another flight to Delhi.

 “This has become a day-to-day affair of the airlines these days. This is nothing less than cheating,” said an annoyed passenger.
 
 Airlines authorities were on the job of rectifying the technical snag.
