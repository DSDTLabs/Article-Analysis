GURUGRAM: Residents of sectors 21, 22 and 23 have complained of water shortage in their areas for the last five days, and claimed they have been forced to buy water from private tankers for hefty money. 

 Members of RWAs said MCG officials have been unable to fix the problem. 
 
 “We raised this issue with MCG. They said the supply was snapped by  ,” said Colonel Omed Singh, president of the Sector 21 RWA. 
 
 “This happened last month as well. Since last week, our water supply has been erratic. We’re unable to carry out routine work,” Rahul Gupta, another resident, told TOI.
 
 Singh also said that they also had a newly constructed tubewell in the area which wasn’t operational. “It’s not working because MCG didn’t fix a motor pump to bring out the water. Had it been working, our water woes could have been alleviated.”
 
 In Sector 23, residents said they too were facing a severe crisis, but the issue appears to have been somewhat resolved. 
 
 “Three days ago, we faced the same crisis that Sector 21 still finds itself in,” said Bheem Singh, president of the Sector 23 RWA. “But it has now abated to some extent.”
 
 Huda officials said water shortage is a common problems in these areas in summers. “Basically, some areas of   Phase 1 on one side of the city, and sectors 22 and 23 on the other side, are located at the tail end of the supply line. Before it can reach them, 80% of the water supply gets exhausted,” an official said.
 
 MCG executive engineer Vikas Malik, who is responsible for the area’s supply, did not return calls from TOI.
