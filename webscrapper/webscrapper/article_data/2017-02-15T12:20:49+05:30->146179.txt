 Shraddha Ruhikar, another participant, said, “This initiative is against violence of any kind that women are subjected to. Women out there who are going through instances of violence should know that they are not alone in this.”
 
 Sonam Tharpure of Samyak said, “If one is a victim of violence, it is always better to share it with those who can help. Hiding it will only make it worse.”
