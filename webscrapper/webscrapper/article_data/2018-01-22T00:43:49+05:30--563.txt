Coimbatore: Global private equity (PE) giant Blackstone has shelved its plan to buy the Brookefields mall, the first such property to open in the city. Blackstone had signed a term sheet with the current owners of the mall including N Radhakrishnan, managing director of Chennai-based Tarapore Constructions and M Balasubramaniam, director of Mangal Tirth Estate, which owns the Spencer Plaza mall in Chennai, to acquire the mall in late 2016. The deal, which was in the final stages of negotiations, was pegged at Rs 450 crore. If it had gone through, it would have been the biggest property deal in the city in the commercial realty space. “The deal fell through because of some misunderstandings on the financial front in the last leg. Blackstone has shelved the plan to buy the mall as they were not able to come to an agreement with the owners,” sources said.  The current owners of the mall were looking to sell to cut down their debt that was pegged at around Rs 125 crore, sources said. Since the owners were able to bring down the debt to manageable levels due to the increase in cash flows from projects, they decided not to exit the mall. “They (current owners) do not need the money now,” sources said. New York-based Blackstone Group LP, the largest PE manager in the world with assets under management of over $350 billion across the globe, declined to comment about the deal.
