PUNE: Thanks to the rising pollution levels, harmful pollutants have even started invading our homes. A group of students from  , in association with the Climate Reality Project India ( ), has decided to put up a fight. Their choice of weapons:  .

 This World Environment Day, the group is encouraging citizens to adopt plants that can produce more oxygen and clean the air indoors. Special focus is on Vimannager residential societies.
 
 Col Shashikant Dalvi (Retd), district manager of CRPI, said pollution levels in the Vimannagar area have risen manifold due to the increase in vehicular movement around the Lohegaon airport, Vishrantwadi and Kharadi areas. “With rising pollution in the area, pollutants have entered people’s homes. We are encouraging people in Vimannagar to adopt plants. Once a plant is brought home, residents will invariably care for it. These plants generate more oxygen and can purify the air indoors,” he said.
 
 According to Shivam Singh, of ExploreiT, which is associated with the initiative, “We are promoting the areca palm which has numerous environmental benefits.” He said while all plants have enriching properties that can improve the quality of air, areca palm is considered the most efficient air purifier. “This plant can survive in low light as well as high temperature. The plant has a great mechanism to absorb harmful gasses like acetone, xylene and toluene emitted from petroleum products and wooden furniture,” he added.
 
 He said a week-long initiative — Adopt a Plant — will be organised at parks, schools, colleges and other public places in Vimannagar.
