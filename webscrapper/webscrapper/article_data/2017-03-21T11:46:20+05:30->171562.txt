BIJNOR: Nearly six months after her caesarean operation, 28-year-old Nootan, a resident of   village here, continued to experience excruciating stomach ache. The reason behind the pain was discovered in March, 2017 when a sponge came out while she was defecating. 

  "My daughter was admitted in a local nursing home for a cesarean operation in October, 2016. During the operation, doctors left a sponge in her stomach. Two days after her delivery, she felt stomach ache. She complained to the doctor about the pain. She was treated there for several days but the doctors could not do anything. Later on December 29, 2016, she was admitted to   for further treatment. Doctors conducted several medical check ups and cured the infection. But, after 10-15 days, her condition again deteriorated," said Dheer Singh, district president of BJP's  . 
 
  On January 8, 2017, she was again admitted in a local hospital for treatment but it didn't help. She then consulted AIIMS doctors on March 15, 2017 and they recommended another surgery. But one day, while she was defecating a sponge came out. Her family members found her unconsciousin the toilet and recovered the sponge. They later took the sponge to a doctor who told them that it is used during operations to absorb blood," said Singh. 
 
  "After piecing together the whole story, we reached the nursing home and met the doctor who had conducted the operation. She called her staff and misbehaved with us. After this, we met district magistrate   and demanded a probe in the matter," Singh alleged. Speaking with TOI, the district magistrate said, "I will get an inquiry conducted in this regard. If the doctor is found erring, strict action will be taken." Chief medical officer   told TOI, "A three-member team has been formed for the investigation. I have instructed the team to complete the probe within two days."
