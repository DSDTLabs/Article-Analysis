A day after heavy rain created havoc in the city, residents raised questions over the authorities’ monsoon preparedness.

 On Friday, various parts of the city were still seen battling water stagnation even as access to some areas remained restricted due to uprooted trees and poles blocking them. Unfinished civic works at certain pockets only made matters worse.
 
 
 “On our appeal, a telecom operator had dug the road outside our gated community, which falls under the   gram panchayat, to lay an underground cable line. We have been requesting them to restore the road, but in vain. As a result, the entire stretch has turned into a ditch, which fills up with water each time it rains. On Thursday, the situation was no different and led to several vehicles getting stuck there,” said  , general secretary of Alkapur Township, Neknampur.
 
 There were similar complaints of apathy by people of other areas. “Soon, monsoon will hit the city and I am not sure if GHMC is prepared to handle it. Instead of pumping out water after every downpour, GHMC should take appropriate steps to ensure that water does not accumulate in the first place,” said   whose bike was damaged on Thursday due to water logging at the   in Baghlingampally.
