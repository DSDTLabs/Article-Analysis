CHANDIGARH: Punjab Congress president   took on the   (AAP) on Tuesday over its allegations of breach of security where electronic voting machines (EVMs) are kept, saying it was an “excessive display of paranoia”.

 “The allegations indicate complete demoralization in the party in the face of imminent defeat in the recently concluded assembly elections,” he said.
 
 He said AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal was leading the way, and every person from the party was running to the   (EC) with one or the other “frivolous” complaint. “The party is preparing ground to save face after the declaration of results,” said Amarinder.
 
 He demanded that, as in the case of judiciary, there should be provisions in EC rules to penalize political parties and candidates found indulging in unsubstantiated complaints and petitions. “All serious parties look up to the EC as being a neutral and non-partisan democratic institution,” he said. “This is not a healthy sign and reflects AAP’s immaturity.
 
 Amarinder said the uproar triggered by AAP over the removal of some old EVMs in Patiala was the latest piece of “theatrics” staged by Kejriwal’s party to pave ground for raising suspicions about the accuracy of EVMs. He said that AAP’s Patiala candidate, Dr Balbir Singh, had made a nuisance of himself a few days ago, and tried to corner the EC with his “injudicious and senseless” demand for permission to set up his own CCTV at a counting centre. “The entire drama is evidently being enacted by Kejriwal and his cronies to justify their eventual electoral defeat, which would be officially declared just about three weeks from now,” he added.
 
 Amarinder said Kejriwal should accept his party’s defeat “gracefully” and not lower the dignity of institutions like the EC.
