NEW DELHI: Weightlifting history will remember the name of India's  , who on day one of the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia delivered a performance for the ages. The 23-year-old world champion and CWG record holder from Imphal, Manipur smashed her way to a new Games and personal record on Thursday by breaking six records in six lifts to win gold in the women’s 48kg event. 

 
 
 
 With a combined effort of 196kg to smash her previous career best of 194kg - achieved last year at the World Weightlifting Championships - Saikhom also bettered the silver medal she won in Glasgow four years ago. Her record-setting performance was highlighted by a CWG and personal best lift of 86kg in the snatch category - all in the span of six minutes - and 110kg in the clean & jerk. This combined lift surpassed the CWG record of 175kg set by Nigeria’s Augustina Nwaokolo in Delhi in 2010 by some distance. 
 
 Saikhom, who in February was crowned Weightlifter of the Year award at the Mahindra Scorpio Times of India Sports Awards (TOISA) for her gold medal winning lift at last year’s World Weightlifting Championships, has widely been hailed as the successor to India’s first individual woman medalist at the Olympic Games, Karnam Malleshwari. Her performance on day one at the Gold Coast CWG has now enhanced that significantly, and raised hopes of an Olympic medal in Tokyo in 2020. 
 
  
  
 Saikhom, who works as a senior ticket checker with the Indian Railways, stepped up as the last of the 11 women weightlifters in the 48kg event at the   1 and began with a CWG record lift of 81kg in the snatch category and then improved that to 84kg and finally 86kg, which surpassed her personal best of 85kg that had been recorded at the World Championships in 2017. 
 
 This amazing showing put her 10kgs ahead of the next competitor and saw her advance to the clean & jerk at first place. In this category, Saikhom recorded lifts of 103, 107 and 110 to clear the competition by a long margin. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Marie Ranaivosoa of Mauritius claimed silver with a total lift of 170kg (76 in snatch and 94 in clean & jerk) and bronze went to Sri Lanka’s Dinusha. Gomes claimed silver with a total lift of 155 (70 in snatch, 85 in clean & jerk). 
 
 Born in Imphal East, Manipur, Saikhom took up weightlifting in 2007 after being inspired by another pioneer of Indian weightlifting, Kunjarani Devi. It did not take much time for the young girl to make heads turn as she won gold in junior levels at the South Asian Junior Games and the 2011 International Youth Championships. Her first major success at the international level came at the 2014 CWG, when she finished behind her team-mate Sanjita Chanu to take home a silver medal. This was followed by gold at the 2016 South Asian Games and the 2017 Commonwealth Championships.
