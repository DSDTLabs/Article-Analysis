NEW DELHI: The Delhi   on Wednesday   the Jawaharlal Nehru University ( ) after going through the   of a   set up to   allegations of   against a professor.

 “I thought you were taking constructive measures to provide a safe environment to them. You (JNU) said on the last date that you were setting up a fact-finding committee which will hear them. I see a complete turn around as you are saying you do not know who the eight students are and did not call them (to be heard before the committee),” said Justice Rajiv Shakdher while hearing a plea by eight students demanding action against professor Atul  . 
 
 However, the university maintained that the committee cannot go into the issues of alleged misconduct by the professor or the complaints of sexual harassment as these aspects will be examined by the internal complaints committee (ICC). It further claimed that the ICC was unable to take up either of the two aspects as the complainants were refusing to appear before it.
 
 Advocate Vrinda Grover, appearing for the women students, told the court that her clients did not have any confidence in the ICC in view of the varsity’s conduct towards them till now and pointed out that despite HC’s May 2 order, directing that Johri should not visit or use laboratory no 409 of the department of life sciences where the students work, it is still under his control and he has access to it. Meanwhile, with Johri’s counsel insisting that since his family stays on the campus he can’t leave it, HC indicated it will issue directions on May 29.
