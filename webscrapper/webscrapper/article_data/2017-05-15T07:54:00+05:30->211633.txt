GURUGRAM: As heat wave is sweeping the district,   residents have blamed civic authorities for the acute water shortage they have been facing for a week and called for immediate action to tackle the situation.

 Reportedly, the pipe connecting Sector 47 with the master   at Rajiv Chowk was permanently damaged after authorities carried out repair work on it a couple of weeks ago, after the master pipeline was shifted for underpass construction. “Every second day, the pipeline to our sector breaks down. Huda and MCG say they are carrying out repair work either on the master or sector pipeline. Ever since the underpass construction began, we’ve been facing a  ,” said Virender, a Sector 47 resident. 
 
 Residents said the repair work has caused permanent damage to a valve in the pipe to their sector. “ Regular leaks in pipelines and technical glitches are evidence why authorities did not want to shift the pipeline from Rajiv Chowk,” said Sahil Kumar Saini, another resident. 
 
 “There has been a shortage in supply to the area for two months. But the situation worsened last week. Even the sector’s underground storage tank, which used to provide water during shortages, has not received any,” said  .
 
 Some residents said the sector’s three authorised tubewells were also not working. “None of the three tubewells work. For the last 10 days, we’ve been solely dependent on tankers,” said  , a mother of two. 
 
 “We’ve been responding to complaints from the sector. There was some issue in a valve, which was resolved within a day. At present, water is being supplied to the sector,” said a Huda official. Sector 47 has nearly 750 three-storey Huda plotted houses and 20 residential societies.
