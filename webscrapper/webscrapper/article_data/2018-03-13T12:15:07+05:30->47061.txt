PATNA: After a gap of 14 years,   is all set to get a Rajya Sabha seat from   with the support of RJD, CPI(ML) and HAM(S). R K Dhawan was the last elected Congress candidate from Bihar in 2004. With only six candidates, including Congress’s  , filing their nomination papers till the last day of nominations on Monday for the six vacancies, even the voting will not be needed. The last day to withdraw papers is March 15.

 However, Congress did not announce its candidate till the last moment as names of IPL chairman Rajeev Shukla, former Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar, party general secretary  , CLP leader Sadanand Singh and former MP Nikhil Kumar were doing the rounds. It was also feared that former state Congress chief  , who recently joined JD(U) led by CM Nitish Kumar, could trigger some kind of revolt among the 27 Congress MLAs. 
 
 Bihar Congress’s officiating president Kaukab Qadri said   enjoyed the support of 40 MLAs, including nine surplus votes of ally RJD after fielding Manoj Jha and Ashfaque Karim, three of CPI(ML) and one of HAM(S). “I had proposed five names to party president Rahul Gandhi at our meeting in Delhi on Wednesday last. He selected Akhilesh,” Qadri said.
 
 A candidate requires 35 MLAs to win one Rajya Sabha seat from Bihar. CPI(ML) has already announced its support to the opposition candidates, either of RJD or Congress. HAM(S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi, who is the party’s lone  , recently quit NDA and joined RJD-led Grand Alliance.
 
 After filing his papers, Akhilesh said: “I have the maximum number of votes with RJD and CPI(ML) support.”
 
 However, not everyone in the state Congress seemed to be happy with Akhilesh’s candidature. “Meira is a recognized dalit face while Shakeel represents the minorities. Akhilesh has come from RJD. It seems party’s Bihar in charge CP Joshi took other things into consideration while finalizing the candidate. Many people in the party are not happy with the selection,” a senior Congress functionary said.
