Nagpur: It is not unusual for a newly-wed couple to get flowers and congratulatory remarks from well-wishers, but if the roses come from khaki-clad security men, then it is surely a special occasion.

 The first journey in the train together for a couple, which was also just embarking upon their journey in life, was made extraordinary by the   ( ), Western Railway, on Monday. The couple was about to board   from platform number three. The couple, accompanied by an entourage of the groom’s relatives, was heading towards Bilaspur.
 
 RPF chief, Senior Divisional Security Commissioner Jyoti  , said he was surprised at the sight of a couple, complete in their wedding attire, including ornaments, on platform number one, heading towards the Railway Over Bridge ( ). “I immediately asked my colleagues to get some roses and meet the couple on platform number three.”
 
 The record-setting RPF team, which had already set a Herculean benchmark of crossing 1,000 ‘good works’ in the last calender year, took swift action and responded to their chief’s out of the box thinking. Acting as good ambassadors of the Indian Railways, a RPF team congratulated the a newly-wed couple and made them feel special during their first ever journey together in train. The RPF squad ensured woman constable   and assistant sub-inspector Bhurasingh Baghel helped the entourage board the train.
 
 The couple was not only presented red roses by the RPF team, but was also given advice on security tips for a safe and sound journey. “The couple and their guests were surprised by our gesture, but were glad to accept our blessings,” said Satija.
 
 “I made it a point to speak regarding security issues to the couple, especially the bride, who had several ornaments on her. Later, we ensured the railway coach patrolling party too kept a vigil on the wedding party and their luggage till they reached Bilaspur,” he said.
