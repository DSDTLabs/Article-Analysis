ALWAR: The cattle smugglers of Mewat are using every trick to evade law. In the latest incident, the   police seized a truck with sacks of potatoes placed on racks above to hide bovines under it.

 The   police station intercepted the vehicle on Jaipur-Agra national highway and arrested three smugglers. As many as 14 cows were rescued from the truck. “When we searched the vehicle, we found sacks of potatoes kept carefully above on modified racks. Under these racks we found tied up cows,” said an official.
 
 In order to fool the cops, the smugglers had changed the registration plate of the truck. “We found six registration plates. These registration numbers belonged to the states of Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, etc.,” said the official.
 
 Police identified the smugglers as Zahid (34), a resident of   in Uttar Pradesh; and Asghar (24) and   (37), both residents of Agra in Uttar Pradesh. A case under multiple sections of the Rajasthan Bovine Act has been registered against the duo.
 
 Primary investigation suggested that the trio had been illegally transporting cows from Tonk to Madhya Pradesh through Agra. “They have been arrested and interrogated at Mathura Gate police station to track the whereabouts of other gang members,” an official said.
 
 The Bharatpur police said that it had set up multiple check-posts on the national and state highways to keep an eye on suspected cattle and gun smugglers. “We found the truck to be highly suspicious. Its registration number looked fake and, hence, we asked the driver to pull over. He was hesitated and said that he was transporting vegetables. On closer inspection, we found cows packed in the vehicle under sacks of potatoes,” officials said.
