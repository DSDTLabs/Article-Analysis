The   was started back in 2001 by the then mayor   to encourage sports in the city. The championship, which back then concentrated only on cricket, was bankrolled by the   Corporation, and a lack of funds meant that the sporting event had to take a backseat. Although it was revived by former mayor   in 2014, the present Mayor,  , has given the championship a new lease of life by re-launching it this year. And like in 2014, the sporting event this year also focused on a range on indigenous sports such as kabaddi, kho kho, wrestling and body building, apart from cricket, badminton, table tennis, swimming and football. The Mayor spoke to   about the success of the championship and what the plans for it in the future. Excerpts…

 
 
 We tried to hold it last year, but the budget constraints wouldn’t allow us to do so. I recently met with corporation members and asked them when they could spend crores on development projects, why not spend Rs 10 lakh on an event that benefits sportsmen? That set the ball rolling. 
 
 
 
 We want to encourage and help people from the district level onwards. I know that the players that took part in the championship will go ahead to make us proud, winning laurels for the city.
 
  
  
 
 
 Yes, because along with cricket, it is important to promote our indigenous sports as well.
 
 
 
 Sitting in an office for hours on end can result in ill health. Also, everyone is so stressed out these days. When you play a sport, a lot of that stress is alleviated. Everyone was happy that Belagavi City Commissioner Shashidhar Kurer stayed on the ground the whole time; he played cricket as well. This became a talking point. I ensured that there were special sports for women as well this year. 
 
 
 
 This year’s Mayor Trophy had special games for women, who were treated to games such as Straw in the Hair, Lemon and Spoon Race and Musical Chairs.
