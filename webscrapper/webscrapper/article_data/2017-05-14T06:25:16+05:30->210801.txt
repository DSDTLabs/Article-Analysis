PATIALA:   teachers working under   reiterated their demand for time bound promotions on the line of other states. The Union ministry of health and family welfare (medical education unit), in its letter dated December 30, 2016, ordered grant of time-bound promotions to medical teachers and de-linking of designation from  

 In a joint press release, Dr H S Sohal and Dr D S Bhullar, president and general secretary of Punjab State Medical and   Association respectively, said time-bound promotions are a longstanding demand of the medical and dental faculty but was being ignored by successive state governments. 
 
 Dr Bhullar said the faculty demanded only re-designation without monetary benefits. “We have already submitted the draft notification to the government. If the order of the Union health ministry is implemented in state-run medical and dental colleges, it will lead to a drastic decrease in court cases and automatic increase in the number of senior faculty members and more PG seats. It will also boost the morale of faculty members waiting for promotion for years. Besides, there will be no financial burden on the state government. We appeal to the chief minster Captain Amarinder Singh and medical education minister   to take up the matter on priority basis and call a meeting of the association to discuss the matter.”
