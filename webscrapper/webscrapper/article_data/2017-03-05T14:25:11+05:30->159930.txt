Disappointed over the dull response his recent movie, ‘Yaman’ has received from the audience,   is rumoured to be attending Telugu classes.

 The star is apparently eager to improve his Telugu skills as he wants to dub for himself in his upcoming movie ‘Indrasena’. 
 
 He will appear in a double role in this film. Directed by debutante director  , the flick will be simultaneously released in both Tamil and Telugu.
