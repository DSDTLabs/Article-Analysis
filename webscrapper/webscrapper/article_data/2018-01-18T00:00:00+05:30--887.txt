 is going to be seen in probably his first ever ‘longish cameo’, as implied, on the Kannada film screen. His scenes in the film in question —   — have been in the news for the attitude and style that oozes out of each of the stills that have been shared so far. Ahead of the film’s release this week, we asked Sudeep what it was that made him choose to essay this role.

 “There was no particular reason why I choose to do this role, except for the fact that the   was so passionate and enthusiastic about their project. They came to me with this sense of clarity about what they wanted and why they wanted me there. The offer came to me at a good time, too, when I was able to take some time off to be a part of this team. I did not know the makers before this, as the only connection I had to this project was the director of photography — Chandru,” says Sudeep.
 
 While the actor has not yet watched the entire film, he tells us, “I was   with the way they   my scenes. There was a certain class to it. After I watched the trailer, I was impressed with the way they have treated their entire film. I really liked some of the dialogues in the trailer; I think it is designed well and is visually attractive. You can work out all these details only when you have a story with substance that you can work with. I look forward to watching the entire film.”
