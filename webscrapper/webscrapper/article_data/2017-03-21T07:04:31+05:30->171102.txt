 The griha pravesh (house warming) by the chief minister was held later in the evening. 
 
 He visited the official residence for only 15 minutes after meeting state government officials at Lok Bhawan. 
 
 “Maharaj ji bhog vilas se door hain. Woh saada jeevan jeetein hain. Isliye jo bhi taamsi aur rajsi vatavaran tha, ussey shuddhikaran puja se door kiya gaya (The Yogi abstains from luxury. He leads a simple life. So the place has been cleansed of all negative vibes by conducting the pooja),” said Praveen Shastri, one of the five purohits, who came from Gorakhpur for the ceremony. 
 
 Led by  , the purohits came from Gorakshnath Sanskriti Mahavidyalaya and performed the puja from 11 am to 12.30 pm. 
 
 The mahurat (auspicious moment) for entering the new house was any time after 11 am, Shastri told TOI, adding that initially, there was information that the chief minister would be arriving around 1 pm, but couldn’t make it as he was busy in meetings with deputy chief ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma and cabinet ministers  , besides chief secretary Rahul Bhatnagar, DGP   and principal secretaries (home and information),   and Navneet Sehgal, respectively, at VVIP Guest House.
 
 The purohit shared with TOI that Aditya Nath Yogi will continue with his routine of feeding cows before his breakfast, though it was not confirmed whether the cows would be bred at the CM’s residence or not.
 
 Almost all the doors at the CM’s residence now bear the swastikasymbol or have shubh laabh written on them, including the main gate, said Shastri, adding that vaastu yantra was installed and vastu puja performed to rid the premises of evil and negative vibes. No date has been fixed so far though there is speculation that the CM would shift into this residence by March 28.
