It is the most influential dera in the region and has following in different states, including Uttar Pradesh, where the BSP has already forged an alliance with the SP and is expected to post a major challenge to the BJP in the 2019 parliamentary elections. Sources revealed that in the next few months BSP supremo   may also visit the dera. 
 
 When asked, Raju confirmed that he called on the Dera Beas chief. “I sought his blessings and discussed different social issues. I also told him about the prevailing situation in the country, including increasing conflicts in society, atrocities against Dalits and attempts to tinker with the spirit of the Constitution,” he said.
 
 Interestingly, this meeting comes at a time when the BSP has already started stitching alliances in different states and is expected to play a crucial role in the 2019 parliamentary elections. The dera also draws a major section of its followers from among Adidharmi/Ravidassia community members, who also form core voter base of the BSP in Punjab as well as in UP.
