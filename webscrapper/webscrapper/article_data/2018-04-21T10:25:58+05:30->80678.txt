JAIPUR:   and one failed attempt,   of 2017 for   and   in   is going to be held on April 22. The much awaited exam is taking place for 333 PhD and 258 MPhil awards in 38 academic departments of RU. The total number of aspirants vying for awards is 3104 from across the country.

 
 
  
 
 
 Even as the entrance exams are set to be held after a gap of two years, the number of seats are comparatively less due to shortage of senior faculty members in the RU. For instance, PhD exams will be held for 29 departments, aganist the total of 38 departments. “The faculty crunch has reduced the numbers of seats for research scholars,” said chief public relations officer of RU Bhupendra Singh Shekhawat.
 
 He said, “The number of seats is also less due to new guidelines of the UGC. Earlier, guides were called from affiliated colleges but new guidelines say that teachers from colleges which have research facilities are eligible to be the guides for PhD. Not many colleges have research facilities, reducing the number of research guides.”
 
 Earlier, teachers in all categories were allowed to have eight research students. “The new UGC guidelines limit the research guides to have maximum of eight students for professors, six for associate professors and four for assistant professors. This has also brought down the number of seats in the university.”
 
 The delay of two years in the entrance exam has affected the prospects of several students who are waiting for their JRF. Many students have gone for private institutions and to other cities to do their PhD by paying hefty sum, up to Rs 2 lakh a year.
 
 “This delay is because of the lethargic attitude of the university. They are conducting 2017 test this year and there is still no planning about the 2018 test. Instead, they should have conducted the test for both the exams together in 2018,” said a source.
