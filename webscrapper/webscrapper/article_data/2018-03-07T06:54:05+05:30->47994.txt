AHMEDABAD: A man stabbed his wife to death over a   in the Vastrapur area of the city on Tuesday, police said. The accused, Ashesh Gurung (34), is a   of a private bank on Ashram Road. The couple had moved to the city from their native place, Guwahati. The incident occurred at Suryavanshi Tower in Vastrapur, where the couple lived in flat B-804, given to Gurung 11 months back by the bank. The couple had married about a year ago, after being in a relationship for a while.

  
  
  Inspector M M Jadeja of Vastrapur police station said, “Gurung was under the influence of alcohol when he got into a heated argument with his wife, Pronita (29). He stabbed her with a knife in her chest, after which she fell unconscious. Gurung took her to the bathroom and washed away her blood. After that, Gurung kept drinking for about two hours. He then told a neighbour that his wife was hurt and sought help. A doctor who lives in the building was called. The doctor found that the body was cold and suggested that an ambulance be called. Paramedics arrived and called the police. At first, the accused tried to evade the cops’ questions but soon confessed to the crime.”
 
  
  Police sources said primary accounts of the neighbours said that the couple often quarrelled over domestic matters and they had had a heated argument about Gurung’s drinking habit on Monday as well. “On Monday, the couple fought over Gurung’s drinking habit as Pronita had smashed a liquor bottle on the floor so that Gurung couldn’t drink. On Tuesday, Gurung bought liquor from a bootlegger and the couple got into a fight which ended in the killing,” said police.
 
 Vastrapur police have registered an FIR against Gurung for murder and arrested him.
