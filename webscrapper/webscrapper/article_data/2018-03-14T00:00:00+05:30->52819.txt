For a debutant, director   is remarkably clear about the elements he wants to be a part of his film,  , especially in terms of the music. He roped in composer  , who is fresh from the success of his film #Chamak, to provide a new sound and feel for the songs and background score.
“The soundtrack of the film has five songs, each of which has its own story, with lyrics that spread positivity and happiness. Personally, I think that Idam Premam Jeevanam has one of the most comprehensive and soothing albums in recent times and Judah has truly woven his magic,” says Raghavanka. The title track, called Life Anthem, penned by  , has a retro feel to it, while Yeah Turning Point, written by Raghavanka himself, will be a mirror to every engineering graduate, says the filmmaker. Arare Arare and the Travel song, also written by Hriday, are numbers with upbeat beats.
 The director’s personal favourite, though, is the   song, penned by  , which Raghavanka says will go down as one of the best songs about parents in Sandalwood, after, of course, the Appa I Love You song from Chowka.
 The songs apart, the film’s background score is also a highlight, says Raghavanka, adding that Judah’s work is a marked departure from what has been seen and heard in most   films.
