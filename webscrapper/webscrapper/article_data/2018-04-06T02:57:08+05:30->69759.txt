NEW DELHI: The tendency of police to invoke extra penal provisions, more so in cases of sexual offences, results in denial of bail and languishing of   in prison.

 This is a preliminary finding of a two-member panel set up by the Delhi high court to examine the issue of women undertrials languishing in   in the city for several years.
 
 In a report the panel told HC that the police, while registering FIRs in sexual offence cases, often also adds charges relating to trafficking and under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, which make it difficult even for a woman accused to get bail.
 
 Set up by the high court in November last year, the panel gave its report after examining the records of several women lodged in the Tihar jail during their trial in connection with rape and other cases.
 
 The panel of professors Mrinal Satish and   from the National Law University said that magistrates determine whether an accused should be granted bail based on the stand of the police and prosecution.
 
 Apart from that, the panel also said that decisions of the   and the high court with regard to bail are not being followed by the lower courts.
 
 The report said that the only viable and long-term solution to the problem of extended undertrial incarceration was “systemic reform that reduces unnecessary arrests”. 
 
 The panel sought directions to the police to not register FIRs or file charge sheets against women for offences of rape, molestation, voyeurism, stalking or any of these crimes coupled with the penal provision of common intention, “unless they are accompanied by an allegation of abetment or conspiracy to commit these offences.”
 
 The panel’s report was filed in a PIL initiated by the high court on its own pursuant to a letter received from Supreme Court judge Kurian Joseph who recieved letters from around 600   from Tihar jail.
