Noida: A day after the Allahabad high court directed the   Authority to pull down any unauthorised construction on the ground floor of   in Sector 153, the Authority on Tuesday said it would follow the directions of the court ‘in letter and spirit’. The HC has given a 10-week deadline to the Authority. 

 “In keeping with the court’s directions, the Authority will ensure that the builder removes the temporary glass partition made in the stilt parking area,” Saumya Srivastava, deputy CEO, Noida Authority, told TOI. 
 
 The order has been issued to ensure that no portion of the stilt area, designated as the parking space, has been sold by the builder for any other purpose.
 
 The builder could not be reached for comment by TOI despite repeated attempts.
