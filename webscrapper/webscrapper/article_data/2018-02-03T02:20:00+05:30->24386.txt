Vijayawada: The Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) approved a budget of Rs 1,481.83 crore for the financial year 2018-19, which is an increase of Rs 146.42 crore over the previous year’s budget estimates. For the fourth consecutive year, the VMC did not change tax slabs.

 Of the proposed budget, Rs 605.25 crore are expected to come through revenue collections and Rs 816.38 crore through capital income for developmental works from state and central governments. The civic body has estimated the total expenditure at Rs 1,474.06, of which revenue expenditure will be Rs 496.13 crore and capital expenditure Rs 884.74 crore.
 
 The VMC presented an ambitious budget though it has missed targets under every head during the previous financial year. The total budget outlay during 2017-18 was pegged at Rs 1,327.64 crore, and expenditure was estimated at Rs 1,280.26 crore. However, the civic body could only get Rs 1,087.70 income, and spent Rs 1,053.10 crore according to the revised budget estimates.
 
 The revenue collection target for 2017-18 year Rs 562.21 crore, but the VMC could only get Rs 500.77 crore. The capital income was estimated at Rs 633.38 crore and it has got Rs 528.17 crore only. The big ticket infrastructure projects did not get any funds. The proposal to construct roads, bridges and expansion of Kaleswara Rao flyover, with an estimated cost of Rs 291 crore not received any funds, and the VMC has put the same proposal in this budget as well. A proposal to provide improved drinking water facilities in Vijayawada central constituency at a cost of Rs 52 crore, and in east constituency for a cost of Rs 43 crore also did not materialise.
 
  These two projects were included in this year’s budget, and the proposal for east constituency was increased to Rs 59.8 crore. Interestingly, Rs 3.48 crore was spent on the golden mile project in the last year, but no funds were allocated to this project this year. The golden mile project was taken up for smart initiatives such as traffic management, parking, connectivity, and Wi-Fi facility across the city.
 
 Development of Rajagopalachari Market and hill top areas also did not get any funds. The Rajagopalachari Market development was proposed at Rs 10 crore, and the proposal was shelved this year. The hill areas development proposal at a cost of Rs 7 crore was included in this budget, for which nothing was spent in the last year.
