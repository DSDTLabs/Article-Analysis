KOLKATA: At least 16 people were killed as   villages went to vote for panchayat polls on Monday, making it the bloodiest day of the state's tradition of violence-ridden election narratives. The first lives lost were that of a couple burnt in their sleep in South 24-Parganas, hours before the start of polling. 

 Miscreants intimidated voters , snatched ballot boxes and singed ballot papers, opened fire at political rivals, hurled bombs at cops and forced poll officials to leave booths, raising questions over the wisdom of the State Election Commission's decision to hold single-day poll. .
 
 Monday's toll was easily the highest 24-hour count in Bengal's recent electoral history. The SEC took cognisance of just six poll-related deaths and concluded that six others were "non-poll deaths" as they occurred more than 200 metres away from polling booths.
 
 The deaths were divided across parties, with Trinamool claiming at least four of the dead as its own. But it was the opposition that bore the brunt of the violence. CPM couple Debu and Usha Das were burnt to death in their sleep in Kakdwip while Independent supporter Sahin Shiekh was killed and seven others had bullet wounds in Murshidand's Naoda. BJP's Tapan Mandal was killed in  's Beldanga. CPM cadres Apu Manna and Jaggeswar Das fell to bullets fired by motorbike-borne Trinamool men in Nandigram.
