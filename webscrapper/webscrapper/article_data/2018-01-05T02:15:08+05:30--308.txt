GURUGRAM:  , the father of 7-year-old  , who died of dengue last September has written to   Narendra Modi, seeking intervention in his fight against the “corrupt health care mafia”.

 Singh was billed Rs 15.79 lakh by   in Gurgain for Adya’s 15-day treatment from August 31 to September 14. Since September 15, when she died, an FIR has been registered against an Frotis doctor while the licences of the in-house pharmacy and blood bank have been suspended.
 
 Singh, though, is demanding that the licences of the hospital and its doctors too should be cancelled. Singh wrote a letter to the Prime Minister on Tuesday, stating that the hospital had forged signatures of the parents on the treatment consent form. He also stated that one of the hospital directors “insulted” him by offering to pay Rs 35 lakh to remain silent.
 
 In his two-page letter, Singh raised four issues against the hospital. He has alleged that   and similar state medical boards are corrupt and ill-equipped to deal with incidences of medical negligence. He has also alleged a conspiracy between pharmaceutical companies, hospitals and doctors, using the example of alleged overbilling by the hospital in Adya’s treatment. Besides, he has said government ambulances refuse to carry patients from private hospitals, because of which Adya was denied use of a government hospital ambulance.
 
 “The Prime Minister can revolutionise the corrupt and inadequate healthcare system. This should be the greatest public service, and no other parent will have to see their child die,” said Singh.
