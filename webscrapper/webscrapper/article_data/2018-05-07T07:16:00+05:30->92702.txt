GURUGRAM: Residents of   2, who have been suffering from lack of working   in their locality since the first week of April, met MCG commissioner Yashpal Yadav on Saturday, who has assured them the issue will be resolved soon.

 Sushant Lok 2 residents have been dealing with non-functional streetlights since the discom snapped supply for not paying bills. An internal disagreement between the developer-managed RWA and residents is hampering the clearing of dues. The latter said Yadav has assured their streetlight woes will be resolved once the area is transferred to MCG.
 
 Residents alleged there is no transparency, and maintenance agency ProFac isn’t showing its accounts. “Our supply has snapped for such a long time due to non-payment of bills. I agree not everybody is paying maintenance to the agency, but a lot of residents are. They are also not repairing roads, yet charges have remained the same, ie. Rs 2.75/sq ft. So why are they complaining they have no money?” asked Neelu Sharma, a resident.
 
 “Yashpal Yadav assured us he will take up the matter with the discom,” some residents said. Yadav could not be reached for comment. All calls were thwarted with the ‘switched off’ message. When contacted, ProFac officials rubbished the allegations, stating that maintenance fees to the tune of Rs 17 crores was unpaid.
