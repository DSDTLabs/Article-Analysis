Gurgaon: The civic body will launch a   on   in the city on March 17 in a bid to create awareness among residents about the need for a clean city.

 The book, Waste Management 2017-18, prepared by city-based NGO Gurgaon First, will be launched during a special programme organised by the MCG, along with a team from the ministry of urban development and other stakeholders. 
 
 According to sources close to the development, different e-learning modules on waste management techniques will be showcased in the programme. The learning courses which have educational videos made on waste management will be open to anyone including the RWAs, residents and students.
 
 “The municipal corporation will felicitate a few people in the city who have done good work in the field of waste management so it acts as an inspiration for others to imbibe such practices,” said a source.
 
 The programme will be inaugurated under Rao Inderjit Singh, MoS, urban development. The handbook contains facts, statistics and opinions on the waste sector and is a timely release in view of several new policies on waste management that were announced in 2016. The Swachh Bharat Mission too is in full swing across the country,” said Shubhra Puri, owner of Gurgaon First. The handbook has five sections — the first section, Waste Overview, covers sectoral basics. Section II, Gurugram Scenario, provides an exclusive update on waste management in the city, progress made and the way forward. The third section, Expert Opinion will help generate insights.
