NEW DELHI: Twelve years after three serial blasts rocked Delhi ahead of Diwali and claimed 67 innocent lives, a sessions court on Thursday acquitted two of the three accused of all charges. The third accused, the alleged mastermind, was convicted on charges of aiding and funding a terror outfit and sentenced to 10 years in prison, a term he has served as an under-trial.

 The trial of Tariq Ahmed Dar, Mohammed Rafiq Shah and Mohammed Hussain Fazli began on January 14, 2008 on charges of terror, murder, criminal conspiracy , and several other provisions of the IPC,   and Explosives Substances Act. Most of the prosecution's charges had unravelled during the trial. The court said the prosecution had even failed to conclusively prove the involvement of the alleged mastermind, Dar, in the blasts. This led to all major charges against him being dropped.
 
 While Shah and Fazli have been acquitted, Dar faces charges in a related case of money laundering filed by the Enforcement Directorate. His lawyer Nisha K V Narayanan told TOI, “We will file a bail application tomorrow in the ED case.“
 
 There is another “minor“ arms case against him in Srinagar, she added. Following a nine-year trial, additional sessions judge   observed, “The failure of the prosecution to prove any involvement of   in the incidents only points to the direction that there is no evidence to hold that Mohammed Hussain Fazli was involved in any manner with the conspiracy behind the blasts.“
 
 The serial blasts took place at Paharganj, Sarojini Nagar and on a DTC bus in Govindpuri. Around killed 67 persons and injured 105 October 29, 2005. During arguments, senior public prosecutor Rajiv Mohan had asserted that following the blasts the investigation agencies had intercepted two calls ­ between Lashkar-e-Taiba operative Abu-al-Kama and Dar ­ following the blasts. The prosecution had alleged that the calls were made through a satellite phone number 008821621523999 on 9906719815. It was argued that the handset with the same IMEI was used on number 9906773692 ­ which admittedly belonged to Dar. According to the prosecu tion, forensic examination had proved that the voice of Dar, then a district manager with Johnson & Johnson. One number 9419475249 was shared by Abu-al-Kama with Dar. Investigations revealed that this number was being used on a handset with IMEI number 356207007579668. After the blasts, the same handset was used with number 9419449528.
 
 The prosecution also claimed that the number ending with digits 528 was being used by Fazli, a shawl trader, who led the police to Shah, a college student back then. Shah had been accused of planting a bomb in a bag in a DTC bus at Kalkaji. It was also alleged that Dar had got a denial issued on behalf of LeT, regarding its involvement in the serial blasts, in a local daily in Kashmir on November 4, 2005.
