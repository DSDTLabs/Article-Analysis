We’ve heard before that actor Sharan’s release this week,  , is a road movie, with nearly 70% of the narrative occurring during a journey undertaken by the main cast —  ,   Ranganath and Chikkanna.
The story, says director  , begins in Goa and winds up in North Karnataka, and the journey is technically only between these two neighbouring states. But as it turns out, in their quest to make a road movie look good, the team set out to different parts of the country. “Before we began shooting, we had identified several stretches of road in   where we could shoot. At the time, the surroundings were dry and barren, but by the time we came back to shoot, it had rained and the entire region was green. While it was beautiful, it was not the backdrop I needed for the film,” says Anil. 
 
 With the schedule all set and artiste dates in place, the team had no other go but to scout for suitable locations. “I needed roads in the midst of dry land and we found that along several stretches in Rajasthan. Similarly, even though the story begins in Goa, we shot some of those portions in  , as there are pristine beaches there. In effect, we travelled across large parts of the country, but audiences will not easily realise that, as we put up boards in   along the stretch that we shot at, be it Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, or the Indo-Pak border in Rajasthan. The places we travelled to have no connection to the narrative. The only reason we were there was because they had good roads that were ideal for the shoot,” says the director, adding that the only logistical nightmare was transporting the car that’s seen in the film from one location to the other.
