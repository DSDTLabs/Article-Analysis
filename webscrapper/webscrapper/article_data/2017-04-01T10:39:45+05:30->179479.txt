THRISSUR: The   project is being pursued only to ensure financial gains for middlemen, actor-director Sreenivasan said on Friday.
Inaugurating a `Tribals get-together' protest programme organised by the   at Vazhachal tribal colony, near the Athirappilli waterfalls, Sreenivsan said ample studies have emphasized that the project would be an environmental disaster and that it will not be economically viable.
 
 Pointing out the project would not be able to meet even 1% of the power demand of the state, Sreenivasan said it will destroy 138 hectares of dense forests which were immense reserves for bio-diversity.
 
 â€œThe government must recall that recently the   had to face stiff resistance for its mining project in Australia considering its impact on endangered species. Only people who lack wisdom would say that a project should be pursued even if it leads to wanton destruction of forests,'' he said.
 
 Even a small country like Bhutan has increased its forest cover from 60% to 70% to ensure quality air for its people.Ironically, the rulers here have been trying to destroy forests, Sreenivasan said.He assured that he would support the tribals in their fight against the project.DCC president T N Prathapan said apart from the Congress, environmentalists and civil society groups will stand with the tribals.
