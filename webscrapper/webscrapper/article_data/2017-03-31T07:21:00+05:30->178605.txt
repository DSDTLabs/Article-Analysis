PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Two persons arrested for burglary at a   shop in Chinchwad confessed to their involvement in vehicle thefts, too.

 The Pimpri police recovered nine stolen cellphones and seven motorcycles, together worth Rs1.55 lakh, from the duo — both criminals on police records. Acting on a tip-off, a Pimpri police team led by senior inspector Vivek Mugalikar zeroed in on the suspects, Krishan Jalnila (22) and Vishal Gunjal (22) from Chinchwad, on March 20.
 
 Mugalikar said constable   received information that the duo was selling stolen cellphone handsets near the vegetable market in Pimpri. “The police team comprising sub-inspectors Harish Mane and Vitthal Badhe laid a trap and took the suspects into custody,” Mugalikar said.
 
 Mane said the police recovered nine cellphone handsets and re-charge vouchers worth Rs35,000 from them. The suspects had ripped off the nut bolts of the roof of the cellphone shop at Ramnagar in Chinchwad in the early hours of March 19 and fled with the nine handsets, re-charge vouchers and   from the shop.
 
 “During interrogation, the duo admitted that they had stolen several motorcycles from different parts of the city over the past two years,” sub-inspector Mane said.
 
 He said the police had recovered seven motorcycles, including four stolen from the Pimpri area and one each from Wakad, Vishrantwadi and  , from them.
 
 Mane said Gunjal had three cases, including dacoity and thefts, registered against him. Jalnila has a case of dacoity against him. “We are probing if the duo was involved in other crimes,” he said.
