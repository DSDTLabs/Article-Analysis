BENGALURU: Voices are being raised in Karnataka in favour of Kambala -   held once in a year in   - close on the heels of 
  getting the government’s nod in the neighbouring Tamil Nadu. Pro-Kannada activists, led by senior leader Vatal Nagaraj, staged protest at Freedom Park on Sunday and demanded that the government must promulgate an ordinance on the lines of Tamil Nadu to lift the  .

 The pro-Kannada organisations are planning to lay siege to Raj Bhavan on January 25 in support of the demand that the ban on Kambala be lifted. On Monday, they are launching a bike rally from Mysore Bank Circle in Bengaluru to Mysuru.
 
 “It seems the Centre has bowed down to the pressure of Tamil Nadu, while it is meting out a step-motherly treatment to Karnataka. Kambala is a pure sport as compared to Jallikattu and both the Centre and state governments must take steps to lift the ban on the sport,” said Vatal Nagaraj. “The Kannada Okkoota (Kannda Federation) will lead the activist laying siege to Raj Bhavan and will organise the bike rally,” he added.
 
 The Karnataka high court’s division bench, headed by chief justice SK Mukherjee, in an interim order in last November stayed holding Kambala on a petition by PETA. Kambala committees have filed an interim application, seeking vacation of the stay and the court will again hear the case on January 30. 
 
 The demands of the pro-Kannada activists include that Prime Minister Narendra Modi must intervene in the issue of Kalasa-Banduri Nala project ensuring justice to Karnataka. 
 
 Vatal said that the protesters would burn an effigy of the Union government on Monday before the launch of the bike rally.
