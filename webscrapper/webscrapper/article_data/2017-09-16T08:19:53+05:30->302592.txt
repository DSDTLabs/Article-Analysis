CHENNAI: A 50-year-old businessman, who police said was upset over mounting debts, is feared dead after he jumped into the   from the Kotturpuram bridge on Friday evening. 

 A search and rescue operation was delayed by close to an hour and the body was yet to be traced till last reports came in on Friday night. Police are yet to register a case.
 
 Mohan Kumar of Lotus Colony in Nandanam paced the pavement adjoining the bridge for at least 15 minutes around 5pm, police said. A friend who saw him came over and asked why was walking up and down the pavement. Kumar simply handed him his cellphone and a card, scaled the parapet wall and plunged into the water below, the friend told police.
 
 Taken aback, the man cried for help and several passersby gathered. Someone alerted the fire and rescue services personnel but a team arrived at the scene only 45 minutes later.
 
 The firemen employed two boats, one an inflatable, in a search for Kumar but in vain. "We stopped the operation late in the evening due to lack of illumination," said a police officer. 
 
 Police said Kumar was upset after creditors went to his home to ask him to repay them. "He was depressed since then," a friend said.
 
 The bridge is an infamous suicide spot, with at least 30 people trying to kill themselves by leaping off it in the past five years. Carnatic   Nithyasree Mahadevan's husband jumped to his death from the bridge in December 2012. The corporation in 2015 planned a 6-ft-high wall along the bridge but the proposal is still pending.
