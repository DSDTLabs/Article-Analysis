LUCKNOW: After   with the   for cooperation in checking   and water management, another opportunity for Uttar Pradesh will be the regional station of the International   Institute (IRRI) of   in  .

 The TOI had reported that Manila, Philippines-based IRRI , a global organisation working in the field of rice research, intended to set up its first regional centre in Varanasi and it was waiting for Union govermentâ€™s approval. A cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Wednesday approved the IRRI regional centre in Varanasi aimed at boosting paddy production in eastern India, parts of Asia and Africa.Varanasi is parliamentary constituency of Narendra Modi and is also located in the eastern UP .
 
 Speaking to TOI, IRRI consultant Mukesh Gautam that Union government had approved the regional centre and most probably the prime minister would inaugurate it soon. Gautam added that the IRRI will help introduce new varieties of rice, increase production and encourage rice cultivation in countries like Africa where it is not produced.
 
 The IRRI consultant explained there are some states in the eastern parts, including eastern UP, Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa which failed to benefit from the Green Revolution as these parts had no irrigation facilities like in Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh. The productivity of paddy in the eastern part is low compared to northern and central regions and the IRRI regional centre would introduce flood and drought resistant varieties for them. IRRI would assist the farmers overcome weather challenges, said Gautam.
 
 This is another major international intervention in Uttar Pradesh in the Yogi government as earlier during the visit of the prime minister to Israel, UP Jal Nigam had signed an MOU for checking pollution in rivers and water management in the state.
