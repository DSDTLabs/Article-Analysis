Sonam, Rhea and Harshvardhan Kapoor’s mother,   Kapoor celebrated her 60th birthday recently in London where her husband   was shooting for his next ‘Mubarakan’. While son Harshvardhan was missing from the revelry as he was busy shooting for ‘Bhavesh Joshi’ in Mumbai, her daughters Rhea and   went out of their way to make their mother’s birthday a very intimate occasion.

 The ‘Neerja’ actress reportedly sent flowers to Sunita every day of the week leading to her birthday, and Rhea decorated the hotel room in which they were celebrating the birthday. Sunita must have felt deeply moved by the special gesture of her two daughters.
