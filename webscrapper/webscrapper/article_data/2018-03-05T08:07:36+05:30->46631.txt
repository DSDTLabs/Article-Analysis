'Interstellar' father and son,   and  , reunited at the 2018 Oscars red carpet.

 McConaughey was all praises for the 'Call Me By Your Name' star, even if he had no idea why he was the Oscar nominee's "spirit animal."
 
  
  
 "He's a good young man," the 48-year-old Oscar winner told to   at Red Carpet. "I played his father in it [Interstellar]. I saw natural talent and I also saw a real confidence. And when you see his work in Call Me By Your Name, it is a fierce performance, man."
 
 "He's dangerous in that performance and completely natural," he added. "He didn't have a false moment in it and he's here to stay. It's true, you see his work and it speaks for itself."
 
 Chalamet had shared a photo with McConaughey on   on Friday, alongside the caption, "spirit animal next 3 days."
 
  
  
 Talking about the same, the 'Dallas Buyers Club' star said, "Someone sent that to me about 30 minutes before I got here. I don't quite know what it means, but he went over there and he was showing the picture like, 'Look at this focus that you've got! I'm there for three days.' And I'm like, 'Good man, stay on it.' "
 
 Chalamet is nominated for Best Actor for his performance in 'Call Me By Your Name.' McConaughey won an Oscar in that category in 2014 for Dallas Buyers Club.
