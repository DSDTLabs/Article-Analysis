 The new series titled ' ', is a creative play on the well-known Marathi proverb Naktichya lagnala satrashe vighna, which means a person who keeps finding faults in others and faces several hurdles in life. The new series will premiere on Zee Marathi from tomorrow onwards. The first few promos of this serial are out, and they suggest that the serial will be a sort of swayamvar for Prajakta’s character. 
 
 
  
  
 
 Our source told us that the series will see Prajakta romancing   and   in the first few episodes. “Avadhoot Gupte too is on board for the next episode. The series will be a fun take on the whole arranged marriage scenario in 21st century,” the source added. 
 
 While it is rare to find so many Marathi film A-listers to be seen on a single fiction series in the form of several characters. We are waiting to find out how the story will pan out.
