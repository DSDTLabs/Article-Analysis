NEW DELHI: The   has asked an   to return to the US with her minor daughter and a toddler, refusing to interfere in child   with her estranged husband.

 A bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Deepa Sharma recently dismissed an appeal filed by the Delhi-based mother seeking to invoke HC’s jurisdiction to contest child custody, saying that only the US court can decide her plea.
 
  noted that in cases where the custody of children is involved, the law of the place which has the closest concern with the well-being of the spouses must govern the parties.
 
 “Merely because the wife decided to visit India along with her children to attend the marriage of her brother and then decided to stay back, cannot be a ground to deprive the US court of its jurisdiction to decide upon the matter of custody of the children. From the fact that she had travelled from the US to Delhi on a round air ticket, it is evident that she was to return after attending the wedding. It was only on landing in Delhi that she decided not to go back,” the bench concluded.
 
 The woman had left India for the US when she was 17 years old and later married the 24-year-old husband who too has settled down in the same country. 
 
 In 2012, they were blessed with a girl but, as per the petition, soon differences developed between them.
 
 The husband initiated legal action when he realised that after reaching Delhi, his wife refused to return. When HC’s attempts at mediation and reconciliation failed, HC decided to go ahead on merits of the case.
 
 Simply because a marital discord took place between them, which made the wife flee from the US and seek refuge with her parents in India, “cannot be a ground for her to claim permanent custody of the children within the legal system of this country” the bench re-iterated, dismissing her plea.
