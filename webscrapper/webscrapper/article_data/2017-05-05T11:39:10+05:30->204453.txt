KOLKATA: When   took charge of the national team for the second time two years ago, one of his primary objectives was to help India break into the top 100 of   rankings.

 On Thursday, the widely-travelled British coach's wish was fulfilled as India jumped one place to be ranked No. 100 in the latest Fifa rankings released on Thursday. This is the first time in 21 years, and only the sixth occasion after Independence, that the Indian team has been ranked among the world's top 100.
 
 Constantine's side shares the No. 100 spot with Nicaragua, Lithuania and Estonia. India's best Fifa ranking is 94, achieved in February 1996.
 
 "As long as we keep heading up the ladder, I am happy. It means that we are heading in the right direction. There are major matches ahead and we cannot take things lightly. There's no place for complacency,"   said in an All India   Federation statement.
 
 According to former India captain  , a progress in rankings reflects a "perception" about a country's standard. "No doubt the national team has been doing well in recent times and it has been reflected in the latest Fifa rankings. Rankings are determined not just by a team's performance, but by many other factors. However, what it does is create a positive perception about a country's football," he said.
