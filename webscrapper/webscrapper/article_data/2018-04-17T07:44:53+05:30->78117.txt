CHANDIGARH: Even as the state government has demanded complete central assistance for minority scholarship schemes, there is a delay in release of existing share of financial assistance for the post-matric scholarship scheme for the scheduled castes (SC), the BCs (backward classes) and the minority communities besides the pending arrears for previous years.

 “A total of Rs 1,615 crore is still due to   under the post matric scholarship scheme. Arrears for the year 2015-16 were Rs 328 crore, for 2016-17 it was Rs 719 crore and Rs 567 crore for 2017-18,” said Punjab youth   president  , who plans to launch an agitation in the state to demand release of the pending amount. “In Punjab, where 32% population belongs to
 
 the SC communities, studies of 9, 14,132 students from the SCs were affected due to non-availability of the scholarship,” he said.
 
 Various schemes are being implemented for the development of SC, BC, economically weaker sections of the society and minority communities. During 2017-18, Rs 115 crore was released as backlog for 2015-16.
 
 Due to non-release of payment of fee claims, various institutions have filed petitions in Punjab and   high court.
 
 Meanwhile, an official said the state has also sought restructuring of centrally-sponsored schemes for better implementation with 100% central assistance. There is also a demand that maintenance allowance under pre-matric scholarship schemes for OBCs should be increased to facilitate the students with their daily education needs. The state also wants that parental income ceiling should be increased keeping in view the price index.
