Director Kamal was in the eye of the storm recently after he made a few statements about actress Vidya Balan making an exit from the film, and he says that it was misconstrued. 

 Responding to the allegations that by saying Vidya would have brought sexuality to  , apparently the ‘sexist’ statement made by director Kamal in a recent interview given to an online portal, the director says,“All I said is as a filmmaker, if Vidya, who acted in Silk Smitha’s biopic Dirty Picture, had played Aami, I would have got more freedom while portraying the sensual scenes. However, Manju has a different image in Kerala and so I had my limitations while portraying those scenes. However, Manju, who has already proved that she can play characters with sexual undercurrents in films like Kannezhuthi Pottum Thottu, has performed every scene without losing the emotional aspect of the character, that too with ease.”
