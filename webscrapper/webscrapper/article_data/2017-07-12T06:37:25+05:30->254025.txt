New Delhi: Twenty-four students of a Noida central school had a   escape after the bus they were travelling in caught fire near   station in east Delhi on Tuesday morning. The driver stopped the vehicle immediately, parked it on the roadside and evacuate the children before the fire could engulf it. Preliminary investigations suggest that a short-circuit in the AC unit caused the blaze.

 The incident took place around 1pm when the children from classes IV to VII were returning from a competition in central Delhi, accompanied by two teachers, in a Tempo Traveller. Police said the driver noticed smoke emanating from the engine as soon as he had crossed the Akshardham flyover and took a left turn towards NH-24.
 
 The students were evacuated and taken to a safe distance when the bus went up in flames. “There was a strong smell of wire burning from the engine and I asked the teachers not to panic. Then I parked the vehicle on the roadside,” said Ram Avatar Singh, the bus driver.
 
 Some passersby lent a helping hand and they broke open a window to pull out some of the kids, added Avtar. 
 
 Meanwhile, the fire department was informed after which three engines were rushed to the spot. The bus was completely gutted within a few minutes.
 
 Initial probe revealed that a loose wire in the engine caused a short-circuit, leading to the fire. 
 
 Police said that the vehicle belonged to a transporter in Noida and was being used as a   on a contract basis. Cops are probing whether the bus had a fire extinguisher in it. Some school staff reached the spot and arranged another bus to take the children home.
 
 The incident sparked a massive traffic jam as the cops had to close one carriageway for almost half an hour to douse the flames. “We had to stop traffic flow on one carriageway as the fire could have spread to other vehicles due to the congestion,” said a police officer.
