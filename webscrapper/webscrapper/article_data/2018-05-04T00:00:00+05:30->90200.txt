"I voted for the first time 15 years ago and I remember that the candidate I voted for won. I thought that I would go with my gut while voting, but I saw this candidate and really liked how he spoke to people, so I voted for him. And he actually did end up doing good work after he was elected. 

 "  are like a  , in which all the   are contestants and the   is all of us. The job of the host is to bring out the right contestant, and we need to do that with the candidates. If you want the right person for the job, you need to do your homework and pick accordingly. We tend to crib about bad roads and other civic issues, but who voted for that person? We did, so we are to blame as well. While voting, we shouldn’t look at the candidate’s religion or caste — all that should matter is that person will do a good job. 
 
 "When compared to previous years, I think that things are really changing now. Earlier, no one really bothered about the elections, but now, I am itching to go and vote. People are seeing that there are development works that need to be in place, but it is not happening. So, now I think the blame game is over and it is time for action. The younger generation is really keen on voting and they are doing a lot of research. Thanks to the awareness through campaigns such as   Maadi, I think that this year, the voting percentage will be higher than previous years."
