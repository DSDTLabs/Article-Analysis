GUWAHATI: The National Socialist Council of  , Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM), after 37 years of armed struggle and 20 years of negotiations, has finally settled for ‘co-existing together with shared sovereignty’ — a new experiment that a federal India with strong unitary features will embark on with the signing of apeace agreement soon. In a statement, a spokesperson of   (I-M) said, “As of now, the Nagas have agreed to co-exist together under shared sovereignty. The ongoing Indo-Naga political talks are progressing smoothly. The framework agreement, which will ensure peaceful coexistence between the Nagas and India with shared sovereignty, will surely usher in peace and a brighter political era for the Nagas.”

 In August, 2015, the NSCN (I-M) and the Centre signed a ‘framework agreement’ in the presence of Prime Minister   for a final settlement. Though the exact meaning of shared sovereignty hasn’t been divulged yet, sources hinted at the possibility of Nagas getting a separate constitution, flag, parliament and judiciary. The spokesperson added that the government, in the ‘framework agreement’ has recognized the Nagas’ sovereignty and has also accepted that the Nagas are unique people with a separate entity and sovereign rights. “India has recognized the uniqueness of Naga history and culture.
 
 The Nagas were independent before the arrival of the British. Only a part of Nagalim was conquered by the British. There is no merger agreement between the Nagas and India. India invaded Nagalim and set up arbitrary boundaries ” the spokesperson further said.
