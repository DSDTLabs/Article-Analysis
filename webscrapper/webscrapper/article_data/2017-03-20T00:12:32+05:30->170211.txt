Actor   has been busy with the Kannada-Tamil bilingual Prema Baraha, which he is currently dubbing for. The Arjun Sarja-directorial marks Chandan’s   debut, while it also is Aishwarya Arjun’s   launchpad. Chandan recently revealed to us that he taught himself how to read and write Tamil in just three hours. “Since this is a bilingual and requires me to know both languages, I decided to learn how to read and write Tamil. You might find this crazy, but all it took was going on YouTube and following a couple of online sessions keenly and I can now read and write the language easily,” says Chandan. The actor, who was last seen in Luv U Alia, after which he went on to take part in Bigg Boss Kannada where he emerged the runner-up, plans to not take on any new film till the release of this bilingual.
