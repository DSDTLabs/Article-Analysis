GURUGRAM: The department of   ( ) on Wednesday slapped notices on six   — all from   2 — for violating building norms and making structural changes after receiving occupation certificates (OCs) under the self-certification scheme. 
 
 Officials claimed the action was aimed at checking misuse of the scheme that was launched in January to reduce the time for processing OC applications for residential houses in licensed colonies as well as decrease pendency rates at the DTP office. 
  
 The six plot owners, who were given OCs in January, have been accused of making changes in designs or structures after receiving OCs for their 60sq-yard plots. They have either increased the ground coverage or made changes in designs of their houses or built additional floors. 
  
 District town planner (DTP) RS Batth said the department came across anomalies in the six of seven houses inspected recently. The owners have been given 10 working days to file their replies. “If the replies are found to be unsatisfactory, the department will revoke their OCs and initiate further action,” Batth maintained. 
  
 According to the rules, one cannot make changes in the building after getting an OC, without an approval from the department. 
  
 The department launched the self-certification system last month, doing away with the mandatory site inspection before granting an OC. Therefore, a plot owner can submit a declaration (self-certification) through his architect and the department will issue an OC assuming that the applicant has followed all the rules.
