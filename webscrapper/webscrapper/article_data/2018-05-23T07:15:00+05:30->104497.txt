GHAZIABAD: The   has finalised the modalities for installing CCTV cameras all along the 10.3km -long  . 

 A committee of five members constituted at the insistence of GDA vice-chairperson Ritu Maheshwari has proposed the installation of 16 CCTV cameras on the  . Santosh Rai, GDA secretary, said, “A committee of five members was constituted by the GDA vice-chairperson on May 15. Members included SP city, SP traffic, GDA secretary, project manager and a technical hand.
 
  On Tuesday, the panel held a meeting to discuss the model under which CCTV cameras should be installed on the Hindon elevated road and they have suggested that 16 CCTV cameras be installed,” said Rai. He further said, “ Eight cameras each on both sides along with two speed radars has been proposed and efforts are on to install in one month.”
 
 While two cameras will be installed at the entry and exit of the elevated road, the remaining have been proposed along the curves and speed radars halfway along the elevated road. “It has been decided that the speed radars will be installed near the   and Vasundhara ramps and the control panel, which will be manned by traffic police, will also be set up near these ramps,” said Rai.
 
 The speed radars will be equipped with automatic number plate recognition (ANPR), which will click pictures of speeding vehicles and the challan would be sent directly to the erring driver’s address. Speeding has become a big nuisance on the elevated road and since its inauguration in March this year two major accidents have already been reported on this stretch. The elevated road has been designed to withstand vehicular speed up to 100km/hr but GDA has restricted the maximum speed to 80km/hr. However, as there is no checking mechanism yet, speeding is a common place on this stretch.
