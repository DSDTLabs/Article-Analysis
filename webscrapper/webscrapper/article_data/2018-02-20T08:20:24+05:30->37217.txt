CHARMINAR: Taking strong exception against traffic police, Charminar fruit vendors on Monday protested seeking an alternate place.

 They alleged the ongoing Charminar Pedestrianisation project has hit their business and now the traffic police action of removing them has added to their woes. “We are considered a stoppage in the movement of vehicular traffic. The road has shrunk by the ongoing Charminar Pedestrianisation project, which is not being taken into consideration. Instead of expediting the ongoing project work, we are being driven out of our places,” said a vendor.
 
  ( ) members delegation headed by working president Mir Inayath Ali Baqri met Charminar traffic police officials seeking an alternate place for the existing fruit vendors.
 
 “The business of more than 300 fruit vendors have taken a hit due to the Charminar Pedestrianisation work. Now, traffic police’s action against vendors has become amatter of concern. They are always considered a hurdle in traffic flow through the police don’t take note of the increasing number of vehicles,’’ said NHF working president Mir Inayath Ali Baqri.
 
 NHF told TOI that they wanted officials to solve the issue as early as possible. “Hawkers play a key role in selling produce from 90% farmers at affordable rates. Instead of taking action against them officials should come up with a plan for the vendors,” added Ali Baqri.
