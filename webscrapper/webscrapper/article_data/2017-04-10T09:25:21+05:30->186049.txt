Dressed in a tradi tional Haryanvi attire,   shows a slice of her on screen personality .She was visiting Ahmedabad for the promotion of her new venture Jaat Di Jugni where she plays the character of Phoolkumari (male protagonist's mother). As she joins us for a conversation, she says, “This is my first visit to Ahmedabad and I have never got any chance to travel to Gujarat. I keep telling Kiran (Karmarkar, her husband) about planning a trip to Somnath, Dwarka and Kutch. I wish I could visit atleast Sabarmati Ashram today, but don't know whether I can do that.“ 
 
 
  
 
  
  Phoolkumari is a strong headed and straight-forward woman from a village in Haryana. But she will do anything for her family. I found this role challenging and different from my previous roles.
  
  
 
  
  I always ensure that whichever role I take, I look at what is the challenge in essaying the par ticular character. I never categorize my work -as negative or positive -the element of challenge in that role is important. Doing the role of Kamla Tai in   was a big risk -to play a cold blooded, sharp woman and picking up Marathi dialect was a good learning experience for me as an actor.
  
  
 
  
  
 
  
  It has been 16 years of togetherness. Since we are from the same profession, we have a good understanding of our work.Over the years, we have become more mature and we have evolved as people as well in this relationship.
  
  
 
  
  Playing a character definitely exhausts one but over the years, I have learnt how to disconnect from work. I prefer reading, listening to music, knitting, crocheting as well as meditating. I have this spiritual inclination. I feel the spiritual side of mine helps me evolve as a strong person and keeps me calm too.
