INDORE: The advocate, who was appointed as special public prosecutor for Shilpu Bhadoriya murder case, has challenged Indore bench of high court’s order removing him from the post and issued notices to the accused who had moved the petition for his removal. 

 A division bench of   and Justice Virendra Singh granted four weeks to accused Shailendra Saraswat and his father Pawan Saraswat, to file their reply to the petition. 
 
 Advocate   Chandel, who had represented the victim’s family before the trial began, was appointed as the special public prosecutor by the state through order dated February 22, 2017 by MP Law and  . 
 
 The state had exercised its powers under section 24 (8) of CrPC, according to which any person can be appointed as the special public prosecutor if he has been a practicing advocate for more than ten years. 
 
 However, the court in its judgment dated December 11, 2017 had ruled that while making any such appointment the state cannot ignore the impartial role of a public prosecutor. 
 
 “It has been noted that there may be cases where a powerful complainant may begin a proceeding to victimize his opponent and if in such a case the state concedes to the request for appointment of a special public prosecutor there will be travesty of justice,” the court had noted. 
 
 The writ appeal has been moved by Chandel on the grounds that there is no evidence against him which suggests that he will not conduct the trial in an impartial manner. The next date of the trial has been fixed for January 19, when prosecution witnesses will be cross examined by the defence counsel.
