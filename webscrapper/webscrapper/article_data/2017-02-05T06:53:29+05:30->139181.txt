KOLKATA:   is causing heartburn on this side of the border as it allegedly seeks to address the concerns of radical groups by dropping works by the likes of   and Saratchandra, among others.

 The most significant among the omissions is Tagore's poem, 'Aaji Bangladesher hridoy hote', from the textbook for Class VI. While syllabus revision is nothing new, what is creating unease is the contention that the poem was allegedly dropped because communal forces had claimed it was written in praise of a Hindu goddess. Besides Tagore's poem, 16 other poems and stories have been snipped. These include Saratchandra's short story 'Lalu', Sanjib Chattopadhyay's travelogue 'Palamou',' S Wajed Ali's `Ranchi Bhraman', Sunil Gangopadhyay's poem 'Sankota Dulche' and Ramayana for children by Upendrakishore Raychowdhury .
 
 While an official at the Bangladesh deputy high commission in Kolkata termed the syllabus revision a “routine affair“, the Bangladeshi media has alleged that the omissions match the demands of Islamic group Hefazat-e-Islam. The country's leading English daily , Daily Star, said in a report that politics of exclusivity makes it seem that “young minds are increasingly becoming laboratories for fundamentalists and extremists propagating their views and ideologies“.
 
 Refuting this, the Bangladeshi diplomat in Kolkata said, “It is the government's decision to upgrade the syllabus. The Bangladesh government was not pressurised to change the syllabus because of Hefazat-eIslam or any other group. Bangladesh has great regard for Tagore and there is no question of omitting Tagore. If anyone is hurt, he or she can always approach the government.“
