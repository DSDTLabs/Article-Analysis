Gone are the days when shooter   would laugh it off each time her classmates showed ignorance about her sporting discipline. “Shooting eh?   (Which movie)? This was a common question I have been asked at school each time I applied for leave to be part of a competition,” Chennai-based Sandhya told TOI.

 
 Today, shooting has blossomed into a sport that has produced champions of international repute from India, and Sandhya is one among them. The 22-year-old, who has been part of the Indian junior team for many years, is now training her sights on bagging a regular spot on the senior side.
 
 
 Her affair with shooting started when she was 11 and the Chennai Rifle Club was among the first places where she trained and learned the nuances of the sport. Over the years, Sandhya has come up with medal-winning efforts both at the national and international level.
 
 
 In 2013, Sandhya clinched bronze in the three-position and prone category at the Asian junior shooting  . Two years later she bagged a bronze in the 50m rifle three-position event at the 35th   in Thiruvananthapuram. She was ranked No. 1 among junior shooters in the country that year.
 
 
 With the competition only getting tougher for a place in the senior team, Sandhya is upping her game. In the past few months, Sandhya has fine-tuned her game under Slovakian rifle   “His inputs have definitely helped and I am beginning to see he changes in my game,” said Sandhya, who will be part of the national selection trials in New Delhi in the first week of April.
 
 
 Sandhya reckons that shooting has a strong mental side. “It is a mind game much ike chess. One has to focus relentlessly on the arget. You have to train your mind to switch on and off. Over the years, shooting has taught me to channel my energies on one thing and become mentally stronger,” she said.
