MADURAI: A woman, who tried to persuade her daughter to return with her, failed in her attempt after the latter expressed her willingness in court to stay with a transsexual, which was the bone of contention of the whole issue 

 "Considering the fact that the detenu (daughter) is a major and also the fact that she desires to reside with a transgender at  , she is at liberty to act as per her own wish," a division bench of justices S   and T   said, disposing the petition filed by the woman's mother. 
 
 The petitioner said that her daughter was studying in a college in  , where she developed friendship with an assistant karate teacher, a transsexual.

Then the petitioner came to know that her daughter was residing with the karate teacher in Manipur. She then lodged a complaint with the Sankarankovil taluk police station and thereafter filed a case seeking direction to police to produce her daughter liberty and set her free.
