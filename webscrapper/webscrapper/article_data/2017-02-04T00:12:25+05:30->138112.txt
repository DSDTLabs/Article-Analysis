NEW DELHI: An eight-year-boy was crushed by a speeding mini-truck in Dwarka Sector 8 in southwest Delhi while going to buy stationery on Thursday night. The vehicle’s driver, who had fled the accident spot, was later arrested.

 The victim, Ankush, studied in the school opposite his house in  . He had been preparing for his monthly tests. 
 
 His family said that the boy wanted a blue register for over two weeks, but could not buy it as it was out of stock. When he saw his cousin writing in a similar register on Thursday, he ran out of his house to get one for himself.
 
 “I kept telling him to not go out so late, but he left saying he had been wanting the register for long and could wait no longer. He then ran out of the house,” said Usha Devi, the boy’s mother.
 
 A few minutes after the boy left the house, someone from the neighbourhood rushed to inform Usha Devi about the accident. 
 
 “I was preparing dinner when I came to know of the accident. I rushed to the spot, which is barely a few metres away from our house, and saw my son lying in a pool of blood. He didn’t respond when I shook him,” said the inconsolable mother.
 
 The boy’s father,  , said that he was walking towards his house after work when he noticed a crowd. “I heard my wife shouting my son’s name. I ran as fast as I could and saw Ankush lying dead on the road. I felt so weak and helpless,” he said.
 
 Ankush lived with his parents and elder sister Arti in a rented house since the past five years. Locals remembered him as a bright student. “He was one of the most loving and competitive children around. He worked hard in his exams,” said Manju, his aunt. 
 
 “A case of rash and negligent driving has been registered against the mini-truck driver, Hari Prasad. He was arrested and his vehicle has also been seized,” said DCP (southwest) Surender Kumar.
