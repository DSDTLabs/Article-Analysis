BENGALURU: Hoping to help thousands of Indian workers stranded in  , the   (GOPIO) has joined hands with the   in Bahrain and UAE to identify eligible workers for training. The Bengaluru chapter of GOPIO has begun to zero in on institutions which will team up with the organisation for skill development. 

  Sunny Kulathakal , global ambassador of GOPIO who was the convener of the  , told STOI: "We are formulating schemes to rehabilitate Gulf returnees. We are in the process of identifying labourers who have lost their property back in India and don't have proper jobs in Gulf nations." 
 
 According to Sunny, thousands of Indians there don't have jobs or income. Many sold their property in India and went to the Gulf countries through bogus visas. Due to the localization drive, many Indians in Saudi Arabia and other regions have had to return to India and will continue to do so. 
 
  GOPIO has urged the government to provide support for the rehabilitation, on the lines of the Tibetan settlement in Karnataka. "Our chamber of commerce which was inaugurated in Mumbai on January 10. We will connect with the Indian business community throughout the world," Sunny said. 
 
 "Since 1989, GOPIO has sou ght a platform for pravasis to exchange their views and urged the government for a separate ministry. Many of the policy decisions from the ministry of external affairs (on PIOs, OCI cards and voting rights) were proposed," said Sunny.
