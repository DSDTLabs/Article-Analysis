NAGPUR: Commuters heaved a sigh of relief as the 375 bus fleet of three red and one green bus operator resumed   operations on Thursday, two days after Bharatiya Kamgar Sena went on an indefinite strike. The strike affected public transport in Nagpur, with the government invoking MESMA to tide over the crisis, and hit bus services in varying degrees across the city and outside, till the union called off the stir on Tuesday.

 The usual hustle and bustle was back at Mor Bhavan, Dhiran Kanya and Maharajbagh bus stands on Thursday.
 
 On February 20, the union had called for an indefinite strike, demanding a pay hike among other things, following the failure of talks on wage revision with municipal commissioner Ashwin Mudgal. After the government invoked MESMA, the striking staff — mostly bus drivers and conductors — was forced to end the stir and resume work immediately.
 
 A manager at a city depot said, “Drivers and conductors have come back to work and all buses are being operated.” Following this, ad hoc drivers pressed in to operate   since Wednesday morning were withdrawn. Nearly 75% of the services were operational by 8am on Thursday, and the number of buses on the road increased by afternoon, he said. 
 
 Though all drivers resumed work, shortage of conductors affected bus services. According to reports, the three red-bus operators had failed to operate 35 buses due to non-availability of conductors. “On Monday, a union delegation will meet   ministers Subhash Desai (industry) and Diwakar Raote (transport) to discuss the issue of low wages being paid to the drivers and conductors of city buses,” said organizing secretary of Bharatiya Kamgar Sena Bandu Talwekar.
