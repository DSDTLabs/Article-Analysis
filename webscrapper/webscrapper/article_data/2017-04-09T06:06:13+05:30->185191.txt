BENGALURU: The outcome of bypolls in Nanjangud and Gundlupet on April 13 matters more to the Congress than the BJP, as the party is on the threshold of going in for a midcourse correction to face assembly elections in 2018.

 
 
 A victory for the BJP in either one or both seats will bolster its confidence to explore avenues to open fresh accounts in constituencies which were out of its reach all these years. State BJP president  , who had made Nanjangud and Gundlupet his home for close to a month, can claim credit for garnering the Lingayat and dalit vote banks in this region, where his party came a cropper in 2013.
 
 
 
 
 Either the Congress or   has been winning both constituencies all these years. The bypoll has turned into a proxy war between Siddaramaiah and Yeddyurappa. An adverse result for the Congress would indicate an erosion in Ahinda votes, which Siddaramaiah has claimed ownership to. The CM has announced that elections will be fought under his leadership and the results will indicate public opinion on his governance.
 
 
 
 
 The Congress rank and file have pinned hope on the bypoll results, and the party leadership will end the uncertainty over the continuation of Parameshwara as KPCC president or appoint a new person. He has tried to position himself as a dalit leader and raised the issue of having a chief minister from this community.   and Gundlupet would help him take this issue forward.
