Actress   said it was tough for her to stay away from her three-month-old son for the first time when she attended CinemaCon in Las Vegas. The '27 Dresses' star attended CinemaCon on Wednesday and it was her first trip away since giving birth to her son  , who she has with her husband  . 

  
  
 "This is the first time that I have left him. He's just a little over three months now and I'm just here for one day and I thought, 'You know, it's irresponsible of me to, like, disrupt his whole schedule for one day just because I have an issue.'"
 
 "He's totally fine without me and I have a problem, so I'm trying to be the grown-up here and make the right decision on his behalf. Oh, I'm sure (I'm having a tougher time than he is). I already Facetimed him from the airport,"   said. 
 
 The 38-year-old actress was also missing her two daughters -  , eight, and four-year-old Adalaide. "I should have moved things along because I was late and I needed to get going to make sure I got my flight this morning, but my middle [child], who used to be my baby, gave me this rare snuggle session this morning."
 
 "She's not much of a snuggler, like, she's more of a daddy's girl, and she'll come to me for a kiss or two, but never really snuggle snuggles. So I got that this morning too, so now I'm feeling especially sad and missing my babies."
