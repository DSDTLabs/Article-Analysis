BHOPAL: Chief minister   gave the ‘Abki Baar 200 Paar’ slogan at the BJP working committee meeting on Saturday, and reeled out a list of welfare schemes adopted by his government for farmers.

 The slogan is the party’s watchword for the 2018 assembly election when BJP aims to win more than 200 of the 230 seats in the assembly. It now has 165.
 
 “There was a time when BJP workers used to celebrate their defeat if they managed to save their security deposit in an election. Now, rival parties are losing their deposits,” he remarked, adding: “At this pace one can easily achieve the target of 200-plus in the ensuing assembly election and I must reiterate ‘Abki Baar 200 Paar’.”:
 
 Realising that the farmer agitation has come at a crucial juncture, the CM pointed out that his government has taken 22 major decisions for the welfare of farmers and their families. When the Centre delayed fixing the minimum support price of farm produce, the state government took the decision under Agriculture Cost and  , he said.
 
 “The state government has taken decisions for farmers’ welfare much ahead of recommendations made by  , who had suggested farm loan at 4% interest. The state government is already providing loan to farmers at 0% and giving a subsidy of 10% on it. There are several other schemes that clearly show how the state government is concerned about the interest of farmers,” Chouhan said, while delivering the valedictory address at the state working committee meeting on Saturday.
 
 The chief minister accused Congress of “creating a myth and spreading rumours” against the state government to garner political mileage from the farmers’ agitation. “The issue of Rs 1 crore compensation raised by Congress is another major political plan,” he said. The CM also recalled initiatives taken by Prime Minister   in the interest of common people.
