Vadodara: A month-and-half ago, a car ran over a puppy’s hind legs in Balaji Township on New VIP Road. Local residents thought that the three-month old stray puppy won’t be able to survive much. But, Rani, as the dog is fondly called, has now become a celebrity in its area. Passers-by watch amusingly as Rani struts around on a pair of wheels. All thanks to a computer engineering student, the puppy has got a new lease of life.

 The puppy now shares a close bond with Devarshi Gandhi who specially designed a two-wheeler trolley for it. “A dog in our area had given birth to four puppies some months ago and of the them came under a car’s wheel. Its hind legs suffered severe injuries,” said 23-year-old Gandhi. She rushed the puppy to a veterinary hospital and got it treated.
 
 “But the puppy’s spinal chord had suffered serious injury. Doctors said that its hind legs won’t move. It pained to watch her in such condition and so I thought of giving it back its freedom to move around,” Gandhi said. After some days, Gandhi came up with an idea of attaching the puppy’s rear body with a two-wheel trolley.
 
 “I designed a trolley made of PVC but the puppy wasn’t comfortable in it. So, I redesigned the trolley and made it out of iron. I took two small wheels from a kid’s bicycle and attached them to this trolley. And it worked. The puppy has adapted well to its new ‘legs’ and now it runs around in our colony. Our neighbours too take care of Rani,” an elated Gandhi said. She will have to build bigger trolley as the puppy grows up and Gandhi is prepared for it.
