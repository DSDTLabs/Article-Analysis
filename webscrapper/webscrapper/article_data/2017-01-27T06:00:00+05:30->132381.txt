Jambagh,  ,  ,   —Hyderabad’s busiest, and most bustling bazars wear a deserted look these days. Reason? Demonetisation, say shopkeepers. “Pehle toh Republic Day jaise chuttion ke time pe toh bahut log aate the... tourist bhi aur local Hyderabadi logan bhi. Par yeh demonetisation ke wajah se toh aaj kal public bahar nikalre ich nahi. jo aati thi thodi bahut woh bhi bandh ho gaye. Aur sab logon ka yahi story hai — crockery wala rehne do ya ittar, ya kapde. Sab ke business mei 50-60 per cent drop hai,” says Kazim from Nizam Attar Perfumers, in Laad Bazar. 
Business has been down since Ramzan last year, but with demonetisation people have stopped spending on non-essentials, says Shailender Prasad, a businessman from Charminar. “Sales were low even during Ramzan. But the   came bang in the middle of the wedding and festival season. So a lot of people who borrowed money or promised to pay later, are now using the cash available to clear off their loans or pay back. That’s why no one’s spending much even now,” Shailender explains. The shopkeepers reckon that it will be a long time before things get back to normal. “customers hai hi nahi toh business ke baare mei kya bolu? This has been the worst year as far as sakes are concerned,” says Vishnu Varma of Swathi Boutique, Sultan bazar. “Doesn’t look like things will improve for us small vendors for six months. The government should do something,” adds Umair of Hyderabad Bangles in Chudi Bazar.
