NEW DELHI: Indira Gandhi International ( ) Airport has become the first such facility in the world to adopt a unique digital platform called Arc. It will be used to measure, manage and improve performance of the airport in resource consumption, carbon emissions and ensuring quality of passenger space, said airport operator   on Tuesday. 

 Arc, developed by   (GBCI) and US Green Building Council (USGBC)—the global certifying body for all Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) projects, will allow DIAL to measure improvements and benchmark performance against other green building projects around the world, said officials. “It supports the projects to track and monitor the building’s performance,” said an officer.
 
 DIAL’s CEO, I Prabhakara Rao, said, “We are proud that   is the first airport worldwide in adopting Arc and it underscores our strategic efforts towards becoming a Smart Airport.” 
 
 He also commended USGBC and GBCI, the creators of LEED green building rating system, for developing the unique platform of the performance-based rating system. “The adoption of Arc is not just a testimony that environment is our top priority but also reaffirms our seriousness towards the ‘Digital India’ initiative,” Rao added.
 
 The president and CEO of USGBC and Green Business Certification Inc, Mahesh Ramanujam, thanked DIAL for taking “this bold step into the future of green buildings focused on data as the newest natural resource”.
