JAIPUR: The BJP government’s policies were responsible for the unrest among farmers across the country, Congress state president   said on Sunday. Congress vice-president   would be exposing how BJP’s policies were driving the farmers to the brink, Pilot said referring to his party’s ‘Kisan Akrosh rally’ scheduled at Banswara on July 19.

 The state’s southernmost district is home to large number of farmers with marginal land holdings. Small-time farmers will the focus of the Congress rally to be addressed by Rahul. Banswara also borders around Madhya Pradesh’s districts that witnessed violent protests by farmers in June.
 
 By taking up the issue of marginal farmers, the Congress will not only aim at the Vasundhara Raje-government but will also highlight the issues of farmers from other states. 
 
 With shrinking land holdings the input cost of farming activities has escalated. Crop prices remain way too short of expenses incurred by farmers and have been the primary reason of agitation by peasants across India.
 
 To oversee the rally’s preparations, Pilot will reach Banswara on Monday. Building up the momentum ahead of rally, Pilot accused the state government of being apathetic to farmers’ conditions in the state.
