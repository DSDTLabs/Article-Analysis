AGRA: In a letter to railway minister  , Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has requested that the weekly   Express train should halt at Bateshwar, 80 km from Agra. It is former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s ancestral village and a major  . It is also known for its 101 Shiva temples along the Yamuna.
 
 The CM said a halt at the station would facilitate Jain pilgrims coming from Rajasthan and other cities who wish to visit Shauripur in Bateshwar, the birthplace of Bhagwan Shri Neminath Bhagwan, the 22nd Teerthankara. The demand to halt the train was initially made by Bah MLA Rani Pakshalika Singh.
  
 “If this system is put in place, it will not only help the local population, but also Jain and other pilgrims who want to visit this major religious centre. You are requested to kindly pass a suitable direction in this regard,” Adityanath said in his letter.
  
 It may be recalled it was Vajpayee who wanted to connect Agra and Bateshwar by train as soon as he became PM in 1999, However, it was in 2015, when a train finally reached the station.
