AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Wednesday turned down a PIL filed by former IPS officer Rahul Sharma, challenging the one-year service extension of ‘encounter specialist’ cops – N K Amin and   – after their retirement.

 A bench of Chief Justice R S Reddy and Justice V M Pancholi dismissed the PIL on the grounds that it is not maintainable in a service matter. The court further observed that the state government has the powers to appoint retired cops on contract. 
 
 “We are convinced that power is conferred on the state to make appointments of 2nd and 3rd respondents (Amin and Barot) on contractual basis, it cannot be said that such appointments are either without authority of law or contrary to any of the statutory provisions.”
 
 Sharma had filed the PIL to quash the order of Amin’s appointment as an SP and Barot’s appointment as a DySP with the Western Railway at Vadodara in September last year. He argued that both the cops were tainted and faced murder charges in the Ishrat Jahan fake encounter case. 
 
 Looking at the service records, their services cannot be extended in public interest.
 
 The state government countered Sharma’s argument that the appointments were against the provisions of the Bombay Police Act. It maintained that the state government has got powers to appoint people on contract basis.
 
 The state government also defended the appointment of both the officers on the grounds of their “outstanding performance” in their annual confidential reports over the last 10 years. There is no departmental proceedings pending against them. They have never violated bail conditions and Amin has been discharged in the 2005 Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case by a   court.
 
 Besides dubbing Sharma as “biased” against the state administration for departmental proceedings against him, the state government also praised Amin and Barot for “eliminating the terrorists”.
