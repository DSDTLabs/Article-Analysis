KOLKATA: In an age when social media fake profiles are common and sending obscene messages on WhatsApp is a major concern, cops have come across a new social media tool for harassment —  .

 A mere suspicion that her boyfriend might begin a relationship with another girl led a college student of a prominent eastern suburban college to create a fake Instagram profile in her rival’s name and upload obscene pictures of her with explicit texts. The victim herself is a third-year student of computer science engineering in a Garia college and lives in the   area. The victim came to know of the profile only after being alerted by her friends and it is yet to be ascertained if she herself used Instagram.
 
 The cyber cell has arrested the 20-year-old accused from her residence in Dum Dum. The case was initially registered at the Survey Park police station on October 8 and later transferred to the cyber cell. Instagram, too, helped with the probe, said Lalbazar sources. “We carried out the arrest based on technical proof,” said joint CP (crime)  .
 
 “It was during questioning that we came to know that the youth in question had been dividing time between the two girls. The accused said she grew suspicious after he failed to meet her once. It was then that the idea came to her,” an officer said.
 
 Lalbazar sources said it is only towards the end of 2016 that Instagram added several security measures after realizing the platform could be used to harass someone. However, most users are still unaware of them. 
 
 According to digitaltrends.com, the Facebook-owned photo-sharing app for smartphones introduced features aimed at combating cyberbullying and other forms of internet mistreatment, like disabling comments, “liking” comments and removing followers from private accounts — follow on the heels of a filter that lets users hide comments by keyword.
