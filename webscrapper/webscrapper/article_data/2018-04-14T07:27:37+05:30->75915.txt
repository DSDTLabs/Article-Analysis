KOLKATA: At the gram panchayat level, 27.1% seats this time have single candidates, revealed State Election Commission (SEC) data released after the Wednesday scrutiny. The   data indicate that in 13,197 gram panchayats across Bengal, only a single candidate has filed his/her nomination in one seat. Compared to the 2013 panchayat elections, in which 5,378 gram panchayat seats were won uncontested, this appears to be a 59.2% rise in the trend.

 
  
 
 Before this, the state witnessed the highest number of uncontested victories in panchayat elections in 2003. That year, 6,800 seats went uncontested, accounting for nearly 11% of the total number. The next highest was in 2013 elections, when 6,274 seats went uncontested, which accounted for 10.66% of the total seats. An analysis of the data released after scrutiny shows the 2018 gram panchayat elections is set to script fresh records for uncontested wins.
 
 “This is a very early stage. But the quantum jump in gram panchayat and panchayat samiti seats with only one candidate in the fray is baffling. If the final tally remains what it is now, we are going to see a jump in the uncontested seats by over 50% from that in 2013,” said election analyst Biswanath Chakraborty. “A closer look at the data will reveal that while the variance from 2013 to 2018 has remained uniform across Bengal, the trend has spiked significantly in five districts of South 24 Parganas, Bankura, Purba Bardhaman,   and Birbhum,” he added.
 
 After the Calcutta High Court order, the SEC on Thursday stopped the poll process state-wide completely.
 
 According to the SEC data, Murshidabad district witnessed maximum single nomination for gram panchayat seats in the 2018 panchayat polls. Only one candidate has filed his/ her nomination in each of 1,896 seats there. In 2013, only 17 gram panchayat seats in this district were won uncontested, with   winning 14 among them. In Purulia and Jhargram, only one candidate has filed his/her nomination for each of 19 seats.
 
 In 2013 panchayat elections, Hooghly witnessed the highest such uncontested wins in 1,220 seats. Among them,   won in 1,207 seats, while others won the remaining 13. West Midnapore and Burdwan (then undivided) also witnessed a high proportion of uncontested wins in 2013 panchayat elections.
 
 According to a senior SEC official, Birbhum has thrown up an intriguing nomination pattern this gram panchayat polls.
 
 For the 2,247 gram panchayat seats in the district, 3,000 nominations have been filed. Among those, 2,305 nominations have been filed by Trinamool candidates, while the rest is spilt between   and Left Front. And among the 3,000 nominations, 1,782 seats have single nomination. Effectively, elections will be found in less than half of the gram panchayat seats in Birbhum, sources pointed out.
 
 In six districts in Bengal, over 1,000 seats witnessed only one candidate filing their nomination for a seat. Seven other districts in Bengal had less than 100 seats that have only one candidate in the fray. Significantly in each of Hooghly and Alipurduar, there is one gram panchayat seat in which there has been no single valid nomination.
