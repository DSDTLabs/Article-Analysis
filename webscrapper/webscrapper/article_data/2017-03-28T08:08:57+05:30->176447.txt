HYDERABAD: With some political parties expressing reservations over police move to aggressively book cases against persons involved in petty offences and sending them to jail, the Hyderabad police have decided to go slow against such offenders, especially those who are `not' habitual offenders. Since the Hyderabad police are slowly linking crime with Aadhaar details, the offenders involved in petty cases out of ignorance are also becoming part of the criminal records.

 A few days ago, MLAs from   (MIM) and   ( ) raised objections during the Assembly proceedings and outside alleging that police were registering cases against hawkers, those encroaching upon footpaths and others in petty offences and sending them to jail.
 
 As a result, Hyderabad police commissioner M   has directed deputy commissioners of police to crackdown only repeathabitual offenders and go slow on those who commit offences out of ignorance and coming from decent background. “We will not register cases mechanically while dealing with petty cases.Henceforth, we will register ca ses only if the violator is a repeat offender or someone who violates public order,“ DCP (South Zone) V   said.
 
 In the last few months, the sleuths of Central Crime Station, traffic police and   police were collecting Aadhaar details of offenders as part of a project to compile database of persons involved in grave or petty offences. It is being done to check whether an offender was a repeat offender, avoid impersonation or disclosure of false personal details. “In the past, we came across instances of accused deliberately misguiding police by furnishing false personal details. Impersonation was also attempted. Now, with compilation of a criminal database, we can verify whether an accused is giving correct personal information or not,“ DCP (West Zone) A Venkateshwar Rao, in whose zone the project was started in February , told TOI.
