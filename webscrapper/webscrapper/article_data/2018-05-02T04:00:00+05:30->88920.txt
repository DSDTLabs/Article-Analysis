Rajkot: Facing acute financial crisis at home coupled with the craving for luxury, Jahnvi Ahir alias Jagruti Makwana stepped into the crime world when she was just 20. 

 Jahnvi’s family lost their sole breadwinner when her father died few years ago. He was a smalltime vendor of seasonal items. She quit studies after passing class X and the need for money only started to increase. Though her mother started doing odd labour jobs, the earning was not enough. 
 
 Jahnvi, who has a younger brother, met Kuldeep, who was engaged in the business of selling used cars. They were involved in an affair for the past one year and were accomplices in the crime.
 
 Meanwhile, she came in contact with Geeta last month who introduced her to the ways of earning quick buck by honeytrapping rich people. Geeta, who has been arrested in this case, was caught in the past too for similar crime. She was inducted into their gang and Jahnvi created a fake Facebook account to lure rich men. Geeta hatched a plan to trap businessman Girish Bhut and told Jahnvi to execute it after he had befriended her.
 
 V C Parmar, investigation officer of Gandhigram police station, said “Geeta and Ketan were arrested in a honeytrap case in past, but Jahnvi and Kuldeep had joined their gang recently.”
