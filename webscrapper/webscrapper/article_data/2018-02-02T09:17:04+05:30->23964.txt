GIBRALTAR:   and former world junior champion   continued with his fine run and held 2012   finalist   to a draw in the ninth and penultimate round of Gibraltar Masters now underway here.

 Abhijeet took his tally to a fine 6.5 points out of a possible nine in the super-open and will look forward to an improved performance in the final round game.
 
 Delhi youngster Prithu Gupta made his maiden Grandmaster norm when he won with black pieces against Johan Sebastian of Norway. The 13-year old had already made his final international master norm with a round to spare and the victory in the penultimate round served as the perfect bonus for the Indian.
 
  was the other teenager who went on to make his second International Master norm after drawing with Grandmaster Erik Blomqvist. Sadhwani will now need one more before he can claim the IM title.
 
 For Gupta, it was a difficult game as he landed in initial troubles. However, a timely exchange sacrifice ensured enough counterplay and Gelfand decided against undue risk.
 
 It's a five-way tie at the top and Gupta stands joint sixth at this point. The last round will determine the course of action for top players here.
