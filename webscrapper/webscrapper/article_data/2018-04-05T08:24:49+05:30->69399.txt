BENGALURU: Entering the Karnataka electoral fray with the card of ‘alternative politics’, the   party wants to be perceived a serious player, saying its candidates will try to make voters realize the difference in at least a dozen constituencies. Party convener  , who was in Mandya and

 Bengaluru on Wednesday, insisted his party’s presence will not be merely symbolic but a small but significant beginning in the state.
 
 Excerpts:
 
 
 
 We are making a small but significant beginning. While we have already announced six candidates, a few more candidates will be announced in a couple of days. Our presence is not going to be symbolic for sure. We want the people of Karnataka to know they have a choice other than the three parties which have no values and no principles.
 
 
 
 
 People who have been fed up of big and mainstream political parties are alternative seekers and they want something different. We can offer them a ‘proof of concept’ this time in a few places this time and scale it up the next time.
 
 
 
 
 The idea was borrowed from the poll campaign of Shanthaveri Gopala Gowda, a great socialist of Karnataka, who sought money and vote from people. If the candidates take money from industrialists for their campaign, they will be obliged to them. If they take money from voters, they will be indebted to them which is all right.
 
 
 
 
 Divisive politics is not new to Karnataka as BJP tried it way back in 1990 in the form of Hubballi Idgah Maidan dispute. BJP leaders are now trying to stoke communal passions in Karnataka and their act is nothing but a treason against Bharat Mata. Dividing people on communal lines to earn political dividend would disintegrate India and it’s my hope that BJP’s communal strategies will fail here.
