 Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Teachers' Welfare Association (SSATWA) president   claimed taht there had been many instances in schools where students had damaged the vehicles of teachers after being scolded for bringing their mobiles phones to school. “Students carrying mobile phones have become a menace. Students are quite aggressive these days. 
 
 There should be instructions to parents about the   on school premises,“ Rana said. A teacher of a government school, Ranbir Singh Rana, said the problem was more difficult to handle because teachers did not have the authority to give them any punishment. “We can only ask them not to bring phones and can't confiscate without the consent of their parents. Most parents later come to school and say they have given the kids phones in case of an emergency ,“ said Ranbir.
 
 Talking about rising aggression levels among students, school counsellor Prabhjot Kaur said the possible reasons could range from stress over academics to domestic violence. “Violence on TV and internet are adding to this problem. There is no way for the youngsters to channelize their energy , as there are no   in some of the peripheral schools,“ she said.
