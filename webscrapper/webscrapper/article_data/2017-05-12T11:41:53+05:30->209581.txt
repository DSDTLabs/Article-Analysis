NEW DELHI: With a top-two finish possible for them,   will be going full throttle at   in their penultimate league match in IPL-10, at the Kotla on Friday. Pune have been on a roll, quite a revelation this season after virtually hitting rock bottom last year. The Steve Smith-led side, however, know how Delhi could be even though they are out of play-off contention. Besides, the hosts are on a high after the thrilling win over Gujarat Lions in their last game.

 The home team may not have been the most consistent side in the league, but they are capable of surprising any team in the competition. In fact, they have earned the reputation of being the 'most unpredictable side.' Fighting the frustration of not making it to the last four despite having one of the most talented teams, Delhi now have pride at stake.
 
 When the teams met earlier in the league in Pune, Delhi were the winners by a whopping 97 run and had showed plenty of promise. But Delhi have lost steam while Pune have evolved as a fighting unit, boasting of a new match-winner in virtually every game. The Pune story this season hasn't been about a superstar performing consistently but about finding a winner in each game. The team has been able to strike a balance and find personnel who can deliver when needed.
 
 Star all-rounder  , skipper   and opener   have been in good form and have contributed their mite when the chips were down for their side. The bowlers have done their bit to keep the opposition in check. But with team's leading wicket-taker   not available for Pune anymore this season, it would be interesting to see on how they cope with his absence.
 
 Pune have shown the ability to deliver against top teams this season. They have won both their games against table-toppers Mumbai Indians while beating Kolkata Knight Riders, number two in the table, once.
 
 They are expected to rise to the challenge on Friday evening. Daredevils, though, will not be pushovers.
 
 It should be a riveting scrap.
