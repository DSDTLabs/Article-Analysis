The   has surged nearly 8.2%, or about 2,420 points, since the beginning of the current financial year. But the rally, interestingly, is not being driven by   (FIIs), as they have invested only about $2.2 billion (Rs 14,625 crore) since the beginning of 2017-18, data with share depository   showed.

 In contrast,   (MFs), who have trailed their larger overseas peers in most market rallies in terms of fund deployments, have invested 2.3 times as much money between April and July. Equity MFs have made net investments of $5.1 billion (Rs 33,196 crore) during the same period, data with markets regulator   showed.
 
 Fund houses have been able to deploy money in a big way due to strong inflows into equity MF schemes. Net inflows into equity funds (including equity-linked savings schemes) stood at $4.4 billion (Rs 28,332 crore) between April and June, data with the   ( ) showed.
 
 FIIs, however, have managed to meet equity MFs in fund deployments so far in calendar 2017 due to their strong showing in March. Overseas funds pumped a record $4.7 billion (Rs 30,906 crore) into the Indian stock markets on a net basis in March alone.
 
 FIIs have been way ahead of domestic investors, including equity MFs, in terms of investments ever since they started putting money into Indian markets from the mid-1990s. But the trend has started to reverse now with equity MFs beating their much larger overseas peers. 
 
 Equity funds upstaged FIIs by pumping nearly 2.4 times more money into the stock markets on a net basis in 2016 â€” the second consecutive year of higher investments. 
 
 But barring odd instances such as the market meltdown during the global financial crisis in 2008 when FIIs pulled out massively from the Indian markets, overseas investors have stood head and shoulders above their domestic peers in terms of Indian stock investments.
