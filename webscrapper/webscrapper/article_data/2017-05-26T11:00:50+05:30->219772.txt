BENGALURU: The high court on Thursday directed the government to allow senior IPS officer   to continue as ADGP , BMTF ( ), as he was posted prior to March 22, 2017.

 A vacation division bench comprising Justices   and John Michael Cunha passed the interim order after hearing a petition filed by Thakur.
 
 “The only reason for transferring the petitioner is administrative. As per the Karnataka Police (Amendment) Act, 2013, the officer should have a minimum tenure of one year. The petitioner has been transferred in 11 weeks. There is no reason assigned by the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) for declining to grant an interim order,“ the HC bench noted.
 
 Counsel for petitioner said Thakur, who was transferred as ADGP , BMTF on January 2, 2017, was again shifted on March 22, 2017 without there being any administrative exigency and allegations regarding misconduct which would entail such a move. The government advocate informed the court that the CAT is scheduled to take up the matter on June 8 while urging the court not to pass any interim order.
