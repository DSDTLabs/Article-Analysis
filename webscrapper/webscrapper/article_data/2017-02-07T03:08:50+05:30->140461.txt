NAVI MUMBAI: Irregular water supply in   node over the past few months has angered its residents. Activists are also questioning if there is any ‘hidden agenda’ to help the private water tanker operators to flourish.

 “For over six months now we are experiencing regular water supply cuts of 24 hours to 48 hours, as announced by   due to ‘technical’ reasons. The latest water cut was on February 3-4, and prior to that on December 2-3. Even after these announced dates, we do not get strong water pressure in many sectors. That is why I am wondering if it is done to help the private water tankers here,” said Kharghar resident and activist Ravi Srivastava.
 
 He is also planning to file an RTI application to Cidco to know exactly what are the technical problems faced with regard to water supplies to Kharghar. 
 
 “The residents of various housing societies have been forced to cough up Rs 2,000-Rs 3,000 to buy 10,000 litres of water from private tankers, although there is no real shortage in the city,” said Srivastava.
 
 However, the chief Cidco spokesperson   denied any alleged link with private water suppliers. “There are some genuine technical repairs taking place so that such water issues are not faced by residents in future. Also, since Kharghar is now part of PCMC, the water department charge will be handed over to the civic body. But there is no connection with private water tankers,” said Ninawe.
 
 A Kharghar based water official added, “The distance from the dam to Kharghar node, via the water treatment plant is 106 km. We are replacing some old and damaged pipes after announcing the dates of repair.”
