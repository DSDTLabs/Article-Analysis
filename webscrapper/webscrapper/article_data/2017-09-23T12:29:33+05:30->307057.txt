CHANDIGARH: Claiming to be followers of  , founder of Sirsa’s Dera Sacha Sauda, several persons have moved the   and Haryana high court seeking directions not to attach the properties originally built by the secretary head.

 According to the applicants, the old deras set up by Shah Mastana were very pious for them and place of worship for thousands of people.
 
 “If in compliance with the HC orders, the need to auction the assets of Dera Sacha Sauda arises, then the properties build by   after 1990 be attached and auctioned. The deras built and founded by Shah Mastana ji may be exempted from attachment as these deras have historic and religious value for thousands of followers of Shah Mastana Ji,” the applicant has pleaded.
 
 The matter reached the HC in the wake of a petition filed by Mahatma Gora Gurmukh (83), a resident of   village in Sirsa, and others who were ‘sadhus’ with Shah Mastana.
 
 The counsel for the petitioners, M S Joshi, said the applicants had no connection with the current dera head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh and were not his followers.
 
 “Shah Mastana constructed about 17 deras in Punjab and Haryana. These deras were established not for any commercial purpose but for preaching. The followers of Shah Mastana treat these deras as place of worship as their guru had performed meditation there. These deras do not hold much commercial value being in villages and hence these deras be exempted from attachment,” the counsel argued.
