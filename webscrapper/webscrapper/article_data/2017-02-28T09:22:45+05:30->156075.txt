 At Borivli we already have a jetty and we have already started dredging work since a depth of three metres is required for these ferries,” said the official.
 
 The official said the service will start most likely in October. “We want to start only an end-to-end service as we want to understand the response. If there is a good response we will construct a proper jetty at NCPA and also add other proposed stops at Marve, Versova, Juhu and Bandra,” said the official.
 
 The operator has proposed running the service from 6.30am in the morning to 9pm at night. “We may allow the night operations,” the official said.
 
 In 2008, a high-powered committee headed by then chief secretary Johny Joseph had finalised the bidding criteria for the transport project along the western coast of Mumbai. The project was to be implemented on a build, own, operate and transfer basis for a concession for 30 years. The cost of phase I at the time was estimated at Rs 700 crore. The project cost is now estimated at Rs 2,000 crore.
