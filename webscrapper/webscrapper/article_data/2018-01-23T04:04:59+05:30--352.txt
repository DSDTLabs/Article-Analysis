BAREILLY: Police have lodged an FIR under sedition charges against an unidentified person for uploading an inflammatory video on   on Sunday evening against the release of Padmaavat. In the video, the man has allegedly threatened to destroy   and   if the film was released and screened. 

 A day after people of the Kshatriya community in Sambhal sent a letter written in blood to the President and PM to protest the release, the video turned up on social media and was widely circulated. 
 
 “I have gone through the video, in which the person has used hateful words against the government and threatened to destroy its institutions if the movie is screened on January 25, which is its scheduled date of release,” said Vikram Singh, in-charge of   Junction police outpost. 
 
 Station house officer Ajay Kumar Singh told TOI, “SI Vikram Singh took suo motu cognizance of the video on Facebook and lodged an FIR against an unidentified person under sections 124-A (sedition) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC and section 67 of IT Act.”
 
 In the video, a person identifying himself as Bhuvneshwar Singh, state chief of Kshatriya Sabha, can be seen saying, “The SC has made a big mistake comparing Padmaavat with Bandit Queen. If the movie is released, we will destroy SC and Parliament. Besides, if our Kshatriya leaders including home minister Rajnath Singh don’t resign from their posts, we will ensure they are shown the door in the next elections.” Akhil Bhartiya Kshatriya Mahasabha has also carried out protests across the state,. announcing a Rs 1 crore bounty to anyone who “throws actor   in a fire pit”.
