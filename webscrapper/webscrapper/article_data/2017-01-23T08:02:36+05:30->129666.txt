BHOPAL: Two Class XII students of a KV in   of   are giving   for the last month, exploding crude bombs and petrol bombs outside their homes and  , to browbeat them into giving good marks. 

 The school tolerated the nuisance considering the age of the students, but on Saturday night, when the duo tried to set a teacher’s house on fire, they informed police.
 
 Kotwali police have booked the two juvenile suspects on the basis of complaint lodged by Dr Rajkumar Sikarwar, the school’s Hindi lecturer and two other teachers. Police said the students have been terrorising teachers for good marks in the supplementary exam. They even made phone calls impersonating a local MLA and municipal officer, said an officer. When disciplinary action was initiated against them, they turned violent. According to Dr Sikarwar, the two students hurled a petrol bomb on the porch of his house. “The entire house would have been gutted had we not seen the flames in time,” said Amit Singh, who was on the spot. 
 
 Before Dr Sikarwar, it was biology teacher Rajkumar Verma whose vehicle was set on fire on January 3. “I thought it was a short circuit. We reported it to police but I hardly knew that these two students were behind it,” Verma told TOI over phone.
 
 “It’s their final year in school and we don’t want to spoil their career. But they are not worth it. They even tried to make false complaints against the school administration and teachers with the board,” Verma said. “They are dangerous. I am looking to take another house on rent and leave this place. They can go to any extent.” 
 
 “We have received a complaint from the teachers about these two students. Investigations are on and efforts are being made to arrest them,” said Morena SP Vineet Kapoor.
