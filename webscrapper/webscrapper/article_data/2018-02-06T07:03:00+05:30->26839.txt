Ghaziabad: A direction was issued by SSP Hari Narayan Singh on Monday not to provide under-training   in district with any   till verification of their antecedents is completed. At present, 137 sub-inspectors are posted in various police stations of district as part of training.

 The direction, which comes in the wake of an alleged ‘fake encounter’ by a   sub-inspector in Noida, was issued after checks conducted in several police stations. The checks conducted in police stations of Indirapuram and Link Road apart from other areas revealed several laxities during duty hours by trainee cops.
 
 “In order to ensure there is no negligence on the part of trainee sub-inspectors, it has been directed not to provide them with weapons of any kind for the time being. Trainees have been asked to wear their uniforms all times during duty and also display the number of stars on their shoulders that is appropriate for their designations,” Singh told TOI.
