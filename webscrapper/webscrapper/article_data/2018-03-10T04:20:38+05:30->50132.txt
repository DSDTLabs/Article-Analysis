JAIPUR: The   assembly passed an amendment bill on Friday that makes rape or gang rape of a girl up to 12 years of age an offence punishable with death. The state is now the country’s second, after Madhya Pradesh, where rape or gang rape of minor girls is a capital offence.

 Through the Criminal Laws (Rajasthan Amendment) Bill, 2018, the state government has added two sections to the   (IPC), 1860, in an effort to check rising heinous crimes against minor girls by provisioning harsher punishments.
 
 The new section 376-AA, added to IPC, says that whoever commits rape on a “woman” up to 12 years of age shall be punished with death or rigorous imprisonment for not less than 14 years and shall also be liable to fine.
