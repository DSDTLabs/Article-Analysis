LUCKNOW: The   on Monday appointed eight-time   as the leader of opposition in UP assembly. SPâ€™s national president Akhikesh Yadav nominated Chaudhary after ignoring veterans like Azam Khan and Shivpal Yadav, who have been the party leaders in the house in the past two occasions.

 "Akhilesh Yadav has nominated   as the leader of the SP Legislature Party and he will also be the Leader of the Opposition," SP spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary said here.
 
 70-year-old Chaudhary, an eight-time MLA, is considered close to Akhilesh and had served as basic education, child development and nutrition minister in the erstwhile SP government.
 
 The name of Azam Khan, the parliamentary affairs minister in the  , was also doing the rounds for the post. During the Mayawati government when SP was the main opposition party in UP, Shivpal Yadav was the leader of opposition. But since he fell out with his nephew and SP president Akhilesh, it was unlikely that Shivpal would be nominated for the post.
 
 Chaudhary, who was active in student union politics, was first elected to the UP Legislature in 1977 from Chillhar constituency. He now represents Bansdih constituency in Ballia district.
 
 Party sources said SP patron Mulayam Singh Yadav has convened a meeting of party legislators here on Wednesday, a day after his son will meet newly elected party MLAs, reflecting that differences in the Yadav family were not over.
 
 "The first meeting of the SP Legislature Party will take place tomorrow. No agenda has been set as of now," Chaudhary said.
