KOCHI: The   on Wednesday asked the state government to inform about the commercial benefits involved in the   International Seaport Limited project. Considering a petition filed by   of   seeking a CBI probe into the awarding of the project to   group, the court said the allegations are serious and that the future of the state is at stake. Government should explain about the commercial considerations behind the deal as well as the commercial benefits arising out of it, the court said.

 The petitioner had raised the demand for a CBI investigation citing the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) that the state’s interests were not protected when the deal was signed.
 
 Noticing the petitioner’s allegation that the government failed in providing necessary infrastructure to an enquiry commission appointed for probing the deal, the court asked the government to inform the steps taken in this regard. It was alleged by the petitioner that though the enquiry commission was to submit a report in six months, the commission had publicly declared that nothing could be done for four months due to lack of infrastructure. Citing the CAG report, the petitioner has alleged that the deal signed by the government would result in loss to the state from the first day of project implementation until the last day.
