Here���s Hyderabad Times��� pick of top 10 movies to watch out for.
Khaidi No 150: ���The Mega comeback���, this film officially marks Chiranjeevi���s much-awaited return to the silver screen as hero. For an entire generation that grew up idolising Chiru, there���s no better reason to cheer in 2017. 
 B��hubali: The Conclusion: For two years now cinema lovers have been asking just one question ��� ���Why did Kattappa kill B��hubali?���. Looks like we���ll finally find out in 2017 when the sequel hits the screens.
 Gautamiputra Satakarni: Nandamuri Balakrishna���s 100th film, this period drama has given legions of Balayya fans a reason to slap their thighs and twirl their moustaches, in celebration. 
 Guru: A remake of the Bollywood hit, Saala Khadoos, Guru is keeping the Telugu 
 audiences waiting with bated breath to see what magic Venkatesh will spin on the screen. 
 Katamarayudu: Power Star broke many hearts when he announced that he would quit acting after a couple of films. And that makes this one the first of his final few left. 
 No wonder fans are so emotional.
 Ghazi 
 Touted as ���India���s first submarine film���, this trilingual has Rana Daggubati playing a naval commander. The film is based on the true incidents on the mysterious sinking of PNS Ghazi, a Pakistan Submarine by destroyer INS Rajput (D141) during the Bangladesh Liberation war. 
 Duvvada Jagannadham
 The makers are tight-lipped about details of this Allu Arjun starrer. But the fresh pairing of Bunny-Pooja Hegde and the buzz that he will be seen playing a 
 devout Brahmin is already getting the fans excited.
 Keshava 
 The tag line ���Revenge is a dish best served cold��� coupled with Nikhil���s hitherto unseen rugged, intense avatar in the posters has piqued the curiosity about Keshava 
 already. 
 
 Mahesh Babu teaming up with AR Murugadoss ��� that���s one combo that packs quite a punch. Moreover, he���s teaming up with Rakul for the first time. 
 
 Om Namo Venkatesaya 
 No one aces the genre of devotional films quite like the Nagarjuna-K Raghavendra Rao duo. Remember Sri Ramadasu, Annamayya and Shirdi Sai? This time, Nag will be seen playing Hathiram Baba, a devotee of Lord Venkateswara.
