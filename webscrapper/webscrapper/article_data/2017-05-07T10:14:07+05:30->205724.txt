LUCKNOW: A day after senior   leader   Yadav announced in Etawah that he will soon launch   (SMM), the idea started taking shape. Posters and billboards welcoming the formation of the new front have come up in the state capital with party workers congratulating Shivpal for the initiative. 

 The billboards, put up by a die-hard Shivpal supporter Om Prakash alias Pappu Yadav, however, has no mention of Samajwadi Party, even as it welcomes the formation of ‘Samajwadi Secular Morcha’ under the leadership of ‘Netaji’   Singh Yadav.
 
 Meanwhile, SP leader Shivpal Yadav reiterated that the morcha (front) led by SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav will join hands with anyone and everyone who wishes to fight communal forces. “It will be led by Netaji (Mulayam Singh Yadav),” said Shivpal, talking to media in Kannauj on Saturday. 
 
 On Friday, Shivpal Yadav took everybody by surprise when he broke news of his plan to float a front, saying that the move was aimed at restoring the honor of ‘Netaji’ (Mulayam) and bring back all Samajwadis under one umbrella. The move led to speculations that the SP was heading for a split. Uncle Shivpal has been at daggers drawn with nephew and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav since the party was gearing up for the assembly elections held earlier this year. 
 
 Akhilesh took control over the party by replacing his father and SP founder Mulayam Singh Yadav, while the latter had refused to campaign for the party during polls and only addressed meetings for candidates from the family, including his daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav in Lucknow and brother Shivpal in Jaswantnagar. Shivpal won the elections, while Aparna lost.
