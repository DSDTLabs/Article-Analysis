Nagpur: Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court directed the divisional commissioner to come clear on removal of encroachments from Bezonbagh or face the contempt action. A division bench comprising justices Bhushan Dharmadhikari and Arun Upadhye asked him to reply on an affidavit before March 7. The court’s stringent directives came while hearing a contempt plea by Madhukar Patil through counsel Firdos Mirza alleging commissioner’s inaction for not handing over open plots in Bezonbagh to Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) despite court’s clear orders in a related petition (WP No 1515/2008) filed by Atmaram Ukey against Maharashtra government. On December 19, 2008, the HC clearly directed commissioner to hand over available open space to the corporation after removal of encroachment, as expeditiously as possible, and in any case before January 31, 2009. It also directed him to conduct a survey on encroachments and submit a report along with recommendations to the additional chief secretary of State Revenue and Forest Department. A year later on December 9, 2009, the court even censured the commissioner over his inaction while tersely observing that the time sought by him “was just an excuse to delay implementation of its directives”. On November 28, 2011, Ukey filed an application seeking directives to handover open plots which are not used as dwelling houses to the NMC commissioner. On May 6, 2016, the HC again directed the commissioner to hand over possession of plots as mentioned in 2011 order. He instead filed an application for modification of that order which was rejected by the court on June 24. Aggrieved by Kumar’ delaying tactics, Patil knocked judiciary's doors demanding directives to him to implement court’s orders.
