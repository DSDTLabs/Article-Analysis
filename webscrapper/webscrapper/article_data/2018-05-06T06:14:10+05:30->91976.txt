KOLKATA: When a snazzy mall replaced a decrepit  , it came as a boon for many shoppers. But for residents in the locality, the development has led to the chaos of clogged streets.

 With scores of cars vying for the few parking slots on the streets, locals have difficulty finding a space to park their cars. Since several homes were constructed in the mid-20th century, most houses did not have a provision for car park. As people purchased cars, they parked them before their homes. But now, they find the space usurped by strangers.
 
 Sripati Pradhan, a septuagenarian who lives on  , says he would gladly pay   a fee to own a parking space but has to hunt for a slot as the entire neighbourhood gets choked with shoppers’ cars. “I have been residing in this place since the 1964. The transformation has been gradual till the mall arrived. Then, the change was drastic,” he recalled.
 
 Subrata Sen, who lives a few houses away, voiced his protest over muscle flexing by a section of parking attendants but then backed off once he realised they enjoyed political backing. “They resort to all types of nuisance. If you protest, the result could be deadly,” Sen said.
 
 Cars parked illegally on pavements have made life miserable for senior citizens, many of whom need medical attention but ambulances can’t reach their doorsteps. Doly Sen, a resident of Sardar Sankar Road, recounted how difficult it was to transport a relative who had taken ill as parked cars blocked the ambulance from accessing the house.
