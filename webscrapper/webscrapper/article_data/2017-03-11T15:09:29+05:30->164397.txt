PANAJI: Former Congress MLA  , who quit the party to join the BJP ahead of the polls, is leading in Cumbarjua constituency in the 2017 state assembly polls in Goa. Madkaikar has polled 6485 votes while Congress candidate Xavier Fialho has pulled in a distant 2052 votes.

 The Bharatiya Janata Partyâ€™s (BJP) move to induct Madkaikar into the party irked the BJP core members who had conveyed their displeasure to the party high command. Madkaikar had slammed the BJP during his term with the Congress but then changed his tune.
 
 The Old Goa Police had registered a First Information Report (FIR) against Madkaikar for allegedly violating the model code of conduct during the campaign for the Assembly elections. Madkaikar had allegedly distributed coupons from a department store run by a trust that is headed by a BJP senior leader.
