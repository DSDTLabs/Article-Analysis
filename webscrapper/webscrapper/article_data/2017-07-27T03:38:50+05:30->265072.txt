NEW DELHI: The   on Wednesday okayed a central bill for regulating use of DNA-based technology as a forensic tool in civil and criminal proceedings, and for identification of missing persons and unidentified bodies.

 The 271st report of the Law Commission headed by Justice B S   submitted to law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad a new draft bill — the DNA Based Technology (Use and Regulation) Bill, 2017 — in place of an earlier bill on the issue referred to it by the Union government in September 2016 and said it had enough safeguards to protect right to privacy of citizens.
 
 Rejecting concerns raised by sections of civil society, the law panel said use of DNA-based technology for criminal investigation, identification of missing persons and unidentified bodies as well as the proposed   would in no way breach the privacy of individuals.
 
 “DNA Data Banks, both national and at state level, will be responsible for storing DNA profiles received from accredited laboratories and maintaining certain indices for various categories of data, like crime scene index, suspects’ index, offenders’ index, missing persons’ index and unknown deceased persons’ index,” the commission said.
 
 “DNA profiling would be undertaken exclusively for identification of a person and would not be used to extract any other information,” it said and recommended strict confidentiality in safekeeping of records of DNA profiles and their use.
 
 “Violation of confidentiality would be liable for punishment of imprisonment, which may extend up to three years and also fine which may extend to Rs 2 lakh,” it said. Significantly, a ninejudge   bench headed by   is engaged in a lively debate on the constitutional status of right to privacy, a question which arose from petitions terming collection of biometric data for Aadhaar as a violation of citizens’ privacy.
 
 In its report, the law panel said, “The 2017 bill, as revised and modified by the commission, is in consonance and in conformity with the provisions which are added by the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2005, which also provides for DNA profiling.”
 
 The bill drafted by the commission proposed setting up of a statutory DNA Profiling Board which would lay down procedures and standards for establishment of DNA laboratories, supervise their functioning and frame guidelines for training police and other investigating agencies dealing with DNA-related matters.
