THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state assembly witnessed unruly scenes on Thursday as treasury benches and the opposition stormed into the well and almost came to blows after a heated debate over Shiv Sena’s   at Marine Drive in Kochi on Wednesday, forcing the speaker to adjourn the house for more than an hour. The opposition, irked by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s comment that Sena goondas might have been hired by the UDF, later boycotted the assembly as neither the chief minister withdrew his allegation nor did the speaker remove it from assembly records.

 The house also witnessed the chief minister proceeding to the well after the adjournment to argue with the opposition, which the latter said was unprecedented.
 
 “The chief minister came to the well to threaten opposition members, which should have never happened. He (the CM) says he was threatened by  , which is not correct,” opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala told reporters.
 
 Later in a Facebook post, Balram denied the allegation and challenged to verify the video recording to prove he had misbehaved with the CM.
 
 Vijayan’s allegation linking the UDF and   came at a time when the opposition members were protesting in the chamber after being denied a discussion on an adjournment motion moved by Congress's Hibi Eden on ‘police inaction and intelligence failure in preventing Shiv Sena’s hooliganism’. Pointing at the protesting members, Vijayan said he ‘was wondering whether it was a drama with hideous intentions and whether Shiv Sena activists were hired by them to do the moral policing’.
 
 Provoked, the UDF members moved towards the treasury benches while the ruling members formed a wall around Vijayan. A heated exchange of words followed, prompting speaker P Sreeramakrishnan to temporarily adjourn the house.
