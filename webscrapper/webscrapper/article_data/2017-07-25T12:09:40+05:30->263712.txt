AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court put an end to the ordeal of trustee of HB   School, Muktak Kapadia, and the school principal Poonam Sedani, as it quashed the FIR filed against them by the parent of a student on Monday. Kapadia was booked earlier this year for cheating, after Chirag Parekh filed a complaint with Ghatlodia police that the school charged exorbitant fees by promising to secure CBSE affiliation by the time the kids were admitted to Class I but failed to do so.

 Justice A J Desai junked the FIR after Kapadia’s advocate Tejas Barot submitted that the issue was settled between the trustee and the parent amicably and the complainant had even stated on an affidavit that he did not have any grievance against the school management.
 
 After this FIR, Kapadia’s troubles started when a lower court and the high court denied him anticipatory bail. In April, it refused protection against possible arrest to Kapadia, The HC observed that Kapadia was accused of having “dishonest intention” and cheating more than 400 people. The HC later stayed his arrest till August 14.
