PATNA: The state BJP on Thursday said chief minister (CM)   criticised the 2017-18 Union Budget because of his ‘friendship’ with RJD president  . In response, the JD(U) said before attacking the CM, the saffron party’s Bihar unit should explain if Union finance minister   had addressed the concerns of common man and middle class in his Budget.

 “It seems Nitish is under total influence of Lalu, which is why he was looking for separate budgetary announcements for Bihar in the Budget,” former deputy chief minister and senior BJP functionary   said. He wondered if the Bihar budget would address the developmental concerns of all the districts and blocks of the state.
 
 Modi said Bihar would be the biggest beneficiary of the central budget. “Jaitley had given AIIMS to Bihar two years ago, but the state government did not provide land for it,” he added. Ridiculing Nitish for terming the Union Budget ‘boring’ and ‘disappointing’, SuMo said the CM should explain if the people of the state were not being bored by his repetitive parroting of his two pet programmes – total prohibition and ‘Saat Nishchay (seven resolves).’ With regard to demand for special category status, he said former economic advisor to the Centre Raghuram Rajan and the 14th Finance Commission had annulled the standing criteria for it. “The UPA and Lalu could not fulfil this demand. The present central dispensation, too, cannot give it,” Modi said.
 
 JD(U) spokesman and MLC Sanjay Singh said Modi should first look inward and hear the call of his conscience and then answer if the Budget is for common man and middle class families. “The Budget was an eyewash. There was nothing in it that deserved praise,” he said, adding that Jaitley should have taken into account regional concerns and demands.
