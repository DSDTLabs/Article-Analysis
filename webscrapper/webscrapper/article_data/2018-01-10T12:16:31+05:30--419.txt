 “I was performing at   amid a full house. Being an ardent cricket fan myself, I had requested a person to sit with a transistor to keep me updated on the score. As soon as India won the match, the man yelled from the wings and I made an announcement about the victory. The audience was filled with jubilation in an instant,” the ghazal virtuoso said.
 
 Udhas will be part of the fine mélange of artists, both instrumental and vocal, who will be performing at Swara Zankar at New English School, Ramanbaug. Organised by city-based Violin Academy, the four–day   will begin on January 11.
