NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Tuesday stressed the need for civic agencies to ensure waste is segregated in   before it is collected.

 “There doesn’t seem to be any difference,” a bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar remarked after seeing a news video of piling trash at each of the landfill sites in the city, despite a shocking incident earlier this month where two persons were killed in a freak accident at Ghazipur.
 
 “You have to reduce the garbage and segregate but you haven’t even started that conversation,” the bench told lawyers for the corporation, after the video showed that despite the accident nothing much had changed in the city on lack of cleanliness and waste management.
 
 The bench also highlighted that the entire problem was caused by the unauthorised colonies in the national capital.
 
 Meanwhile, HC also approved a set of draft bylaws on sanitary waste disposal framed jointly by local authorities and environmental experts, which calls for introduction of user fees for municipal services among other things.
 
 The court directed the Delhi government to forward the bylaws to the LG office so that these can be immediately notified, giving them four weeks time. The bylaws are the “first of its kind” in the country, the experts told the bench. Apart from introducing user fee for using municipal services, the bylaws provide for enforcing segregation at source such as in the households and housing societies, strengthening of waste collection, storage, transportation and processing systems and imposing of penalties for littering or violating the rules.
