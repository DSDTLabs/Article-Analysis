COIMBATORE: About 50   and interreligious couples celebrated ‘Samathuva Pongal’ with their families at a field near   here on Monday.

 Writer and journalist  , who was the organiser, said people celebrate festivals like Pongal with their kin or with people from castes which they deem equal. 
 
 “But people who had married outside their caste or religion have no festivals. They usually give up celebrating festivals of both religions as a compromise,” Paamaran said, adding that, “So we started holding this event.”
 
 The idea behind holding the event on Pongal is that no religion can claim ownership of the harvest festival, said Paamaran. “A farmer could belong to any community or religion,” he said. 
 
 The couples and their family members gathered at the field and played traditional games like goli gundu, pambaram, uri adithal, and kite flying. “The most important part of the event is where we taught traditional games to the children,” said Paamaran. 
 
 Children today are glued to computers and mobile phones and are not exposed to outdoor games. “We introduced pambaram and pattam (kite flying) to at least 10 children today and they did not even know what the games were,” said Paamaran. The event was a useful recreation for the families, he added. 
 
 The event was started in 1997. “Every year around 10 new couples join here for celebration,” Paamaran said. “We do not brand or boast about it,” he added.
