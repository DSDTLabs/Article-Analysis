Nagpur: A man allegedly attempted to kill his wife by poisoning her birthday cake at midnight on July 21. The victim is recuperating at Mayo Hospital. An offence of attempt to murder has been registered at Yashodhara Nagar police station against accused Jamil Khan (45), following a complaint by Saira Bano (40), the survivor’s mother. Cops have sent the cake to Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) for investigation. Saira claimed that Jamil, father of five, had forced the family to get him married to their eldest daughter Aliya (25). The duo got married on March 8 this year. Soon, Jamil started harassing Aliya over petty issues. A resident of Farooq Nagar, Jamil owns a tailoring shop, where Saira and Aliya were working from the last nine months, informed Saira, whose husband died around two decades back. “I requested Jamil to provide me financial assistance since I wanted to pay off a debt which I took for my younger daughters’ marriage. But he asked me to mortgage my house measuring 600 sq ft at Ekta Nagar. He prepared mortgage papers for Rs1.60 lakh and fraudulently procured my signature on July 7. He also gave me fake cheque of Rs25,000. The next day, he got separated from Aliya,” Saira told TOI. Relatives said Aliya had tried to call up Jamil several times, but it remained unanswered. Surprisingly, he called up Aliya to wish on her birthday and also told her that he would meet her. He then turned up with the cake late in the night, when Saira was also present. When Jamil left after a small celebration, Aliya’s health started deteriorating and she vomited thrice before felling unconscious. Saira immediately rushed her to Mayo Hospital and informed her relatives. The cops were alerted to the medico legal case by the hospital authorities. Investigation officer BA Hood said only the FSL reports would reveal the truth. He added that Jamil is at large since the incident.
