AHMEDABAD: After selling off their companies to foreign firms in large deals over the past year, promoters of three city-based companies — Havmor, eInfochips, and   — are now keenly weighing options to invest in startups apart from venturing into other sectors and scaling up their existing businesses. 

 Talking to TOI after a panel discussion on ‘Story of   Exits’, organized as part of TieCon Ahmedabad, an entrepreneurial conference organized in the city on Friday, Pratul Shroff, founder, eInfochips, said, “For the coming three years, I will be with Arrow Electronics and help accelerate the company’s growth and focus on more hiring.” Subsequently,   said, he will look at an advisory role to mentor and even invest in companies as a venture capitalist. Early this year, US-based Arrow acquired eInfochip in a deal valued at around Rs 1,800 crore.
 
 Ankit Chona, the managing director of Havmor, expressed willingness to scale up the existing business and explore investment opportunities as well. “We are looking at scaling up the restaurant business and also the newly launched boutique ice cream brand once the official handovers are done with,” Chona said. “While we are looking at investment opportunities, that is not the only option. We will be exploring new business sectors and are looking at investments in the   sector, as part of which we are open to small acquisitions.” South Korean giant Lotte Confectionary acquired Havmor’s ice-cream business for Rs 1,020 crore last year.
 
 Founder of Motif Inc, Kaushal Mehta, echoed a similar view about mentorship and investments plans down the line. “For the next three years, I will be committed to scaling up the company and I am even open to working towards it after that.”Mehta went on to say: “While I am not looking at setting up a separate business, investing in companies including start-ups is being explored. A few companies have already approached me and will look into it.”
