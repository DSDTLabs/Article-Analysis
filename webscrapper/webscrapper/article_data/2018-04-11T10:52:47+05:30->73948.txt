PUNE: More differently-abled children will soon be able to enrol in the special school run by the   ( ). In the next four months, the school is set to get a new building, which will have capacity to house 50 children.

 At present, the school — Swabhiman Centre for Special Children — is operating from the premises of Dr  , and does not have space to house more than 22 children. The school imparts various skills and provides therapies to the differently-abled students for their overall development.
 
 
 Amol  , chief executive officer of KCB, told TOI, “In the current facility, we are facing certain difficulties in providing all the required therapies. As a result, the need was felt to have a dedicated facility.”
 
 Accordingly, KCB’s engineering department conducted a survey and based on the findings, a tender was floated in November 2017. Recently, the tender was awarded to a private contractor.
 
 “As per the terms and conditions of the tender, the contractor has to complete the work within the next four months. The new building will have all the necessary equipment as well as different therapies cells,” Jagtap said.
 
 He added that the school will be able to accommodate about 50 children. The estimated cost of the project — including the cost of therapy equipment — would be around Rs 1.5 crore. Almost all the students here, Jagtap said, belong to below poverty line (BPL) families. The board spends Rs 1lakh each month on the school.
 
 Sources in the board confirmed that the conditions at the current school were not ideal. A board member said, “We had received complaints about poor facilities and unhygienic conditions at the school. Over the past two years, we have been following up with the board authorities. This facility is a lifeline for the poor families. The board must pay extra attention to the facility to maintain the basic standard.”
