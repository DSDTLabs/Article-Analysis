JAIPUR: Jumping the   is a   followed by motorists at the   200ft bypass circle.

 While police officials rue the lack of awareness about traffic norms, motorists say there are no proper alert signs at the spot. “People will follow norms when there are enough cops for enforcement. There is only one traffic cop to man the entire crossing,” said Vikram Kaushik, a local shopkeeper.
 
 The authorities, however, said that they were paying attention to improving infrastructure. “There are some issues like the construction of railing and removing encroachments. All agencies, including the police and civic bodies, are on the same page to carry out works and avert accidents,” the official said.
 
 “There are structural problems on this stretch. There are no proper signboards here to indicate where to park, where to stop, etc,” said Vikram. Officials said that they have been surveying the   hotspots in the city to understand what makes some places the most accident prone.
 
 “Accidents can be prevented only when people are willing to stop at traffic signals and follow rules. But there are people who refuse to follow traffic norms even at risk to their own lives,” said an official.
