 The company’s counsel argued their case before the appellate authority of the   on Thursday seeking to revoke the non-renewal of the CTO after it expired on March 31. During the May 4 hearing, the pollution regulator submitted grounds under which the consent was not renewed, to which Sterlite’s counsel submitted their response on Thursday.
