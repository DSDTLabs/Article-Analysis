 Ludhiana: On the one hand, civic officials have been asked to increase the pace of recovery of pending dues if they want their salaries on time and on the other, office staff has been deputed on re-verification of atta-dal scheme forms. Although officials said it will be difficult to handle both duties at the same time, authorities said they would get recoveries at any cost. 
 
 The civic body has been made the nodal agency for verification of forms provided through the district administration. But officials said they are already under pressure to recover pending dues from defaulters, which would make it tough for them to handle so many things. 
 
 Officials of the district food civil supplies and consumer affairs department are also helping MC officials but most of the staff from all branches has been deputed for the verification process. According to an official, MC staff was earlier put on ward delimitation   because the company could not provide staff despite appointing an agency. He said they were tasked with election duty also and re-verification of forms would be another problem. 
 
 MC commissioner Jaskiran Singh said while the staff is involved in the task of form verification, they hope to achieve set targets of recovery. He said last month they recovered Rs 2 crore from various sources and this month they have doubled the target. 
 
 The state government started the re-verification process to check whether actual beneficiaries are availing the facility. The government will start distributing wheat and pulses to the poor after the verification process.
