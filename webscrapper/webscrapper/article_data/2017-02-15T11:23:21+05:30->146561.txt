ROHTAK: Former chief minister of   Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Tuesday asked the ruling   to find a solution to the ongoing   for reservation immediately or make public the reasons for the delay in fulfilling promises made by it earlier to the protesting community.

 Hooda, who was addressing a press conference at his residence in Rohtak, said, "Jats are on a dharna across the state to seek what was promised by CM   to them. When it was not fulfilled, the Jats were forced to protest leaving their work."
 
 Mocking Khattar, Hooda said he probably was the first CM who is delaying action on the promises made by him to a community, but later retracted without giving reasons behind the delay. On his stand about the reservation, he said he has announced his support to the ongoing dharna till it remains peaceful. On the call of INLD to start digging the Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal, Hooda said the current mess was because of former CM O P Chautala who refused to protect Haryana's interest during his tenure as head of the state. tnn
 
 "Chautala gave priority to his family relations with   CM   than state's share of water from SYL canal," he alleged.
