Trichy: Aspirants seeking admission to engineering colleges in the state can register online for the Tamil Nadu Engineering Admission (TNEA) counselling this year onwards. The last date to apply is May 30. Those who do not have internet or computer facility at home can make use of the facilities arranged at the University College of Engineering on BIT Campus, Anna University, or the Government College of Engineering at Srirangam in Trichy. Elaborate arrangements have been made at both the centres in Trichy which are among the 42 facilitation centres across the state.  “The registration was a simple process which could be completed in a matter of 10 minutes, but I am really looking forward to the next phase of admission which I have no clue,” said G Vamsidharan from Trichy who visited the BIT campus.  TNEA consists of three phases - online registration, original certificate verification and online choice filling. Once the registration is complete, the original certificates will be verified at the facilitation centres, selected during registration, in June.  “200 computers with internet facility have been kept ready with faculty members to assist students in the registration process at the campus,” said dean T Senthil Kumar, University College of Engineering, BIT Campus, Anna University.  “Facilitation centres will screen videos demonstrating on how to use the TNEA portal during counselling,” he added.  Once students register on the TNEA portal, board exam marks of each candidate would be automatically fetched though the directorate of board examination. Following this, the merit list would be prepared for the eligible candidates and published on the TNEA portal.  “We will be given six chances to select our choice of college unlike in the past when we needed to take a decision at the time of counselling itself. This seems to be a transparent method as the whole process will be done online,” said G Keerthivasan, another candidate from Trichy.
