Five years ago, she learnt to ride a bike for her film Puthagam. And now,   has tried her hand at riding a cycle rickshaw. This time, it’s for her film with Karthi,  . 

 Rakul, who is currently filming in London for one of her   films, says, “I had to ride a rickshaw for one of the song sequences and I was quite kicked. The rickshawala was so nervous that he kept following me around while I was riding it, telling me how the brake functioned and how it was different from the other ones. I think he was worried that I would ram the rick into something and hurt myself. I enjoyed pedalling the rick around   with Karthi and the rickshawala on the passenger seat.”
