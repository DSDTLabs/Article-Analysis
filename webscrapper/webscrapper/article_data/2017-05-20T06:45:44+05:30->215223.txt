PUNE: Citizens need not go to a police station to file a complaint about their   necessary to get fresh papers issued. These complaints can be lodged online and a   report can be obtained instantly. 

 Such a facility for the citizens through the “Lost and Found” portal on the Pune police’s website was launched on Friday. “The portal will start functioning from Monday,” deputy commissioner (cyber crime) Sudhir Hiremath said.
 
 Hiremath said along with the complaint of the lost article, people can also report about the articles they have found. 
 
 “After filing the report for found articles, the portal will cross check the complaints in the lost articles section. If the found article report matches with the information in any of the reports, the complainant will get a notification automatically,” Hiremath added.
 
 As of now, a person has to go to a police station to file a missing report for any article and spend long hours getting the report from the police station as the police personnel at the police station registers the report as per his convenience, a police officer said.
 
 The new system has bypassed this tiring process and will save the complainant’s time and that of the police personnel,” the officer said.
 
 Hiremath said the portal will help them keep the record of all the reports with the police stations as well as the crime branch. “If an article is lost in Shivajinagar area and it is mentioned in the form, the report will be sent directly to the   station and the crime branch,” Hiremath said.
