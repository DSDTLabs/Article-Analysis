Amaravati: If all goes well, the   Pradesh Civil Supplies Corporation will supply Jaya variety of   produced in the twin Godavari districts to Kerala.

 Kerala’s civil supplies minister P Thilothaman met his AP counterpart Prathipati Pulla Rao and deputy chief minister K E Krishna Murty on Thursday to pursue the proposal in the secretariat. The ministers discussed the proposal along with the officials. Kerala team proposed to AP government to enter into an agreement according to which AP will take up continuous supply of Jaya rice at the rate of 6,500 tonnes per month.
 
 Thilothaman said Kerala’s civil supplies corporation is procuring rice at the rate of Rs 35 per kg and if AP supplies the same at a lesser price, they are ready to sign an agreement with AP civil supplies corporation. Minister also assured that his state government will pay money within two days of supply of rice. However, the AP team expressed its inability to supply rice at that rate. 
 
 Both the parties agreed to discuss the issue of price at another meeting.
 
 When the Kerala team asked for the supply of Guntur chillies, Pulla Rao suggested that the issue could be discussed after the deal over rice is finalised.
 
 Earlier, deputy CM K E Krishna Murthy told the media that Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had called him 20 days back seeking supply of rice from AP which has a lot of demand particularly during the Onam season which falls in September. He then took it to the notice of CM N Chandrababu Naidu who responded positively.
 
 Meanwhile, Pulla Rao warned rice shop owners of strict action if they sell pre-packed items at two prices post GST. He said the stocks will be seized and the shops sealed if they were found resorting to anomalies as the rules are more stringent in AP than in other states.
