NAGPUR: SCZCC has for the time-being decided to continue with its monthly early morning musical programme  . The event, which was started three years back, is among the most popular ones in the centre’s calendar. Held on every second Sunday of the month, in April it missed its scheduled date but is now set to be held on April 16.

 The event will have a performance by upcoming flautist   from Mumbai on Sunday at 6.30am at the SCZCC premises. “Since approval for the programme and a budget are yet to be sanctioned we will be featuring upcoming and amateur artists as otherwise too very established musicians don’t require this platform,” said  , project officer at SCZCC.
 
 “We did not have clearance to hold this event in the new financial year. Any decision on it can be taken only in the programme committee meeting called by the state’s minister for cultural affairs who is also its chairman. Since the date for that meeting has not been finalized and we do not know when it will be called, our officiating director Dr Sajit EN has decided to continue with this event till a fresh order is received,” said Dande. 
 
 SCZCC has now decided to propose holding it between October to March. “That’s because we face a lot of trouble during the monsoon months. For now, we are continuing with the event till the time the committee meets,” Dande added.
 
 Brahmanaad received tremendous response for its ambience and content. Musicians like Pt Rajan Sajan Mishra, Bhajan Sapoori and Rahul Deshpande have taken the stage at this event.
 
 Music lovers of the city have enjoyed performances for a paltry fee of Rs50 or an annual membership fee of Rs300.
