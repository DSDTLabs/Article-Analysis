RANCHI: The rise in the allocation for development schemes for STs in the Union Budget has evoked reactions in Jharkhand, which has a huge tribal population. Union finance minister  , in his Wednesday's budget speech, increased the budgetary allocations to Rs 31,920 crore for the 2017-18 from Rs 24,005 crore in the last fiscal. 

 Rameshwar Oraon, chairperson of the   (NCST) on Wednesday welcomed the increased allocation but expressed his concern on its spending pattern. Speaking to TOI after Jaitley's budget speech,   questioned the spending on budgetary allocations and claimed that the funds provided to states were diverted to expenditures that did not concern the tribal communities. 
 
 "For instance, during a NCST review meeting for Odisha recently we found that the fund allotted for tribal welfare schemes was diverted for purchasing bullets, construction of police stations and building transportation headquarters," Oraon said. 
 
 He added that the budgetary allocations for the welfare of tribal community should not be based on the population density but instead be focused on problems being faced in tribal areas. "How many of the tribal children do actually get scholarships? States like Jharkhand have not been able to spend nearly 52% of their state budget with only one month left for the lapse of current financial year," Oraon said. 
 
 Stating that the development gap between urban and tribal dominated rural areas could not be bridged by allotting more funds only, Oraon said the schemes such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act had failed in tribal areas because of the low wages. "The state and the center should come together to look at the problems at grassroots and ensure monitoring of the spending," Oraon said.
