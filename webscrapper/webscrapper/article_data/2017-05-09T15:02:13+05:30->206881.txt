BARWANI: Indian National   general secretary and former chief minister of   Digvijaya Singh on Monday termed the chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s Narmada Sewa Yatra as mere hypocrisy. 

 He joined hands with people of Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA), who formed human chain with a demand that NCA should not clear the closure of Sardar Sarovar project gates.
 
 Speaking to media persons at a bridge on river Narmada in Rajghat, Singh alleged that the chief minister Chouhan’s his kin and   workers are involved in illegal sand mining and ruining river Narmada and trying to mislead people by ‘Narmada Sewa Yatra’ which is nothing but a hypocrisy.
 
 Singh said that if CM   really loves Narmada River and wants to serve it than he should step down from his position and start ‘Narmada Parikrama’ on his feet. Singh was in Kukshi to pay tribute to late Congress leader Pratap Singh Baghel. He alleged that 40, 000 families affected from Sardar Sarovar project are still awaiting for the proper rehabilitation and Narmada Control Authority on Tuesday is assumed to give verdict of closing the dam’s gates, which will lead the affected to miserable condition.TNN
