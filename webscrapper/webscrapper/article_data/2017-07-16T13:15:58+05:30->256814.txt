UDHAGAMANDALAM: The   wore a festive look on Saturday as aficionados of the   (NMR) celebrated the 12th anniversary of its journey into  .

 The NMR, one of the major tourist attractions in the Nilgiris, was declared a world heritage site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) on July 15, 2005 at the 29th session of the World Heritage Committee meeting at Durban.
 
 In a brief function organised by the Heritage Steam Chariot Trust (HSCT), comprising NMR lovers, at the Coonoor railway station, all the passengers were greeted with sweets and some were garlanded as a token of travelling in the mountain train on the NMR heritage anniversary day.
 
 “We have been observing July 15 as the NMR heritage day since 2006 to popularise the steam engine-powered mountain train among the youth and find more patrons,” said K Nataraj, managing trustee, HSCT.
 
 “Talking about the history of the NMR and its present state and how it could be saved in the days to come is a way of creating awareness among the public, especially youngsters and stakeholders,” he added.
 
 Pointing out that the charm of the NMR was gradually fading away, Nataraj said, “No proper care or interest is taken by the railway authorities to glorify the heritage mountain railway. As far as the authorities are concerned, it is just another railway in the region.”
 
 L Sheela, a passenger, told TOI, “It was a sweet surprise when we were greeted at the Coonoor railway station. Only then we came to know we travelled in the mountain train on the NMR heritage anniversary day. It gives us immense pleasure.”
 
 In the past, the NMR was operated with six coaches. Now, it has only four coaches.
 
 NMR officials, however, did not take any initiative to observe the day. “The heritage railway section will disappear in future unless and otherwise stakeholders and the local public come forward to save the mountain railway,” Nataraj said.
