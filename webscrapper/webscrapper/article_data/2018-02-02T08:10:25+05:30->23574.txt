CHENNAI: With finance minister Arun Jaitley announcing in his budget speech on Thursday that railway stations with a daily footfall of more than 25,000 would be provided with escalators, at least 12 stations in the city’s   train network are likely to get the facility.

 These include important stations like Tiruvallur, Avadi, Chengalpet, Guindy, Arakkonam, Pazhavanthangal and Chromepet, which recorded more than 25,000 originating passengers per day, as per data from the 2016-17 financial year.
 
 However,   officials are tight-lipped about the stations where the scheme will be implemented as it is not yet clear if the benchmark will be originating passengers or total footfall at the station. 
 
 "If the total footfall is taken into consideration, more stations will get   services," an official said, adding that they would take a call as per the Railway Board’s advice.
 
 At present, escalators are provided at MRTS stations on the   route, but at many stations they are poorly maintained or not operational during some periods of the day. In suburban stations like Tambaram and Chennai Egmore, there are either one or two escalators and the facility is so convenient that there are complaints when they are stopped for a day or two for maintenance work.
 
 K Baskar, a member of Chennai Divisional Rail Users Consultative Committee, welcomed the move. He suggested that Railways should carry out a proper survey of the footfalls recorded at suburban stations. 
 
 "For instance, if I buy a ticket from   to  , it costs Rs 10, which is the same as Chennai-Tiruvallur. So the system will count it as a footfall at Tiruvallur station and not Putlur. This means smaller stations where there is no electronic record of footfalls will stand to lose out on amenities," he said.
