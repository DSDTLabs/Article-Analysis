AHMEDABAD: In a unique initiative, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIM-A) organized 'Dinner in the Dark' event on Sunday evening on its new campus. Students and faculty members were served food in complete darkness in an auditorium so that they can understand blindness and empathise with visually-impaired persons.

 The event was held by   (EOSC) of the institute where a panel of five blind persons from a city-based organization engaged them in a discussion based on audience questions. The event was held from 6pm to 8pm on Sunday at PP Gupta Auditorium of the new campus in which around 150 members of the 14 A-League institutions including IIM-A, IIT-Gandhinagar, NID, Gujarat University and GNLU participated, said organisers of the event.
 
  
  Harshvardhan Bisht, a postgraduate programme (PGP) student and coordinator of the programme, said that the idea came when a student of IIM-A went to Austin University in USA under a student-exchange programme where he saw such a programme being implemented to understand the issues of visually impaired students. 
 
 The organisers also decided to take Rs 50 for registration of each person and the amount collected through the event be donated to the Blind Peopleâ€™s Association ( ), said Bisht. 
 
 The students asked the panelists how they visualised the outer world and how they acclimatized to the new place. They also enquired if there are any mobile apps for the visually impaired and if they feel any kind of discrimination from so-called normal people. The participants and panelists had juice, burger, chips and pancakes during the discussion. 
 
 He said that more such events will be organized in the future.
