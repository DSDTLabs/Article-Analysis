BENGALURU: The   ( ) is plagued by procurement delays, with the department buying 1,300 buses of the 1,650 announced in January 2017.

 Chief minister   had also announced in his previous budget that the corporation would procure 3,000 more buses, of which 1,500 were to be taken on lease. However, there has been no headway in the project so far.
 
 The BMTC now has 6,586 buses, of which 860 ply as chartered services for IT parks, companies, factories and educational institutions during peak hours, and about500 are off the roadson any given day because of mechanical or technical issues. This means the corporation operates over 5,200 buses for regular commuters during rush hours. The number will further come down as the BMTC will have to scrap nearly 1,000 old buses this year.
 
 Urban expert Ashwin Mahesh said: “...There should be at least 120 buses for 1 lakh people, which means Bengaluru needs at least 14,000 buses.”
 
 BMTC officials said the delay is due to National Green Tribunal’s stayon purchasing new diesel buses. “NGT has given permission for 1,650 diesel buses, we’ll procure more once we get NGT’s nod,” said a senior BMTC official.
 
 BMTC earns an average of Rs 8 crore every month from chartered services. In addition to that, BMTC gives buses on casual contract. “Chartered services ply on regular routes after completing their designated trips,” another official said.
 
 However, many passengers complain that chartered services ply during peak hours and they get these buses only when the demand is low. There are also complaints that BMTC uses good buses for chartered services.
