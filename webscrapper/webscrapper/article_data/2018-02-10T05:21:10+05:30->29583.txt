NEW DELHI: BJP president   on Friday asked party MPs to counter   allegations on the Rafale deal with facts and tell people how the Opposition, including Congress chief  , was doing politics on an issue concerning the country's defence. 

 Addressing the BJP parliamentary party meeting, Shah said although Congress leaders knew about the secrecy clause, which was signed by their own leaders in 2008, they were making it a political issue, which was tantamount to compromising with national security. 
 
 S ources said Shah was referring to the agreement between India and France concerning the protection of classified information and material in the field of defence. Signed for 10 years, the treaty, which was supposed to expire on January 25 this year, covers the period when Delhi signed the Rafale deal. 
 
 "Disclosing details in   will harm national interest and the   dispensation too had followed a similar practice. Moreover, sharing all details of the deal such as expenditure incurred on weaponry and technological know-how will only alert India's enemies and harm the country's interests," Shah told MPs. He said the UPA government too did not share details of defence deals finalised by it for similar reasons. 
 
 R esponding to Rahul's tweet that UPA disclosed details of defence deals, Anil Baluni, convenor of BJP media cell, said all deals are different, and not all covered under non-disclosure agreements. BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao said Rahul was adopting Hitler's "big lie" technique of repeating the same lie hoping that it would be perceived as truth. TNN
