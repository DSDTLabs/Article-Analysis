PATNA: Hundreds of   ( )-Patna and   (CNLU)-Patna students blocked the road at Mithapur in the city for several hours in protest against the death of NIFTian Preeti Bharti in a road accident on Thursday.

 The 21-year-old was riding a scooty to her institute when she was crushed by a truck at   on the new bypass road under the   police station area. She was rushed to a private hospital where she was declared brought dead. 
 
 A resident of   under the Beur police station area, she was a third-year student of Textile Design department.
 
 The agitators were demanding ban on the plying of heavy vehicles on the city roads during college and school hours and arrest of the vehicle owner. They were also demanding deputation of police at the roads near educational institutes to ensure safety of students, including women.
 
 The students raised slogans like ‘We have right to stay safe’, ‘Make Patna safer for us’ and ‘Safety rules are your best tools’ and held the district administration responsible for the death of Preeti. NIFT’s faculty members and non-teaching employees also joined the protests.
 
 Preeti’s classmate   told this newspaper the administration must take strict action against the culprits of such negligence and ensure traffic discipline on the city roads. “We students are facing so many odds, including lack of proper light in the areas where educational institutes are located, eve-teasing and haphazard parking of vehicles outside the campuses of educational institutes,” Sneh said.
 
 She regretted their repeated complaints against eve-teasers to the Jakkanpur police station fell on deaf ears. “We are angry with the administration,” she fumed.
 
 The students withdrew their stir around 2pm only after additional SP Sushant Saroj and Jakkanpur police station SHO Abrar Ahmad Khan reached the spot and assured them that stern action would be taken against the people involved in rash driving. 
 
 A prayer service was also conducted at NIFT for Preeti.
