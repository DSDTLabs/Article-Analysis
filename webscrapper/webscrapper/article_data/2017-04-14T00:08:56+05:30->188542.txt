THANE: The   (TMC) is mulling a financial formula for reservation plots leased out to various   in the city by proposing to connect the annual   amount with prevalent market rates and making it more viable for the   Municipal Corporation (TMC). 

 The idea is to bring in more revenue for the TMC every year in the present fiscal and at the same time ensure indiscriminate allotment of plots.
 
 The general body in 2008 had approved a plan to lease reservation plots to educational institutes to develop schools on them, which was revised over the next seven years. The idea was to bring in professionals who could develop institutions which would also help benefit the needy. However, with an aim to attract institutes, the general body had decided to reduce the lease   to less than half of the market rates prevalent at that time.
 
 Eleven institutions have been given land parcels in the city for developing educational institutes of which seven are local bodiesâ€™ while four are from other areas.
 
 The annual lease value for local educational institutes was fixed as low as 20 per cent while for others, the reduction in lease was granted up to 50 per cent. Though the plan was sent to the state government, it didn't approve the same as the move seemed unviable. Accordingly, the civic body decided to formulate a policy and to make the same viable financially for itself, has suggested linking the lease to the market value of the plot and charge as per the prevalent prime lending rates.
 
 "We are now proposing to bring the lease amount at par with the market rates. The institutes were already informed that an approval from the state was awaited and the rentals could fluctuate anytime. The lease would increase as per the market value every year," said a civic official.
 
 A proposal has now been put up before the general body meeting scheduled next week for approval of leasing such plots in the future.
