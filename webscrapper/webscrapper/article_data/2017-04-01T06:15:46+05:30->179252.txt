CHENNAI:   (TACTV) has requested broadcasters and multi-system operators (MSOs) not to disconnect any signals of TACTV , “under the guise of implementation of DAS (Digital Addressable System)“, failing which “may lead to initiation of contempt proceedings“ against operators.

 In a letter to broadcasters on Friday , TACTV managing director J Kumaragurubaran referred to a circular from the ministry of information and broadcasting dated March 30, 2017, to all broadcasters and MSOs “about switching off of analogue cable TV signals to all the networks of MSOs falling in the DAS phase -IV urban areas with effect from April 1, 2017“.
 
 According to the terms of the Letters of Acceptance to broadcasters, he said, the contract is for telecast of their channels “in both analogue and digi tal mode“ in  . Recalling that TACTV had applied for a DAS licence to the I&B ministry in 2012, he wrote the issue “is still pending and is yet to be processed“. He referred to TACTV's two writ petitions pending in the Madras HC, adding the “issue of digitalization is subjudice and not yet implemented“ in TN. He also recalled the   “restrained   (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) from disconnecting TACTV Corporation's subscriber signals and the said order is still in force“.
 
 He referred to a TACTV writ petition (40365) of 2015 for provisional registration, and a court order dated December 21, 2015, granting “status quo in favour of TACTV restraining the I&B ministry or any one acting under the Ministry from disrupting, disconnecting the signals of TACTV in the guide of implementation of DAS“.
 
 The order, he wrote, “is still in force and valid.“
