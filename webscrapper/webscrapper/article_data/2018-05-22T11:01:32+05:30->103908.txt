MYSURU: The   at   here will get a new lease of life as the Confederation of Indian Industries,   and the district administration have taken up its rejuvenation under the Mysuru Water Positive by 2021 Project. 

 At the groundbreaking ceremony on Monday, SBI came forward to rejuvenate the lake, spread over 1acre, as part of its   initiative. Ramakrishne Gowda, joint director of DIC who performed the ceremony said, "The support and cooperation of the residents' associations and locals will go a long way to restore and maintain the lake."
 
 Both   and government can initiate rejuvenation projects, but the onus lies on people to look after them, he added. The project will bring together industries in Mysuru to drive rejuvenation and conservation of lakes in and around Mysuru.
 
  Arjun Ranga, chairman,  , said, "The combined efforts of CII and the government will ensure that Mysuru will become the first water positive city in the country. The city has over 25 lakes, and we have identified 15 lakes that need immediate attention." 
 
  A healthier ecosystem to save lakes through rejuvenation, restoration, conservation, and maintenance needs to be created to ensure lakes in the city are preserved, he added. He added: "A few companies have shown interest in the project. CII is focused on obtaining support from other companies too." 
 
  The identification, survey of lakes and coordination with industry and implementing agency is being coordinated by Ramakrishne Gowda and CII Mysuru. 
 
 In the project, lakes will be desilted and fences erected around the boundary to stop encroachment.
