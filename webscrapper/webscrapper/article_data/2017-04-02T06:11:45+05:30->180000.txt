AURANGABAD: The death of Sharad Yaykos, a youth from Paithan taluka of Aurangabad district, due to alleged medical negligence at   ( ) here during wee hours on Saturday, triggered angry reactions and demands that the doctors concerned be booked for murder.

 The 21-year-old had met with a road accident near his village Pimpalwadi on Friday afternoon and was rushed to GMCH by his family. Narayan Kankate, member of medical advisory committee of GMCH, said Sharad did not receive proper medical attention, which led to his death.
 
 “As blood was oozing from his nose and ear after the accident, the family members requested GMCH authorities to hospitalise him without any wasting time. The doctors on duty performed an X-ray and an ultrasound and simply asked them to return the next day for CT scan,” he said. 
 
 Sharad and his family members stayed in the hospital premises in the hope of getting CT scan done next day, but the youth’s condition started deteriorating. “His family members again sought help from GMCH doctors. However, he died before he could get proper treatment. He was in fact left to die,” Kankate said.
 
 Aurangabad MP   pulled up the hospital management and said the doctors responsible for Sharad’s death must be booked for murder. “This incident implies that assaults on doctors have other side too. I have asked for immediate inquiry into the whole incident and termination of services of the on-duty doctors if found guilty,” he said.
 
 Khaire also instructed GMCH authorities not to ask outstation patients in critical conditions to leave hospital premises after evening. GMCH dean Chandrakant Mhaske could not be reached as he was out of town. Medical superintendent   did not respond to calls and SMS sent to him. Meanwhile, no offence has been registered in connection with the death. Relatives of the patients staged brief protest against GMCH doctors before taking the body home.
