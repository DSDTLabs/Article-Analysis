Pune: A student’s desperate attempt to fudge his final examination marks unexpectedly helped him land two cheats in the anti-corruption bureau net. 

 The ACB on Wednesday arrested the men for attempting to cheat the student of Rs20,000. The money was intended as a bribe to a lecturer from the Savitribai Phule Pune University. 
 
 The student is a second-year civil engineering student of a city-based college. He had failed in two subjects in his final examinations. Desperate to pass, the student got in touch with Vitthal Ramesh Salunkhe. “An acquaintance helped him get in touch with Salunkhe (26),” said an ACB officer. 
 
 Salunkhe told the student he had contacts in SPPU and can help him change the “fail” to a “pass” with lecturer’s help. “Salunkhe said the lecturer charges Rs20,000 to increase the marks,” the officer said.
 
 Salunkhe wanted Rs10,000 per subject as an advance from the student. Before handing over the money, the student wanted to meet the lecturer. “Instead, Salunkhe called the ‘lecturer’ and told the student to speak to him,” the officer said.
 
 The officer said the ‘lecturer’ assured the student that he would increase his marks. 
 
 “The student got suspicious and contacted the ACB,” the officer said. On Wednesday, Salunkhe told the student to bring the money to his Kondhwa home. “An ACB team led by deputy superintendent Sunil Yadav caught Salunkhe red-handed,” the officer said.
 
 The police also tracked down the man who claimed to be the lecturer. “Our probe revealed that the ‘lecturer’ in the SPPU was Salunkhe’s accomplice Avinash Kamble. He had posed as the lecturer,” the officer said. “We are trying to ascertain whether anyone from SPPU is connected to the duo,” the officer further said.
 
 SPPU authorities said they were unaware of the incident. “Once anybody approaches us officially, we will appoint an investigative committee and will take action against the student,” Arvind Shaligram, SPPU registrar, told TOI.
