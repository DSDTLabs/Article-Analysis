CHANDIGARH: The cash-strapped   (PU), which approved its budget of Rs 515 crore for the 2017-18 financial year with a 12% increase in its deficit on Monday, has been shown the door by the department of higher education,  . 

 The varsity had applied for Rs 20 crore grants for infrastructure upgradation under Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA). Sources said that it was decided in a   (PAB) meeting of RUSA held in Delhi on February 6 that the grants of Rs 20 crore that the PU had demanded for infrastructure upgradation won’t be given to PU. 
 
 Sources said that the PU vice-chancellor Prof Arun Kumar Grover had written to MHRD on January 7 to approve the grants of Rs 20 crore for infrastructure upgradation. The officials had some reservations for Panjab University that the grants are meant for only state or central universities. The status of the PU that it is neither central nor state created the confusion, said sources in the meeting. 
 
 Sources said that the varsity had also applied for Rs 176 crore of grants for research and innovation, which was also not approved by RUSA. Moreover, the varsity has not received an additional grant of Rs 30.5 crores that the Punjab and Haryana high court on January 19 had asked the   to release expeditiously, not later than four weeks. The status of the grants was enquired in the BoF meeting held here on Monday, but the MHRD and UGC officials did not know about it. 
 
 The Punjab government has also refused to enhance its grants for the university. The government, however, provides financial support for the constituent colleges in Punjab but the varsity wants the government to facilitate financial aid for its regional centres in Punjab. 
 
 The deficit of PU for the 2017-18 financial year has increased by 12% in comparison to the last year’s deficit. The deficit amount in the 2017-18 financial year comes around to be Rs 244 crore and the deficit in the financial year 2016-17 was Rs 217 crore.
