HYDERABAD: On May 4, Air   (AIU) officials followed a woman passenger who arrived from Dubai in   flight (EK 524) and after she crossed the 'green channel', they intercepted her. In the checked-in baggage,   sleuths saw toys packed in corrugated boxes and upon close inspection found 1.09 kilo gold foils worth over 30 lakh deftly concealed in the walls of the boxes. 

 Based on the information provided by the passenger, AIU team coordinated with the   (SOT)) of Cyberabad commissionerate and arrested six persons including four men from Kerala and two men from Hyderabad who were waiting outside the airport to pick up the yellow metal.
 
  The kingpin sitting in Dubai has called the victim there by promising to offer a job and later sent her to India with gold concealed in a corrugated box, instructing her to handover the same to an old man waiting at the RGI Airport.
