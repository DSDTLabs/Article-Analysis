Ahmedabad: The state government has appointed 10 members to the Gujarat Wakf Board, with eight being repeated from the earlier board â€” including Rajya Sabha member Ahmed Patel, MLA Javed Pirzada, and Bar Council of Gujarat member Afzalkhan Pathan. According to the changed structure of the board, two women have also found a place. 

 The state government placed a copy of the notification before the Gujarat high court on Monday during the hearing of a PIL demanding the reconstitution of the board. The petitioner, Wakf Bachao Abhiyan, has raised question over the new appointments on several grounds including complaints of misuse of powers in granting approval for the disposal of 26 properties and for not holding elections for caretakers of wakf properties. The government on Tuesday sought time in the high court to file an affidavit in reply to the challenge to the re-selection of old members. tnn
