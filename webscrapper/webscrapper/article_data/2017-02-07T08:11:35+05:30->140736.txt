BHOPAL: State government on Monday extended the tenure of Justice SK Pandey commission, which is probing into the jailbreak by   men and their subsequent hilltop encounter in Bhopal, by another six months.

 Constituted by the state government on November 7, 2016, the commission was to submit its probe report in three months. However, as the three months’ time was ending on Monday, the state government extended its tenure in light of the elaborate nature of the commission’s work.
 
 Meanwhile, the commission that started working on December 5, 2016, has completed significant part of its investigations. It has also directed the concerned parties to appear for hearing on March 1. “Commission, in its order dated Feburary 4, has summoned all the witnesses, concerned officials and family members of the deceased SIMI men for hearing on March 1,” said a police official associated with the investigations.
 
 Representing the kin of two alleged SIMI operatives --- Aqeel and Majid who were killed in the encounter, advocate Parvez Alam said, “We have made our submissions before the commission and now it has summoned us for hearing on March 1.” Sources said there are several unanswered questions that the commission is probing like the source of weapons recovered from the possession of the alleged SIMI men who were killed in the encounter.
 
 The government had announced the judicial commission headed by Justice (retd) SK Pandey five days after eight alleged SIMI activists were killed in an encounter following their escape from Bhopal Central Jail on the night of October 30 last year. The government issued the notification two days later, on November 7.
