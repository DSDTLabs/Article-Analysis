PANAJI:   (TTAG), the apex body representing hotel and travel trade in Goa, held an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss the probable impact on the   if   of road transport and highways’ proposal to upgrade 229 km of major district roads and state highways into national highways is effected.

 Post meeting, president TTAG   told TOI that it was decided to constitute a three-member committee to study the orientation of the proposed national highways before taking a final call.
 
 “We will decide what exactly is to be done after the committee readies its report,” the TTAG president explained.
 
 TTAG members, Messias said, are apprehensive about the proposed move of the government. As of now there is no clarity about the proposed location of the roads that would be converted into highways.
 
 Messias said TTAG will certainly oppose if the proposed national highways affect the hotel industry. The TTAG, he said, also wants to have wider consultation with hotels in South Goa. Another round of meeting will be held soon.
 
 He said they would also request the government give TTAG representation in the committee proposed to be formed by the government to study the issue. 
 
 “We would seek representation in the committee,” Messias said. 
 
 Majority of the hotels are located in   with a larger concentration in the tourist hot spots of Calangute, Candolim and Baga.
 
 A TTAG member, who did not wish to be named, said most members are quite apprehensive and will not take things lying down if the hotel industry has to suffer due to the proposed upgradation of roads into national highways.
 
 “The government ought to have discussed it with stake holders before approaching the centre with the proposal,” he said.
