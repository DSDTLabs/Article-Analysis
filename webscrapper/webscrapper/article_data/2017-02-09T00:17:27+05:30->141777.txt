Pune: The Republican Party of India (A) workers were jolted on Wednesday after leaders announced the suspension of 10 candidates from the party for fighting the forthcoming civic polls on Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) tickets. The party also suspended three candidates contesting similarly in Pimpri Chinchwad and four in Solapur.

 RPI’s general secretary Raja Sarawade said the candidates have been suspended with immediate effect after instructions from party chief Ramdas Athavale.
 
 Of the 162 seats in Pune, BJP had offered 10 to RPI (A) against the party’s demand for 20 seats. While finalizing the list, BJP offered RPI candidates the ticket to contest on its symbol instead of the RPI’s.
 
 Sarawade said the decision was not abrupt. A meeting was convened in Lonavla in January 2017 under Athavale. It was resolved to have an alliance with BJP but RPI candidates would use their party’s symbol. “Some candidates in Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad and Solapur have flouted the resolution which has led to their suspension,” he said, adding the party’s Pune unit managing committee was also dissolved. Unit chief Mahendra Kamble said he had not received any official communication. tnn
