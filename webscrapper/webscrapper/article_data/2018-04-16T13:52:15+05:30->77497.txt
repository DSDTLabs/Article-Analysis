HYDERABAD : In an alarming trend, city doctors say that an increasing number of professionals are now turning up with symptoms of neck pain and spinal problems, caused because of spending hours on their smartphones — texting and checking for updates — every day.

 
 Poor posture, over time, causes disc herniations, pinched nerves, metabolic problems and  , say neurosurgeons.
 
 “When the head and shoulders drift forward due to poor posture, some muscles in the chest and neck can shorten and become tight over time, which can perpetuate the poor posture that is causing neck pain. Neck pain among those who use the phone for long hours has been increasing over the past few years. If not detected in time, spine surgery becomes the inevitable last option,” warned Dr Manas Panigrahi, senior consultant neurosurgeon at KIMS, Secunderabad.
 
  
  
 As per a recent survey conducted among more than 200 patients in the 20 to 40-year age group, there is   of neck pain among phone users. According to the survey, 56.25% patients reported mild pains while at work while 62.5% reported mild pains while driving. About 50% of patients surveyed also   while sleeping.
 
 “The sedentary lifestyle of the working generation is to be blamed for the alarming increase in spine problems that we see. Sitting in front of computers for long hours with bad posture has serious consequences,” said Dr Savitr Sastri, consultant neuro and spine surgeon at a city hospital.
 
 Some doctors said how many of their patients these days, walking in with complaints of neck pain, are children. Highlighting the case of a six-year-old child from the city, who was recently diagnosed with this problem, doctors said it was the result of spending long hours playing games on a tablet.
