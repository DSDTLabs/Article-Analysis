RAJKOT: Some miscreants damaged the statue of goddess of justice installed outside the compound of a court in   town of Rajkot. Advocates practising in the court held protest over the issue and demanded immediate arrested of those responsible.

 The Gondal municipality had erected the statue on the crossroads outside the court campus two years ago. According to police, some miscreants had broken the left hand of the statue on Tuesday night. 
 
 Protesting over the issue, advocates on Wednesday chanted slogans and demanded the municipality to replace the statue with a new one.
 
 Gondal   president   said, “The security persons are deputed outside the court compound round-the-clock. Despite that, somebody damaged the statue and insulted the goddess of justice. We want that police immediately arrest the miscreants and prosecute them.” tnn
