New Delhi: Going by the numbers released by Delhi Police, crime seems to have declined in the first four months this year as compared to 2016. While murders and rapes — which are the prime indicators of the crime situation in the city — have dipped, even snatchings and   have gone south as well.

 Moreover, this is the first time in the last few years that vehicle thefts have gone down, though marginally. From 12,784 thefts reported between January and April in 2016, the figure stands at 12,666 in the corresponding period this year.
 
 While 164 murders were reported early last year, this year the number is 158 till April 30. This is a pleasant change as compared to the sudden spike in murders in the first two months of 2017. This year, 647 rapes and 1,110 molestation cases have been lodged as compared to 685 rapes and 1,443 molestations reported till April 30 last year.
 
 Snatching, the prime indicator of street crime, has also seen a fall from 3,378 in 2016 to 2,923 in 2017 in the first four months. The total number of heinous crimes has dipped from 3,071 to 2,131. Even the roads seem safer as 433 fatal incidents have been reported this year as compared to 528 cases reported till April 30, 2016.
 
 Robberies have seen a dramatic fall from 1,959 to 1,081 and dacoities have fallen from 17 to 14. Kidnapping for ransom has dipped from 9 to 6 in the first four months.
 
 Officers attribute the dip in crime to several factors, including enhanced patrolling and a more visible police force on the streets.
 
 Another major contributing factor, officers said, is police commissioner Amulya Patnaik’s engagement with all ranks of the force. Be it special commissioners or beat constables, the top cop has ensured that he reaches out to everyone. Patnaik also showed a rare gesture by meeting beat cops, the backbone of the force, in south Delhi two weeks ago. Apart from lauding the efforts of officers, Patnaik has fixed accountability for lapses as well. With zero tolerance on corruption, the police chief has ensured that all supervisory officers are held responsible for their respective jurisdictions.
 
 Special commissioners (law and order) and joint commissioners of all ranges have been asked to engage in on-the-ground policing. This precedent has clearly reflected in the crime figures.
 
 Patnaik now wants to make public transport safer for women after dark. He said that monitoring systems would be set up to keep a check on drivers of public service vehicles. It would the force’s priority to ensure safety of women who usually travel alone.
