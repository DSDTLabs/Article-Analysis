CHENNAI: Frequent power outages may plague city residents for some more time as most   are unable to take the   owing to the   that peaked at 3200MW on the night of May 19. 

 With the use of airconditioners increasing in almost all areas, the burden on the transmission lines is increasing, especially in the evenings. "In many suburban areas as well as in some areas in North Chennai, the transmission lines are on towers. These lines will trip if the load increases beyond a level. Only if all these lines are converted into underground cables will we be able to solve the problems of short term outages," said a senior Tangedco official. 
 
 Residents of areas like Chintadripet and Velachery have been already begun complaining of regular outages, either in the afternoon or at night. "There is no shortage of power. It is only due to overload that these lines sag causing outage. 
 
  Last week, the Manali-Mylapore line tripped due to heavy load and this led to blackouts in many areas," he said. Residents have been protesting in many neighbourhoods.
