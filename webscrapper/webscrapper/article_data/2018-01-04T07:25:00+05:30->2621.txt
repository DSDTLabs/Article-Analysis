Bathinda: After ensuring that no political conference was organized at the Shaheedi Jor Mela at Fatehgarh Sahib in the last week of December 2017, Sri Guru Granth Sahib Satkar Committee has now announced to not allow any political party to hold conferences at Muktsar on January 14, the occasion of Maghi.

 Committee activists on Wednesday held a protest at Muktsar and asked the parties not to organise Maghi conferences. The committee members also handed over memorandum to the administrative officials, urging them to not allot land for conferences.
 
 The ruling Congress, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) have announced not to hold conferences on Maghi.
 
 Meanwhile, Akal Takht jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh has also directed parties against holding political conferences on religious occasions.
 
 Satkar committee activist Sukhjit Singh Khosa said a meeting was organized on Wednesday at Muktsar where it was decided that no political conference should be allowed on Maghi as it disturbs the sanctity of the occasion.
 
 “As people who come to pay obeisance are made to listen to political speeches where only allegations and counter allegations are made at one another, we want all this to end,” he said.
