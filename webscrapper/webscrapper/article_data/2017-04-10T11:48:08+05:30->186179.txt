NAGPUR: Even though the   under Right to Education ( ) quota have started,  . This comes as a shock because the initial response by parents was overwhelming with available seats getting oversubscribed by 300%. 

 Till Saturday, only 4,108 admissions were completed out of the 7,099 seats available. Out of the total completed admissions, only 97 were done in the second round. 
 
 Officials say this mismatch in the initial response and final admission figures is because of parents pinning their hopes only on a particular school. “In any given area there is one popular school where everybody wants to secure a seat. The number of applications rise drastically but it’s obvious that majority of them are vying for a particular school. Those who don’t make the cut in the lottery decide to go to another school,” said the official. 
 
 There are speculations that some may even be applying to the school under for non-RTE seats. A school trustee said, “We had a parent whose daughter was studying in our primary section paying the regular fee. Later the parent enquired about admission for the younger sibling under RTE saying he was eligible to apply.”
 
 Another school principal said, “Parents look at the school while applying not the fact that they can get free education. The latter is just a bonus. The 25% quota has simply given parents another shot to secure admission in a popular school. We have raised questions over the validity of documents being submitted like income certificate and address proof. Many parents refuse to submit a registered rental agreement citing various reasons. But if someone has nothing to hide then I don’t see any reason for refusing to comply with a valid request.” 
 
 The education department has now changed the criteria for address proof by declaring that even government issued ID with the current address will now be acceptable.
