VIJAYAWADA: A year after city police introduced the unique initiative   Mitra, they decided to take it to the next level. City police collaborated with International Foundation for Crime Prevention and Victim Care with the support of American consulate to train   volunteers to address women’s issues. As many as 42 persons under north and central zones, covering six police stations, were trained as part of the Community Led Action Plan on Policing (CLAPP) program.

 The program is intended to identify a wide range of problems that beset the daily lives of  , including systemic prejudices, gender discrimination and issues of sexual harassment.
 
 A four-day workshop was conducted to train the  , members, coordinators of Mahila Mitra and police officials. The scanning, analysing, response and assessment (SARA) method was adopted to train volunteers. 
 
 Coordinator of CLAPP program, Anupama said that they have identified a few places in the city where, strangely, only men used to go. Although, there was no rule in place that prevented women from visiting those places, however over the years a myth was created disallowing women. She further said that in the next three months they would aim to dispel such myths and make at least two such places accessible to women.
 
 Speaking at a program organised on the ocassion of the initiative’s first anniversary, city police commissioner D   observed that Mahila Mitra has born good results in identifying and resolving women’s issues. He said that the CLAPP program will further equip Mahila Mitra members and police personal in understanding and addressing women’s problems.
 
  from Vasavya Mahila Mandali, who has been associated with city police in conducting counselling sessions for the victims as well as perpetrators of various offences, said that Mahila Mitra and Mahila Rakshak initiatives have transformed the way women think about their problems.
