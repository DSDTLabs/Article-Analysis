GHAZIABAD: The   has approved the constitution of a panel to decide on reducing   on pending instalments of residential plot allottees. The proposal was approved during a   on Monday, which was chaired by commissioner (Meerut range) Prabhat Kumar.

 “The panel has been asked to submit its recommendations within a month. We are considering reducing interest rates on the dues of residential plot owners commensurate with market rates. The reduced interest rates will be applicable for residential plots and buildings developed by the GDA,” Kumar said.
 
 The board also approved a proposal to conduct a fire safety audit of highrises and other important buildings. The audit has been ordered to gauge the fire safety measures in place in various buildings. Apart from highrises, audits will be conducted on schools, hospitals, market complexes and other multi-storey buildings.
 
 “The audit will be conducted by the district magistrate with the help of a team of officials. Most buildings might possess NOCs from the fire department. But the audit will be conducted to ensure the presence of firefighting equipment and preparedness to deal with a blaze. The decision to conduct a fire safety audit was taken in view of the massive fire reported from a 24-storey building in London in June,” Kumar told TOI.
 
 The board also approved a proposal to prepare a detailed zonal plan for transit-oriented development (TOD) along the under-construction Metro corridor from   to New Bus Stand. The GDA had earlier earmarked 500 metres on each side of the corridor for TOD. The plan will deal with all aspects of the TOD, including parking facilities, plot sizes, building heights and mixed land use. The TOD along the Metro line has been earmarked to ensure maximum density of population along these corridors.
