 has done it again. The much-awaited ‘Kaala’ teaser is everything we’ve been waiting for. Apart from Rajinikanth’s majestic screen presence, the major highlight of the teaser is Santhosh Narayanan’s background score. Going by the clip, the film revolves around ‘Kaala’, a gangster in Mumbai, and his family members. 

 It starts with   asking what kind of name is ‘Kaala’. Given the track record of Ranjith, ‘Kaala’ is likely to talk about the story of the oppressed with   leading the masses. The scene where Rajinikanth says “Kye Re...setting ah” has gone viral among fans.
 
 The teaser, which was supposed to be out today, was released by   at 12 am. Apparently, the teaser of ‘Kaala’ was leaked on the internet thereby forcing the makers to advance the release.
 
 Taking to Twitter, Dhanush wrote, “Here you go...Kaala teaser...Thalaivar teaser eppo release aanaalum eppidi release aanaalum diwali dhaan. Mass dhaan.”
