AHMEDABAD: A policeman accused in the bitcoin   case submitted before a local court on Wednesday that he had tried to surrender to   (crime) but the agency did not   him. 

 
 The cop, Noor Mohammed, who was serving as constable in Amreli police, submitted in his anticipatory bail plea that he had joined a few other cops in the attempt to surrender. He said that he was not involved in the conspiracy and the agency has falsely implicated him in the case.

Amreli SP Jagdish Patel was also booked in the case later. The cops had allegedly extorted Bitcoins from Bhatt.
 
 Mohammed contended that he had followed orders from his superiors and was not aware of the conspiracy. The court is likely to pronounce the verdict in the case on May 18. 
 
 Bhattâ€™s partner  , who was allegedly involved with the cops from Amreli in hatching the conspiracy to abduct Shailesh Bhatt, was produced before the court on Wednesday and then sent to judicial custody.
