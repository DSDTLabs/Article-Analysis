PUNE: The   ( ) is moving its   collection   from the next cycle to increase compliance and reduce queues.

 Most big civic bodies, and even some smaller ones, have shifted to the online platform for tax payments.
 
 Every year, long lines at the revenue department of PCB force many to miss their payments on time and lead to penalties. PCB staffers have also complained of overwork and frequent confrontations with taxpayers during these phases. As a part of this move, the PCB has finalised talks with banks regarding payment gateways. It has also zeroed in on a contractor to design a website, which will host the gateways.
 
 “Taxpayers can now use net banking or credit and debit cards to pay their property taxes. The website will also generate a challan as a payment receipt. People who want to pay by cash can go to the branches of partner banks,” a senior PCB official said.
