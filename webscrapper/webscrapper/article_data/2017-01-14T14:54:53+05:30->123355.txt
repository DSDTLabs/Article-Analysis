Pop star   has reportedly   his   performance after he failed to receive a   at the annual ceremony. 

  
  
 The 32-year-old singer-songwriter, who was also scheduled to appear at its launch, said to have high hopes of receiving some recognition for his most-recent studio album '24 Hrs', but scrapped his appearance for the same upon hearing he had been overlooked by Brit Award judges.
 
 "Olly is gutted. One of his main ambitions is to win a Brit and he really thought he had done enough to be nominated. As soon as Olly and his team found out he had no nominations they made the decision to pull out," a source said. 
 
 Murs has been nominated for Brit Awards on six previous occasions and recently said he was excited by the prospect of appearing at its launch. "I'm performing at the Brit Awards launch in January. I'm hoping to be nominated and pick an award up. I'd really like one." "The fact that I'm performing at the launch means I'm doing something right."
