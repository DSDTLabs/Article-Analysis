  The group members, who met at a discussion in Gurgaon recently, pointed out that Delhi doesn't have a community culture. To promote more community participation, Nakul Butta, the founder of the group, organised a 'spot-fixing' campaign under   flyover. He said, "We do 'spot-fixing' at several locations, but in two-three months, people again paste posters and deface the walls, so we need to go back to the same location.We have collaborated with Delhi Street Art for the makeover of the Moolchand flyover. Students from the Indian School have also been working with us."
