HYDERABAD: Technical glitches turned into a major headache for candidates trying to seek admissions into undergraduate courses through Degree Online Services, Telangana ( ). They were forced to fill the form multiple times before it was finally submitted successfully. 

 
 Candidates complained that the moment they pressed the save button, they were losing all the data they had filled and had to start the process again. "I tried thrice to fill the application, but each time the data was lost and I had to start the process again. I somehow managed to submit the application," said Sruthi K, a student.
 
 Few candidates were unable to complete the process as their mobile number was not linked to   card. "I realised that I need to link my daughter's Aadhaar card with her mobile number to submit the application. So, I had to visit an Aadhaar centre and get the process done," said   M, a parent.
 
 Meanwhile, DOST officials said they are trying to address all the complaints and have established 74 helplines across the state and three super helplines at   in the city. "We are trying to correct mistakes made by the candidates at the back end itself. To identify mistakes, we have colour codes. While all the major errors will be shown in red, minor errors like spelling mistakes will be shown in orange. These errors are corrected at our helpline centres and students are sent out a message saying that their process is completed and they can approach the respective college and pay the fee," said Limbadri R, DOST convenor, adding that they have received about three thousand complaints till now.
 
 He said that students are asked to visit helplines only if they have to submit some documents. "We have received about 60, 000 applications till now and are hopeful to receive about 2 lakh applications by May 29," said Limbadri R.
