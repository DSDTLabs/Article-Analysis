HYDERABAD: After last week’s rape of a patient at   ( ), authorities have now decided to put in place gates at secluded places and lock at least 10-15 departments post their operational hours.

 “As and when a department closes, we will lock it up. The neurology department, for instance, shuts by 1pm, so after that, it will be locked. Also, additional gates will be put up to restrict access to these areas and security personnel will be given orders accordingly. They will be instructed to hand over the keys to the resident medical officer (RMO),” OGH superintendent Dr B Nagender told TOI. With staff and other workers at the hospital familiar with isolated pockets, management hopes that the move would prevent such incidents.
 
 The latest decision is significant because at least three-five domestic violence victims turn up at OGH every day for treatment. In most cases, sources say, the women come to the hospital alone, making them vulnerable to sexual assaults.
 
  president Mujtaba Hasan Askari said, “Although enhancing security and CCTV cameras are important; the hospital must have counselling facilities both for the patient as well as family members.”
 
 Also, while restricting access to ‘blind spots’ like the OP block where the incident occurred is pertinent, doctors say that a dormitory-like set up for housing such patients must be created to ensure safety.
