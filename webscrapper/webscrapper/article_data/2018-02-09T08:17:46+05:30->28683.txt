JAIPUR: The   (SMS) Hospital has referred the case of a resident doctor of  , who alleged that the oxygen supply was faulty at some points in the emergency ward, for disciplinary action.

 However, the   (JARD) said that the issue has been blown out of proportion and any action against the resident doctor would trigger protest.
 
 The incident happened two days ago after a person, who was brought to the hospital with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), died while undergoing treatment at the hospital’s emergency unit.
 
 Resident doctor Mukesh Mahla said that he had brought the shortcomings in the emergency ward to the notice of authorities for the benefit of patients. It’s because of such issues, doctors had to face the ire of the relatives of patients.
 
 In a letter to the principal of SMS Medical College, he called for immediately addressing such issues.
 
 However, the hospital administration claimed that they did not found any glaring issues in the emergency ward which could cause the death of patients. “There are 13 points for oxygen supply for patients. If one is not working, it does not mean that the oxygen supply has been affected completely. There are always oxygen cylinders present in the emergency unit as a backup. After the incident was reported, we have inspected the emergency unit several times but we did not find any major fault,” said Dr S S Yadav, spokesperson, SMS Hospital.
 
 He said that the case of the resident doctor has been referred to the administration of SMS Medical College.
 
 But JARD office-bearers pointed out that if any action was taken against the resident doctor, it would break the confidence of other doctors working tirelessly for patients. “There is a need to find an amicable solution for the issue. Action against the resident doctor will not be a solution,” said Dr Ravi Jakhar, president, JARD.
