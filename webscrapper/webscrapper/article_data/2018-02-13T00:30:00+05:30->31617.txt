Bengaluru: A four-storey building in  , north Bengaluru, developed cracks and tilted on Sunday, triggering panic in the neighbourhood. 

 Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials said the building started cracking due to work being carried out on the nearby stormwater drain. 
 
 Residents claimed the house tilted partially after earth-digging equipment was used to pull out some stone slabs from the adjoining tertiary drain. BBMP officials, however, denied the allegation. “We were carrying out remodelling work on the 40-year-old stormwater drain (SWD) adjacent to the building. We were removing slabs to desilt it when the building started to crack. By using the adjacent building, we have given lateral support to the cracked structure. It is possible the foundation of the building was not strong and it was leaning on the slabs,” said Rangaraju, assistant engineer (SWD), west zone.
 
 He said the building owner was staying on the second floor, while the ground and first floors were occupied by tenants. “The owner has already shifted to the adjacent building, while the tenants vacated the structure by 3pm on Monday,” he added.
 
 Corporator Jayaprakash M C said the building had a setback violation. “It is 30 years old and was built right up to the edge of the plot, without leaving the required gap between the drain and the structure. Since it is tilting so precariously, a portion of it will be demolished. We will first build a support structure for the ground and first floors within a week’s time and then raze the second and third floors,” he said. 
 
 On Saturday, a five-storey under-construction building at Marenahalli, Jayanagar V Block was demolished after it developed cracks and tilted to one side.
