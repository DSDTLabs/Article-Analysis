PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Chandrakant  , who was praised by Prime Minister   in Mann Ki Baat for   in June last year, is now fighting for the abolition of   and regularisation of unauthorised constructions.

 Kulkarni, a retired school teacher and Vishwa Hindu Parishad member, has started a token protest for 10 days outside the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC). He said, “People have constructed unauthorised houses because they don’t get building permissions. The government is at fault here.”
 
 Over a month ago, Kulkarni had sent a letter to chief minister   urging the total abolition of penalty tax on illegal constructions and their regularisation.
 
 “I have not submitted a memorandum to the municipal corporation as yet. I am only highlighting the issue which has been pending for many years now. Political parties are sidelining the matter,” he said. During his protest, he will be meeting people affected by unauthorised constructions.
 
 “People have the right to build houses. People with low income cannot buy expensive flats or get loans easily to build houses. Also, permissions are not granted for these houses. The government should regularise these constructions on humanitarian ground,” he said.
 
 Kulkarni would plan the future course of action once the protest ends on May 12. Responding to high court’s order to raze illegal buildings, he said that the civic body should demolish them.
 
 PM Modi had met Kulkarni during his June 25, 2016 visit to inaugurate Smart City projects in Pune.
