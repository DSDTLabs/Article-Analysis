PANAJI: The   (IMD) has requested fishermen not to venture out to sea in the next 48 hours. A low pressure area over the southwest   and its neighbourhood is likely to concentrate into a depression. 

 Light rain is likely to continue in isolated places due to localized heating and incursion of moisture.
 
 “But this is just precautionary, as the low pressure area will move west-northwest towards the Gulf of Aden,” M L Sahu, director, IMD,  , said.
 
 On Monday, the department recorded a maximum temperature of 34.6C, just 0.7 degrees above normal. The minimum temperature was 26.1C, 0.6 degrees below normal.
