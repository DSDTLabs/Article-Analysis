NEW DELHI: Falling for the second day,   lost its sheen by plunging another Rs 400 to trade at two-week low of Rs 29,150 per 10 grams on Friday, tracking a weak trend overseas.

 Moreover, reduced offtake by jewellers owing to slackened demand at the domestic spot market at prevailing level too hit sentiment.

 Traders said sentiment was downbeat, largely in sync with a weak trend overseas. A rally in the US stock markets that saw   crossing 20,000 yesterday for the first time, along with stronger American currency and Treasury yields, hit the precious metals' safe haven appeal.
