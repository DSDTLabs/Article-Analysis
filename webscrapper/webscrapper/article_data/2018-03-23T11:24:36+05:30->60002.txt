HYDERABAD: Over 70 temporary huts were reduced to ashes when a major fire swept through   in   on Thursday. The property loss was put at Rs 25 lakh. Luckily, there was no loss of life though the fire occurred close to Maxcure Hospital.

 “These temporary dwellings were built by the daily wage labourers. A majority of the 500 families residing in these huts were affected,” said  , assistant district fire officer of Madhapur division.
 
 One of the inmates of the huts alerted police and fire station and within 10 minutes, three fire tenders were rushed to the area. Fire services personnel took nearly one-and-ahalf hours to bring the fire under control. The fire began at 9.20 am.
 
 “One of the families did not put out the fire completely while cooking in the open and ventured out for work. Dry leaves caught the fire, leaving the flames rage through the huts,” Suresh said. Several families lost everything — from clothes, utensils, household articles to cash and jewellery.
 
 Police said a majority of the daily wager families belong to   and Andhra Pradesh. There are nearly 600 huts in the area inhabited by 2,000 people. However, the fire gutted only 70 huts.
