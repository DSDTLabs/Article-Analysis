Mumbai: In three separate drug cases, the special Narcotic   and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) courts let off the accused on technical grounds as   were not conducted in accordance to the mandatory legal provisions. 

 Last week, a court acquitted Saroja Koshti (60) who was booked by the anti-narcotics cell on April 7, 2009, for possessing 100gm of a contraband called alprazolam. The court observed that though Koshti was apprised of her rights on how a search was to be conducted under Section 50 of the NDPS Act, the cop did not mention that she would be searched in the presence of a magistrate. The court said from the constable’s statement it was revealed that he had only mentioned a gazetted officer. “These serious lacunas in the prosecution case give benefit of doubt to the accused,” the court said. It also held that the woman constable who had conducted the personal search on Koshti did not even depose as a prosecution witness.
 
 In the second case, Rani Gaikwad (50) was nabbed for allegedly dealing in brown sugar from her Masjid Bunder home in 2009. In this case too, the court observed that she had not been appraised of her rights under Section 50. The court also found that besides a female constable, even a male sub-inspector conducted her personal search “It is necessary to take personal search of the accused in a closed room by keeping her decency... provision of Section 50(4) has not been complied,” the court said.
 
 In the third case, in March, a court acquitted a Malwani man who was arrested in 2012 for possessing 1.1kg of charas. The court observed that he was not appraised of his rights of search, but was only given a letter regarding the same. The court also held that the naik who had conducted his search was not authorized to do so.
