GURUGRAM: A major fire broke out at an automobile spare part manufacturing   in Sector 3 of   early on Monday owing to a short circuit, according to fire department officials. Though no one was injured in the fire, it is suspected to have caused a damage of around Rs 2 crore. 

 A total of 14 fire tenders from fire departments of Gurugram and Manesar were dispatched and the fire was brought under control after six hours.
 
 As per the information, the security guard working at the automobile filter manufacturing unit had spotted fire on the ground floor, after which he called up the department. Six fire tenders from Manesar reached the spot but were unable to control the fire, after which eight more tenders were rushed from Gurugram.
 
 Fire officer Narender Yadav said the fire spread quickly due to the raw materials kept there. “Since the company manufactures filters for automobile companies, there was lots of oil kept there due to which it took long to douse the fire,” said Yadav, adding that all raw materials were gutted.
 
 Notably, in the past few years, fires have broken out at many manufacturing units in Manesar. In August 2017, a fire had broken out at a helmet manufacturing   in Sector 8.
 
 On May 29, 2016, a major fire had broken out at the Manesar plant of Subros Limited, manufacturers of air conditioners and transport refrigerator systems. The Subros plant was opened after several months after the incident. In June 2015, an auto manufacturing plant in Sector 4, Mansear, had faced a fire too. 
 
 Most of these fire incidents had occurred in the early morning hours and no human casualties were reported.
