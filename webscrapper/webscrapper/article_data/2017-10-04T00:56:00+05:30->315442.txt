Trichy: Four members of a family, including three with health issues, were found dead in their house at Thiruchendurai, around 17km from Trichy, on Tuesday. The incident came to light when neighbours, who grew suspicious after there was no movement in the house for the last two days, alerted the Jeeyapuram police.

 Police sources said that Krishnamoorthy, 85, a retired government employee, had been residing at his house in Thiruchendurai Agraharam along with his three children including two daughters Akila, 48, Madhu, 40, and son Ragunath, 45. All the three children were suffering from health problems. While Krishnamoorthy’s wife Kamala, 80, was staying with the couple’s eldest son Subramanian, 56, employed in a nationalised bank at Trichy, Krishnamoorthy was taking care of the other three in Thiruchendurai Agraharam.
 
 Sources said the family hardly interacted with the neighbours. Subramanian would often visit them to provide groceries and other requirements from Trichy. Meanwhile, for the past two days, as Krishnamoorthy’s house was found locked from inside, and also as the milk packets delivered at the doorstep remain unused, neighbours grew suspicious and alerted the Jeeyapuram police on Tuesday morning.
 
 Police sources said that upon breaking open the house, all the four occupants were found lying in an unconscious state with signs of vomiting. “The family might have consumed poison-laced food at least a day ago as the bodies were not decomposed much. Stress and inability to take care of three children with health troubles may have driven the senior citizen to commit suicide with family,” a police official said.
 
 On information, Krishnamoorthy’s wife Kamala, son Subramanian and other relatives arrived at the house. The bodies were subsequently sent to Trichy government hospital for medical examination while the Jeeyapuram police are investigating the incident.
