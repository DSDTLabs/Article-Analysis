NEW DELHI: Having lost his job and unable to pay for his daugther’s school education, this 31-year-old MBA graduate took to smuggling illicit   from   to Delhi in his  . However, his luck soon ran out when he was caught red-handed with   in his possession.

 DCP (Dwarka) Shibesh Singh said the accused, Mohit Goswami, was arrested under the Excise Act. Police acted on a tipoff about illegal liquor being sneaked into Delhi from Haryana in an Esteem car. The car was intercepted and, upon checking, police recovered 23 cartons of Haryana-manufactured liquor. During interrogation, Goswami, a native of Amritsar, told police that he held a B.tech degree and had also done an MBA from a private university. He secured a job in Singapore with a Japanese eatery in 2011.
 
 After working there for around nine months, Goswami returned to India. He came into contact with a man named Sanjeev, who told him that they could make a quick buck by smuggling liquor between Haryana and Delhi. However, as Goswami got a job in a real estate firm in Gurgaon, he forgot all about the “offer”. Having tied the knot, he settled down in the city even as his father moved back to Amritsar while his mother went to the US.
 
 Police said Goswami lost his job in the recent industry slowdown and was in a dire need of money. He needed to pay Rs 80,000 as school fee for his daughter. Running out of options, Goswami got in touch with a gang of smugglers who offered him Rs 500 per carton.
 
 Police said Goswami was being questioned further to trace the other accused in the case.
