YAVATMAL: The   branches in Yavatmal are facing acute currency shortage and continuing to follow the restricted money transactions despite the RBI lifting the restriction from March 13.

 One of the account holders of   Datta Chowk Branch Wazulla Khan, a resident of Yavatmal has approached the branch for withdrawing a sum of amount of Rs50,000/- from his saving account, the branch manager refused to allow him to transact on the lame excuse of not having supply of adequate currency notes from the main branch. The bank recently allowed the account holders to transact up to Rs10,000 which caused great inconvenience to the account holders. When contacted the branch manager Suhas Kotkar has confirmed the currency shortage and said he was not supplied a single paisa by the SBI main branch on Friday.
 
 “I have been forced to allow only restricted money transactions,” he added. The ATMs are also running short of currency. Kotkar has given the explanation to the ATM position that whatever amount was stored in the ATM earlier would be able to withdraw and thereafter no transaction would be possible due to want of currency. Another problem faced by the public is that the traders are refusing to accept Rs10 coin on the ground that the coin is already nullified by the RBI.
 
 When contacted the Branch Manager Suhas Kotkar said that there was no such invalidation of Rs10 coin. “If the public gathers in our branches with huge number of coins, it would be impossible for us to count the coins and return the amount in currency denomination,” he further said.
 
 “Our senior officials are daily contacting the   for supply of adequate currency uninterruptedly but to no avail,” he further lamented. 
 
 The account holders of the nationalized banks in the city are making long queues for   even now. The pass book printing machines in the SBI branches are often found defunct and there is no convincing answer from the officials for the same.
