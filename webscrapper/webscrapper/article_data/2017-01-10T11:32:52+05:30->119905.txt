Margao: Navelim MLA and fisheries minister  , on Monday, released his manifesto for the upcoming assembly election. Furtado will be contesting as an independent candidate from Navelim constituency. 

 In his manifesto, Furtado has laid stress on providing and improving basic infrastructural facilities in his constituency.
 
 With state Congress president Luizinho Faleiro having declared his intent to contest the elections from Navelim, Furtado will be pitted against Faleiro, who he once strongly supported. 
 
 Furtado, who defeated former PWD minister, Churchill Alemao, in the 2012 assembly elections, was supported by BJP. Defence minister   and chief minister   openly urged Furtado to join the BJP and contest on the party ticket. But, Furtado rejected the offer.
 
  Sources said that BJP is toying with the idea of fielding its own candidate in Navelim to contest against Furtado and Faleiro.
