BENGALURU: Of the over 1.6 lakh   cast across the state in the 2013 assembly polls, 26,186 were rejected during counting due to glitches in the ballot paper, shows electors’ data summary published by the Election Commission.

 The situation was no different in the 2008 assembly elections. Of 64,098 postal votes, 14,284 were not included in the final count. Interestingly, most of these errors were committed by polling personnel who used the postal ballot facility. 
 
 While a majority of postal votes are cast by government officials who are on election duty, a considerable number are from defence personnel as well. In 2013, nearly 30,000 votes were cast by them. 
 
 “It’s an irony that polling personnel who are supposed to understand the voting process thoroughly make mistakes when they cast vote through postal ballots,” said a BBMP officer who has been working in the election wing. In many cases, missing signatures have led to rejection of votes. 
 
 Ramesh K N, joint chief electoral officer 1 (technical), Karnataka, said a common error is violation of secrecy. “An elector (voter) has to make a declaration about himself/herself in a form while voting by post. The procedure is such that the ballot paper is kept in an inner cover and the declaration form in the outer cover. These crucial details are shared with polling personnel while training them. Yet, year after year, these mistakes are happening. If the elector doesn’t provide a declaration form, it leads to violation of secrecy,” he added.
