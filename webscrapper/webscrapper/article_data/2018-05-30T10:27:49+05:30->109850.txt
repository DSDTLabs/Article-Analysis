KOCHI: The move to scrap the   (CCE) was applauded by most city schools, despite a slight apprehension among students and parents. The lack of clarity on how grades were awarded created a confusion among students and schools.

 
 “Parents and students were not familiar with the board exam pattern and this led to a confusion. Above 90% does not secure you an A1. Thereby, the number of A1s has decreased to a large extent. Of the 56 students, only one student has secured an A1 in all subjects.” said Jaya Sabin, principal of Greets Public School, Kaloor.
 
  
 This year, CBSE shifted from the grading system that was applied during CCE and shifted to a relative grading system, where the highest 1/8th of passed candidates was given A1, the next 1/8 given A2 and so on. Candidates who failed were given an E grade. The grading system was elaborated in the exam bylaws. Minor variations are made depending on the number of students appearing for the exams.
 
 President of Kerala CBSE School Management Association TPM Ibrahim Khan said: “The fall in the number of A1 candidates will have a psychological setback among students and parents, especially in rural areas. The association had already taken up the matter with CBSE.” Schools also pointed out the lesser marks in languages, namely, French, Hindi, and Malayalam. “Probable A1 holders missed their mark in French. This has contributed to decrease in A1 students,” said Sunitha Satheesh, principal of Choice School, Tripunithura.
