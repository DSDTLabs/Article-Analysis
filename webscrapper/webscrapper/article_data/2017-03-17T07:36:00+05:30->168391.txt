Gurgaon: A preliminary probe into the murder of Delhi gangster gunned down on Tuesday night has revealed he wanted to marry the ‘honeytrap’ girl, who he knew for only 12 days before his death. Police is still trying to identify the girl. 

 Rahul Mann alias Rinku, 27, a native of Delhi’s Alipur village, was shot dead on Tuesday night at around 11pm in Sector 23 A, Gurgaon, according to his friends. TOI reported on March 16 that the needle of suspicion points towards the rival Nandu gang that had set up a honeytrap to lure him to the secluded spot. Two special teams have been formed to investigate the case.
 
 “Mann’s friend said they often saw him exchanging messages with the girl on Whatsapp. He was planning to marry her. We have identified some suspected rival gang members who might be involved in the murder. We are also trying to identify the girl,” said Sumit Kuhar, DCP (crime), Gurgaon. 
 
 As soon as Mann reached Palam Vihar on Tuesday night in his friend's Santro car, the assailants who had been already waiting there opened fire at him, police said. After getting five bullet shots in his chest, head, hip and stomach, he died on the spot. 
 
 When cops reached the spot, Rahul's body was found lying on a kerbstone and his Santro parked on the road side. Police identified him on the basis of his driving licence. A birthday cake was also found in the car. His mobile was missing from the crime scene. 
 
 Mann, a member of Bawania gang, was out on bail from Delhi's Rohini jail around two months ago and was working as a cab driver.
