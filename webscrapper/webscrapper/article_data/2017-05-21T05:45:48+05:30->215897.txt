THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   chief   has furnished a detailed report to additional chief secretary (home and vigilance)   on his arguments with ADGP (headquarters)   earlier this month over a meeting convened by the latter. Senkumar is learnt to have submitted the report on Friday in response to Thachankary’s complaint a few days ago.

 Sources said the incident dated back to May 8, the day after Senkumar took charge as the state police chief. Thachankary had reportedly convened a meeting of all ministerial staff at police headquarters without Senkumar’s knowledge and asked them to route files to the state police chief only through him. Senkumar summoned Thachankary the next day and pulled him up for the directive, leading to a heated exchange between them.
