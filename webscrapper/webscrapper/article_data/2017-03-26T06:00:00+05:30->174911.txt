Kolkata: The state cabinet has granted provisional permission to two private companies to develop   projects, one in Rajarhat and the other near Amtala. While the Rajarhat ptoject will come up on 80.29 acres, the one near Amtala will cover almost 233 acres.

 According to sources in the state secretariat, the Rajarhat project will share a common boundary with Eco Urban Village at Jagdishpur mouza. Forum Properties Holding Pvt Ltd has been selected to develop the ‘Innovative Township’. The state govermment has asked Hidco to issue provisional certificate to Forum Properties, subject to payment of necessary fees and compliance of statutory obligations.
 
 Ambuja Neotia Group would set up the other theme-based township near Amtala. The theme for the township would be education, health and tourism. Group chairman Harsh Neotia pointed out that there’s mandatory low-cost housing in the project. Besides, the developer will build roads and other infrastructure. “We are committed to build an integrated township that will provide housing to all. There would be many activities for employment generation in areas of healthcare, education and tourism,” he said.
 
 The state government had earlier identified 447 acres for six theme townships, one each in Dabgram, Bolpur, Kalyani, Baruipur, Asansol and Dumurjola and had also come up with a policy. Expressions of interest have been floated to invite private players for developing the proposed townships.
 
 According to the policy, developers will get quick clearance at the state level. The developer would have to keep 25% of the total project area for setting up residential units for economically weaker sections. Another 25% will be reserved for the theme it is based upon and commercial expansion can be carried out in the remaining area. Town Planning norms, municipal laws, environment laws and the National Building Code have to be followed by the developers.
