LUCKNOW: Water consumption will no longer be free as residents of Lucknow will soon have to pay tariff for water usage.  , which has already installed 1,000 meters, plans to fix 90,000 meters in Indiranagar & Gomtinagar by June. As of now, people only pay water tax, which is 12.5% of the total rental value of the property. Once water meters are installed, people will have to pay for consumption, too.

 The meter will calculate the exact volume of water being consumed in each house and accordingly charge the house owner.
 
 While Mumbai and Delhi have been doing this for a while now, this is the first time that any UP city will charge tariff on water supply.
 
 
 
  
 
 A total of Rs 22.5 crore had been sanctioned for this under Centre’s scheme JNNURM long ago but not utilised. The remaining funds will come from AMRUT.
 
 Jal Nigam’s project manager said, “We have already applied for required funds under AMRUT. Work will be done phase-wise.”
 
 The objective is to minimise leakages in the supply network by comparing total production with total consumption in supplied houses. The other motive is to regulate water wastage.
 
 
 
 
 In apartment buildings,   will provide supply to the common underground tank. The payment will be charged by dividing the consumption by number of houses. Because it will be a collective approach, resident welfare associations will have to play a role in minimizing wastage of water.
