AMRITSAR: A day after the  's top law court allowed employers to bar workers from wearing visible religious symbols, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) said on Wednesday that it would write to Prime Minister   to seek his intervention to prevent any possible turban ban in European countries. 

 SGPC president Kirpal Singh Badungar described the  's (ECJ's) verdict as "condemnable". "We will write to the PM to take up the issue with European nations through the diplomatic channel," Badungar said.
 
 The Luxembourg-based court's ruling came in the case of a Muslim woman fired by the Belgium-headquartered security company G4S, after she insisted on wearing a headscarf. The EU court said workplaces should be religiously neutral and religious attires, such as the turban, affect "neutrality".
 
 The court's decision is expected to affect the three lakh Sikhs living across the European Union. "Our main worry is the situation in mainland Europe. There are 2.5-3 lakh Sikhs in countries across mainland Europe, like Italy, Spain, Portugal and Germany, who are already vulnerable to widespread discrimination, especially when it comes to employment," said   (UK).
 
 The chair of UN-affiliated NGO United Sikhs, Amrik Singh, said the ECJ's ruling had "struck at the heart" of those practising Sikhism.
