NEW DELHI: Responding to the recent incidents of Hindutva outfits disrupting Friday prayers in Gurugram, Haryana chief minister on Sunday said that Muslims should offer namaz inside mosques and eidgahs.

 
 "It is our duty to maintain law and order. There has been an increase in offering namaz in open. Namaz should be read in mosques or eidgahs rather than public spaces," Khattar was quoted as saying by ANI.
 
  
  
 Last Friday, prayers were disrupted in several areas of Gurugram by Hindutva outfits. 
 
 Unprecedented scenes were observed from all around the city as mob shouting "Jai Shri Ram" and "Bangladesh Wapas Jao" (go back to Bangladesh) interrupted the congregations.
 
 The disruptions were witnessed in busy areas like Iffco Chowk, Udyog Vihar, Leisure Valley Park and Mall Mile on MG Road. 
 At a park opposite Candor Techspace, a group of corporate executives prayed amid heavy security cover.
 
 What happened on Friday had been building up for a month. On April 6, a group of men from Wazirabad village opposed prayers at a ground in Sector 43 and threatened the congregation.
 
 Six persons were arrested after an FIR was filed at the Sector 53 police station for allegedly disrupting the Muslim prayers at an open ground in Sector 53 and threatening those offering prayers.
 
 Following the filing of the FIR, a protest march under the banner of the Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti was taken out to demand cancellation of an FIR against six youths on the charge of disrupting 'namaz' on government land.
 
 The protesters gathered at the Kamla Nehru Park and marched to the Mini Secretariat, where they handed over a memorandum to the Additional Deputy Commissioner for forwarding it to Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar.
