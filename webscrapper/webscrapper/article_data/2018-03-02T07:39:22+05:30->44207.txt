AHMEDABAD: In the assembly, the state government stated that nearly a quarter of children gone missing in the last two years (2016 and 2017) are yet to be traced. The majority of children reported missing are from five cities — Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot and  .

  
  
 CID (crime) officials said that between 2007 and 2017, the state recorded 37,732 kids and teens going missing, of which 34,336 were found. The state ranks 14th nationally in terms of tracking missing children, they added.  , DGP, CID (crime), said about 90% of the such children have been traced over in past decade. “A number of initiatives, including sustained drives and sensitizing police staff about the issue, have been taken up. Coordination with neighbouring states has also improved, due to which we are getting information on kids from   found by police in those states,” he said. Why do children go missing? CID officials said the state reported two major categories, children leaving on their own or abduction.
 “In 15-18 years age group, 85% of missing persons reported are girls. In most of these cases, a love affair is suspected to be the cause, though there are also cases of coercion. The majority of boys brought back or who returned on their own cited reasons such as scoldings by parents, getting hurt by comments or acts, failure in exams or love affairs,” said a senior CID official. Activists said some cases have been stuck in limbo such as the   case of 2012. In some cases, boys returned on their own or families tracked them down. According to the government reply in the assembly, Ahmedabad rural and   were two divisions where the tracking rate was below 50%. Tribal areas also have comparatively higher rates, attributed to migration for work within and outside Gujarat.
