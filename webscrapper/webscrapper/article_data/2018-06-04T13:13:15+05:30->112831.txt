Additional superintendent of police Sudha Singh said, “Veerpal had taken an agricultural loan for lending money to his friends. However, they were not ready to return the money to him. When he kept asking, they took him to Sohanlal’s house on the pretext of returning the money and fed him liquor. Later, they killed him and dumped his body in the well. They also put a pouch of liquor in his trousers to create an impression that he fell into the well in an inebriated condition.”
