GURUGRAM: Residents of   — a residential society in   — have written to CM   following a report that space has been allocated to set up a   on the premises of the society’s shopping complex.

 “Our township has only one shopping hub, which is Malibu Shopping Arcade, from where residents buy essential commodities. It is an integral part of the township. Also, Shopping Arcade was built as per the zoning plan of Malibu Township. How can a pub come up in a residential area, making it difficult for families to venture out of their homes?” Mahendra, a resident of Malibu Towne, said. 
 
 A group of residents alleged the land for a school had already been demarcated within 50-metre radius of the market, where the pub will be set up.
 
 “Under various provisions of the Haryana excise policy, permission to set up bar, microbrewery or wine shops cannot be granted at a location that is within 150-metre radius of a school or a religious place,” Kavita, a resident of Malibu Towne, said.
 
 Residents alleged the society management granted permission to set up the pub in the name of a restaurant. “We visited representatives of Malibu Estate Pvt Ltd (MEPL) on Tuesday to take up the issue. Residents requested them to share the lease agreement signed between Malibu Towne and pub owners. But they refused to share any details, claiming MEPL leased out the space to set up a restaurant. They also refused to share any information on the original zoning plan,” alleged a statement released by the residents. 
 
 Though TOI tried to contact Malibu Estate Pvt Ltd general manager wing commander (retd) S.C. Sharma to enquire about the allegations raised by residents, he remained unavailable for comments.
