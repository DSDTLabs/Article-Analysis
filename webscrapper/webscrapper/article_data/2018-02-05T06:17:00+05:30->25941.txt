Kolkata: A CID raid at former IPS officer Bharati Ghosh’s Madurdaha home, off EM Bypass, on Sunday prompted   to allege that CID was trying to “plant evidence” to falsely indict her. 

 CID, which has so far refused to confirm or deny reports that Ghosh – or properties owned by her – was under its radar, kept mum on the developments.
 
 Ghosh, however, alleged in an audio message that CID officers were frequenting her Madurdaha home for the last two days, even at night. “They conducted a raid today. However, over the past two days they were seen entering the place with heavy bags,” she alleged in the audio tape. 
 
 Ghosh claimed CID had not bothered to show her the FIR, nor informed her about the impending raids. She said such disregard for law was “state sponsored terrorism”. She said she would take legal steps on her return to Kolkata. 
 
 While no senior CID officer was willing to comment, the raids on a home owned by Ghosh clearly show she – and her role as West Midnapore SP when the complaint was made – is under investigation. The state CID on Friday started raiding homes of several serving and former cops as part of a probe into a fraud gold-for-cash scheme they allegedly patronised.
