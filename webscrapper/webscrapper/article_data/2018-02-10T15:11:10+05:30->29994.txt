Keith Adams, who served as the stunt coordinator on the sets of  , has said that he would have been able to prevent actor  's crash had he been notified about the scene. Adams told media that he and his team were not on set as no stunts were scheduled for the day the violent car crash happened. 

  
  
 "No stunts of any kind were scheduled for the day of Ms Thurman's accident. All of the stunt department was put on hold and no one from the stunt department was called to set. At no point was I notified or consulted about Thurman driving a car on camera that day," Adams said. 
 
 "Had I been involved, I would have insisted not only on putting a professional driver behind the wheel but also insuring that the car itself was road-worthy and safe," he added. In an article, Thurman had alleged that director   forced her to drive an unsafe car as part of a stunt on the set of 'Kill Bill', which crashed and injured her. Tarantino, on his part, has expressed regret for Thurman's accident, calling it the 'biggest mistake' of his life.
