PUNE: Students should reach the   centres early as the hall tickets issued by the   board do not specifically mention sub-centres where seating arrangements are made.

 The state board has issued hall tickets to students only with the name of the main exam centres. But in case of big colleges having huge campuses, there are sub-centres where the students have been allotted classes.
 
 
 State board chairman  , said, "It's difficult to mention the subcentres on the hall ticket. From next year onwards, we shall see to it that sub-centres are put on the hall tickets."
 
 Finding the sub-centre and classroom takes time leading to students reporting late for the paper. Parents and students pointed out this inconvenience, but the board failed to take any action.
