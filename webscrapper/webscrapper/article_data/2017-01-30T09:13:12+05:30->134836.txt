MANGALURU: Actor  , who is sharing screen with the iconic actor-filmmaker   in ‘Kung Fu Yoga’, said that the Indo-Chinese movie will be a hit at the box office unlike other Chinese-US co-productions, which have lost money in the past.

 “The upcoming Hollywood movie to be released on February 3 is very much related to Indians as well as Chinese. The movie is shot in India, Dubai and other parts of the world. Indians can relate themselves to story as some elements are common,” Sood told mediapersons here on Sunday.

 “Jackie is humble. I see him bringing food and fruits, feed everyone from spot boy to others. He is happier in India than any other country when shooting,” shared Sood. He revealed that he will be soon working in Telugu film. 
 
 “I haven’t explored South Indian movies but I want to and I have shortlisted few for an upcoming project,” he said.
