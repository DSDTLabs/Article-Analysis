The team will tranquillize the tigress.
 
  As dusk fell, the operation to tranquillize the tigress was postponed till Friday morning as it was not possible to spot it amid the dense cane crop.
  
  Sources said one of the six teams formed to track the tigress in an area covering 30 villages spotted the tigress in the early hours on Thursday along Khannaut river at Chandupur village. It immediately alerted its superiors, said sub divisional officer of social forestry and in charge officer of the quick response team (QRT) of PTR KP Singh.
  
  On the information of the tracking team, DFO of PTR  , divisional director of social forestry  , the range officers and field force of both forest divisions rushed to the spot and gheraoed the sugarcane field where the tigress is said to be hiding.
  
  Singh said the sugarcane field spanned a five-acre area and it was was encircled by forest force personnel while dart shooters and gunners atop four elephants kept striving to locate the big cat. However, despite massive search operation, the tigress was neither sighted nor did it come out of the cane field, he said.
  
  As the tigress could not be spotted till 6.45 pm, the field force, which has installed high power searchlights, was ordered to remain at the spot all night long in order to confine the tigress in the field. The SDO said the operation would re-start on Friday morning.
