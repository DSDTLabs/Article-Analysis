NEW DELHI: A day after a   engineer died in an accident after allegedly being chased after a raid against illegal power thefts at   village near Najafgarh, cops have registered a case of culpable homicide. Two men allegedly involved in threatening the driver of the car have been identified. 

 Police say that one of the men who had threatened the driver has been identified as Fauzi. However, police said they have not received an official complaint from the BSES officials regarding an attack.
 
 In their statement, the injured officials said their driver   had started speeding when he saw two men from the village on a motorbike riding beside their car. Wasim claimed that he panicked seeing the gestures by the men and started speeding which led to the accident. 
 
  “We are probing into the allegations about men chasing the BSES vehicle leading to the accident,” said DCP (southwest) Surender Kumar. 
 
 Police say that they had recieved a call about the surprise raid by the BSES half an hour before they actually reached the village. They had sought the video and photographic evidences collected from the spot near   village, which is about 3kms away from Jhuljhuli, after the incident. 
 
 Meanwhile, the body of the assistant engineer Abhimanyu Singh will be flown to   and handed over to his family members. 
 
 The car in the accident has been sent for a mechanical inspection, and the driver and the other passengers are being questioned. 
 
 Cops have also found three eyewitnesses, including a BSES manager and a DTC bus driver who had pulled out the injured officials. Their statements were recorded on Tuesday about the sequence of events.
