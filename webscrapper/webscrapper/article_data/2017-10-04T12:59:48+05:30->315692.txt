VADODARA: Whenever the festive season approaches, guess what is one of the top priorities for the cops in the city? 

 Cleaning up the roads and streets in the old city areas where the processions like Ganesh and Tazia draw large number of people. And no, it is not out of any sense of civic duty. The cops clear the roads of debris to prevent incidents of stone pelting during communal clashes. 
 
 Police officials said that whenever communal clashes break out, one of the first things that the mobs do is pick up roadside stones and debris to pelt at each other. 
 
 “If the debris lay strewn on the road, it becomes easier for the mobs to pick up stones and pelt them. So, we clear the debris and stones from the main roads and other streets ahead of the festive season,” said Manoj  . 
 
 “We take the help of the civic body to clear the debris. The job is done vigorously to avoid the incidents of stone pelting. There are certain elements who resort to stone pelting and damage lot of property. It also causes injuries to civilians and cops,” Sashidhar added. The police doesn’t just clear the debris from the roads but it also checks terraces of many buildings and homes in the old city. 
 
 “Many mischief mongers stock up stones on the terraces and pelt them when communal tensions occur. We visit terraces of many apartments to ensure that no stones and other objects are stocked up there,” said a police official. After any incident of rioting in the city, stone are seen strewn across the streets. 
 
 The recent rioting during Tazia processions also saw stone pelting that caused injuries to civilians and some cops. To prevent injuries, many cops enter the rioting zone wearing helmets that are usually worn while riding on two-wheelers.
