TALEIGAO: Condemning the assurances made by BJP national president Amit Shah in   regarding the Mhadei water dispute,   ( ) on Sunday held a protest outside Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Indoor Stadium in   where Shah addressed nearly 16,000 BJP booth workers.

 Fearing unrest, a police cordon was set up to prevent protesters from disrupting traffic, but things quickly escalated leading to minor scuffles between police and GSM members for around 20 minutes.
 
 The scuffle began with a war of words when GSM members began chanting slogans against Shaheven as BJP booth workers were arriving at the venue. Irked by the taunts, some BJP supporters got down from their vehicles and began to threaten the protesters. The police quickly stepped in to calm things downeven as GSM continued with the taunts and heckling.
 
 GSM, a breakaway faction of the Goa RSS prant, is upset over Shah’s statement during the Karnataka election campaign where he assured farmers that the water-sharing dispute between Goa and Karnataka would be resolved in six months, and that Mhadei water would be diverted for irrigation purposes to parts of Karnataka. “We want to convey to Shah that Goa does not welcome his statement on Mhadei. Both states are fighting the case before the Mhadei Water Dispute Tribunal,” GSM president   said.
 
 The protestors were walking to the indoor stadium when they were stopped by Goa police. The BJP booth workers and members demanded that the police should arrest the protestors.
