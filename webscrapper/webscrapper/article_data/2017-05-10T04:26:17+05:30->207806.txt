New Delhi:   of Sukhdev Vihar have moved the   recently against the   waste-to-energy   which was allegedly causing severe air pollution around their colony. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) which was hearing residents’ appeal to shut down the plant had allowed the plant while imposing an environment compensation charge of Rs 25 lakh for violating pollution norms earlier.

 The residents welfare associations of Sukhdev Vihar, Jasola, Ishwar Nagar have filed an appeal together in Supreme Court. They are mainly challenging the location of the waste-to-energy plant which is only 35 metres from the residential areas.
 
 “The location of the said plant from the very beginning was in violation of the Master plan/Zonal plan, documents on record besides false representations which were made by different government bodies and other persons. Residents of these areas never got a fair opportunity to represent their obvious case that the plant cannot be located in so close proximity of densely populated residential areas. The emissions from waste-to-energy plant are so lethal that if any accident takes place, it may result in massive casualties,” said a note prepared by the residents on their appeal.
