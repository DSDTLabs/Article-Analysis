VIJAYAWADA: Fed up with paying huge amounts of interest, Chandrasekhar (38), who availed himself of a series of ' ' loans aggregating to Rs 27 lakh, lodged a complaint against a moneylender at the police commissioner's office. 

 According to Chandrasekhar's wife Lavanya, they have obtained loans from 2011 up to Rs 27 lakh and bought two flats in the city. After paying Rs 50 lakh towards the loan over a period of four years, Gummadi Ramakrishna, the financier who took promissory notes and cheques from them, transferred the two flats also to his name.
 
 "We are in possession of the documents showing we have transferred the two flats to his name. What's worse is that he had sold them away and even took the broker's commission of Rs 35,000 for selling the flats which were in his name," Lavanya said.
 
 The two flats that Ramakrishna took are presently worth Rs 48 lakh and Rs 60 lakh respectively. Apart from taking away their flats, the moneylender allegedly demanded Rs 90 lakh claiming that they still owe him Rs 45 lakh principal amount and Rs 50 lakh interest.
 
 He has even issued a legal notice to Chandrasekhar to return the amount. Unable to bear Ramakrishna's harassment, the couple decided to lodge a police complaint. 
 
 Murali, a friend of both Ramakrishna and Chandrasekhar said, "They decided to lodge a complaint when the call money issue broke some time ago but I asked them to go for settlement. Now he is demanding more."
 
 Ramakrishna is now planning to attach Lavanya mother's property as well.
 
 They also lodged a complaint at an ACP office where their statements were recorded. The police are yet to take Ramakrishna's statement and may plan to hold a mediation between both the parties.
 
 Back in 2015, a massive extortion, sex racket and blackmail pertaining to 'call money' was exposed in  . Hundreds of people across various political parties were arrested and even a judicial probe was ordered into the racket.
