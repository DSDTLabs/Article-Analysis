Indore: After disappointing results over the past few years, Indore students performed extremely well in the MP board   last year.

 MPBSE results for the Class X and XII exams were a disappointment for students before 2016. Indorean Hunny Wadhwani from Tirathbai Kalachand HS School became the city topper among Class X students for the academic year 2015-16 scoring 96.5 per cent.
 
 Atisha Gupta of Sarafa Vidhya Niketan emerged as the city topper with 95% marks for the Class XII exams. Around 52.05 per cent students who appeared for the exam cleared it with flying colours in 2016.
 
 The city attained a total pass rate of 46.46 per cent in the Class X results, which was less than 2015. Indore district attained a pass percentage of 54.74 per cent in 2015. Results this year are expected to be better compared to previous years.
 
 “We took a slew of measures to improve results and increase the number of merit holders in the city. The result has been better this year as far as I know. The details will be revealed on Friday,” said SS Kaushal, district education officer.
 
 Meanwhile, teachers and students from the city are also confident of this year’s result.
 
 In both the results previously, girls beat boys in the number of toppers from the city. However, not many students made it to the state merit list in the city. As a surprise, some students from small towns like Shajapur, Khandwa and Khargone grabbed a place in the state merit list.
