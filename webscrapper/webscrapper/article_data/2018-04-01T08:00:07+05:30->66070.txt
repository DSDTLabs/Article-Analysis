BENGALURU: The Congress on Saturday claimed the country has become the second-largest beef exporter in the world with the meat industry flourishing in the Narendra Modi regime. 

 Hitting back at BJP president Amit Shah for promising to ban cow slaughter in Karnataka if the party comes to power, home minister Ramalinga Reddy claimed India was in third position in   before Modi came to power. 
 
 “Now, it has come to the second spot with 14% year-on-year growth. In 2017, India exported 1,850 tonnes of meat, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Private Limited and BJP-ruled Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh have been major contributors for this. Another BJP-ruled state, Goa, consumes around 30 tonnes of beef every day. Many BJP leaders are in this business,’’ Reddy alleged.
 
 “This shows the BJP’s double-standards. Why haven’t they banned beef export? Why are they silent on cow slaughter in Goa and north-eastern states?” he asked.
 
 He also took exception to Shah’s promise to send those who killed right-wing activists in Karnataka to jail if the party came to power. “Who is he to send them to jail? The state government has acted promptly in these cases. We have already sent the accused to jail and in some cases, chargesheets have been filed,” Reddy said.
 
 He advised Amit Shah not to divide the society by politicising these murders. “As many as 12 SDPI and PFI workers have been killed by right-wing activists in Karnataka. Why is Amit Shah ot talking about these killings?” Reddy asked.
 
 He described Shah’s visit to Sutturu Mutt and the royal family of Mysuru as election gimmicks.
