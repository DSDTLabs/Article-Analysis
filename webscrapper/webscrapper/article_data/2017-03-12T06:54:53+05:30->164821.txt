 There is no doubt that Modi is the man. His achievements, his policies at the national level and Shah's “Chankaya tantra“ will propel the party to power in 2018. I am just an excuse. I have been the CM of this state and am once again projected as the CM candidate, what more do I want in my political career?Without Modi, there is no more politics in this country.
 
 
 
 
 There is no question of replacing me. Having been endorsed by the PM and Shah, I do not see any scope for any new person staking claim and becoming the chief minister.
 
 
 
 
 Hundred per cent. The UP election verdict will see the BJP working much more enthusiastically towards grabbing these two seats and providing a platform for our goal of 150 seats in the 2018 elections. From tonight itself we will be working towards the victory of our candidates who have been identified and building that platform.
 
 
 
 
 Ending two months of speculation, former Karntaka chief minister S M Krishna is set to join the BJP on March 15. Sources said Krishna is likely to join the party in the presence of party president Amit Shah and other senior leaders in New Delhi. Krishna quit the  , reportedly because the party sidelined him because of his age.
 
 Unlike former minister V Srinivas Prasad, who hinted at joining the saffron party before he officially did so, Krishna hasn't announced his plan yet. The former Union minister could campaign for the BJP in the April 9 Nanjangud and Gundlupet byelections if he joins the party this month. BJP state president B S Yeddyurappa told STOI that Krishna's presence will boost their chances in Old Mysuru region.
