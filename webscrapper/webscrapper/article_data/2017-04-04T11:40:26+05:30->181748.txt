If you were around in the 1990s, you would have heard Big Mountain’s cover of Peter Frampton’s ‘Ooo Baby I Love Your Way’. This popular track was a hit then, and singer Shibani Kashyap’s favourite too, as she grew up listening to it. And now, her recently released international collaboration, 24 Hours Irresponsible, with the Los Angles-based reggae band, is what has her all excited. 

 This is the first time the band has come to India to promote their song with Shibani. “They wanted to collaborate with an Indian artiste and I was thrilled when they called me. We have just shot a fantastic music video. Quino (the vocalist) and I hit it off instantly. Our next song together is going to be for a   film,” Shibani signs off.
