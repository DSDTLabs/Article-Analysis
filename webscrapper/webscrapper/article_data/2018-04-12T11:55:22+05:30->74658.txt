NEW DELHI: Addressing a press conference today in connection with the alleged rape of an Unnao girl by   MLA Kuldeep Singh Senger, the Uttar Pradesh (UP) DGP OP Singh said that if at all Sengar has to be arrested, it will be done by   and not UP police.

 
 "Now that the case has been given to CBI, they will decide on arrest," said Singh.
 
 "He has only been accused so far and not convicted," he added.
 
 Referring to Sengar as "honourable", DGP assured that the state administration had no intentions of saving the rape accused.
 
 "Nobody is defending honourable MLA, all we are saying is that we have to hear both sides," he said.
 
 Also present in the media conference was the home secretary of the state, Arvind Kumar, who accused UP police of being "negligent".
 
 "The state police has been lax in carrying out investigation so far," said Kumar.
 
 Earlier today Police SO Rajesh confirmed that an FIR was registered against Sengar.
 
 The BJP MLA has now been booked under various sections of IPC and POSCO Act, Times Now reported.
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
 The UP government had yesterday decided to lodge an FIR against Sengar in the case and refer it to the CBI for investigation. The government also decided to recommend a CBI probe into the alleged murder of the rape survivor’s father in judicial custody.
 
 The government decision for a CBI probe came just after Sengar made an appearance at the official residence of Lucknow police chief to announce that he had no role in the rape of the teenager and death of her father.
 
  
  
 
 The government also announced suspension of two senior doctors of Unnao district hospital. It also announced disciplinary action against three other doctors of the jail department for dereliction of duty and negligence in attending to the rape survivor’s father, who died on Tuesday. An officer of the rank of DSP has been suspended for not attending to the repeated complaints of the rape survivor and her family.
