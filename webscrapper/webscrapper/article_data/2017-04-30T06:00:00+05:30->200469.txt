It was a sight to behold as Hyderabad based dance group Stepz wowed the audience with a breathtaking contemporary interpretation of traditional   sambaralu and   at   on Friday. The show titled “Dance of the Warriors” was a fusion of jazz, contemporary and classical Indian dance styles.
The evening was kicked off with a performance showcasing the rich art and culture that flourished in Telangana during the reign of the Kakatiya dynasty. Watching the dancers create the Thousand-Pillared temple and the Warangal Fort Temple with their dance formations the audience broke into generous applause. The section ended with an ode to celebrated warrior queen,  .
 This was followed by the segment that recreated the life and time of the people during the period — filled with village folk, cattle, farming, friendships, kids playing etc — through their dance formations. The dancers impressed with their well synchronised movements and mesmerising head stands. The performance ended with a segment that blended Perini Shivathandavam and Jazz. “Jazz is more of an expressive dance form; we mixed the jazz moves with the Perini. The audience's response was fantastic. They loved our performance. A lot of classical dancers appreciated the idea of presenting these elements through a modern dance form. Many in the audience were not familiar with the Perini and Bathukkamma dance forms; especially those of the younger generation. But when we started doing it in a modern style, everyone enjoyed,” says  , the choreographer of the show.
