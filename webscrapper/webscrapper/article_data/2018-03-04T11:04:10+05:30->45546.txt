Tirupur: Feeling anxious over her husband’s deteriorating health, a 38-year-old woman fed poison to her two children and her mother before consuming it at   here on Friday. While her 10-year-old son died, others are struggling for their lives at the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital.

 Police sources identified the hapless woman as Sudha, wife of   of Eripalayam. “Arun was working as a confectionery vendor. The couple’s son Suresh Karthik was a class IV student and six-year-old daughter   was a class II student in a private school. Arun was suffering from kidney disease and both of his kidneys had once become defunct. As the disease became acute, Sudha, a homemaker, had donated one of her kidneys to him two years ago. However, the 43-year-old man did not recover completely and used to fall ill often,” a police officer said.
 
 Arun told police that Sudha was extremely worried about his health and used to tell him that if anything happens to him, she and the children could not live.
 
 On Friday, Arun had left the home as usual for work. When he felt dizziness during the afternoon hours, he phoned Sudha to inform about his condition. When he heard his children crying, he asked her about it, only to learn that Sudha had fed poison to the children and her mother S Palaniammal, who was staying with the family. A panicked Arun alerted his neighbours, who rushed the family to the Coimbatore government hospital.
 
 Suresh was declared dead on Friday evening. The other three are in a critical condition.
 
 Udumalpet police have registered a case.
