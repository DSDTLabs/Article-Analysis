NEW DELHI: In its bid to ensure that all vehicles have tamperproof   ( ), the government will allow automobile manufacturers to fit them before vehicles are rolled out of the factory. "The embossing of registration number will be done at the dealer's level," road transport minister   said. This will make the entire process hassle free for buyers and the registration or number plate will have 15 years' guarantee. Sources said in case of any defect, the dealer will be responsible for replacement.

 This will also end the monopoly of a few   in the market. Even 13 years after the government made HSRP mandatory, several states are yet to enforce it.
 
 HSRPs are uniform and have in-built security features such as a self-destructive sticker with engine and chassis number of the car, which cannot be tampered with. HSRPs also serve as adeterrent to car thieves.
 
 “Since vehicle manufacturers will buy HSRPs in bulk, prices will fall drastically. But what is more important is there will be huge relief for people, they will have assured service from the dealer concerned and there will be 100% compliance,” said Anil Chikkara, a transport expert.
 
 At present, the registration number is issued by the district-level Regional Transport Office (RTO) of respective states and the shop owners authorised by HSRP manufacturers fix the number plates on vehicles.
 
 HSRPs will also aid in creating a national database of all motor vehicles.
 
 Government officials said to introduce the change in norms, they will invite suggestions and objections from people before notifying the changes.
