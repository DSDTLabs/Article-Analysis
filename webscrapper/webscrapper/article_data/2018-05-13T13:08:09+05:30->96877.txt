COIMBATORE: Former CPM state secretary G   on Saturday said the party would organise a protest condemning the 28% GST rate on the micro and small industry sector, which has lost around 40% business because of the new tax regime. He, however, didn’t disclose when the protest would be held.

 Talking to reporters here on Saturday, he said, “While implementing the GST, the Centre said prices of raw materials would come down due to the single point taxation system. However, the prices have shot up. Besides, industry capital has been locked as tax refund has not been made to several owners.”
 
 Ramakrishnan said due to this, exports from Tirupur garment sector have reduced by Rs 3,000 crore. “Earlier, the exports were to the tune of 26,000 crore. But now it has come down to Rs 23,000 crore. Also, industrialists said tax refund of about Rs 2,500 crore has not been made so far,” he said.
 
 Even after several representations to reduce the GST rate, the state and central governments have not heeded the requests of small and micro entrepreneurs, he said. “So, the industrialists have decided to stage a protest. Workers also should join them in the protest,” he added.
 
 On NEET, Ramakrishnan said the Centre had made 5,700 students from the state to travel to other states to write the exam. “This is despite several government schools and colleges were available in the state,” he said. 
 
 Ramakrishnan said higher education in   was in a state of degradation. “The appointments of 21 vice-chancellors to the 22 state universities are questionable,” he said.
