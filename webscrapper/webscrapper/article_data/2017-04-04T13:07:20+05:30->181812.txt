CHENNAI: The Centre cannot be a mere spectator to the travails of drought-hit farmers, and the financial burden to prevent farmers from committing suicide does not lie on the shoulders of the state government alone, said the Madras high court on Tuesday.

 “We are hopeful that the Government of India will consider this unprecedented situation prevailing in   and extend its helping hand to the state government to reduce the financial burden of the state government. To save the farming community is not entirely upon the shoulders of the state government, but also on the central government,” said a division bench of Justice S Nagamuthu and Justice M V Muralidharan.
 
 Passing orders on a PIL filed by P Ayyakannu of the National South Indian River Interlinking Agriculturist Association seeking waiver of farm loans availed by all farmers, instead of limiting the benefit only to small and marginal farmers, the bench said: “The central government is aware of the severe drought in Tamil Nadu during 2016-17. The entire state has been declared as drought-hit. Farmers have started taking extreme steps like committing suicide.”
 
 Referring to letters from the chief secretary to the advocate general of Tamil Nadu stating that it would cost another Rs 1,980 crore for the state government to waive the loans of other farmers holding more than five acres of land, the bench said: “We are aware that the financial situation of the state government is grim.”
 
 “In this difficult situation, the central government cannot be a silent spectator. It should come forward to extend the help to the state government to share the burden. We are hopeful that the government of India will share the burden with the state government and extend maximum financial help to the state government to tide over the situation,” it said.
