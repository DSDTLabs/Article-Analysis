LUCKNOW: After wasting crores of rupees and more than a decade on running   in Lucknow at Shivri,   is back to the basics of  . As per a new rule, individuals will now have to separate waste and put it in different bags before handing it over to LMC’s sanitary staff.

 The new system has recently been adopted in Gomtinagar and Aashiana where LMC’s private partner in waste collection Eco-Green is collecting two types of bags from each house and transporting them on small electronic-carts to the designated garbage dumping ground nearby. The company piloted the project in Gomtinagar last month where it is covering over 25,000 houses and recently began the initiative in the three wards of Aashiana covering almost 10,000 houses daily.
 
 LMC’s environment engineer, Pankaj Bhushan said, “The previous company wasn’t able to collect waste from interiors of localities because of narrow width of approach roads which didn’t allow big vehicles to enter a colony for picking garbage. The e-carts help in navigating even narrowest of roads to collect garbage daily. We have plans to deploy about 50 such e-carts in the first phase for garbage collection.”
 
 The door-to-door segregated garbage collection through e-carts would be carried out next in Alambagh and other residential colonies near Kanpur Road. Eco-Green would be adopting this model of garbage across the city by June 2017. Here, a person has to keep separate bins for solid and liquid waste before handing over to the collector. The user-charges will not be increased.
 
 It is only after failure in three consecutive years of Swachh Bharat Mission listing that LMC finally realised there are marks to score for even   of solid and liquid waste. Hence its partner Eco-Green is working towards the new system. LMC said segregation of waste helps in convenient transportation and treatment of garbage at the plant.
