Hrithik Roshan, who has recently returned from a two-week vacation in the US with sons, Hrehaan and Hridhaan, ex-wife Sussanne Khan, and friends has been approached for Ronnie Screwvala's yet-untitled production, to be helmed by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra.

 "It’s a film on kabaddi, set in a prisoner- of-war camp, which has been developed by Ronnie’s writers. Hrithik has heard the script but is yet to sign on the dotted line. The film is expected to roll by the year-end. The final locations will be selected soon," informs a source, adding that contrary to reports, Ronnie’s kabaddi team won’t feature in the film. "It’s not even a biopic. It’s completely fiction."
 
  
  
 The film will be Screwvala’s fifth production after Anand Tiwari’s 'Love Per Square Foot', featuring Vicky Kaushal and Angira Dhar, an anthology of four shorts directed by  , Anurag Kashyap,   and Dibakar Banerjee – a follow-up but not a sequel to Bombay Talkies, a comedy helmed by Akarsh Khurana that will feature Irrfan Khan, and Abhishek Chaubey’s next, which sees   Rajput playing a dacoit.
 
 Hrithik was last seen in his home production, the Sanjay Gupta-directed 2017 action-crime drama 'Kaabil', which was followed by a cameo in designer-turned-filmmaker Vikram Phadnis’s Marathi film, 'Hrudayantar'. Meanwhile, Rakeysh is gearing up to start work on the   and   Bachchan-starrer 'Fanney Khan'.
