PUDUCHERRY: The Union human resource development ministry seems to have learnt a bitter lesson from the ousted   vice-chancellor   episode. 

  Now, the search committee constituted by the ministry to select a vice-chancellor for Pondicherry University has taken adequate measures to prevent candidates from submitting fake CVs and making false claims about their works while applying for coveted posts like that of the vice-chancellor.
 
 The committee has sought candidates to submit soft copies of their academic and administrative achievements and books and articles authored by them and other works before March 20 so as to detect academic misconduct like plagiarism. It also asked them to submit soft copies of their vision for Pondicherry University and special achievement, if any. There are many authentication software like 'Turnitin' that are used for 'originality check' of PhD / MPhil thesis and books/journals.
 
 The committee after screening the applications will shortlist candidates and hold personal interviews for the post of vice-chancellor of Pondicherry University on March 29 in New Delhi. The committee comprises of   vice-chancellor Kuldip Chand Agnihotri, Indira Gandhi National Tribal University (Amarkantak, Madhya Pradesh) vice-chancellor T V Kattimani and   former vice-chancellor Pradip Narayan Ghosh.
 
 Pondicherry University was mired in controversy during Chandra Krishnamurthy's regime as vice-chancellor following charges of plagiarism and misinterpretation of facts against her. The ministry constituted a fact-finding panel, which after a detailed probe, found that she was guilty of plagiarism and misrepresentation of facts while applying for the post of vice-chancellor.
