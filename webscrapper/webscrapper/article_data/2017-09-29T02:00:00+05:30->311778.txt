PATNA: Youngsters in Patna observe   fast not only to cleanse their soul and seek Goddess Durga’s blessing, but also to detoxify their body by abstaining from oily food.

 Devendra Kashyap, 26, who fasts every year during these nine days, said, “I am not a very religious person, but I like to fast during these nine days of Navaratra. I am on a strict liquid and fruit diet,” he said, adding it would cleanse his body and help him get rid of the flab in unwanted places. 
 
 Archana Singh, 24, said most of her friends observe fast during Navaratra to lose weight. “I have been fasting on Navaratra since 2013. I usually consume fruits and Navaratra special chips during the period,” she said.
 
 However, some people fast during Navaratra only for religious purpose. Khushboo Singh, 26, said she observes fast so that Goddess Durga fulfils her wishes for a better life. “Different people observe the fast for different reasons. Each avatar of the Goddess symbolises something,” she said. After the end of nine-day fast on Mahanavami, Khushboo will worship nine ‘kumari kanyas’ or pre-pubertine girls.
 
 Youngsters may have been observing the fast to maintain their figure, but nutritionists warn them against extreme starvation. City-based nutritionist Ranjeet Kumar has suggested devotees to go for a rich nutrition diet. “Fresh fruits and juices made at home should be consumed. People should also keep themselves hydrated with water. Many nutrition companies provide 100% fruit extracts that can also be consumed during fasting. Avoid oily food. It is important to fulfil some of body’s main requirements of vitamins, proteins and minerals without which the body will become weak,” he said.
