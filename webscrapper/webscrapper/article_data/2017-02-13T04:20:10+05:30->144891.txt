CHENNAI: DMK has convened a high-level executive panel meeting on Monday. This move from the state's principal opposition party came amidst political turmoil in wake of power tussle between the interim AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala and caretaker chief minister O Panneerselvam. DMK working president and leader of opposition M K Stalin will preside over the meeting, which will be held at 5pm on Monday at party headquarters, Anna Arivalayam, in Chennai. 

 All members of the executive panel of the party will attend the meeting. Though the party has not outlined any specific agenda for the meeting it is expected that the members will discuss the volatile political scenario prevailing in the state. 
 
 DMK general secretary K Anbazhagan, in a statement, appealed to all the high-level panel members to attend the meet without fail. The DMK had earlier charged that the government has been paralysed due to the power tussle between the rival camps in the ruling party. 
 
 Stalin, who called on the governor a couple of days ago asked him to ensure smooth functioning of the government.
