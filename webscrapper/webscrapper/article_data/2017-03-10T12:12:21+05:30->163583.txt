BHUBANESWAR: Board exams have come as a dampener for thousands of students in the state who were hoping to play  . Yet, in between exams and preparations, they hope to take a break to soak in the festival of colours. 

 Doctors advise students to take precautions and play a safe holi. "There's a gap of five days between the first and second language paper. So I don't want to miss the festival. I have planned to complete my revisions and go for a splash on the day of Holi with my friends. My parents have also given permission for a three to four-hour break," said  , a Class X student. 
 
 However, there are other parents who are in a dilemma as whether or not to allow children to play Holi during exam. "When everyone around will have fun and will be making merry, I know it will be difficult for the kids to concentrate on studies. But playing Holi means an entire day is lost and that can become very crucial during   time. I am unable to decide what to do," said  , mother of a Class XII student. Doctors, meanwhile, advised examinees to take precautions and not to use wet colours much during the festival. 
 
 "I would suggest examinees not to get wet. During Holi children tend to remain in wet clothes for a long time, which may cause them to catch cold, cough and fever. They must apply oil on their hair and cream on the body for easy removal of colours and stains, said Dr S P Padhy, a dermatologist at a private hospital here. He advised children with asthma and skin allergy problems to avoid playing Holi. "Any health issue during exam can lead to stress and may affect their careers. So it is always advisable to be safe," he added.
