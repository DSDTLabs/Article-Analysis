BHOPAL: Chief minister   on Monday took a dig at his Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal’s apology spree, advising him to make a list of people he needs to apologise to.

 Chouhan tweeted: “Arvindji, meri salah mane toh ek list bana lijiye, bari-bari se sabse maafi maangne mein asani hogi. Ya phir, ek maafinama taiyyar karwa lijiye: ‘To whosoever it may concern’. (Arvindji, take my advice and make a list, it will be easier for you to apologise to people one after another. Alternatively, get an apology affidavit prepared: ‘To whosoever it may concern’).”
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 The tweet at 3.30pm from @Chouhan   received 750 replies, 3,500 retweets and 10,000 likes by midnight. Chouhan hasn’t forgotten how Kejriwal hit out at him in Bhopal last year. Addressing a rally in the state capital in November, the Delhi CM had raised the Vyapam controversy and said: “Shivraj has sucked Madhya Pradesh like a mango.”
 
 State   spokesman Rahul Kothari took the CM’s cue and said: “It is hard to believe that Arvind Kejriwal’s heart has changed. This could be yet another political move. But while he is apologizing, he might as well say sorry to the people of this country and the media for his unfounded and false allegations.” AAP was quick to hit back. MP state convener of AAP, Alok Agarwal, said: “When will he (Chouhan) seek apology for destroying the lives of 8 crore residents of Madhya Pradesh? In Delhi, 8,000 new classrooms were built, but in MP thousands of schools have shut down. In Delhi, the power tariff is a third of MP. In Delhi, farmers get Rs 50,000 per hectare as compensation for crop damage but in MP it is only Rs 5,000. When will Shivraj apologise for all this?”
