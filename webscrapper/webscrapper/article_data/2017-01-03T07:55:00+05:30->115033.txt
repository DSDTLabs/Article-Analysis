GURGAON: The case related to   over the natural drain in   has reached the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). This, after chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar announced he would regularise the old encroachments over natural drains.

 In his complaint, Ravinder Yadav, a resident of Sikanderpur, said, “If encroachments are not removed from Sikanderpur Ghoshi, the   may face flash floods and traffic snarls during monsoons, just like the ‘Gurujam’ the city had to face in July 2016, due to waterlogging on NH-8.” 
 
 Sikanderpur Ghoshi hit the headlines after MCG, in September 2016, issued a notice and order to seal and demolish illegal structures that had sprung up over the drain. “But nothing was done on the ground to stop and demolish the constructions,” Yadav said in his complaint.
 
 Subsequently, in December 2016, CM Khattar, after hearing a complaint submitted by Yadav, announced the state government would formulate a new policy to deal with such cases. 
 
  “Blocking this drain can lead to a natural disaster in east  ,” said Yadav, adding the blocked drain would flood Mehrauli-Faridabad road and nearby areas. “I have been complaining about the encroachments for the last one year, but nothing has been done,” Yadav said, alleging the chief minister had been misguided on the matter.
