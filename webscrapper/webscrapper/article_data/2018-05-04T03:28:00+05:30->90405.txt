Panaji: Public works department (PWD) minister Ramkrishna Dhavalikar, on Thursday, said that the allegations against his brother Pandurang   by activists, that he is a beneficiary of the controversial Regional Plan 2021, are completely illogical.

 “My brother has also been named in the RP 2021 controversy. Our family has been involved in the real estate and construction business much before we entered politics.. We have been in the business and continue to be in it since 1979. No one has pointed fingers at us all this while. To keep the business going we have to purchase new plots, otherwise how will we run our business. The allegations make no sense,” he said.
 
  “We have never done anything illegally till date. We have gone as per the plan. There is not a single plot in my name. The plot in question is in my brother’s name. Someone wanted to drag politicians into it. My brother heads the party (MGP) so his name was dragged into it,” said Dhavalikar.
