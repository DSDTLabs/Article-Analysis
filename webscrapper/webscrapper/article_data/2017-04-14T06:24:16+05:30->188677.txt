AHMEDABAD: All the gau rakshaks (cow protectors) accused of killing  , a Muslim youth, are out of jail, with   high court granting regular bail to the eighth accused, Deepak Solanki, earlier this week.

 Solanki got bail after two of three eyewitnesses in the case could not identify him during a test identification parade before a magistrate. He also got bail on the grounds of parity, as seven co-accused in this case were granted bail by the HC last month.
 
 Last September, Mev died after gau rakshaks attacked him and   in the   area, when the duo were allegedly found transporting cattle. 
 
 After much public protest, police got into action and eight persons were arrested and charged.
 
 Before Solanki, another accused Vijay Bharwad had got bail on March 17. Both are accused of murder, attempt to murder, rioting and unlawful assembly. The HC granted them bail on condition of not leaving Gujarat without the court’s permission.
 
 There are six other accused persons in this case — Vipul Vyas, Alpesh Rabari, Dhaval Bhatt, Aniket Shah, Ritesh Prajapati and Vikram Bhati. They are accused of attempt to murder and rioting. The high court granted bail on March 9 on furnishing a bond of Rs 10,000. All six got bail on the grounds of parity.
