Nagpur: It was a perfect platform for ‘desi’ music fans to get the taste of ‘videshi’ tune. Expectedly, Saturday night was filled with neo soul and funk music as the young French singer-cum-songwriter Hyleen along with her two incredible musicians   and Nicolas Vicarro performed for the Nagpurians at Chitnavis Centre.

 The musical concert held as part of Bonjour India was facilitated by French embassy in New Delhi, department of culture, government of   and Alliance Francaise de Bhopal. Alliance Française de Bhopal is a non-profit organization which promotes Indo-French culture by imparting French courses and organizing cultural events. The four-month long cultural extravaganza ‘Bonjour India’ started in November 2017 and will end in February 2018 and is being held in several major cities of the country.
 
 Hyleen, the composer and guitarist hailing from Cannes in France, has done a debut album titled ‘U & I’ in 2014 and has released two EPs and is already creating ripples in the world of neo soul,   and funk music. With release of her new album, ‘B-side’ Hyleen shares her amazing talent and energy onstage alongside Nicolas Vicarro on drums and Julien Boursin on keys and Moog-bass.
 
 Her voice on ‘Looking at’ accompanied with evocative instrumentation stole the show. Her numbers ‘Dark knight’, ‘Can you love me’, ‘Breeze’ and a special song from her album ‘B-side’ kept the crowd entertained. Audience couldn’t help but tap their feet over the music.
 
 Apart from Hyleen’s energetic voice, the crowd were mesmerized by wholesome show by Boursin on keys and Vicarro on drums for special case in the song numbers. One special instrumental music case on melodica was given by Boursin.
