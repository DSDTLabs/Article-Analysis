 The incident reportedly occurred last year. In her complaint, the rape victim alleged that accused Rajinder lured and forcibly kidnapped her for solemnising marriage under duress. 
 
 She alleged that Prem and Balwan raped and physically assaulted her in a village this month. The DSP said that the women police station team was verifying the facts and action would follow.
