INDORE: With   rejecting primary probe report on the ragging complaint at  , Indore, college authorities and anti-ragging committee on Friday decided to transfer the complainant and five accused students to different colleges. 

 After the college sent primary probe report to   on Wednesday, the complainant once again contacted anti-ragging helpline and said that he wasn't satisfied with the enquiry. 
 
 "The college is trying to dismiss the matter to save its reputation," said the complainant. On Friday, the college conducted a fresh probe in the matter and once again found the case to be a matter of personal dispute. 
 
 The anti-ragging committee and college authorities then decided to transfer both parties to some other colleges in the state. 
 
 "We had resolved the dispute amongst the students on Wednesday but the complainant again lodged a complaint with UGC. This is a matter of personal dispute and fight and not ragging as all of them are classmates. To avoid such incidences in future, we have decided to transfer the complainant as well as the five accused to some other college," said Dr  , dean, College of Agriculture. 
 
 A BSc second year student of the college had lodged a complaint with UGC stating that he was mentally and physically tortured by his classmates and a few other senior students in college and hostel. In his complaint, he stated that his classmates used to regularly abuse him and beat him if he did not follow their orders. He also stated that he had complained to the college authorities about it but no action was taken.
 
 "The complainant on Wednesday agreed that no ragging happened and we had warned the complainant and the other students to not indulge in any sort of quarrels and brawls and lodge false complaints like this. But he complained again," said Swarnakar. 
 
 The father of the complainant has requested to get his son transferred to   in Sehore, his hometown.
