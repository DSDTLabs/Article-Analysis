The television premiere of the blockbuster   is all set to add to the festivities of the approaching festival Dussehra. Yes, you read that right. The   and   starrer is all set to be aired on the small screen on October 8 at 1 pm.
 
 As known to most Baahubali 2 aka Baahubali: The Conclusion had taken the box office by storm at the time of its release earlier this year and it is expected to do phenomenally well on the small screen as well. The record-breaking film comes as a perfect Dussehra gift for all and sundry. It's bound to send a wave of excitement in the viewers.
  
 To mark the occasion, Prabhas, Rana Daggubati and SS Rajamouli held a press conference. The movie's official Twitter handle gave us a window into what went down at the event.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 The question that's hovering on everyone's lips is that if there will be a third part to the Baahubali series. When Rana was asked about it once in the past he had answered in the affirmative.
  
 On the work front, Rana last in the Telugu film Nene Raju Nene Mantri and Prabhas, on the other hand, is busy shooting for his next big film Saaho, in which he will be seen opposite Shraddha Kapoor. The man who steered the Baahubali ship, SS Rajamouli, is all set to work with Mahesh Babu for his next project.
  
 Looks like it will be a long wait before we get to hear about Baahubali's third installment. For now, mark the date for the television premiere of Baahubali 2.
