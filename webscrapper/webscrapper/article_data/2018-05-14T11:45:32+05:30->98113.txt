MADURAI: The   CID of the   police arrested two more people in connection with the alleged misappropriation in the making of the Lord Murugan idol at Sri Dhandayuthapaniswamy temple in Palani. The 200kg idol was made in 2003-2004 to replace the idol of the presiding deity under the pretext that it had been damaged.

 The idol wing CID team, which started its third phase of investigation on Saturday, arrested former assistant commissioner of the temple Pugazhendi and verification officer Deivendran on Sunday night. Two months ago, the idol wing had arrested sculptor M Muthiah and former HR&CE (Hindu religious and charitable endowments department) joint commissioner K K Raja. 
 
 An expert team from IIT-Madras led by metallurgy department professor Murugaian Amirthalingam was helping the idol wing to check the composition of the controversial idol. All the idols made in the recent past were being checked by the expert team, officials said.
 
 The 200kg, idol which was installed in January 2004, was removed in five months. It has been kept in a strong room since then. 
 
 Police said there was a conspiracy behind replacing the old statue with the new one as the suspects wanted to sell the old one in international market.
