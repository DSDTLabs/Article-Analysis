NAGPUR: A day after TOI reported about BA first semester students being marked  , a student got immediate respite while another got a bigger shock on Tuesday.

 In the first case, a student was issued fresh   with 94/100 in one of the papers. In the second, the student was told that her answersheet has gone missing. 
 
 Director, Board of Examinations and Evaluation   had told TOI in the morning that it would take around a month’s time to issue fresh marklist. But, in the evening the BA student broke the news that she was called to the exam section and handed over the marklist. 
 
 Khaty couldn’t be reached on his mobile phone in the evening. 
 
 On April 11, TOI reported that several BA first semester students were marked absent in the winter exam and were asked to take re-exam a day before commencement of the summer exam. 
 
 The aggrieved BA students approached TOI complaining that they have been allegedly   by the Nagpur University. They were shocked to find that they have been marked absent in some papers after their result was declared on March 29. One of the students was marked absent in all the five BA subjects by the university.
