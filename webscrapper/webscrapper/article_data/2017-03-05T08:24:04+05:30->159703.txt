CHENNAI: If you ask senior   leader   to choose between 'corruption' and 'demonetisation', he may choose both. "  is a terrible idea," he said at a panel discussion on Saturday after the launch of his book, 'Fearless opposition: power and accountability'. "It's like demolishing a mountain to catch a rat," he continues. "But it was dead rat". 

 Chidambaram then moved on to corruption, "It's a tragedy that we reelected a corrupt government in Tamil Nadu. Voters should never reelect a corrupt leader. You may vote him once, but if you know that he is corrupt, never reelect him again. Our judiciary is slow, so it's in your hands. A corrupt politician should never be reelected," he said.
 
 Published by Rupa, the book brings together a selection of essays written by Chidambaram which were published in a national daily in 2016. "I don't want to say that there aren't any good people in today's Central government. There are. What is wrong is the one-man attitude of the government. It's dangerous," he said. "We don't know the name of our   secretary or chief   adviser today. The reason is that they are not allowed to speak out in open. The decision is taken by a single man. In Delhi, the buzz is that even the finance minister was not aware of the demonetisation plan," said Chidambaram.
 
 Hitting out at the Centre's idea of digital and cashless transaction, Chidambaram said, "We should never think that cashless transaction is cheap. It comes with a cost."
 
 Speaking on the influence of regional parties in today's political scenario, Chidambaram said regional parties are not good for nation-building. "Regional parties are good for the respective states, but it's not good for the development of a nation," he said. Asked what 'fearless' in the title of his book means, he said, 'We are living with fear. I used the world deliberately to avoid such fear and fight for a better tomorrow."
