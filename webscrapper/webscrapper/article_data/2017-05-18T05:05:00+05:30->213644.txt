Ghaziabad: The district administration barred the entry of Manveer Teotia, one of the leaders of  , into   on Wednesday. Teotia was allegedly fomenting unrest among farmers in Loni, whose land had been acquired by the state government in 2007-08 for a residential project of UP Housing & Development Board.

 District magistrate Ministhy S invoked Section 144 of the CrPC in Loni to prohibit any kind of unlawful assembly and to prevent Teotia from entering Ghazibad. The prohibitory orders were issued on the recommendations of a three-member panel formed by the state government earlier this year to resolve grievances of farmers from Mandola, Agrola and Nanul villages of Loni.
 
 The panel, headed by commissioner (Meerut Range) Dr Prabhat Kumar, includes Ghaziabad DM Ministhy S and SSP Hari Narayan Singh.
 
 The administration has invited aggrieved farmers for a dialogue on Thursday at the district collectorate. “Teotia had been planning to disrupt law and order by fuelling unrest among farmers over compensation issues. We got to know this through intelligence reports,” Loni sub-divisional magistrate Prem Ranjan Singh told TOI.
