MUMBAI: A day after senior cleric and sacked member of   Maulana Salman Nadvi said he would not push for an out-of-court settlement to the   dispute, another senior Islamic scholar and   chairman Dr Zafrul Islam Khanhas supported Nadvi’s views on an out-of-court settlement, and on shifting of the mosque away from the disputed site in Ayodhya. He, too, is in the eye of the storm since a few Urdu news portals carried his opinion on Saturday.

 
 Delhi-based Khan, who is a former president of  , an umbrella body of over 40 Muslim organisations, in a piece he penned on Saturday, backs Nadvi for making efforts to end the dispute but disagrees that Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravishankar could have convinced Hindu organisations to accept the formula. “Maulana Salman Nadvi’s suggestion is logical but who will listen to Sri Sri Ravishankar? Involve the government, the SC or the RSS and take parties on board,” he said. Defending Nadvi, he said he has known him for the last three decades as a learned person. “I have differed with him but never doubted his integrity,” he said. “Maulana Nadvi capitulated to pressure but I will not,” he added.
 
 When told that   has repeatedly reiterated its stand that Muslims would wait for the SC verdict and ‘once a mosque always a mosque’, Khan, an alumnus of the Cairo-based famous Islamic seminary Al-Azhar explained: “There is no textual (Quran or Hadith, the Prophet’s traditions) to support this claim.”
