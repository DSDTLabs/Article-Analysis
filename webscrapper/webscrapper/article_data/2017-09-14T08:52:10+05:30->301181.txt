PATIALA: Miffed with the state government’s decision to  , Punjab truck operators have decided to oppose the move. Calling it ‘anti-trade’ and ‘anti-people’, the truckers said measures being taken by the government would destroy the state transporters.

  Union president   alleged that the government was bent upon destroying livelihoods of the truck operators and was taking several decisions to this effect. He said the truckers pay road tax on a quarterly basis and with a 50% increase, they would now have to shell out Rs 2,375 for a six-tyre truck, Rs 3,750 for a 10-tyre truck and Rs 5,500 for a 12-tyre vehicle.
 
 Sandhu said the hike would severely affect their business. He also questioned the rationale behind increasing taxes for truckers when buses and other modes of transport were not included in the tax hike. He said Punjab was already having a higher tax rate as compared to the other states.
 
 The president said if the situation persists, people would start hiring trucks from other states as it would work out cheaper.
 
 Sandhu said a delegation of truckers would soon meet the Punjab principal secretary for transport to apprise him of the situation and seek relief. He said they would also take up the issue of pending dues pertaining to transportation charges for the wheat season as more than Rs 150 crore was to be released by the state government.
