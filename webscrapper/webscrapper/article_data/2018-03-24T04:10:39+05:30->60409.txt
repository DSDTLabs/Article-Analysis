NEW DELHI: Chief election commissioner O P Rawat on Friday denied any concerns regarding the Election Commission’s social media outreach through  , currently under lens for allegedly sharing users’ data with British firm   (CA), saying that no data whatsoever was shared by   with Facebook. 

 
 “From our informal enquiries with the officials concerned, we have learnt that there is no linkage of any voter data, including age profile, with Facebook. There is no sharing of information by EC and hence no concern regarding compromising of data,” he said. The statement is seen as a hint that there may not be any immediate need to review EC’s tie-up with Facebook. 
 
 “Facebook is only using the information that is voluntarily offered by the voter,” added Rawat. However, he said it was indeed a concern that a social media like Facebook can exert influence on the voter by giving agencies like Cambridge Analytica access to its user data. 
 
 “But as far as the current concerns over mining of Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica, the EC does not come into the picture at all. It is for ministry of electronics and information technology to probe and tackle the issue,” said Rawat.
