MUMBAI: The railways plans to have clean-up marshals on the lines of the   to curb littering and spitting at railway stations. According to rules, only stationmasters and ticket checkers can levy fines for such behaviour. 

 The plan is remarkable as even the   (RPF) doesn't have the powers to act against those who dirty railway premises. It comes a day after a nationwide cleanliness survey of railway stations revealed that Mumbai's major stations, including CST, Dadar and  , have slipped down the previous year's rankings.
 
 “We have submitted a letter to the railway board to make changes in the law so that outsourced personnel can fine offenders,“ said  's divisional railway manager (DRM), Ravinder Goyal.
 
 The public seems to have welcomed the move. A commuter said stationmasters are busy with train operations, while ticket checkers are occupied with keeping an eye on unauthorised passengers.
 
 “I have never seen anyone being fined for spitting or littering on platforms,“ said Khargar resident  . “Outsourcing personnel to curb the menace will act as a huge deterrent.“
 
 A stationmaster said, “Mumbai's suburban system is extremely busy. The footfall at the busiest stations is thousands of commuters every hour. As station masters, our job is to ensure the smooth running of trains. It is good if a system of clean-up marshals is put in place.“
