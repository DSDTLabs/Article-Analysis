PUNE: Churches in the city are gearing up for  , the day commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. It is a day of prayer, reflection and fasting for the Christian community around the world.

 Fr Malcolm  , vicar general, Diocese of Poona, said priests will wear red vestments during the church services as a remembrance of the blood shed by Christ during his torture and death on the cross. “The passion service held in the evenings at different churches relives the crucifixion. What follows is the unveiling and veneration of the cross and the communion service, after which everyone departs in silence,” he said.
 
 “The day commemorates Christ’s great sacrifice for every human being in the universe. We must remember that Christ died for all humanity, not just for Christians,” Sequeira said.
 
 A blood donation camp will be held at the St Patrick’s Cathedral on Good Friday. Last year, around 120 people donated blood at the camp. A similar camp was also held on Sunday at the Divine Mercy Church in Vadgaonsheri.
 
 Fr Samuel Pillai, assistant priest at the All Saints Church, Khadki, said a three-hour service will be held at the church on Friday. “Everyone will dress in either black or white during the prayer service,” he said.
 
 On Thursday, Fr  , parish priest of the St Patrick’s Cathedral and state coordinator of the Prison Ministry, India, will lead a small team to symbolically wash the feet of prisoners at the open jail at Yerawada. Christ had washed the feet of his disciples a day before his crucifixion.
