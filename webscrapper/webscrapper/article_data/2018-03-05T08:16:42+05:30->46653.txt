MADURAI: Two notorious rowdies - 'Saguni' Karthick and   - who were shot dead on the city outskirts on Thursday had a pistol in their possession. Police officials said that they were shot dead when they tried to fire at the police team which tried to arrest them. 

 Just 10 days back, two men from Watrap in   district were arrested by the Madurai city police for possessing two unlicensed country-made revolvers. 
 
 There have been many incidents of guns seizures in the past few years in Madurai. 
 
 Most of the guns seized were country-made revolvers and pistols. However, the one seized from the Karthick and Irulandi was a polished weapon. Investigation is still underway to ascertain the supplier or source. 
 
 The gun seizures might indicate the prevalence of a gun culture among rowdy and anti-socials elements in Madurai.
 
  However, it not confined to Madurai, say police officers. It may be noted that Chennai police busted a gang and seized seven guns in Chennai and Trichy. Many including a police constable were arrested for trying to sell them a month back. 
 
 A police officer seeking anonymity said that most of the guns procured are from other states like  . They were disbursed through brokers in various places. On a few occasions, the guns seized by them originated from Kerala. Guns are bought at anywhere between 40,000 and 1.5 lakh depending on the quality and type, he said. 
 
 Even though there has been multiple gun seizures, not many shooting incidents have taken place in Madurai and southern districts. However, in an incident in October, 2016, Karuppasamy, 25, from Kovilpatti was shot dead at point-blank range in a government bus. The accused, identified as   from Kovilpatti, who was later was arrested, murdered him to take revenge for his son's murder.
