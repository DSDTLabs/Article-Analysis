BHUBANESWAR: To tackle the Maoist menace in the state, the state police have decided to go for redeployment of security forces engaged in Maoist-hit areas. 

 Director general of police Rajendra Prasad   on Sunday said as part of the police's goal in 2018, there would be strategic redeployment of forces in some areas to deal with the changing dynamics of ultra violence, especially in   and Malkangiri districts. 
 
 The cut-off area in Malkangiri is still reporting major Maoist violence, mostly killing of civilians, whom rebels brand as police informers. "This will require strategic deployment of security forces," Sharma told TOI. 
 
 Without divulging the details about the plan to thwart the extremists' activities, Sharma said bringing the non-cadres, who are being used in different roles by ultras, to the mainstream will also be one of the priority areas. "The Gurupriya bridge will be ready soon and this will be a major boost for movement of the security forces and a key catalyst of development," he added. 
 
 He said there will be two-pronged approach to tackle the menace. One will be the strategic deployment for deterrence and offensive action and another development of the cut-off area, he said.
 
 Official figures show 14 civilians and nine security personnel were killed in Maoist violence in 2017 (till November 15) in the state. There were total 47 incidents of Maoist violence in the state. In 2016, the state had witnessed 68 incidents of violence committed by the guerillas. 
 
 The top police officer said   district, which borders  , has not witnessed Red violence in 2017. "More or less, the influence of rebels is getting shrunk in terms of areas. We are keeping a watch on their movements and strategies," he added.
