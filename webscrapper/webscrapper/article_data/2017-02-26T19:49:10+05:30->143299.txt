Little do people know about actress  's poetry skills. The actress, who is producing her husband  's   with Krishna and   in the lead, has penned a song for the film. 'She co-wrote the film with me and has also penned a song. She's very good at Tamil poetry and keeps writing now and then. We needed a song for an important sequence and she wrote a beautiful song for the film,' says Feroz. 

 The film revolves around a boy, who has been abandoned by society right from the childhood. 'He grows up in a violent atmosphere. The only way to get something, for him, is through getting into fights. How he gets into an underground betting gang that puts him in difficult situation and how he comes out of it and realises his mistakes forms the crux. When I wrote the script, I was sure that only Krishna could pull it off. You can mould him the way you want to. He's also hardworking and dedicated. The film involves several risky stunt sequences. We shot those scenes with Krishna without a body double. In the process of filming, he got hurt several times," says Feroz, adding, 'One of the fights takes place in a theatre. We shot this for around 15 days. This will be one of he highlights of the film.'
