BHOPAL: Senior   leader and parliamentarian   up a political controversy after a video grab allegedly showing him requesting a group of government teachers in Ashoknagar to help create an atmosphere in the favour of BJP government went viral on social media.

 Thereafter,   approached the   with a complaint alleging misuse of government machinery ahead of bypolls in Mungaoli and Kolaras. Jha’s statement came a day after his visit to Ashoknagar district in view of upcoming bypoll in Mungaoli.
 
 The BJP leader held a meeting with teachers in Ashoknagar and was seen in the video urging them to help BJP government by creating a favourable atmosphere for the party. “I have said less, but you should understand more. You are all intellectuals...you can create an atmosphere all over...in  , in Piprai and in Mungaoli...besides, other areas like Malhargarh and Bahadurgarh. If one teacher decides, he can develop a perception at several places and that too sensibly...so I am requesting you,” shows the video grab.
 
 As the video went viral, Opposition political parties made a scathing attack on Jha alleging misuse of government machinery and threatening government teachers ahead of bypolls. However, clarifying his stand immediately after the video raked up a controversy, Jha said he had only urged teachers to help the government.
 
 “There is nothing wrong in it. I went to Ashoknagar and was invited by teachers. There I urged them to work with full enthusiasm and support the government initiatives. At present, bypoll has not been announced by the EC, and the opposition is making unnecessary hue and cry", said Jha
