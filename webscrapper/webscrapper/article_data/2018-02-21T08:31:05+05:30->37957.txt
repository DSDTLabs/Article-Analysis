 The same day, 400km to the west of Chhindwara, a 26-year-old was tying the knot at Bhadwahi village in Shahdol when police dropped in. There was no escape. “We had received a complaint from a 17-year-old girl, a distant relative of the groom, that he had taken her to a kin’s house last week and raped her after promising marriage. But he left her there and returned home as his marriage was fixed with some other girl,” Jaitwar police station incharge Sanjeev Uike told TOI.
 
 Police are looking for Rakesh. “Since the survivor approached Chhindwara Kotwali police station, a case was registered on zero FIR and the diary is being transferred to us,” said Chaurai police station in-charge, Raghunath Khatarkar.
