LUCKNOW:   patriach   may not be the party national president, but he will lead the  , with a new poster showing   offering his father to take the poll mantle.

 In the poster, Akhilesh is seen as promising his father with folded hands “Aap ki cycle sada chalegi aap ke naam se. Phir pradesh ka dil jitenge hum milkar apne kam se.“
 
 (Your cycle will always be with you. We will together win the heart of the people with our work).“ Mulayam's photograph is much bigger than that of Akhilesh in the poster.
 
 The move is being seen as an attempt by Akhilesh to send out the message that he hasn't shown any disrespect to his father.
 
 The father and the son had been locked in a bitter battle for control over the party and its symbol for the past four months. But Monday's EC verdict settled the dispute in Akhilesh's favour.
 
 It has been decided that the poster will be used extensively during the campaign, and senior leaders have been told to ensure that Mulayam's photographs should appear prominently during electioneering, sources told TOI on Wednesday .
