PUNE: Maharashtra   would take suo motu punitive action against unauthorised constructions and developers on the basis of source information received from its help desk to be made available on the website. 

 “For the non-registered ongoing projects and unauthorised buildings, the MahaRERA would take suo motu punitive action on the basis of source information,” Real Estate Regulation and Development Authority (RERA) interim regulator   told TOI.
 
 Consumer bodies are relieved by the move as it would ensure necessary relief to those who had raised queries on what action would be initiated against unauthorized structures that have not got completion certificate. The action would, however, be initiated after July 30— the deadline for the builders to register their projects under RERA.
 
 With the website already having a help desk facility for citizens to raise their issues, activist Vijay Kumbhar said it would be help initiate action on unauthorized structures. “If I can complain about such structures and RERA authority would take cognizance, it would benefit citizens who are left high and dry and keep running to consumer courts,” he said.
 
  representative Vijay Sagar said if such a facility was provided through RERA, it would encourage citizens to report about unauthorised structures. “The structures that have not got completion certificates will come under RERA. It would benefit the citizens.”
 
  president   said, “Complaints through help desk will definitely help the consumers and the developers. The fly-by-night operators will face action if anybody reports about non-registration or unauthorised structure,’’he said.
