Salem: After a request from farmers near ‘Panamarathupatty’ lake, Salem district collector visited the   and ordered the officials to evict encroachments and assured to restore it to allow water to reach the lake.

 The lake, which is spread across 2137.92 acres, does not receive water due to construction of as many as 40 check dams by the government department including Tamil Nadu Water and Drainages (TWAD), agriculture engineering department and forest department in the last few years. 
 
 “Due to check dams, the lake has not received water in the last few years,” said the collector, Rohini R Bhajibhakare. She asked the Salem municipal corporation (SMC) and public works department officials to identify the canals that reach the lake and ordered them to desilt them as the rainy season is round the corner to allow water to reach the lake.
 
 As the catchment areas Varattaru, Koottaru and Jarugu malai hills are expected to receive good rainfall, the administration is planning to store water across 834.5 acres of the lake. “The Panamarathupatty area receives average rainfall of 735 mm per year and we will store enough water in the lake,” Rohini said. The collector added the administration is planning to make the lake as a ‘herbal’ plant zone to attract tourists. 
 
 Following this, she visited an iron shutter of a canal, which was built in 1911 near Periyur village in Kuralnatham panchayat, and ordered the officials to repair it immediately.
