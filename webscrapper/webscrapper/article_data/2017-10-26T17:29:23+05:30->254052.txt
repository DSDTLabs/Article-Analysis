GURUGRAM: The city has been put on   in the wake of   on   pilgrims in   district of  , deputy commissioner of Gurgaon Vinay Pratap Singh told TOI. The terror attacks sparked fears of communal tension across the country. As many as 2,000 devotees from Gurgaon also went to pay obeisance to the Hindu shrine that rests above 4,000 meters in mountains.

 Singh had assessed the situation across the city, and so far found “no sign of trouble”. This step comes after Delhi police issued a high alert in the capital and advised security cover to the kanwar yatra. Gujarat also sounded high alert after it was revealed that all killed in the attack belonged to Valsad district of the state.
 
 “We have sounded an alert, but so far as I have analysed the situation. I don’t foresee any trouble here,” Singh told TOI, adding that police would be on alert and swing into action if any untoward incident happens.
 
 Singh also received a memorandum by more than half a dozen members from different right wing groups, including RSS, Shiv Sena, Bajrang Dal, Hindu Kranti Dal and Vishwa Hindu Parishad, who gathered outside his office and protested the terror attacks. The memorandum addressed to the President demanded compensation for families of slain pilgrims.
 
 “The family of Farooq Ahmed Dar who was used as a human shield in Kashmir was offered Rs 10 lakh by human rights commission. We want no less than Rs 1 crore as ex-gratia for the families of slain pilgrims. We are not resorting to any violence,” Kulbushan Bhardwaj, who led the representation, told TOI. The demonstrators also called for dissolution of the State Human Rights Commission of Jammu and Kashmir for awarding compensatory money to the family of Dar.
 
 Bhardwaj also said the BJP government must come out in strong condemnation against the terror attack.
