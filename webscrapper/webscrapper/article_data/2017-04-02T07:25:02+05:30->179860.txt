PATNA: The Bihar government has formed a committee to study the fee structures of   institutions, especially schools, and suggest ways and means to rationalise them.
 
  The education department’s move follows a   order of March 17, asking the government to evolve a regulatory mechanism for the purpose.
  
  Hearing a petition filed by one Sanjeev Kumar, a division bench of   and Justice Sudhir Singh has given six weeks’ time to the state education department to submit a report on what the state government proposes for the regulation of fee structure in private schools.
  
  The eight-member team, headed by additional secretary (education)  , has been asked by the department to submit its report to the government on April 20.
  
  Sources said the committee would invite suggestions from different stakeholders, including private institute heads and parents of students, and incorporate them in its report. “In certain states, the government regulates fee hike in private schools. There are also caps on the fees. We will explore the possibility of developing such a mechanism for our state,” a committee member told TOI on Saturday.
  
  The Haryana School Education Rules 2003 as amended in 2007, for instance, prescribes that schools cannot up the fees by more than 10%.
  
  School-going children’s parents in Patna welcomed the HC’s intervention. They also pleaded for government vigil on the schools “extorting money” in the name of development, computerisation etc.
  
  “There are schools which charge fresh admission and registration fees even when a primary section child is promoted to the secondary section of the same school. Quite a few   their students to purchase shoes of a particular brand and uniform from a particular store, which are costlier,” rued a parent.
