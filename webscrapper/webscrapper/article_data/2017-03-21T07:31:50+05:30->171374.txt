KOCHI: The local leaders and activists of the  , who are accused of engaging in   at the   here on International Womenâ€™s Day, have approached the high court seeking bails. They are accused of attacking couples who had arrived to spend time together at the popular hangout.

 It was around 4.30pm on March 8 that the local leaders of Shiv Sena and its activists took out a march along the Marine Drive walkway carrying a banner and attacked couples sitting on the benches, using canes. The mob was allegedly led by Shiv Sena Ernakulam district president T R Devan
 
 Police had later registered a case with regard to the attacks by including offences such as unlawful assembly, rioting, assault on a public servant to prevent him from discharging duty, attempt to commit culpable homicide, sexual harassment, and criminal intimidation. Devan and seven others were arrested by police and they have been in judicial custody from March 8, with a three-day police custody in between.
 
 In the petition seeking bails, the Shiv Sena leaders and activists pleaded innocence and said that they have been implicated in the case due to political reasons. Police have added the offence of attempt to commit culpable homicide in the case to deny them bail, they have contended.
 
 Refuting the allegation of moral policing, the Shiv Sena activists have claimed in the petition that the protest march at Marine Drive was against exploitation of women and girls but a section of media made it into a breaking news of moral policing so as to take the focus away from a case of rape involving a priest.
