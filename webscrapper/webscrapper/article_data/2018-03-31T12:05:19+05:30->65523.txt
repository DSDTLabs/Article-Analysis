VADODARA/ ANAND: The   Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation ( ) on Friday said that one of its member union in Gandhinagar has stopped procurement of milk from parts of   following quality issues. 

 GCMMF – the apex marketing body of all the dairy unions of Gujarat – said this a day after it received a representation from a group claiming to be farmers from Rajasthan who had reached milk city Anand demanding that Amul resume procuring milk from them. 
 
 The group which had first reached   premises and later at GCMMF headquarters had claimed that Amul has stopped procuring milk from farmers of Banswada, Udaipur and   districts since last one month. 
 
 GCMMF’s managing director R S Sodhi however told TOI that the Gandhinagar District Co-operative Milk Producers Union Limited popularly known as   had stopped the procurement after noticing adulteration in the milk. 
 
 “Our member union – Madhur Dairy – has stopped procuring milk after noticing quality issues. Also, the group which has made the representation is not that of farmers but traders who were not procuring milk through Amul pattern but want to sell their milk to Amul because of the higher prices that co-operatives give to farmers,” he said. 
 
 According to GCMMF officials, Madhur Dairy has stopped procuring 40,000 to 50,000 litres milk per day in Dungarpur area after it came to its notice that traders had formed their own system to procure milk from farmers which was later supplied to Madhur Dairy. 
 
 “We have already told them that there is no question of any middlemen as through Amul pattern we procure milk directly from farmers and not through traders,” said Sodhi. 
 
 The group had claimed that it had already invested heavily by setting up bulk milk coolers. 
 
 On Friday, when a group of three representatives again reached GCMMF headquarters, they were asked to approach Madhur Dairy officials.
