MARGAO: Agriculture minister   on Sunday assured that the government would intervene if the prices of coconuts did not decline by February 1.

 “I have informed the department to source the coconuts from every grower and sell it at the horticulture outlets if the price does not decrease by February 1,” said the minister. 
 
 Sardesai further hinted of providing subsidies in the forthcoming state   so as to provide an incentive to Goan farmers to cultivate barren agricultural lands that are lying fallow throughout the state, by forming farmers clubs and undertaking community farming. 
 
 The agriculture minister informed that a group of women self-help groups (SHGs) had conducted community farming on an experimental basis in Agalli-Borda, Margao and had later sought barbed wire fencing from him. 
 
 “Since this project was successful, the government will declare a new agriculture scheme to incentivise community farming that will revitalise the uncultivated land.The scheme will provide for subsidies for constructing a well, solar pump, drip and sprinkler irrigation system, fencing, ploughing, etc, for a minimum of one hectare land,” said Sardesai.
