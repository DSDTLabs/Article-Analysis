NEW DELHI: The   turned down the plea of a group of lawyers asking it to deliver its verdict on   or bull racing before the harvest festival of Pongal on Saturday.

 A bench of Justices Dipak Misra and R Banumathi said it was “unfair“ on the part of advocates to ask for a judgment in two days. The court said it was not possible to deliver the verdict by Saturday.
 
 The apex court has reserved its verdict on a batch of petitions challenging the Centre's notification allowing the sport. The court had stayed the operation of the notification, saying that its 2014 verdict banning the use of animals could not be frustrated. It had also dismissed the review petition against its verdict.
 
 The court had declared   Regulation of Jallikattu Act, 2009 as constitutionally void, being violative of Article 254(1) of the Constitution. On January 8 last year, the Centre had issued a notification lifting the ban on Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu with certain restrictions, which was challenged in the   by Animal Welfare Board of India, People for Ethical Treatment of Animals India and others.
