Film, television and theatre actor and singer   of 'Wake Up Sid' and ' ' was in town for a musical performance recently. An occasional visitor to the city, Das was upbeat about this visit to Lucknow. "I started my musical journey from the same platform two years ago," said Namit, adding, "Log humse kehte thay humne aapko dekha hai par suna nahi hai. Yahan (in Lucknow) par logon ne mujhe sirf suna hi nahi, balki saraha bhi hai. Today, it’s a kind of revival of that musical journey which started two years ago. I am always happy to perform here in Lucknow as I have a very close connection with the city because of its music, food, shabdon ki wajah se, bhaasha ki wajah se. Yahan ki jo softness hai woh kahin na kahin mein apnana chahta hoon. Isiliye shayad mujhe Lucknow baar-baar bulata rehta hai aur main aata bhi rehta hoon."
Talking about the audience of the city, Namit said, "Yahan ki audience bahut hi zabardast sunkaar hai. Aur jab main keh raha hoon ki sunkaar, toh matlab jo sacchi mein sunte hain. Aapko aise log kam milenge. Aisi audience aapko Mumbai ya aur jagah kam milegi. Baaki jagah log aapki music par nachna chahte hain. But here, people really listen to you and this increases our responsibility to perform our best."
 Namit portrayed Ranbir Kapoor’s best friend in 'Wake Up Sid', and has also been part of many films. He’s also played the lead in the sitcom ' '. "I am an actor by chance. I had initially trained to be a singer. While studying in college, music was not on my mind, where the theatre scene was vibrant. I thought that acting was the best way to express yourself. But today, my first love is music. It’s not that I will not act but I will be doing it along with my musical journey," said Namit, adding, "It’s not about singing any particular genre, I sing the songs which touch my soul rather than singing anything and everything. You have to feel the song first only then can you give a soulful performance."
