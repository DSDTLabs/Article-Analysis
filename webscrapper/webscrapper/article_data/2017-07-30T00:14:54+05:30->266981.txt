Jodhpur: Senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Saturday said here that the only solution of the trouble between India and Pakistan is splitting Pakistan into four parts. He said that this division of Pakistan is the only way out to rectify this rogue nation.

 “Pakistan will never rectify. Better it is split into four parts like Baluchistan, Pakhtunistan, Sindh and West Panjab. This is the only solution to the problem with Pakistan,” said Swami.
 
 Swami was talking to the media persons in Jodhpur at the Jodhpur Civil Airport. He had come to Jodhpur to address the audience on Reality Check of Modi means Business.
 
 Referring to stepping down of Nawaz Sharif as Prime Minister of Pakistan, Swami said that the bilateral relation between India and Pakistan will worsen now.
 
 “Sharif was a henpecked Prime Minister and was nothing but a tool for the army and jihadis there. Pakistan and its army has always wanted a prime minster with a jihadi leaning and Sharif never met their expectations,” Swami said.
 
 Talking about the emerging tension with China over the verbal spate on border, Swami said that India needs to harmonise its relation with China.
 
 Back to the politics, when asked about the Congress MLAs from Gujrat being herded to Karnataka by the Congress, after its three MLAs defected to BJP, Swami ascribed them as cattle and that is why they are being caged.
 
 “They are cattle and need fodder, which is available with the BJP,” he said while claiming that all of them will hence embrace the BJP to gobble up this fodder.
