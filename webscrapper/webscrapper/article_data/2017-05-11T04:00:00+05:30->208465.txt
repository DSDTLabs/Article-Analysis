Mumbai: As a forecast for normal monsoon boosted investor sentiment, both the   and   rallied to new all-time highs on Wednesday. The sensex jumped 1%, or 315 points, to close at 30,248, while the Nifty, too, closed 1% (90 points) higher at 9,407. Weakness in crude oil prices globally, which will help keep domestic inflation in check, and a good set of quarterly numbers from leading companies also helped the rally, market players said. 

 The day’s gains — led by index heavyweights like HDFC,   and   — added about Rs 1.1 lakh crore to investors’ wealth, with the BSE’s market cap now at Rs 126.3 lakh crore, which is also an all-time high level. 
 
 According to Pankaj Pandey, head of research, ICICI Direct, Wednesday’s rally was on the back of a favourable set of developments such as normal monsoon, benign crude levels as well as decent set of quarterly earnings announced so far. 
 
 “Indian economy is on a strong footing with relatively strong macroeconomic fundamentals, lower inflation/interest rate regime, possibility of a major reform such as GST and a favourable demography supporting sustainable growth. We believe that earning growth from here on would be the key factor driving the markets,” Pandey said. 
 
 “With enabling fundamental factors such as stabilised commodity base, upbeat consumption and most importantly, a lower base, the earnings from here on could witness a strong double-digit growth recovery (this fiscal) and thus keep the market sentiments buoyant,” Pandey added.
