GHAZIABAD:   ( ) has set the ball rolling for the delimitation of 20 new wards in the district, mayor Ashu   told councillors on Friday. Verma said the deadline for submission of the blueprint of the delimitation project to the district administration was April 12, 2017.

 According to GMC officials, a new ward will be created at a population segment of every 16,500 people across the district, with a negotiable margin of 15-20%. “We are making sure that no main road runs through the land chosen to create a ward, dividing it into two parts,” said D K Sinha, nodal officer of the project, GMC.
 
 “We will also take care that no big sewer line or railway line cuts across the ward dividing it geographically,” Sinha said.
 
 At the moment, there are 80 wards in Ghaziabad, and this number will go up to 100 after the formation of the 20 newly conceptualised wards.
 
 The agency is in the process of drawing up appropriate locations for the construction of wards all over the district. Senior officials are to begin talks through video conferencing from Saturday.
 
 “Ghaziabad is a very fast-growing city and it doesn't expand like any other place. Post-2011, the city has seen an unparalleled level of migration from Delhi and other neighbouring states. Places like Vaishali, Crossings Republik and Indirapuram have witnessed a greater boom post-2011,” Verma said.
 
 According to the 2011 census, the population of Ghaziabad was put at 16,48,000. However, over the years, there has been an exponential growth in the population. “We have received the administration's guidelines to create 20 new wards in Ghaziabad district. According to the acceptable standard, if the population of a city falls between 16 lakh and 18 lakh, 100 wards are to be created,” Verma said.
 
 If the population exceeds 18 lakh, the number of wards increases to 120. “But since the population of Ghaziabad according to the last census in 2011 is below 18 lakh, we are bound by the 100-mark,” Verma said.
