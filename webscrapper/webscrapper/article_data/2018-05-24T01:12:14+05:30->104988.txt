 My father is the seniormost politician and his experience will definitely be utilised. But I want to make it clear to all that he will not micro-manage administration. I am the CM and I will hold the reins. With regard to my father’s meeting with the chief secretary and police chiefs, it was a courtesy call by the latter. My father’s advice will be appreciated; I reiterate that he will not interfere. I have lived with the people and I too know their pulse, I am the people’s chief minister.

Moreover, I have learnt from the mistakes of the past.
 
 
 
 My commitment to the farming community stays the same and I am only seeking more time as I have to take our coalition partner into confidence.
