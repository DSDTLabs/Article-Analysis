CHENNAI: Food minister R   said some people while using mobile app to apply for smart cards used pictures of actors and this led to mismatch in some cards. He ruled out any human error in the mismatch of photos. 

 In many cases, pictures of actors and others have appeared on smart cards. The minister said so far 1.88 crore smart cards have been distributed to households in the state and 2.02 lakh cards alone are yet to be printed. “Printing and distribution of smart cards have been smooth and it is not possible to attach housewife photo as the rules under   permits only the photo of head of householder,” said Kamaraj in reply to Congress Colachel MLA J G Prince. 
 
 Prince alleged that there has been discrepancies in assessing of households. “Some middle class households have been classified under below poverty line category and vice-versa and pictures have been mismatched in many smart cards,” said Prince. 
 
 “We gave the option for householders to apply for smart cards through mobile aap. Some of them instead of uploading their own photos uploaded pictures of actors and others. We have devised a method to prevent such mismatch after some cards had different photos,” said Kamaraj. He said very soon all smart cards will be printed and distributed.
