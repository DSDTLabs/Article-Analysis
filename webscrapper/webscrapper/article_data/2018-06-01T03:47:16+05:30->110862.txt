MUMBAI: To protect the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, the city’s green lung, from  , the   had, in 1997, fixed the boundary of the park. But more than two decades later, a wall has been built along only 43 km of the approximately 157 km boundary. If one takes into account the private walls (9.5 kms) and natural boundary (19 kms),   authorities are yet to construct wall along 83 kms of the boundary—and worse 33 kms of it is disputed.

 
  
  
 Now, the SGNP has sought Rs 108 crore from the state government to complete the  . “Recently, Vikas Kharage, secretary, forests (revenue and forest department) questioned park officials why the wall was being constructed in a piece meal fashion. He directed the conservator of forests to send an estimate to complete the entire wall,” said forest officials.
 
 “Till date we’ve received approximately Rs 37 crore of which the public works department is yet to spend Rs 11 crore,” said officials. SGNP chief conservator of forests Ahmed Anwar blamed the slow pace of work on the numerous boundary disputes and encroachments. “Each time a section of the wall has to be constructed the area has to be surveyed and demarcated. Private landowners have been dragging the SGNP to court disputing the boundary... Also at Malad there is huge encroachment and it is a politically sensitive issue,” said officials.
 
 In 1991, 61,000 slum-dwellers had encroached on forest land. Following a HC order, around 58,649 living on forest land post-1995 were removed and 331 acres of forest land was freed. 
 
 Officials also blamed the PWD for delaying the survey work and demarcation for the boundary wall. “We have asked them why Rs 11 crore has remained unspent given the fact that the government has been releasing Rs 1 crore every year. They complained about access to sites it being a forest area and we are now coordinating on expediting the work,” said officials.
