PANAJI: The   ( ) has received 40 applications to open new   starting June, few of which would see light. 

 Director of education GP Bhat said that feasibility reports for these have already been prepared and   will decide on the status of these applications at a meeting in the last week of April.
 
 However, official sources said that none of these 40 applicants were likely to be allowed to open new primary schools. 
 
 Education officials fear that the enrolment at government primary schools would suffer if new aided institutes are allowed to open primary schools nearby. Around 347 government primary schools are on the verge of closure across Goa for want of enrolment.
 
 Goa has one primary school serving in a radius of four kilometres or less. During the medium of instruction ( ) issue, the state government had relaxed the distance criteria for Konkani and Marathi schools, which increased the density of primary schools further in some areas.
 
 “We have received applications to open 13 Konkani medium, 14 Marathi medium, 7 English medium and six Urdu medium primary schools so far,” director of education told TOI.
 
 Since 2012, 70 new government aided primary schools have been given permission to begin operations by the state government and most of them were allowed to open as they offered education in Konkani or Marathi mediums.
 
 Additionally, five schools that received permission to open last year — two in Colvale, one in Camurlim, one in Sakhali and one in Sal — could not begin operations as the permission came too late. 
 
 These five schools are expected to begin functioning from the academic year 2017-18.
