KOLKATA: An investigation into some companies linked to NCP leader   has led the   to a Kolkata-based shell company on  , which is allegedly being used by a top   leader to park his money.

 While the probe is on to join the various dots, indicating the flow of alleged illegal money from Kolkata to Mumbai and vice-versa through a complex maze, central agencies have stumbled upon a big realtor from Kolkata, apparently close to the leader under scanner.
 
 A shell company is a fictitious firm, which exists only on paper -without any physical presence--and is used to launder money.
 
 The money trail and the list of directors at the Upper Wood Street company led the ED officers to another firm at Baguiati, where money was pumped in. One of the directors of this Baguiati company was found to be a co-director of a big realty firm in Kolkata. It was this real estate firm which was being used to launder money by the Trinamool leader, officers said. “We started with a single company in Kolkata, but it led us to a labyrinth. We are analyzing the data and may need to search the linked companies,“ said an ED officer from Mumbai.
 
 The whole search operation began with the income tax department earlier this year submitting a report to the Union finance ministry, listing at least 17,000 shell companies operating out of Kolkata over the past six years. Based on the specific input from the income tax department, ED officers zeroed in on over 1,000 fictitious firms located across the country, including more than 90 companies in Kolkata; the one linked with Bhujbal was among them.
 
 Scanning the balance sheet and statutory filings by  , a real estate firm owned by Bhujbal's son Pankaj and nephew Samir, an ED team from Mumbai came across a host of firms, the shares of which were sold at a huge premium.Pravesh Constructions allotted shares to the Kolkata-based company under radar.
