CHENNAI: In less than a day, O   has gone from being a compliant deputy to a man who’s seized the moment. There may still be questions about who is pulling the strings this time, but there’s no doubt that the caretaker chief minister has 
  of sorts.

 On Tuesday night, an hour after his outburst, around 300 people gathered at his residence on Greenways Road. They rallied behind Panneerselvam as they felt he was ‘Amma’s’ rightful heir. All of them found a voice in 
  .
 
 “I saw OPS speak on television and came here to see him,” said S Maheshwari. Policemen, who tried to contain the crowd, gave in and let them inside the bungalow. As the crowd in front of Panneerselvam’s bungalow swelled, he stepped out at intervals to greet them. It seemed to work: “Dei, I am at the chief minister’s house. He is right next to me!” a boy shouted on his mobile.
 
 Panneerselvam started trending as a hero on social media. While on the ground the public seemed to back him, up the echelons he garnered support that cut across party lines. DMK legislator from Chepauk-Triplicane J Anbazhagan tweeted in favour of the chief minister, congratulating him for his bold speech, while joint secretary of the   I-T wing Hari Prabhakaran tweeted in support of him.
 
 Political observer Sathyamurthy said the 
  wasn’t unexpected. “Stories around Sasikala are negative, while the little about Panneerselvam has been positive,” he said.
 
 Then, there were those who didn’t know which side to choose. They poured into the MGR memorial. Emotions ran high as people, including AIADMK party workers, prostrated and stood with their hands folded and heads bowed. Several cried out asking why Jayalalithaa had left them “orphaned”, why she hadn’t chosen a political heir and how her two aides were “tarnishing her legacy”.
 
 “Tell us what to do?” asked a woman, clutching a handful of flowers. “It is over. The state is doomed,” said a man next to her.
