NEW DELHI:   president   slammed chief minister   and said that the CM had violated constitutional provisions over the alleged attack on Delhi's chief secretary. 

 "The contempt with which Arvind Kejriwal treats the constitution seems he is a student of the school of naxalism, whose first teaching is to violate the law of land. We first saw Kejriwal disrespecting the constitution in January 2014 when he threatened to boycott Republic Day celebrations and now during the last three years, we seen him repeatedly violate constitutional provisions on governance," the Delhi BJP chief said.
 
 Tiwari said much like other Delhiites, he, too, wants to know the real reason behind the assault on chief secretary Anshu Prakash by the members of Arvind Kejriwal government. He further said that Kejriwal had challenged the federal structure of the nation, the army, LG, the media and had passed veiled observations against judicial decisions too.
 
 Delhi BJP's   on Monday organised a prayer meeting at Rajghat to wake up the conscious of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for repeatedly violating the spirit of the constitution. "We pray at the pious Rajghat for better sense to prevail upon the CM, to shed his egos and to start working for the people," added Tiwari.
