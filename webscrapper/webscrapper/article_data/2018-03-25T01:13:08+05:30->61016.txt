GURUGRAM: A ruckus broke out at a private school in the city on Saturday with the current school management alleging that security   appointed by the former   beat up students on school premises. Allegedly, the guards also stopped parents from entering Dev Samaj Vidya Niketan Senior Secondary School, New Colony, to participate in the ongoing admission process.

 The school is run by Dev Samaj Society which had appointed Sudhir Maheshwari as principal and K Natrajan as manager on May 2017. However, former principal Sharda Sharma and former manager Sangeeta Sharma had lodged a civil case, seeking extension of their tenure. They lost the case in October but have now approached the high court. So, the principal’s room stays locked but Sharda Sharma allegedly visits the school every day and sits at the reception. The present management claimed she employed the guards over two months ago. Sharma said the guards were employed after a few students tried to heckle her and that they have not touched any student. 
 
 On Saturday, cops visited the school thrice to bring the situation under control. Ashok Kumar, SHO, New Colony, said, “We got a call from the school. A complaint has been received but no FIR has been registered. It seems to be an internal matter of the school.”
