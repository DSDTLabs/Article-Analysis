BENGALURU: An  ,   died after a   he was trying to catch bit him in a  ,  , on Sunday. Maharaja, 48, was a construction labourer.

 Rajesh Kumar, wildlife rescuer with the BBMP forest cell, said he got a call from a resident in Sidedahalli, along Hesaraghatta Road, who asked him to pick up a snake kept in a box. “When I went there and asked who had caught the snake, I heard about a man who had died after catching it. The snake had bitten him once on his right hand. He had brought the snake home and it had bitten him again. He had gone to sleep complaining of uneasiness. Neighbours took him to a hospital where he was declared brought dead. A neighbour claimed that Maharaja was drunk,” he added.
 
 Rajesh, who also works as a volunteer with the wildlife crime control bureau, requested people to call BBMP helpline (080-22221188) if they need help in rescuing snakes and not depend on unauthorised persons. “It’s natural that people panic when they see a snake and try to get rid of it by calling anyone they think of at that moment. They’re risking the life of the snake catcher who may not be experienced and also pose a risk to the snake. Also, keeping snake at home or anywhere without permission is a crime under the Wildlife Act,” he added.
 
 The 3.5-foot cobra, whose teeth was reportedly removed by the illegal snake catcher, has been sent to a wildlife hospital.
 
 Bagalagunte police said a case of death due to snake bite was registered.
