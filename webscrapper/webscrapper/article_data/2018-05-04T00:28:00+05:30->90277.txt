Jaisalmer: The contractor making road at the proposed refinery site at Pachpadra was allegedly stealing saline water from salt mines for using it to build roads. Using saline water damages the roads and, thereby, causes heavy loss to the government.

 On getting information on Wednesday, Balotara SDO Bhagirath Choudhary, Pachpadra tehsildar Surendra Kumar and Pachpadra SHO Harchandram Devasi went to the spot and seized a tractor without registration number and other items and lodged a case against the contractor.
 
 The contractor reportedly demolished the walls of salt mines to pump out saline water to spray on roads that is under construction in the refinery area. Saline water is high in density and will damage roads if used in large quantity.
 
 The water was being stolen for quite a long time and on getting to know this the salt producing Kharwal community reached the spot. The officers also reached there and seized the items. The salt mines are near the refinery and people caught the contractor stealing water from the salt mine of Ramkishore Rameshwar Lal. After the contractor was caught his men fled from the spot leaving behind the tractor and some other things.
 
 The Kharwal community lodged a report against the contractor at Pachpadra police station and police have started investigation. The victims Saurabh Singh, Parasmal and Mukan Chand in the report said that Dhannaram while building roads, was stealing water from salt mines due to which they had to suffer loss in lakhs of rupees. Police have lodged a case against Dhannaram Jat resident of Sambhra for theft and causing damage to property.
 
 Salt producer Saurabh Kharwal said that because of drawing water the mines have dried up and salt cannot be produced which has caused heavy losses.
