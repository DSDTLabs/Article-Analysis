 The director says that the untitled film will be an action thriller. “It’s got a social theme and will have a lot of action sequences. It would be thrilling from the start to the finish, and will have a foreign schedule too,” says Shaji Kailas, who had directed Mohanlal in Narasimham, Baba Kalyani and Red Chillies.
 
 Both the director and the scriptwriter have teamed up for several political thrillers such as Thalasthanam and The King and Commissioner. Will the movie too be on the same lines? The filmmaker says, “There’s not much of politics in the movie but it touches up on the subject.”
 
 On when the movie will go on floors, the director says, “Currently, we only have the story thread ready. Renji is scripting Lelam 2 for his son Nithin. He will start working on this script only after that. However, we are planning to start the shoot by the end of this year.”
 
 The movie would mark a Malayalam film from Shaji Kailas after four years. His last film was Ginger, which had Jayaram in the lead. On the sabbatical, the director says, “I have been waiting to work with a scriptwriter who I am comfortable with. That’s why the gap. Also, I wanted to take up a small project but Lal insisted that if we collaborate once again it should be for a big film.”
