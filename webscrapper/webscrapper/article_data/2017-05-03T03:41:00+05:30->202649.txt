Panaji: State-owned Kadamba Transport Corporation Limited ( ) has now decided to enter the bus ticketing domain, BusIndia, to widen the spectrum of services they offer.

 “Over 50% of our bookings are done online. But many people are not aware of the online services. BusIndia’s strong online presence and ticket booking services will enhance our business,” said KTCL general manager, Sanjay Ghate.
 
 KTCL has had similar collaborations with big players like RedBus, MakeMyTrip and GoIbibo wherein their servers is linked with these portals.
 
 BusIndia’s integrated online ticketing system brings together government and private bus transport operators across India under a single window, thus facilitating users to plan their bus travel across cities with ease. Many road transport corporations (RTC) from other states have also integrated their services with this pan-Indian website.
 
 Besides helping book tickets online, the portal also enables users to browse ticket prices, pick the drop-off location (from a list provided) at the destination and select a seat of their preference.
 
 Private bus operators, however, maintained that this integration by KTCL will not intensify competition against them. Managing director of Paulo Travels, Mario Pereira said, “Passengers usually opt for government run buses because tickets are cheaper. Whether they book tickets online or not is up to them. Adding a new online bus ticketing system will not affect us much.”
