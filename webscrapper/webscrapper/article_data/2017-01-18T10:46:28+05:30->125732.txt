SANGAM(ALLAHABAD):   will greet visitors to   at Sangam. The arrangement is made in view of slippery wet sand terrain that is not ideal for movement of motorcycles or patrol on foot and bicycles are easier to ride on through the lanes on the campus. 

 Mela police official,   told TOI, “Two patrol teams of women constables have been formed to conduct patrol on their bicycles near   and adjoining areas. He added, “This is the first time women police patrol teams have been assigned the task of patrolling with the aim of giving a secure feeling to devotees and kalpwasis camping in the mela area.”
 
 Only two teams have been formed initially and if it works, more women would be pressed into service.
 
 Police said they have procured high-performance bicycles that may also be fitted later with search lights and carry boxes. They bicycles are also fitted with gears to negotiate all types of terrain.
 
 Police said the measure was taken also to keep an eye on unwanted elements roaming at Sangam noz. Women constables will run a patrol during evening and morning hours.
