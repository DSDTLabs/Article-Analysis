India’s efforts to watch   play a friendly against Minerva U-20 were scuttled by the ‘hosts’ at the Conscient   ground in Gurugram on Wednesday.
 
  India and Colombia, placed in the same group for next month’s   U-17 World Cup, are training at the same venue till next week when Fifa will allocate them separate training venues.
  
  On Wednesday, India had a 90-minute training session for the first time in the Capital – home for the group stages – and were keen on watching Minerva U-20 take on the might of Colombia just 20 minutes later. Coach Luis Norton de Matos, on friendly terms with his Colombian counterpart Orlando Restrepo, had also expressed interest, but the entire Indian contingent had to leave after Colombia made it clear they didn’t want anyone around.
  
  “We saw many people there prior to kick-off. We need support from all quarters before the World Cup,” said a team official.
  
  Even Minerva Punjab FC were stopped from filming or livestreaming the game. That the Punjab club still managed to broadcast a few images is an entirely different tale.
  
  India played Colombia during the four-nation tournament in Mexico last month and lost 0-3 but nobody had any doubt that Matos’s side were up against a second-string team.
  
  “We have enough videos of the Colombian team but it would have been good to see them play here against Minerva. So close to the tournament, they could only be fielding their best team,” said the source.
  
  Colombia won 1-0, thanks to a first half goal from striker Deyman Andres Cortes. The club said Colombia – among the favourites to clinch the U-17 World Cup here in India – earned a “hard fought” victory.
