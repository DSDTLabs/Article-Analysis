Trichy: The famous thematic   exhibition at Sri Rangathaswamy temple got more technical this year as many of the arrangements were given added effects making them a visual treat.

 There are about 1,000 idols on display in the thematic golu arrangements narrating stories in 35 sections. While colourful lighting arrangements add value to the display, moving objects further increased its charm. 
 
 This year is even more special with the theme of Bhakthiyum Mukthiyum Srimannarayananey. The structure and shape of the exhibition itself is different from last year, said the organisers. 
 
 “We have kept eight goddesses on eight motorised swings which actually move. We were able to make it with the help of motors which wasn’t there last year,”said S Surendranath, president of the cultural ambassadors of Mylapore, who is also a creative director by profession. 
 
  The golu arrangement by Mayilai Kalai Moovar will be kept open for public from 10am to 1pm and 6-9 pm.
