NEW DELHI: Flights continued to get delayed at   on Saturday with airspace restrictions kicking in between 10.30am and 12.15pm for  . Over 100 flights were delayed with many scheduled for departure before the restrictions also unable to take off due to congestion.

 Over 150 flights were delayed on Friday due to dense   and technical reasons, while another 25 were cancelled. In addition, 21 flights were diverted that led to a backlog, which continued on Saturday.
