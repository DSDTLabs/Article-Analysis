AGARTALA: A day after the   upheld a three-year-old judgment of the   regarding   of 10,323 undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate teachers of the state, students studying in these schools did not attend classes on Thursday. 

 The affected teachers had been appointed between 2010 and 2012 in different government schools but their appointments were deemed illegal, first by the high court and then by the Supreme Court on Wednesday. However, the apex court has allowed the government to retain the teachers till December 2017 when fresh appointments will be made through the Teachers' Eligibility Test.

 Meanwhile, BJP on Thursday launched a state-wide demonstration seeking the resignation of chief minister   and education minister Tapan Chakraborty. State BJP president Biplab Kumar Deb on Thursday said the saffron party would move the high court to seek a CBI inquiry into the appointment process.

 The ruling party, on the other hand, termed the Supreme Court's decision 'inhuman'.
