BATHINDA: With the   ( ) set to hear a petition on February 26 over the violation of its order that bans felling of trees in Punjab, the state forest department has distanced itself from a senior officer who asked private developers, in letters written in January 2018, to start development in areas falling under Punjab Land Preservation Act ( ) after February 2, as a previous notification of the state government would expire on the date.

 Punjab principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF)   is learnt to have filed an affidavit before the NGT on Friday, making it clear that if any officer, by an act of omission or commission commits contempt of court, it should be treated that the said official alone was responsible for it.
 
 A copy of PCCF’s affidavit is with the petitioner in the case, Dr Amandeep Agarwal. The affidavit further states, “By presupposing that the area will not be notified under PLPA after February 2 or subsequently, the officer has tried to usurp the powers of the state government to decide on whether the area is to be renotified or not. Even when regulations are not applicable under sections 4 and 5 of PLPA, the areas would still remain notified under Section 3 of PLPA.”
 
 Longowal-based Dr Agarwal had filed a petition before NGT against deforestation in Punjab. Taking up his plea, the NGT had on May 19, 2016, imposed a ban on felling of trees in the state. On coming to know of the letter, Dr Agarwal filed a supplementary petition.
 
 Punjab’s chief conservator (hills) had written letters about development activities, which necessitate felling of trees. The officer has said he wrote letters as per directions of the Punjab and   high court, without violating NGT orders. The matter will come up on February 26.
 
 When contacted, Sharma declined to comment. “Let’s wait for the NGT directions on February 26,” he said.
