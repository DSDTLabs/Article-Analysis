CHENNAI: Parched reservoirs have hit piped water distribution in around 3.5 lakh households in central Chennai, pushing many to book water tankers. On Wednesday, the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board recorded its highest number of loads on asingle day with 6,800 trips.

 There has been a two-fold jump in the number of residents buying water from Metrowater through the 'Dial for Water' scheme. In all, the water agency now receives 2,800 calls and emails a day asking for mobile water supply . “We receive around 1,200 bookings during summer,“ said a senior engineer. A large number of the calls now are from Teynampet, T Nagar, Kodambakkam and Anna Nagar -areas usually secure in the distribution network.
 
 A Metrowater official said the desalination plants in   and Minjur cater to the southern and northern parts of Chennai respectively , water for the central part is usually sourced from the reservoirs. Howe ver, with the combined storage level in the city reservoirs standing at less than 3% of their capacity , the agency is tapping groundwater to meet central Chennai's needs.
 
  now has 699 water tankers with a capacity of 6,000l and 9,000l. Residents said though they prefer water supplied through Metrowater tankers, as it is cheaper than private tankers, sometimes the wait is too long. “We now buy water from Metrowater and private tankers,“ said B  , secretary of T Nagar Residents' Welfare Association, who stays in an apartment complex on Rangan Street. Residents there have stopped banking on borewells. “ And we don't get piped Metrowater supply at all,“ said V S  , a resident of   in T Nagar.
 
 At present, Metrowater supplies around 470-500 million litres of water per day, 12% of which are through tankers.Officials say at least 60% of the mobile supply is free of cost for the slums. Those wanting to book a tanker can avail Metrowater's facility through its website or call 044-45674567.
