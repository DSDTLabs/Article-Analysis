 NEW DELHI:  's President Htin Kyaw has resigned, said local media reports citing a Facebook post from his office. 
 
 
 Htin Kyaw became president in 2016 after landmark   which saw the end of decades of military leadership. But he was essentially a ceremonial leader, with long-time opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi acting as de facto president, said the BBC.
 
 The unsigned Facebook notice, which was posted to Facebook by the President's Office, said Htin Kyaw resigned on March 21 because he wanted to "rest", said Frontier Myanmar, a news site.
 
 The notice said a replacement would be in place within seven working days. Rumours of Htin Kyaw's impending resignation have been widespread for almost a year but government and National League for Democracy party officials have consistently denied them.
