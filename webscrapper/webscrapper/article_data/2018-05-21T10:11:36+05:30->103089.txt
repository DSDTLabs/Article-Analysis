JAIPUR: In a joint operation with the police department,   (JDA) finally removed encroachments from 100 feet sector road in Mangyawas village, which falls under   (PRN) south zone.

 Fearing a protest, the drive was carried out under huge police deployment to keep locals at bay. On the first day, JDA removed more than 40 structures, which were falling on the 100 feet road as per the master-plan 2025. A portion of a temple was also removed that was falling in the road periphery.
 
 Many structures including   were not bulldozed as the owners have showed court stay to the JDA.
 
 After the teams reached around 10 am in the morning, the drive was started from   end, which was entry point of the road. A senior enforcement official said, “The drive was carried out peacefully and many residents voluntarily removed the encroachments as JDA had earlier marked the portion that was coming inside the road with red-paint. The drive will continue on Monday to remove remaining structures.”
 
 On Sunday, encroachments were removed from 1.2 km area of road, which connects in Mangyawas and New Sanganear road. As zonal plan of nearly 800 metre were not drawn appropriately, the JDA has decided not to carry out drive in that area. The drive will start once the zonal plan is prepared.
 
 While a few supported the JDA’s drive, many affected house owners alleged that officials were partial and portions of many houses were razed more than required.
 
 Along with the police force, huge machinery deployment was also made to remove debris from the spot. More than 10 JCB machines, 20 tractors and 20 trolleys were deployed to lift the debris. As traffic was diverted from the area many commuters who were travelling to New Sanganear road had to face inconvenience.
