NEW DELHI: Even before counting of votes could begin on Saturday, former chief minister   had been elected unopposed in the   assembly election.

 
 67-year-old Rio, who led Nagaland for 11 years, is a force to be reckoned with in the north-eastern state. Often described as "the tallest leader in Nagaland" by party colleagues and rivals alike, Rio first became chief minister in 2003 when he won from the Northern Angami-II assembly seat in Kohima district as part of the Naga People's Front (NPF), a party he formed after defecting from the   the previous year. He won again in 2008 and 2013.
 
 Then, in January this year, Rio broke away from the ruling Naga People's Front to join the fledgling   (NDPP), a political outfit founded in May 2017 with his backing. 
 
 To secure his party's electoral fortunes and his own political ambitions, Rio brokered an alliance with the   - the NDPP is contesting in 40 seats in the 60-member assembly, while the saffron party is fighting in the remaining 20 seats. 
 
 Rio is being touted as the state's next chief minister, should the BJP-NDPP alliance dethrone the ruling NPF. 
 
 However, Rio's tenure as CM has been dogged by allegations of corruption, which he has hotly denied. Public sentiment turned against him when he quit as chief minister in 2014 and became a member of Lok Sabha.
 
 A report by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) put the three-time CM among the three richest candidates in the fray in Nagaland, with personal assets amounting to Rs 36.4 crore.
 
 Rio was once again declared the winner from the Northern Angami-II seat after his rivals pulled out of the contest on the last day of withdrawal of nominations.
 
 Following his victory, he resigned from the Lok Sabha to be able to serve as a Nagaland MLA.
