NEW DELHI: With the   ( ) citing high disparity in distribution of world cricket income as one of its weaknesses, the   asserted on Thursday that it won’t entertain any sort of cut from its share as it is expecting a rise in its expenditure.

 
 
 
 The ICC’s strategic working group (SWG) met the Supreme Court-appointed committee of administrators ( ) and BCCI office-bearers here on Thursday to discuss its global strategy for the growth of cricket.
 
 
 
 According to sources, BCCI has pointed out that its budget is set to rise since it will have more members to look after now. “With the Lodha recommendations coming into effect, we have new members coming in. The north-eastern states have got full membership. They will get due grants from the board. We are investing heavily in women’s cricket as well. We can’t afford to lose out on any money,” a top BCCI official told TOI. “Every board has its peculiar financial situations. It can’t be assumed that BCCI has enough. But BCCI needs to keep growing, strengthening its domestic cricket and infrastructure,” the official added.
 
 ICC’s global strategy report stressing on over-reliance on India has not gone down well with BCCI. And it has asked ICC to change the language of its SWOT analysis as it gives a negative connotation. “They have assured that before the final strategy paper is prepared and presented to the board, a course correction will be done. Had they stopped at ‘not truly a global game’, it would have sufficed,” the official said.
 
 Interestingly, ICC Chief Executive   said that India's revenue generation is a “strength and not weakness”.
 
 “I would rather look on it as strength as we need Indian cricket as part of global strategy. It is due to this strength that we have such a huge cricket economy behind us. So it's not a weakness from ICC's point of view. It's just a reminder to other countries that they cannot rely on India alone,” Richardson said after the meeting.
