All is surely not well between ex-lovers   and  . While they may have sparked off rumours of a possible reconciliation with their lunch date recently, Upen's   account seems to suggest another story. 
 
 Ever since they met at a restaurant in Bandra recently, Upen has been posting quotes and images, which serve as a direct reference to his relationship with the 'Jhalak' actress. They speak volumes of the wrong done to him when he was in love. 
 
  
  
 He posted an image with a caption yes, and it read, "When it's over, leave. Don't continue watering a dead flower." 
  
  
  
 What is even more shocking is the fact that he tagged Karishma Tanna with another image, accusing her of using and lying to him. He later deleted the posts. Take a look:
 
  
  
 Upen didn't stop there and shared another one that hints at his trouble relationship with the actress. He went on to tag Karishma in the picture yet again, making his feelings about her apparent to the world. 
 
  
  
  
 Upen and Karishma made one of the most gorgeous looking couples in 2014 when they appeared on   8 together. Fans gave them the name 'UpMa', keeping both their initials. Later, they appeared in more reality shows together and their vacation pictures set some serious goals for all the couples. However, they headed for a split later, which left all their fans everyone disheartened.
  
 Looking at how things are headed, there is little hope that anything would ever work out between them now.
