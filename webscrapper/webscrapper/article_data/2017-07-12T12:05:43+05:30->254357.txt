SURAT: It’s a déjà vu for the family members of Champa  , 56, one of the seven deceased in Monday’s terrorist attack in Anantnag. The Prajapati family had gone through similar agony and pain two decades ago. 

 During the pilgrimage in 1996, Champa’s mother Parvati Prajapati had died of cardiac arrest while her paternal grandfather was shot dead in the terrorist attack. 
 
 Wife of Raman Prajapati, Champa had gone along with nine other family members from Vapi after a fight with her husband. Raman Prajapati, who is a retired electrician with the DGVCL, was not allowing her to go to Amarnath for past four years due to the 1996 incident. 
 
 It had so happened that Parvati Prajapati was on Amarnath yatra with her in-laws’ family.  , her father-in-law, was shot dead by terrorist in an attack at that time, and Parvati was stuck with an army jeep for four days with his dead body.
 
 It was on her return to safety at Baltal after four days that Parvati Prajapati suffered a cardiac arrest and died the next day. 
 
 Raman Prajapati said, “My guru Rangavdhoot had asked me not to send her to Amarnath at any cost. I was refusing her on the pretext of not having money for pilgrimage. But this year, she insisted and paid the tour fee of Rs 12,000 from her savings and went.” 
 
 Champa is survived by son Pinal and two daughers — Dipika and Jayvanti. All three are married and have children. 
 
 Shrish Amrut Mistry, son-in-law of Champa Prajapati, said, “After 1996, the connection with Amarnath has become even stronger. Until and unless Kashmir is not free of terrorist, we won’t go on the pilgrimage. The   government at the Centre should take strenuous action to eliminate the terror groups from Kashmir.”
