BENGALURU:   in the hinterland may be a problem that the country has failed to resolve even after  . But the  , a   conducted by   at T Beguru, 35km from the city, and off Tumakuru Road, is an example of what sincere efforts by conscientious individuals can achieve. 

  Ramana Rao has been running the Village Clinic at his farmhouse in T Beguru for the past 43 years. Started in 1971, it has earned the distinction of being the largest serving free clinic in the world by treating over 20 lakh patients. On Sunday, the clinic took a crucial step towards holistic care. As part of Dr Ramana Rao's 'Walk With Dignity Mission', orthopaedic walking sticks were distributed to the elderly free of cost. 
 
 "Many of the elderly become immobile and dependent. This mission is to ensure they go about their work safely and stay mobile. Even one fall could lead to permanent immobility and rapid deterioration in their health. This is the larger context behind distributing these walking aids," Dr Ramana Rao said.
 
  Former cricketer Anil Kumble, who distributed the sticks to the needy, said: "Many individuals may conduct such camps a few times, but to sustain it for 43 years is amazing. Ensuring primary healthcare in villages is quite a challenge. To bring quality healthcare free of cost requires huge effort. This initiative of Dr Ramana Rao has an impact on not just the patients but also on their families and society at large."
