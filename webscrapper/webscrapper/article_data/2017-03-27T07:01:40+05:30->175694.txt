THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The vigilance and   has submitted a report to the state government citing serious lapses in the police probe into the murder of a dalit woman at Perumbavoor on April 28, 2016. 

 The 16-page report submitted by vigilance director Jacob Thomas in January questions the credibility of the probe by the special investigation team headed by ADGP Sandaya, appointed by the ruling  , and the SIT headed by K Padmakumar, during the tenure of the previous government.
 
 Vigilance sources said the report also states that the probe conducted so far was not in the "right direction" and there were serious lapses in scientific collection of evidence and that the proof would not stand legal scrutiny in court.
 
 The investigation team had submitted a 1,500 page charge sheet in the case in which Assam native Ameerul Islam was the sole accused. He was arrested in June. According to the charge sheet, the victim was murdered after the accused tried to rape her.
 
  Police had conducted six scientific tests, collected 75 pieces of material evidence, 125 documents and taken the statements of around 105 witnesses.
 
 The report, prepared following a complaint to the anti-corruption watchdog that the investigation was not in the proper direction, was handed over to the home secretary, who in turn had forwarded it to CM Pinarayi Vijayan and DGP Loknath Behara.
