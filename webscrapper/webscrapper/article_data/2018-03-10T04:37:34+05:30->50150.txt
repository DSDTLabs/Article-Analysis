MUMBAI: To add to the state’s fiscal woes, revenue from excise has taken a hit in the wake of a Supreme Court order prohibiting serving of liquor within 500 metres of notified highways.

 Alcohol and stamp duty from property sale are large income-earners for the government. Real estate seems to be regaining buoyancy with revised estimates for revenue under ‘stamps and registration fees’ up by Rs 2,100 crore, taking the total amount to Rs 23,100 crore.
 
 Overall, government’s income projections are off the mark by Rs 13,866 crore—that’s the gap between the projected amount in last year’s budget and the revised estimates.
 
 While admitting that fiscal deficit was currently bordering on 3% (of gross state domestic product), close to the limit prescribed for fiscal responsibility, finance minister   said his government will rein it in and ensure it does not cross 1.8%, the figure mentioned in the budget documents. However, former finance minister   of the   said it was already 3% and he “would not be surprised if the fiscal deficit crosses Rs 30-35,000 crore”.
 
 State’s excise revenue was estimated at Rs 14,340 crore but collections are down by Rs 1,840 crore. Similarly its share from central excise duty is down by as much as Rs 2,653 crore. The estimate was Rs 5,492 crore. Even the state’s share from customs is only Rs 2,740 crore against the estimated Rs 5,254 crore.
 
 Taxes on sales and trade have also yielded Rs 37,428 crore less on account of introduction of Goods and Services Tax against an estimate of Rs 92,839 crore.
 
 Revenue from the state’s own taxes increased by Rs 11,542 crore and from non-tax revenue it earned Rs 1,541 crore more. The Centre’s contribution through grant-in-aid increased by Rs 1,012 crore.
 
 From   and Services Tax, the state will earn Rs 8,888 crore while from   and Services Tax it will earn another Rs 50,977 crore. Its share of Corporation Tax, also based on devolution from the Central government, is up by Rs 380 crore.
