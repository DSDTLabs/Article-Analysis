VISAKHAPATNAM: With the ministry of external affairs planning to transform head post offices into post office passport seva kendras (POPSKs), obtaining a passport will become hassle-free and the burden on passport offices which are grappling with large volume of applications will ease.

 After getting successful results from post offices in Karnataka and Gujarat under a pilot project a few weeks ago, the union ministry has decided to roll out the same at 56 head post offices in the country including Kurnool and Kadapa in Andhra Pradesh falling under the   (VRPO).
 
 At present, the two districts fall under the  , but once the POPSK service is introduced, they will come within the VRPO limits.
 
 Regional passport officer NLP Choudary said negotiations are still on with the   and Kurnool over the terms and conditions, but they have agreed to provide space and requisite staff to run the POPSK. “We will likely to open POPSKs in the two districts before March 31 in the first phase and later extend the similar facility in other districts like Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, and  , among others where demand is high. We will set a target of issuing 300 passports per day at Kadapa and 150 passports at Kurnool POPSKs,” he said.
