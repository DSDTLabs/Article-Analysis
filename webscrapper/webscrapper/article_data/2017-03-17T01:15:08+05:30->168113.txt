NEW DELHI: After the party’s disappointing performance in the Punjab and Goa assembly elections, AAP convener Arvind   has written a   to party  , asking them to “keep the faith, keep up the fight”.

 The letter, e-mailed to all registered party members on Thursday, seeks to address the debacle and lift the cadre’s morale just before Delhi goes in for the municipal polls on April 22 and the party prepares to contest its next the state election in Gujarat at the end of 2017.
 
 “We have come a long way from the beginning of our movement six-plus years ago. All we wanted was a corruption-free India. All we asked for was a strong anti-corruption law. Millions of you took to the street in protest. They mocked us and said ‘Laws are not made in maidans. Fight and win elections if you want to pass a Jan Lokpal Bill. We took up the challenge…Although we didn’t get the expected results, we are now the principal opposition party in Punjab with 22 seats. Also, having got 6% vote share in Goa, we are just one state away from becoming a national party,” the letter stated.
 
 Kejriwal further said that before understanding why the party fared badly in Punjab and Goa, volunteers needed to understand that winning and losing were part of AAP’s “political adventure”. He added, “The 65-year-old BJP has only 18% seats and 20% vote share in Karnataka, and the 130-year-old Congress has only 15% seats and 18% vote share in Maharashtra. They haven’t given up and there is no reason for us to give up. The question we should ask ourselves is whether the current political system is fine. Have rampant corruption and crony capitalism disappeared? Is there justice for all? Are the common people getting what they deserve? If the answer is ‘No’, we have to continue and strengthen our political revolution.”
