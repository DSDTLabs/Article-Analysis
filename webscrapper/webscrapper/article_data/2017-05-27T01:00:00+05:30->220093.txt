 "Whenever Anurag is in Banaras he makes it point to visit our place and eat the apple pie, his favourite dish. In fact, before starting the shoot of 'Mukkabaaz' he came with some members of his team and had expressed his desire to shoot some scenes here," says  , owner of the eating joint, adding, "Our place is an adda of sorts for the entire team from their 'Gangs of Wasseypur (GOW)' days. The entire team used to hang around during the evenings once the shoot was over â€“ a tradition which he still follows. Ever since he is in town, he is coming here on most of the evenings," adds Shukla.
 Shukla also tells us, "While filming 'Gangs of Wasseypur', the film's lead   used to come here and wanted something low on calories and healthy for which she suggested the ingredients. So we named a pasta after her and even incorporated it in our menu and is immensely liked by Banarasis."
