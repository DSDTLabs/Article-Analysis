Salem/Erode: Responding to a statewide bandh called by the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) on Wednesday to condemn the Centreâ€™s failure to constitute a Cauvery Management Board (CMB), many shops, hotels and other commercial establishments closed their shutters in Salem, Namakkal, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri and Erode districts.

 During the bandh, a total of six buses, including a bus owned by the Karnataka government, were pelted with stones by unknown miscreants. 
 
 About four government buses were damaged by stone-pelting near Pennagaram in Dharmapuri district. According to police, no one was injured in the incident.
 
 In another incident at Punsai Puliyampatty near Sathyamangalam in Erode district, miscreants pelted a Karnataka State Regional Transport Corporation (KSRTC) bus, which was heading to Sathyamangalam from Mysuru, with stones. The Punsai Puliyampatty police said bus driver Syed Jahir Ahmad lodged a complaint with them.
 
 Likewise, miscreants pelted the windshield of a private bus that was plying between Salem old bus stand and Veeranam with stones at Veeranam on Wednesday morning. The bus driver lodged the complaint with the Veeranam police.
 
 Meanwhile, the bus service between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka was suspended due to the bandh. Buses from both the states stopped at the border towns - Dhimbam near Bannari in Erode district, Mathewaran Malai near Mettur in Salem district and Attibele near Hosur in Krishnagiri district.
