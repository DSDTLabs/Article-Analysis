Panaji: Two premium trains catering to Goa have fared poorly on multiple parameters of food hygiene in the latest report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).

 The audit report on catering services in Indian Railways, recently tabled in Parliament, had revealed an overall poor performance by catering services. In its sample of 80 trains from all the divisions of the railways, the Hazrat Nizamuddin–Madgaon Rajdhani Express and the Nizamuddin-Goa Express were taken to task by the auditing body.
 
 “Cleanliness and hygiene were not being maintained at catering units at stations and in trains. Deficiencies in respect of quality of food served were noticed. Articles unsuitable for human consumption, contaminated foodstuff, recycled foodstuff, shelf life expired packaged and bottled items, unauthorized brands of water bottles, etc., were offered for sale on stations,” the CAG summarized in its report .
 
 During the inspection by audit teams and railway officials, caterers on both the   and Madgaon Rajdhani were found using unfiltered tap water in preparing food items.
 
 “Instead of available water purifiers, unpurified water straight from the tap was used in preparation of beverages – coffee, tea and soups in the trains,” the teams noted, adding that catering persons were also not wearing handgloves while handling food items in these trains. 
 
 Despite strict rules on cooking in pantry cars after a spate of fire incidents, the Goa Express was among the 18 trains flouting them.
