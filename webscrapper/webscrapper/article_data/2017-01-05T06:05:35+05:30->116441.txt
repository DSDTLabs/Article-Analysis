No one knew it was a disciplinary proceeding,“ the lawyer for JNU student  , who was arrested in connection with the event, argued before Jus tice  . “The committee was not set up to find someone guilty and punish them. It was set up to enquire into the incident and then recommend actions,“ Umar's counsel   said.
