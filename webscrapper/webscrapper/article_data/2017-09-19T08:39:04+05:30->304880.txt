MEERUT: It was said in passing and in a brief sentence, and possibly nobody noticed.

 But when   chief Maya wati spoke about   “using a Scheduled Caste person“ in Shabbirpur village in   where   attacked Dalits in May, the unnamed jibe appeared aimed at Bhim Army and its chief Chandrashekhar Azad  .
 
  claimed the link between the person and BJP was exposed which forced the state government to initiate some action against “his“ outfit. Bhim Army, a strident Dalit outfit, has gained prominence after Saharanpur clashes. But Mayawati alleged there was a larger plot in the clashes. She said BJP had hoped that she would use Dalit rhetoric in Saharanpur which will stoke further clashes. It would also provide a cover to unleash violence to kill her and end BSP for good, she said. She alleged that the chief guest at the Shabbirpur function, which triggered the clashes, was   who had killed Phoolan Devi.
 
 “But there, I spoke about `Sarv Samaj' and foiled the BJP gameplan,“ she said.
