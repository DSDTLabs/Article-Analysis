  , who plays Anita Bhabhi on   Ghar Par Hain has won over hearts by her sweet gesture towards her drivers, maids and office boys.
 
  The actress recently bought medical insurance for all of them. She has not only bought it this one time but has decided to keep paying the premium for them. This comes as a kind gesture from   and it is a result of an incident that took place on the sets of her ongoing show.
  
  Saumya's driver recently collapsed on the sets of her show and his wife was unable to admit him to a hospital owing to expensive medical bills. This was absolutely unacceptable to Saumya. She not only took care of the medical bills but also took up medical insurance for all her staff members.
  
  
 
  
  Saumya said, "My driver collapsed on my set on the shoot one day, her wife refused to take him to the hospital and kept insisting that he should be left home because in her mind hospital admission means heavy bills which they can't afford. They all rely on the local dispensaries and saline and injections which they are given without proper diagnoses because hospital expenses are beyond them. I admitted him in the hospital and decided that all my staff both drivers , maids, office boys should be medically insured every year so that they are not scared to go to the hospital and take proper treatment."
  
  "In our country is not a welfare state, poor do not get proper medical treatment, government hospitals are in shambles. I cannot and do not want to take work from ill families. Thus every year I have decided to do family medical insurance for all the five people who work for me," she added.
