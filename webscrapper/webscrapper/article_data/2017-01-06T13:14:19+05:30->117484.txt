MALAPPURAM: Unable to realise his dream of a career in medicine, a 20-year-old youth tried the next best thing – he pretended to be a  . For an entire year, Shibin, a native of Nellikkuthu in   district, clad in white overcoat, stethoscope round his neck and a couple of impressive-looking tomes in hand roamed the wards of government medical college in Manjeri posing as a second-year   student.

 On Thursday, hospital staff and local people finally saw through his game, following which Shibin was arrested by Manjeri police. According to police, so convincing was Shibin’s act that no one suspected his identity.
 
 College principal Dr K Mohanan revealed that Shibin managed to mislead staff of various departments of the college. “When Shibin approached them for financial support to pursue his studies, they even initiated a fund collection for him. The truth came to light when some officials probed his exact whereabouts and academic qualification,” Dr Mohanan said. In reality, Shibin has completed only higher secondary in commerce with 70% marks.
