GANDHINAGAR: As   looms over the state, the state government has asked   to take steps so as to   from the Narmada canals. They have been asked to deploy additional security forces wherever they find it necessary. One group of SRP has already been allocated for the purpose.

 “The government has ordered to prevent Narmada water theft by farmers and industries through ‘bak nali’. We have increased vigilance across the main and sub-canal network. So far, our staff have removed around 8,000 ‘bak nalis’. We have already informed the farmers through ads in newspapers and through other mediums that they won’t get water for summer crops,” said a senior officer of the   (SSNNL).
 
 Government doesn’t want any harsh step against the farmers but definitely an increased vigilance to prevent any incidence of theft or damage to the canals during the summer season, the official revealed.
 
 Another senior government officer said that the government has decided to divert water to SAUNI and other pipelines and stop water supply into Maniya-Miyana and other main canal network where instances of water theft are reported on regular basis.
 
 Chief minister Vijay Rupani on Friday appealed to the farmers to stay away from sowing for the summer crop as the government will not provide irrigation water due to severe shortage of drinking water.
 
 Talking to reporters the CM said, “Narmada dam was meant for water supply to four states including Gujarat. Due to lesser inflow of water in the Narmada dam due to the poor rains, water level is not sufficient for irrigation. Drinking water is our foremost priority. Situation like this is not normal. It happens once every 20 years.'' “The first priority is supply of drinking water to around 4 crore people of over 10,000 villages and more than 167 towns,” the CM said.
