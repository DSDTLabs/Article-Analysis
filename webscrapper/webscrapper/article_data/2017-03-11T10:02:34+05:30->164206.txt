AURANGABAD: Pouring   on the   celebrations, the municipal authorities on Friday said they would not be able to provide additional quantity of water on March 13. 

 The authorities, who are struggling to streamline the water supply in many parts of the city after the recent mega shutdown, categorically said that there is no room for supplying additional quantity of water and thus the residents should judiciously use water on the occasion. 
 
 While some of the social organisations and corporators have been demanding additional quantity of water during the festival of colours,  , incharge of water supply in the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation ( ), said that the existing water lifting system does not allow the authorities to draw more water from the Jayakwadi lake. 
 
 “We are already using the system to its capacity, but are still unable to meet the city’s demand,” he said that it would be possible to lift additional water only when the civic body installs new pipeline on the 45-km long patch between the Jayakwadi and the city. 
 
 However, Chahel added that the authorities have streamlined the city’s water supply soon after the shutdown. “Following the repair and maintenance work, we normalised the water supply and people in all parts are getting tap water as per their terms,” he said. 
 
 Rajendra Datey Patil, a social worker said Holi is an important festival in this part of the country and people use a lot of water while playing with colours. “Last year the region had witnessed drought-like situation and the civic body was drawing water from Jayakwadi’s dead storage, hence we did not raise demand for additional water. But now, we have enough water in the reservoir and the municipal body has recently plugged all the leakages on the main line. I think the authorities should improve the supply during the festival.”
