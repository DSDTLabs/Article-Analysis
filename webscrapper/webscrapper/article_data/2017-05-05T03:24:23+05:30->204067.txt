NEW DELHI: In a first for India, the Centre will on Friday come out with draft rules for a no-fly list that may have varying periods of grounding for unruly flyers depending on what they did on board the aircraft they were on.

  The draft civil aviation requirement (CAR, or rules for aviation) is a result of a demand from all Indian airlines for a no-fly list after   MP   had thrashed an   employee with slippers on March 23, 2017. 
 
 Air India had, in an unprecedented move, banned Gaikwad from its flights and all other carriers had followed suit.
 
  The draft will be made public by aviation minister Ashok G Raju and his deputy Jayant Sinha on Friday. For effective implementation, the Centre is likely to make some identification mandatory - either Aadhaar or passport number - while booking even domestic tickets. The idea: a person on the list should not be able to book a ticket under a false name as he or she would require a valid ID. 
 
  The draft will give about a month for the public to comment. The aviation ministry will then take some time to study them and come out with the final CAR. Sources say the process is expected to be complete in about three months.
