LUCKNOW: Barely two days before the   delivers its verdict on the battle for control over the   and its symbol, the Yadav family feud continued on Saturday , this time in the Yadav heartland of Mainpuri.

 Soon after Naresh Uttam, appointed president of the SP state unit by chief minister  , met with SP patriarch   at his residence and sought his “blessings“, the “other“ state president,  , announced that Karhal (Mainpuri) MLA Sowaran Singh Yadav would be given SP ticket.
 
 On December 29, Akhilesh, in his list of 235 candidates, had dropped the MLA to accommodate Abhishek alias Anshul Yadav as his choice from Karhal. Shivpal's announcement was a reitera tion of Mulayam Singh Yadav's origi nal list of candidates issued on December 28. The need to re-emphasise the original candidature, sources said, could indicate that the MSY faction was trying to build its own support base if the EC ruled in its favour. The Akhilesh camp had claimed before the EC that it enjoyed majority support of the SP delegates, comprising MPs, MLAs, MLCs and elected members of the party's national executive.
 
 TOI couldn't independently verify whether Sowaran Singh Yadav had signed an affidavit which was submitted before the EC in support of Akhilesh as the SP national president. Mulayam continued to send out contradictory signals by not only blessing Uttam, but also allowing his name plate -removed during clashes between party workers last week -to be hung up outside the state president's office again.
