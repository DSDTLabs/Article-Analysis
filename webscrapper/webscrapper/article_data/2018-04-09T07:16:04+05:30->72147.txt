AHMEDABAD: The registrar of the city civil and sessions court, J P  , has requested the city police commissioner to make police officers and personnel wear   while attending court proceedings. Earlier, additional public prosecutor L B   — citing the observations of Justice S H   — had written to all district superintendents and police commissioners of the state to make   wear uniform while visiting court. Dabhi had said in his letter that sometimes it had been observed that investigating officers send constables and head constables on their behalf. The letter said that the constables and head constables were often unaware of the facts of the cases, which affected court proceedings.

 As for uniform, Dabhi had mentioned in the letter that some police officers had said that those working with special branches were exempt from wearing uniform. However, the letter rubbished the excuse and said that officials could be exempt from wearing uniform while performing police station duties but not while attending court.
 
 The registrar of the city civil and sessions court has written to the city police commissioner, saying that it has been observed that when cops visit court — whether as part of protective detail, or to depose, or to produce the accused —most of them do not wear uniform. The registrar has requested the city police commissioner to issue necessary instructions to ensure that cops attend court in proper uniform.
