PATNA: Former deputy CM   (SuMo) said on Friday the gross state domestic product (GSDP) growth rate of the state has come to half of what had been achieved under the NDA rule in Bihar.
 
  He said the state’s GSDP growth rate reached 15.4% during 2010-11, but fell to 7.6% in 2015-16, as the   tabled in the state assembly on Thursday showed. Despite that the state government has been patting itself on its back, he added.
  
  Between 2011-12 and 2014-15, Bihar GSDP growth rate was in 10.29%-9.4% range, but in 2015-16, plunged to “single digit”, he said.
  
  Similarly, the per capita income in the state used to be 37% of the national income in 2012-13, which increased to 40.6% in 2014-15, SuMo said, adding that the state’s per capita income also fell to 35% of the national average in 2015-16. Incidentally, the report has been preening its feathers on the state’s per capita income by comparing it with the national average, that was 33% a decade ago, SuMo said.
  
  Even in the matters of health and agriculture sectors, the present figure is poor. In 2013, the number of patients visiting government hospitals per day was 10,426, which fell to 9,871 in 2014 and 9,778 in 2015, SuMo said. Besides, 16.47 lakh women opted for institutional delivery at government hospitals concerned in 2013-14. Their number came down to 15.34 lakh in 2015-16, he added.
  
  The senior BJP man said the fall in the growth rate in fishery sector has been 2.2% in 2015-16, followed by falls observed in the production of wheat, pulses and oilseeds.
  
  However, JD(U) spokesman and MLC   countered SuMo, saying CM   believes in doing work and also holds the record of bringing about turnaround in the state’s economic and social situation which the former deputy CM must be aware of since he had served under him in the government.
  
  Besides, unlike the BJP-led government under PM   at the Centre, CM Nitish has never depended on false propaganda, Singh said, adding that even SuMo was a part of that propaganda machine being run for PM Modi.
