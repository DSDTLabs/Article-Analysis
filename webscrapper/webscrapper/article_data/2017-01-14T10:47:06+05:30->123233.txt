And it is exactly as it sounds — an artful group of piercings, generally three or more, spaced out asymmetrically across the entire ear, which resembles a design that you are likely to see in the sky. While some people scatter their piercings like the stars in the sky, there are no rules. You can choose to group a small collection of studs in a triangular form on your   lobe, or place them in a line along your cartilage, setting a big one down on your ear lobe and then smaller ones as you go up, so that it looks like a planet with moons. You can even stack them vertically like shooting stars, or just place them in a cluster. 
If cartilage piercings scare you, fret not, as the studs can be placed on just on your lobes. The overall look is quite dainty, and is perfect for girls for who minimalistic is the way to go.
 Although stacking of earrings has been popular for a while, it gained momentum after celebrity piercer   — who has pierced Beyonce’s ears — gave it a name. He says that a successful   relies on cool contrast. So, mix your studs and hoops, and remember to keep things unexpected.
 A word of caution, take time to plan the look, and get your   done with someone who knows what they are doing.
