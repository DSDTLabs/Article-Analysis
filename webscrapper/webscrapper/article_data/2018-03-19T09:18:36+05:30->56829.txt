HYDERABAD: The nationwide   declared by drivers working with app-based cab aggregators   is unlikely to have much impact on commuters in Hyderabad as many city-based cab owners’ and drivers’ associations have decided not to take part in it. Cab drivers in the city are expected to carry out   by wearing black badges while attending to their duties.

 
 Drivers in Bengaluru, Pune, Chennai, New Delhi and Mumbai have threatened to go on indefinite strike from Sunday in solidarity with the nationwide strike declared by the  . Drivers in Hyderabad said their decision to stay away from the strike was to ensure there is no loss of earnings.
 
 
 “The last time such a protest was carried out in Hyderabad, the drivers’ earnings were significantly affected. This is why this time we have decided to engage in an indefinite symbolic protest instead. While plying around the city, cab drivers will wear black badges to show their solidarity with the strike. Through this, we aim to make our customers aware of the problems faced by cab drivers due to mismanagement,” said Shaik Salauddin, state president of the Telangana Four-Wheelers Drivers’ Association.
 
 
 Drivers working with cab aggregators point out how their profits have dipped when compared to a few years ago due to the lack of proper incentives. High EMI instalments have been cited as the primary reason why drivers are unable to make ends meet.
 
 
 “Although we went on similar strikes in Hyderabad twice in 2017, no solution was found. We are now demanding that the state government intervene in the matter and urge the managements of Ola and Uber to listen to drivers’ concerns,” said Salauddin.
