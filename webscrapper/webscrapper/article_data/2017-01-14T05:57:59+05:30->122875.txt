ALLAHABAD: The district administration of Allahabad has come forward to lend a helping hand to  , the marathon winner from Handia tehsil, who was forced to seek the job of a sanitation worker because of her financial condition. 

 Aradhana met district magistrate   at his office, along with the athletics coach of   Stadium, Rustom Khan, on Friday. The district administration has agreed to bear the cost of her accommodation and food for the next six months. She had won a bronze medal at the recently held All India Indira Marathon. 
 
 TOI had published a report on December 30, highlighting Aradhana’s plight and how she had to seek a safai karmi‘s job to pay for her training. “I am overwhelmed by the support I am getting by the DM and Khan sir. Now that there are so many expectations from me, I have added responsibility which I will surely fulfil,” said Aradhana.
 
 The DM gifted her a new running kit and a pair of running shoes. The administration has also ordered a special pair of shoes for Aradhana, which are used by long distance runners.
 
 “Providing her with the basic amenities is just the beginning. I am sure that under Khan’s coaching and the administration’s help, she will make the city and her parents proud,” said the DM. 
 
 Aradhana has started training with Rustom Khan at the stadium and trains daily twice a day. “She has the potential and now with the help of administration, the girl can show good results in the coming marathons,” said Khan.
