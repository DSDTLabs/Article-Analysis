SHIMLA: Leader of opposition   at Himachal Pradesh assembly on Monday accused the government of not fulfilling most of the poll promises made in the party manifesto of 2012 assembly election. He said of the 317 promises made by Congress, 200 promises were not touched till date.

 Speaking during the discussion on the governor’s address,   said that in 2012, the then Union minister for commerce, Anand Sharma, was the chairman of the Congress manifesto committee. He said Sharma had informed the then BJP minister Narendra Bragta on September 16, 2011, in a letter that import duty cannot be increased beyond 50% which was maximum, but in the 2012 manifesto he promised to increase import duty by three times. 
 
 Dhumal said Congress manifesto had also promised to bring transparency in recruitments but on coming to power this promise was not fulfilled. He also said backdoor entries in government jobs are taking place and bank recruitment has been entrusted to state education board which is not able to conduct its own examination in time. 
 
 “Congress was never serious about their manifesto. Has the committee of Congress ministers on manifesto ever checked how many poll promises were there and how many of them have been implemented?” he asked. The opposition leader said promise of having public grievances mechanism was also made but till date, this has not been fulfilled. He said grievances of even the elected representatives are not resolved as chief minister office and other departments never respond.
 
 He said promise of citizen rights charter and increasing cold storage facility have not been fulfilled. He said after coming to power, Congress government has abandoned the anti-hail guns installed during BJP regime, but now some farmers in Baghi area of Shimla have installed three similar anti-hail guns at their own cost.
