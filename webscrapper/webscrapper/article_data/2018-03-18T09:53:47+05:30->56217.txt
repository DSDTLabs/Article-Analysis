HYDERABAD A poor line judgement at 18-18 in the decider turned the tide against   in the semifinals of the All England Championship. The 22-year-old Indian lost a close encounter 21-19, 19-21 and 18-21 against Akane Yamaguchi of Japan at the Arena Birmingham late on Saturday. Sindhu will rue her decision to leave a shuttle thinking it was sailing out. Leading 19-18 Yamaguchi produced two winners to seal the Indian’s fate.

 
 In an energy-sapping one hour 19 minute contest which witnessed rallies as long as 51 shots and 44 shots, Sindhu won the first game. But in the next two games, Yamaguchi's ability to win the big points helped her reach the final.
 
 Yamaguchi will square up against defending champion and world No.1 Tai Tzu Ying of Chinese Taipei. In the semifinals Tai recovered from a mid-match slump to beat Chinese eighth seed Chen Yufei 21-15, 20-22, 21-13.
 
 
 
 On Friday,   wasted his chances and crashed out in the quarterfinals. The Indian lost momentum and allowed Huang Yuxiang to win 20-22, 21-16, 23-21 in the quarterfinals.
 
 Prannoy began with a 10-3 lead in the decider and he made it 16-10. The Chinese shuttler closed the gap to 16-13. Prannoy won a couple of crucial points and was within striking distance of a win at 18-15. But the Indian faltered thereafter and watched helplessly as Yuxiang went ahead at 20-19. Though Prannoy saved a couple of match points, Yuxiang was not to be denied as Prannoy hit the shuttle wide at 21-22.
 
 A disappointed Prannoy said that he gave it his all. “I tried everything in my armoury but failed to finish it off. Though disappointing, I am happy to be back after the break,” Prannoy said.
 
 Yuxiang will play Lin Dan in the semifinals late on Saturday. The Super Dan got the better of his rival and defending champion   of Malaysia 21-16, 21-17.
 
 It will be an all-China final as Shi Yuqi made it to the title round with a 21-17, 21-14 victory against Son Wan Ho of South Korea in the semifinals on Saturday.
 
 Earlier on Friday, Lin Dan underlined his renewed determination to win the All England Championships for a seventh time with a fluent and at times brilliant performance which ended the title defense of rival Lee Chong Wei on Friday.
 
 The 34-year-old Chinese lefthander overcame the 35-year-old champion from Malaysia 21-16, 21-17 in the quarterfinals in a 40th encounter between the badminton greats which did not disappoint.
 
 Chong Wei moved superbly as ever, tried to mix up the patterns, and led 16-15 in the first game and 13-10 in the second. Both times, however, Lin found something unusual, an explosive change of pace or a sudden smash, and when the death points came in each game he finished them immediately.
 
 “We both played quite well,” Lin said as if better were to come. “It’s a great tournament, and he is one of the great competitors, so this is superb.”
 
 Chong Wei tried to attack Lin whenever possible to nullify his great rival’s unique attacking threat but the effect was temporary.
 
 “I will move forward,” he said. “There are a lot of competitions to come.” Whether he will return next year to try for a fifth title remains in doubt. Earlier, both Olympic singles champions were beaten.
 
 Chen Long's 21-10, 21-17 loss to fellow Chinese player Shi Yuqi was nominally a surprise but Carolina Marin's 21-15, 21-18 defeat to Akane Yamaguchi, the World Superseries title-winner from Japan, was more expected.
