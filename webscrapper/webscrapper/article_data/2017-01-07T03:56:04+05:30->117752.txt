GURUGRAM: The   has yet again revived its   plan for Gurgaon. To begin with, the civic body has submitted a proposal to the urban local bodies (ULB) department, and urged it to appoint a transaction adviser who will handhold it to prepare the blueprint and implement the   as well. It has also sought an approval from the ULB department to appoint another transaction adviser for implementing the personal rapid transit (PRT), also referred to as pod taxi.

 The state government, according to sources, is trying to convert Gurgaon into a smart city, even though it was not included in the list of smart cities from   sent to the ministry of urban development (MoUD) in 2015. The city had lost its place to Faridabad and Karnal, as only two cities were allowed from the state.
 
 “Even though Gurgaon fits the bill to become a smart city, Karnal was chosen over it. Karnal is the chief minister’s constituency. The government move had triggered protests. Later, it decided to make Gurgaon a smart city and provide all financial assistance,” said an MCG official.
 
 “The government has also requested the Centre to provide the technical assistance to Gurgaon, which it is providing to all 100 smart cities in the list. However, in order to receive the technical assistance, we need to prepare a roadmap. For this reason, we have decided to appoint a transaction adviser, who would handhold us and see us through the entire project. We are certain that the ULB will approve our request,” the official said. 
 
 The civic authorities claim that they will appoint only highly reputed global consulting firms that have a turnover of around Rs 3,000 crore as  . The MCG plans to build a PRT route from the Gurgaon railway station to the Huda City Centre Metro Station.
