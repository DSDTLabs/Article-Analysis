BHOPAL: Owing to delay in starting the online reservation, several passengers who wanted to board the inaugural run of Bhopal-Khajuraho Mahamana Express could not book their berths. 

 Train 22163 will be flagged off on Thursday from   3 pm from platform no-6. After it was announced that Bhopal-Khajuraho train will be launched on July 13, several passengers were keen to book their berth, but their entire effort turned futile, as there was no information about the train on official portal of the Indian railways.
 
 “It is a good initiative of the Indian Railways as there was no   from Bhopal. I was keen to spend weekends in Khajuraho with friends and also wished to be a part of the inaugural train. I tried a lot, but could not book a seat as there was no information,” said Suraj Sisodiya, a private firm employee. Another traveller, Rakesh Sahay said that he was also unable to book seat in the inaugural journey. 
 
 When contacted, DRM (Bhopal railway division) Shobhan Choudhuri admitted that the bookings were not available till Thursday evening. “Bookings have been started from 6pm. Such problems happen when a new train is launched,” he said.
 
 PRO of Bhopal railway division IA Siddiqui confirmed that bookings are now open for the inaugural train. “It is not a trail run. Bookings were open for general people. They can book tickets and travel,” said Siddiqui. 
 
 From July 15, the train will originate from Bhopal at 6.50am to reach Khajuraho at 1.30 pm. There will be seven halts during the 367 km journey which will be covered in 6.4 hours. Union rail minister Suresh Prabhu will flag off the train through video-conferencing from New Delhi.
