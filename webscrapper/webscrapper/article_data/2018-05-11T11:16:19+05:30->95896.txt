SHIMLA: To put a check on the illegal activity of forest mafia operating in Himachal Pradesh, the state government has finally provided weapons to forest guards serving in sensitive areas. With this, forest guards are now expected to launch a fresh salvo against forest mafia in an effective manner. The state government has also formed rapid response force in sensitive areas headed by a deputy range officer.

 In Himachal Pradesh, unarmed forest officials were finding it tough to fight against the armed forest mafia.
 
 While the attack on forest officials by the mafia was quite common in the past and murder of forest guard   by forest mafia last year brought the situation to the fore, the decision to provide weapons to forest guards would boost the morale of officials serving in sensitive areas, sources said.
 
 After increased attack on forest officials at the time of discharging their duties, state government was talking about providing weapons to them. Chief minister   in his budget speech had mentioned about the incidents of attack on forest staff in the state and had also announced to launch a scheme to provide appropriate weapons to the officials .
 
 State forest minister Govind Singh Thakur said, “The rapid response force will be laced with GPS (global positioning system) so that officials deployed in forest areas are provided timely help during an emergency situation.” He added that during group patrolling in forest areas, a deputy range officer and a block officer too would be part of the patrolling team and barring group members no other would be having any information about patrolling.
 
 “In the patrolling, officials from other forest ranges would be included to minimize chances of any nexus with forest mafia,” he said.
