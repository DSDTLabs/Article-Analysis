PATNA: All school buses, vans,   will have to undergo fitness and pollution test from May 23. The permits of those  , except auto-rickshaws, will be cancelled if they failed to pass the test, Patna divisional commissioner   said on Tuesday. He has directed the transport department officials to launch a 15-day drive in this regard. 

 The permits of those commercial vehicles, which do not get checked during the drive, would temporarily be suspended, he said.
 
 A committee has also been formed under the chairmanship of Patna district magistrate with senior police, traffic and transport department officials to identify new routes in the city for running environment-friendly e-rickshaws. The committee would submit its report in 15 days.
 
 The directives were issued in the meeting of Patna divisional pollution committee chaired by Kishor and participated by officials from   (BSPCB) and district administration, among others. “The directives are aimed at curbing the rising vehicular pollution in the city. At present, a number of old and ill-maintained vehicles ply on city roads and contribute to the deteriorating air quality,” Kishor said.
 
 “Restriction on plying and phasing out of 15 years’ old commercial vehicles will minimize the pollution level. The state transport department will prepare a proposal or action plan for the execution of the drive. The permits of vehicles failing to pass the   would be cancelled immediately,” he added.
 
 A decision was also taken to divert a few routes for auto-rickshaws. “The transport department will identify new routes to divert diesel-driven auto-rickshaws and plan to promote e-rickshaws in the city,” he said.
 
 The commissioner also ordered the district administration to close down and lodge FIRs against 17 brick kilns along the bank of the Ganga in Patna sadar, Maner, Fatuha, Danapur and Phulwarisharif areas as they were found violating the set standards for their operation.
