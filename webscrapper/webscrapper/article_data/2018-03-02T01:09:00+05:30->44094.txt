Madurai: Madurai Kamaraj University on Thursday donated $31,762 towards establishing a Tamil chair at Harvard University, at a function held at university premises. Madurai district collector K Veera Raghava Rao who also participated at the event announced that he will donate his one month salary towards the cause.

 Addressing the event, Vice Chancellor, P P Chellathurai said that Tamil culture is spread across the world, and the entire world belongs to Tamil and not just Tamil Nadu. Tamil has the uniqueness of surviving and evolving continuously when compared to many ancient languages which vanished over the time. The richness of the language makes it vibrant, the VC said.
 
 He appreciated district collector, K Veera Raghava Rao for speaking the language though he hailed from other state. Language should not be a barrier and Tamil people should not limit themselves from learning just Tamil. They should learn other languages to enrich Tamil language and the state and work towards empowering Tamil language.
 
 Madurai has the pride of nurturing Tamil with Sangams, and MKU is fitting to contribute towards the task of establishing Tamil chair at Harvard. On behalf of MKU, they are donating the sum by pooling money from one day salary of VC and all university staff, as well as from the contribution of retired staff from the university. Besides, all constituent and affiliated colleges have donated for the donation, the VC mentioned.
 
 Vijay Janakiraman, founder chairman of Harvard University Chair initiative accepted the cheque from MKU VC. He lauded the efforts of university staff and spoke on the significance of the Tamil chair.
