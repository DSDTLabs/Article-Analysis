Ahmedabad: Ten days after Gujarat University (GU) held interviews for six posts of assistant professors and professors, the varsity once again has invited applications for 25 posts, on Saturday. Interestingly, these 25 posts include the six posts across the varsity’s departments for which interviews had been held.

 GU officials told the state government that as the number of admissions in the respective departments was insufficient, appointments for posts for which interviews were conducted, could not be made. However, strangely, applications to the same posts were invited just 10 days later. Many are questioning the varsity’s move, asking how the student count increased suddenly in 10 days.
