Surat: The Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has decided to give priority to Pandesara Industrial Association in supply of treated water.

 The standing committee of SMC on Wednesday took an in-principle decision to supply 40 million litres per day (MLD) of treated water to Pandesara, ahead of industries in Sachin GIDC that has demanded 35 MLD treated water from SMC. 
 
 Rajesh Desai, chairman, standing committee said, “Pandesara units have been buying water from us since last few years and SMC has benefited from this. So we will naturally give them priority.” 
 
 Meanwhile, SMC has decided to come up with two more tertiary treatment plants in Dindoli and Bamroli of 40 MLD and 35 MLD capacities respectively . 
 
 “Pandesara would get treated water from whichever plant comes up first,” said Desai. 
 
 Pandesara is already buying 40 MLD from SMC at the rate of Rs 18.70 per kilo litre whereas the rate for Sachin industries would be decided later. However, sources said it is likely to be at least Rs 23 per kilo litre. 
 
 In Sachin the demand for treated water had come from a cluster of 11 industrial unit and there are other 2,150 small units too. SMC has asked them to inquire from the units about their requirements so that supply plans can be chalked out.
 
 If the civic body supplies, 115 MLD treated water to these industrial clusters, it would help save a significant quantity of potable water that would be given to residential units in certain areas.
