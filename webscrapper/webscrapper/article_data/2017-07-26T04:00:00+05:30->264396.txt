Vadodara: After Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the historic visit to Israel earlier this month, two officials from the Israeli consulate will be visiting the city for the first time on Wednesday. Deputy chief of missions, Nimrod Assouline and cultural officer, Tosha Sen will meet city’s eminent academicians, businessmen and politicians apart from the civic authorities. 

 “We will be making a presentation for building an Indo-Israeli recreation centre in the city to the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC). The project will be jointly discussed by the Israeli consulate officials and civic authorities,” said Nikitin Contractor, convener of Friends of Israel, Vadodara. The officials will also visit Contractor’s house on the Faramji Road. 
 
 “I will also discuss the cultural and musical festival we are planning to do in Israel in September this year with them. It is more of a goodwill visit,” Contractor told TOI. He added that there is a piece of land in Nizampura where the recreation centre including a hall, an exhibition hall and a library can be made. Contractor was invited to Israel by their consulate when Modi became the first Indian PM to visit that country.
