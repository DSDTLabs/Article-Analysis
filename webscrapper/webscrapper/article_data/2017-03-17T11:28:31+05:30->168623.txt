VIJAYAWADA: Allaying the fears of businessmen and tourists who wish to go to the US, Donald  , consular chief of American consulate, Hyderabad, said that India is important for his country. “Both countries share a very good relationship and US President   shares a one-on-one relationship with Indian Prime Minister  ,“ he said here on Thursday.

 Keeping in view the fear created among Telugus after the recent spree of hate crimes against Indians, the   Chamber of Commerce and Industry Federation conducted an interactive session with members of the US consulate, Hyderabad, and discussed B1 and B2 visa processing. Consular officer   also attended the session.
 
 Vine said that after former US President's directives, the consulate is making sure that there is no delay beyond 21 days in visa processing. “If the candidate is found to be carrying fake documents or has failed to conform to the details furnished in the applications, a penalty of lifetime exclusion from the US is inevitable,“ Vine said.
 
 Both Mulligan and Vine said that there has not been any significant drop or rise in the number of visa applications or approvals since Donald Trump got elected as the US president. “The data we have right now doesn't indicate a plateau. It is too soon to comment on the matter,“ he said.
