KOLKATA: The   ( ) have found a novel way to check the underground pipe networks in   — a red   is poured into the line to check for blockages in the drainage and sewer lines. 

 Following reports that the pipe network was clogged in some places due to dumping of waste construction materials, NKDA and   engineers used a test where a dye was poured into one end of the pipeline and its spread through the network was observed. 
 
 “The time taken to cover the distances between manholes and the intensity of the dye colour are taken into account to see if there are blockages in the fluid flow or leakages into the network,” said an NKDA official.
 
 Officials said that it took several hours for the examination conducted in an 800m sewer line network system in Action Area 1C. “The result of the test was quite satisfactory as no further intervention had to be done to check the pipelines. Tests on the pipelines in other areas will be conducted soon,” official said. 
 
 Officials said the method was similar to the way doctors checked for heart blockages. “The dye is injected and its movement through the arteries is monitored. It highlights if there is a blockage in the blood flow. Similarly, in this case, the red dye will highlight faults in the pipelines — if it gets diluted or does not flow properly,” an official said.
 
 Officials explained that the sewer and drainage lines that are separate from water supply lines do not carry water under pressure. Usually, the pipes do not need cleaning. Any blockage would give a reverse inflow pressure on the pumping machinery and thus, it is easier to detect if there is a fault in any specific pipeline.
