PUNE: Investigations by the state   ( ) into an IED explosion at a private courier office in   on March 21 have revealed that no student either from   school or junior college, run by social activist   to whom the courier was addressed, was involved in the incident.

 A senior ATS officer told TOI on Saturday, “Since we had recovered a note from the crime scene, purportedly written by a former student of Sarhad, we checked the records of   college as well as school and found that no student by the same name studied there. Therefore, we strongly suspect that it was a deliberate attempt to defame   students and affect the institute’s work.”
 
 The intended victim was Sanjay Nahar, the head of Sarhad, which works for displaced Kashmiri students. Nahar was involved in various social and peace-keeping activities to bring Jammu and Kashmir youths into the mainstream since 1990.
 
 “So far, our investigation has not been able to establish a possible motive,” the officer added.
 
 Nahar said his institute has extended all help to investigating agencies. “We will continue our social work for Kashmiri students,” he added.
