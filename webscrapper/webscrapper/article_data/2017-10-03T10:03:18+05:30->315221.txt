HYDERABAD: Irrespective of whether the state government decides to enhance the salary of   associated with various universities across the state or not, about 15% of them are likely to be adversely impacted as the state has noticed that they are not eligible to work as lecturers in varsities.

 
 : The findings of the Tirupathi   committee, formed to look into the issue, show that these staffers are not National Eligibility Test (NET) or State Eligibility Test (SET) qualified or don't possess a valid PhD degree. “Out of 1,600 lecturers working in various universities of the country, only about 200 of them are unqualified,“ said Rao. But while these 'unqualified' lecturers might not lose their jobs, they are sure to get a poorer hike when compared to the qualified faculty , said experts. However, contract lecturers maintain that their main demand is to get paid a basic salary and dearness allowance (DA) while being extended job security. “It is the varsity administrations who have hired non qualified candidates as lecturers, so now they can't remove these people from the posts. Moreover, most of these lecturers are trying their hand at securing PhD and they should be given a chance,“ said Dharamteja, president,   adding that they should be provided with job security .
 
 Contract lecturers also demanded the committee suggest the government provide weightage to contract lecturers during recruitment, when a notification is released, and give them 100 per cent hike. A decision on the issue will be taken by the TSCHE once Tirupathi Rao committee submits a report.
