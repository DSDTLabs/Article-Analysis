GHAZIABAD: A sixth person was arrested on Thursday for the murderous attack on   Anuj Chaudhary in Ghaziabad on April 8. The man, Bablu (46), is a younger brother of the main accused, Shekhar Chaudhary, who had allegedly masterminded the attack on Anuj from Dasna jail where he is currently imprisoned.

 Police said Bablu, a who has several criminal cases against him at Kavi Nagar police station, was nabbed near a fuel pump in Shastri Nagar after being on the run for nearly 10 days following the incident.
 
 “Bablu was involved in the planning of the attack on Anuj. He was aware of the sequence of events. He was actively involved in the conspiracy hatched to eliminate Anuj. He had been named as an accused in the FIR that was registered following the April 8 attack. We are probing the role of women family members of main accused Shekhar Chaudhary who have also been named in the FIR,” SSP Vaibhav Krishna told TOI.
 
 Bablu has at least five cases pending against him in Kavi Nagar police station of Ghaziabad including those pertaining to attempt to murder and criminal assault. Police said he used to live in Delhi where he ran a used-car sale and purchase business while his wife taught in a school. Investigations have revealed that Bablu was present near the house of Anuj, where bike-borne sharpshooters opened fire at him, on the evening of April 8.
