NEW DELHI: It was an unusual Friday afternoon in central hall of  , with   leaders from   more alert than would have been the case when private members’ business are taken up. The reason was   MP Bhupendra Yadav’s motion calling for simultaneous   and assembly polls being listed for discussion.

 The premises wore a busy look and some Congress MPs even jocularly asked Yadav when he planned to leave Parliament for home. Yadav had no intention to oblige even as it was unclear whether the resolution would come up at all.
 
 Concerned that it might be passed in a House with thin attendance despite NDA lacking a majority, Congress RS MPs hung around, waiting for proceedings to end. Congress leaders who are members of the upper House include Ghulam Nabi Azad, Ambika Soni and Ahmed Patel. Keeping them company were D Raja (CPI) and Tapan Sen (CPM), who had also been asked to stay on. However, the resolution did not come up on Friday to the relief of the opposition benches. This keeps it out of the rest of the budget session that ends on April 12, as that leaves only the next Friday that is April 7 for private members’ business. With the issue having been flagged, even if there is a change in norm set for private members’ business, the opposition benches are likely to be on their guard to prevent it from being passed.
