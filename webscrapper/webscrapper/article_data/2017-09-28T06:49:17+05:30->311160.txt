SURAT:  , a 16-year-old girl sought help of 181  ,  

 The girl, who studies in class XI science stream in Bardoli town, had been facing harassment by the van driver for past few months. On Tuesday too, the driver pulled the girl towards him when she was climbing down the vehicle. She immediately fled straight away to her home and informed her parents. She told them how the driver passed lewd comments at her and tried to pull her dupatta sometimes.
 
 “He asked her to be the last to get down from the van so that he could talk with her,” said a 181 Abhayam counsellor.
 
 Fearing social stigma, her parents did not take any action against the driver. “After Tuesday’s incident, they decided to stop her studies to end the problem. They told her that she should stop going to school,” the counsellor said.
 
 The girl was a bright student and wanted to pursue higher studies. Hence, she called the 181 helpline. “We conducted awareness programmes in schools and put up stickers to make women aware. She had seen them and called us to seek help,” he added.
 
 Following her call, the counsellors met her personally and discussed the problem. They even met her parents and explained to them that the girl should not be forced to quit studies for no fault of hers. After counselling, the parents agreed to let her continue studies.
 
 “We have assured them all support and advised them to go to the police to lodge a complaint against the driver. However, they are unwilling to take legal action fearing social stigma,” said the counsellor.
