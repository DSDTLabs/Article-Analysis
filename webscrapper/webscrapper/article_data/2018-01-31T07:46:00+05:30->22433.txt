Chandigarh: Under fire from the opposition over the issues of law and order and recruitment drives, the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP government is on the receiving end, this time for the proposal of re-employment of 5,500 police officials.

 A three-member team of Congress, including Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee general secretary Virender Singh Rathore, former MLA Anil Dhantori and youth leader Himmat Singh, has asked the Khattar government to withdraw its move. Notably, Rathore, Dhantori and Himmat Singh were pick by AICC president Rahul Gandhi in the assembly elections. Dhantori had made it to the assembly from Shahbad while the other two unsuccessfully contested the polls from Ambala City and Gharaunda.
 
 “This is neither in the interest of the general public nor will help in fair investigations. The move will also block the career prospects of non-gazette officers (NGOs) of the police, especially constables and head constables,’’ Rathore said, adding, “What stops the government in initiating recruitment process for the appointment to 15,000 vacancies in police force? This would be a step towards bringing down the number of unemployed.” 
 
 Without naming former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda’s governance, Dhantori also slammed the system of contractual employment in Haryana. “We admit that we were a part of the government. But what is wrong is wrong. Even as the apex court has advised against such employments, the state government has gone ahead and done this. Such system not only blocks the growth of others, but even of those who get such employment,’’ said Dhantori.
