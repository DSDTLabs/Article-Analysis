Recently at an event, Rocky seemed to be awestruck with Hina's get up and look for the evening. He took to the stage in expressing his love in the most romantic and filmy way.  Rocky danced to a famous Bollywood song, describing his love for Hina. The actress, who seemed delighted by Rocky's act, matched steps with Rocky in his performance. While the onlookers couldn't stop beaming with joy on seeing the couple have a romantic time, the two were seen completely into each other.  
 The two refrained from acknowledging their relationship in public but it was during Hina's tenure in Bigg Boss 11 where both finally accepted their relationship and made it official.  While talking about the same, Rocky had told  , "When you are close you don't realize that the bliss of togetherness is a privilege. It took this distance of two months and more to bridge that gap and we became closer only this time without being around each other in the physical form. And in that moment we didn't care if there were 100 cameras or even a thousand as all that mattered is that we can be true to each other and that's exactly what happened."
