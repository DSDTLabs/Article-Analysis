Coimbatore:  , steep rise in price of shallots affect monthly expenditure budget of many families. But this season, it is expected to stay at a normal of Rs 25 to Rs 30 per kg. 

 Thanks to adequate buffer stock in shallot cultivating districts, increase in cultivation area and competition from Thailand for export to Sri Lanka and Malaysia, the price will remain low, experts at the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) told TOI.
 
 Researchers at the Domestic and Export Market Intelligence Cell (DEMIC), Centre for Agricultural and Rural Development Studies at TNAU said in the last season, shallot prices touched Rs 90. “Usually, shallots start arriving from June. This year, we have forecast the prices to reduce around three times,” principal investigator at DEMIC KM Shivakumar said. “We arrived at the price based on the inputs from shallot farmers and traders at the conventional shallot growing areas such as Trichy and Perambalur.”
 
 Shallots are grown in Trichy, Perambalur, Tirupur, Dindigul, Namakkal, Theni and Madurai. Shivakumar said this year, farmers and traders in these districts have an adequate buffer stock to meet the market demand, and this was the main reason for the drop in prices. “The extended monsoon and untimely rainfall this year could be the reasons for the availability of buffer stock.”
 
 “Also, usually shallots would be exported to countries such as Malaysia and Sri Lanka. But for the first time this year, Thailand has started exporting shallots to Sri Lanka and Malaysia. This has reduced the export demand from Tamil Nadu, subsequently bringing down the prices,” Shivakumar said.
 
 The prices would be stable for the next two months unless there is an unexpected export demand. “Good shallots can be bought for Rs 25 to Rs 30 per kg,” he said.
