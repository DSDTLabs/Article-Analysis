KOCHI: When there was a call for the first-of-its-kind ‘Kiss of Love’ protest against   at Marine Drive two-and-a-half years ago, it evoked a whopping response on the social media.

 However, to a similar call made after   workers attacked young men and women on Wednesday, the response was mixed, courtesy the arrest of the then   leaders   and Resmi Nair on charges of being part of a flesh trade network.
 
 While many on the social media expressed displeasure over the ‘Kiss of Love’ movement’s silence on the incidents of rape reported from different parts of the state, others encouraged the movement to continue its fight against moral policing, fascism and terrorism.
 
 Expressing his view on the protest, Nidhish Issac Samuel wrote on his   wall: “I don’t think there is any need for kiss of love...we can protest in other decent ways.”
 
 Thomas Abraham, another Facebook user said, “The act of moral policing is condemnable but how does a "kiss" bring some real life solutions to moral policing???? What needs to be done is efficient application of existent laws. Impartial government policing is the need of the hour.”
 
 Hitting out at the movement, Arun George, who followed the Kiss of Love said, “A moment of silence to all those dumb ones who still consider this as some kind of event where you satiate your carnal needs.....”
 
 However, those like Denvor Fernandez came out in support of the movement. He wrote, “ISIS is doing the same thing, but with guns and bombs. Terrorism should end. Long live Kiss of Love!”
 
 Paul G P, another Facebook user, said, “The watchdogs who remained mute spectators to Shiv Sena's goondaism must be summarily sacked”.
 
 When ‘Ooraali’, a music band stated that it would be performing at the venue protesting against moral policing, social media responded with positive notes. The band said that it stood by love and abhorred violence.
