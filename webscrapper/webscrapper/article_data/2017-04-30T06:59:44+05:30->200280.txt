PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The civic administration has been asked to check irregularities in the development of model wards during the Nationalist   ( ) rule. At a recent meeting, standing committee chairperson Seema Savale directed officials of the engineering department to investigate if the wards were really developed. 

 The civic administration is to submit a report in this regard. 
 
 During the NCP rule, model wards were formed in a few areas including Sambhajinagar and Pimple Gurav. As part of the development work, some roads were to be concretised, footpaths widened and street lights installed. The footpaths were to be covered using paver blocks that could be removed easily and re-installed when required.
 
 “Model wards were developed in specific areas. A lot of money was spent on the development works in these wards. The situation is that these wards aren’t being developed as model wards,” said Sawale. 
 
 The civic panel directed the administration to probe the tendering process for development works and examine allegations related to irregularities and corruption. “During the NCP rule, there was massive corruption and irregularities. Unless an enquiry report is submitted to the standing committee, the amount to be given to contractors should not be disbursed,” Savale said.
 
 Further, the standing committee chairperson added, “The panel has invited College of Engineering Pune(CoEP) to conduct quality testing of the works completed under ‘model ward’ since there have been complaints in this regard. We do not want to focus on a small area as model ward. Instead, we want to develop the entire city as a model city.”
