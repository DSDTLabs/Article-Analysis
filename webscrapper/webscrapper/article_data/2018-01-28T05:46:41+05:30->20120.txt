KOLKATA:   (Advanced) this year will move to a computer-based platform, with all candidates typing in their answers on keyboards very much like it happens in the   for the Indian Institutes of Management. But candidates will have to compulsorily submit the papers on which they scribble their rough work.

 Another major change that will come in this year concerns a very common scenario, when two or more candidates have the same score; students with the least negative marks (which happens when the answer is wrong) will automatically rank higher than others with the same score but with more wrong answers. Marks in Mathematics and then Physics will be considered if there is a tie even after this.
 
 These are some of the significant changes, in the entrance examination to the countryâ€™s leading tech schools, which will be kicking in from this year.
 
 The decision to switch over to a computer-based examination follows the realisation that an overwhelming majority of students who clear the first round, IIT-JEE (Main), and appear for IIT-JEE (Advanced) are exposed to computers either at school or their coaching centre.
 
 The shift to computers will also give candidates the option of seeing a question in either Hindi or English, which is yet another significant change in the exam this year; candidates can switch from English questions to Hindi and vice-versa any time during the test.
