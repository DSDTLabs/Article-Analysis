MUMBAI: A 26-year-old man from Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh, who has been absconding for nearly two years, was caught at   while he was about to fly to the Gulf on Friday morning. The crime branch received a fax that morning from the immigration authorities informing them that Yashir Naiyar, whose name was on a lookout notice, had been detained. 

 A central intelligence unit (CIU) team immediately flew to Delhi and took custody of Naiyar. Police produced Naiyar before the 32nd Patiala metropolitan magistrate, and secured his transit remand to Mumbai.
 
 Naiyar, police said, had been absconding after CIU and telecom enforcement resource and monitoring cell officials busted an illegal   exchange racket by Bangladeshis in  . Police had raided the illegal   and had arrested Chandran Singh and Shabuddin Ayan from Bangalipura and recovered 231 SIM cards and Rs 1.5 lakh from them. Police later arrested Faisal Balki and Shaukat Shaikh from Bihar and booked them for cheating, forgery, breach of trust and under the Indian Telegraph Act and Indian Wireless Telegraph Act. The gang used to offer voice over internet protocol (VOIP) services to people indulging in illegal activities and cause a huge loss to the exchequer.
 
 The accused operated telephone booths in Ghaziabad and Delhi, offering cheaper STD calls to customers, who were told to dial the number of the illegal exchange at Electronic City, before dialling the STD numbers. The exchange used VOIP technology to deliver international calls across India, police said.
 
 It bypassed the ISD network by using two gateway routers, each of which could handle multiple telephone lines simultaneously. The accused had set up the illegal telecom exchange with the help of routers purchased from a leading telecom company, at an estimated cost of Rs 3.9 crore, police said.
