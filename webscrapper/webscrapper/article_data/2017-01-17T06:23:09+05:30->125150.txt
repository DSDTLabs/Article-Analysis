New Delhi:  , which has emerged as the biggest critic of the proposed   mechanism in recent weeks, ended up being isolated as the   and the states agreed to break the   on crucial issue of powers to levy and administer GST tax base.

 Earlier, the negotiations focused on a formula under which manufacturing units with annual turnover of below Rs 1.5 crore were to be assessed by the states with the Centre seeking control over smaller entities in the services space. It had argued that states did not have experience in dealing with service tax and states led by Bengal saw it as intrusion into their domain.
 
 On Monday, the Centre seemed to have reworked the formula and agreed to share the entire taxpayer base with the states, resulting in everyone, barring West Bengal, coming on board.
 
 To the states it was clear that they would get control over 90% of the entire small taxpayer base (with turnover of under Rs 1.5 crore), apart from getting half the base of the larger pool, which was the real revenue earner. This prompted a more pragmatic stance from all states, resulting West Bengal being completely isolated on the issue, finance ministry sources said. Left with little choice after holding out for nearly three hours, West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra submitted a dissent note. 
 
 “This is a big victory for states and an equally good thing for the Centre in a collaborative framework,” Mitra said, referring to the   agreeing to equal treatment for states and Centre under IGST.
 
 Asked about the other issues flagged by West Bengal, including powers to arrest and anti-profiteering clause, sources said the state which had launched vocal protest post-demonetisation was raking up settled issues with a majority of the states on board. 
 
 Mitra said 13 pending issues were raised by him — such as the definition of agriculture and definition of deemed exports — were being referred to the law ministry, which will revert by the first week of February.
