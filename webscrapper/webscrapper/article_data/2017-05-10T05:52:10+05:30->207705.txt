SURI: Two houses were ransacked and bombs hurled during a clash between alleged rival sand mafia gangsters in Birbhum’s Kukudihi village on Tuesday. This clash comes under a month of large-scale arson and violence when sand gangs battled each other at   village, 1 km from Kukudihi. Seven persons were arrested. 

 According to Birbhum police superintendent  , it wasn’t clear whether the groups were fighting over drug peddling, sale of illicit liquor in the area or sand mining. A vehicle with police sticker on the windscreen was seized, but its driver,  , is absconding. 
 
 “Milon’s kin said the vehicle was hired on a contract basis by the cops but the sticker had not been removed after the contract ended. But we found the vehicle bearing that number was never hired by the police department. We are investigating the matter,” Kumar said. — Someswar Boral
