COIMBATORE: A 22-year-old man and a lodge manager were arrested on Monday on charges of raping a 13-year-old schoolgirl. The man, who befriended the girl from Tirupur on Facebook, took her to Puducherry, raped her and abandoned her in a lodge. Later, the lodge manager also raped her. 

 The arrested persons were identified as S Ibrahim, 22, of Pichampalayampudur in Tirupur and E Prabhakaran, 29, of Puducherry. Police said Ibrahim was working in a textile unit in Tirupur and Prabhakaran had taken a lodge on lease more than six months ago.
 
 Police said the girl studying in class VIII in a private school started an account on Facebook. Ibrahim, who befriended her on Facebook last month, often chatted with her on social media. More than 10 days ago, he persuaded the girl to give him her mobile number and they often spoke on the phone. 
 
 Ibrahim told the girl that he was in love with her and wanted to marry her. He met the girl at her house when her parents had gone for work. On April 26 evening, Ibrahim went to her house and told her he wanted to take her to Chennai and marry her. Believing him, she went with him.
 
 Meanwhile the girl's parents approached the   police, who registered a girl missing case. Police said the duo reached Chennai on April 27 morning and travelled to Puducherry, where an autorickshaw driver dropped them in a lodge at Kuilapalayam. Ibrahim raped the girl in a room. Later, she found obscene photographs of several women on his mobile phone. When she questioned Ibrahim on this, he abused her and abandoned her in the lodge.
 
 On April 29, Prabhakaran advised her to return home. He pledged the minor girl's gold chain and handed over 5,000 to her. He too raped her. The girl escaped from the lodge and returned to Tirupur. Her parents took her to woman inspector G Bathurunisha, who conducted an inquiry and registered a case.
