JAIPUR: The   on Saturday detained seven people near   and seized Rs 5 lakh along with several bottles of liquor that were to be smuggled into Gujrat.

 Harmara police station chief Lakhan Singh told TOI that all seven are residents of Haryana. “They would hide   inside   and place them on overhead racks of  . Their car would follow the bus till it reached Gujarat. Once they arrive in Gujarat, one of the gang members would take the bag and supply it to their customers,” Singh said, adding that their gang was busted on Saturday when a specific input was received about their activities. 
 
 The cops stopped their SUV near Daultpura and searched the vehicle. “We have recovered as many as 16 mobile phones from them, apart from cash and bottles of liquor,” Singh told TOI, adding that cops are on the job to identify all the suspects.
 
 “Since liquor is prohibited in Gujarat, the gang would tactfully place contrabands in travel bags. Many times these bags were confiscated by the police, but nobody was arrested as they didn’t travel in the same bus but followed it in their SUV,” Singh said, adding that some papers have also been recovered from the seven suspects.
 
 “Their activities were on our radar for a very long time, the seven accused are being quizzed for their involvement in other criminal activities in the state. We are trying to verify if the car in which they were travelling actually belonged to them,” cops said.
