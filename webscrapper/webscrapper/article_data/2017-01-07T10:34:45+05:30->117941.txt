JAIPUR: Rajasthan has refused to yield to Centre’s demand to sign a memorandum of understanding ( ) for the construction of Renuka, Kishau and   over Yamuna in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.

 The state has demanded changes in infrastructure facilities to receive its due share from these dams before becoming a party to the agreement.
 
 The ministry of water resources has asked Rajasthan to sign a MoU to execute the project aimed at generating power and controlling floods.
 
 Besides the state, five other states have to also approve the MoU to enable the construction of three dams.
 
 However, sources claim that the water resources department has put its foot down and demanded changes in infrastructure to channel water to the state. “The project will not improve Rajasthan’s water share from Yamuna. On the contrary, it will further reduce flow, particularly during monsoons,” said an official.
 
 The points of contention are the Tajewala barrage in Haryana, from where water hardly enters the state, and   barrage in Uttar Pradesh, which, officials claim, is only contributing 30% of the flow for the past many years. “To facilitate the project, it is necessary for Rajasthan to receive its due share. For that, a suitable system to channel water to the state is urgently required at Tajewala head,” added the official.
 
 Rajasthan has offered to remodel the existing channel from Tajewala head to the tail of Loharu feeder and create a new channel. The other alternative proposed is to lay pipelines from Tajewala to Rajasthan border. Both these proposals are, however, cost intensive.
