 'Begum Jaan', starring   in the pivotal role of a brothel madam, is set in 1948, with the backdrop of Indian Independence. The Junglee Music album, composed by  , has the talented   as the lyricist. 
 
 With 'Prem Mein Tohre', Malik brings Asha Bhosle back, and her magic is unmistakable as she renders the little vocal nuances in her masterly way. The minimalist BG music and slow beats gives it a definite ghazal-like feel and the tenderness of this love track touches you to the core. This number is easily Malik’s next best after 'Moh Moh Ke Dhaage' ('Dum Laga Ke Haisha'). However, there is a certain likeness this song has to Mukesh’s 'Gore Gore Chand Se Mukh Par' (by Laxmikant-Pyarelal, 'Anita', 1967). The track, which has an old-world charm, in keeping with the movie, has also been rendered by   in her trademark, honest and full-throated voice. 
 
 'Azaadiyan' by Rahat Fateh Ali Khan and   poignantly conveys the pain that partition brought. The drums and strains of shehnai that this one begins with, sets the mood for the song that has two of the most remarkable voices from both sides of the border, making this song with it’s hard-hitting lyrics, an important part of the film’s narrative.
  
 'O Re Kaharo' by Kalpana Patowary and   is a sad and haunting track that talks of the plight of women living in brothels and their struggles. This one is reminiscent of the 90s Bollywood film music.
 
 'Holi Khelein' by   and   is the only fun, light-hearted song in the album. This classical-based dance number has prominent tabla beats and both the singers do justice to it. Shreya’s honeyed voice and Anmol’s quick rap-like stanzas makes this a typical Holi number.
