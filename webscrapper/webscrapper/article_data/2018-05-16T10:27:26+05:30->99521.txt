  : Strongly protesting against the 'arbitrary' appointments made to the fifth body of the Arunachal Pradesh State Commission for Women ( ), the Arunachal Pradesh Women's Welfare Society (APWWS) has asked chief minister   to take immediate steps to rectify the mistakes. 

 APWWS president Dipti Bengia  , during a press conference, claimed that there were gross violations of the APSCW Act, 2002 at the time of constituting the fifth body of the commission.
 
 Referring to RTI documents, Tadar said as per advertisement published in local dailies, it was clearly stated that all letters of interest should reach the office of APSCW on or before December 13, 2017. However, none of the members of the current APSCW team had applied for any of the posts within the stipulated time as per the advertisement, she added.
 
 Moreover, ten candidates, instead of three, were empanelled for the posts of chairperson and vice-chairperson, Tadar added. RTI documents showed that the three members, who were finally appointed, did not have their names on the list. Names of these members were also absent from the list prepared by outgoing APSCW team, she added.
 
 APWWS further alleged that the present vice-chairperson does not appear to be from the APST (Arunachal Pradesh State Tribe) which flouts the APSCW Act 2002. They demanded investigation into the background of the candidates to ensure that deserving tribal women are not deprived.
 
 "Despite our strong objections to the irregularities, we have not received any response," said APWWS spokesperson Gumri Ringu.
 
 APWWS members submitted a deputation to chief minister Pema Khandu on Monday. Khandu, after giving a patient hearing to their grievances assured to look into the matter and sought for one week's time for the same.
