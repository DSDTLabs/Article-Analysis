PUDUCHERRY:   and chief minister’s parliamentary secretary  , who moved the   against the nomination of three BJP loyalists as members of the Puducherry assembly, on Tuesday threatened to initiate criminal proceedings against lt governor   if she “tampered” with files and documents.

 He told reporters that Bedi had been making contradictory statements on her role in the nomination of MLAs. Bedi had earlier said she did not recommend anyone and that it was the Union government that did so, Lakshminarayanan said. She also said she administered oath of office and secrecy to them.
 
 “But now we learn that she is attempting to tamper with files and documents to make out that she had recommended the three to the Centre,” he said. The case is coming up for hearing in the HC. She is doing this because the case proceedings are in favour of the government, Lakshminarayanan said.
