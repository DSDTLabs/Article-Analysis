MUMBAI: No prudent person will drive his   on to the  , said the  , while convicting a Santacruz resident in a 17-year-old rash driving case that led to the death of a  .

 Justice Anant Badar held Vimanjan Devarkonda (42) guilty of causing death by a rash and negligent act and for offences under the Motor Vehicles Act. The HC upheld the trial court’s order sentencing Devarkonda to a one year simple imprisonment and gave him two weeks’ time to surrender for the crime.
 
 Devarkonda’s lawyers had claimed that he had been falsely implicated, but the HC rejected the contention. “ By no stretch of imagination, one can say that a prudent person would drive a car in such a way so as to take it on the footpath of the road,” said Justice Badar. “This act is certainly negligent as well as rash because it depicts lack of due care and attention. Therefore, no infirmity can be found in Devarkonda’s   (for the) offences...Similarly, as seen from the evidence of witnesses that instead of providing medical aid to the injured and victim, he fled from the spot.”
 
 The case dates back to March 29, 2000. Sugrabai and her son Abdul Rafiq was sitting on the pavement near Halav bridge in Kurla, when Devarkonda rammed his car into them. Sugrabai died on the spot, while Rafiq suffered injuries. Police said Devarkonda fled leaving the vehicle behind. A magistrate’s court held him guilty in 2014 and his appeal was dismissed by the sessions court in January 2017. He then filed a revision application before the HC. Devarkonda’s lawyers claimed that he had been falsely implicated as no test identification parade was conducted. The court, however, pointed out that there were witnesses who had identified him during the trial.
