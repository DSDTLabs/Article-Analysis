HYDERABAD: To get around the legal hurdles for its   (SRDP) around the  , the state government has now proposed to revise the   (ESZ) of the national park to ' ' from the previously decided '25-35 metres'. 

 Citing the example of the Guindy National Park in Tamil Nadu, where the ESZ was similarly reduced to zero in December 2014, the TRS government, in a letter to the union MoEF has requested that the same be done for KBR to pave the way for SRDP, which aims at easing 'traffic congestion around the national park'. It argued that the wall around KBR was enough to protect the flora and fauna and did not require an ESZ. 
 
 The union ministry confirmed the receipt of the proposal and said that the matter was still under consideration even as local environmentalists termed the move 'ridiculous' and slammed the government's SRDP move that would "sound the death knell" for the iconic park.
