Mangaluru: Miscreants on Friday night smeared ink on the portrait of Indira Gandhi at the Indira Canteen that is being built in Surathkal.Gururaj Maralihalli, executive engineer, Mangaluru City Corporation, on Wednesday filed a complaint at the Surathkal police station in this regard.

 The canteen is being built on the premises of the primary health centre located on the Surathkal-MRPL road. This is one of the 10 Indira Canteens that the state government has proposed to build in the district.
 
 Police sources said that the area where the canteen is being built does not have CCTV cameras. However, police are checking CCTV cameras in buildings in the vicinity for clues, sources said.
 
 Meanwhile, Dakshina Kannada district Congress president K Harish Kumar said the incident has brought disgrace to the city. “It is unfortunate that miscreants smeared ink on the canteen that is aimed at providing food to the poor at a subsidized rate. It is a pro-poor programme, which has been implemented in Bengaluru successfuly. The government also aims at opening such canteens across the state. The BJP had objected to the setting up of the canteens when the govermment proposed the project. However, it has been functioning well. No efforts by the BJP or any other vested interests will dampen our determination. The project will be a success in the district as well,” he said.
 
 Five places have been identified in city to set up Indira Canteens. Canteens are being set up at the vending zone near Nehru Maidan, Kankanady Market, Urwa Store, Kavoor and Surathkal. The government is yet to declare the dates of opening of these five canteens.
