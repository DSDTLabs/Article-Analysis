NEW DELHI: The National War Memorial   that’s coming up at   has hit another hurdle. Delhi Urban Art Commission has rejected concept   number 2, saying it doesn’t conform to the architectural surroundings of the area. 

 DUAC was asked to expedite the approval of designs for the museum. These were winning entries of a contest to select a design for the war museum. DUAC did not approve design number 1, the winning entry, last year and observed that it was “unsuitable for the location and not in conformity with the surroundings”. DUAC also held that the design didn’t conform to the “overall urban design character of central vista and the Lutyens' Bungalow Zone”.
 
 The Centre then sent design numbers 2 and 3, which were the   and third winning entries respectively. Before examining them, DUAC referred the matter to the Heritage Conservation Committee and Central Vista Committee. The Central Vista Committee, however, shot down the proposal.
 
  “The considered opinion of the committee is that the design presented does not match with the grandeur and style of central vista,” the panel held. 
 
 DUAC, upon further study of the design, agreed with Central Vista Committee. “It was also observed that the terms of reference of the design competition for which the concurrence of DUAC was taken have not been respected with reference to its edifice in Princes Park around C Hexagon, amongst other landmarks such as Baroda House, Hyderabad House, etc and also does not integrate with surrounding buildings in the Lutyens’ Zone,” DUAC said. 
 
 DUAC also said that the overall architectural character in terms of the integrated central vista have not been respected in the second design.
