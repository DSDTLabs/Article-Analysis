MUMBAI: For the past couple of months, some roadside cloth   in   have been making windfall profits by getting   for dirt cheap. The supplier: five homemakers from a housing society on Balasinor Society on  , who sold at least 4,300 such suit materials at one fourth of their market prices. All these at the expense of a local  .

 How? The suit materials, worth Rs 25.8 lakh, were stolen by the five women from the godown of a local garment shop by taking turns every night for the last two-three months. 
 
 The theft came to light last week when the shopowner, Mahesh Thakkar (52), realized 34 cartons of suit materials were missing while checking the stock. After conducting enquiries with his staff and checking his account books, he approached police. “Initially I did not find anything amiss and started getting doubts when cartons started vanishing. But there was no sign of any break-in,” he said.
 
 With no clues to work on, police started trying to trace the people who had bought the stolen materials. They finally found the buyers, who pointed the finger at the roadside hawkers, who, in turn, revealed how they got the materials from five women—Renu Tobedo (33), Pratima Tiwari (30), Parmeshwari Pandiyal (23), Vimala Kalavli (40) and Sheela Mishra (50). Investigation revealed that the women entered the godown between 2am and 3am every night using a duplicate key, which they circulated among themselves.
 
 “The women sold the stolen suit materials to roadside hawkers for Rs100-Rs150 while they cost Rs600 in market,” police said adding they are trying to find out how the women got a duplicate key.
 
 Kandivli police senior inspector Mukund Pawar said the women, who were arrested on Friday, have been has been booked for theft (IPC section 380 ), and house-trespass or house-breaking at night (sections 454 and 457).
