Energy drinks, energy shots and coffee are popular beverages that are claimed to increase  . These products are powered with  , a mild  . Moreover, there are rising health concerns associated with the use of these products. Importantly, the caffeine associated energy shot elevated both systolic and diastolic blood even if you don't have high  . Regular consumption of caffeinated beverages develops tolerance to caffeine.

 People who drink caffeinated beverages regularly have a higher average blood pressure as compare to those who don't drink caffeinated beverages. In a double-blind crossover study, 7 healthy subjects were studied for 90 minutes, on 2 occasions in random order after ingestion of 250 ml caffeinated (150 mg) and decaffeinated (<2 mg) coffee. Compared with baseline, arterial stiffness measured by carotid femoral pulse wave velocity increased progressively at 90 minutes after caffeine intake, an effect that may be independent of changes in blood pressure. In addition, arterial wave reflection also found increased. No significant changes were observed with decaffeinated coffee intake. These results show a significant effect of caffeine intake on arterial tone and function and suggest that caffeine acutely increases arterial stiffness.
 
 Because caffeine is a stimulant, it increases heart rate as well as blood pressure. People with heart  , murmur, and hypertension should limit their caffeine intake. People diagnosed with type 2 diabetes should also limit caffeine consumption because it can impair glucose metabolism in diabetics
