GHAZIABAD: The   on Wednesday refused to provide relief to Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation (GMC) officials, who were collectively fined for non-compliance with an order on March 1. 

 The NGT had earlier slapped a fine of Rs 1 lakh on municipal commissioner  , GMC chief engineer R K Mittal and executive engineer   for non-compliance with its earlier order on maintenance of a stretch of road in Sector 3, Vasundhara. The court, however, said it would consider their plea to waive the fine in the next hearing, scheduled to be held on March 23.
 
 “While hearing a petition filed by Vasundhara resident Nayan Agarwal on Wednesday, the NGT refused to waive the fine. However, the court expressed satisfaction at the work GMC had carried out on the NGT’s order and said that it will consider its plea on the next date of hearing of March 23,” Agarwal’s counsel told TOI.
 
 “Regarding the three stretches of road needing maintenance that the petitioner had highlighted, the NGT has asked the GMC to come up with a plan on how it intends to take up the work within a time frame, and present the plan in the next hearing,” the counsel said.
 
 The case dates back to May last year, when Agarwal filed a petition at the NGT saying that a stretch of road in Sector 3 has not been repaired for years, becoming a major source of dust pollution. The court in subsequent hearings had ordered the GMC to repair the road and file a status report. The repair work of the road which was carried out by the GMC was not satisfactory and the status report filed in the court was ‘misleading’, forcing the NGT to summon the municipal commissioner. However, Samad did not appear in the court on March 01, so the NGT imposed the fine on him, Mittal and Chauhan.
