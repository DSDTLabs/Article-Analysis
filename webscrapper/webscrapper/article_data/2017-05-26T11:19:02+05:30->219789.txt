CHENNAI: In a closely-fought clash, it was   who held their nerve to beat Globe Trotters by three wickets and win the   memorial one-day tournament at the MA Chidambaram Stadium here on Thursday. The architect of Rovers' win was a patient 82-ball 56 by   after the bowlers had restricted Trotters to 215. 

 Chasing 216, Rovers saw their skipper Kaushik Gandhi (14, 2x4) and No 3   (3) back in the hut by the time they reached 44 in the 10th over. Kaushik, who played across the line, saw his middle-stump being disturbed by Washington Sundar (2-34) in the 8th over of the chase. Bist departed two overs later, stumped by   off   (3-30). S Lokeshwar (41, 5x4) and Ankeet (4x4, 1x6) stitched a 44-run stand for the third wicket before the former was stumped by Jackson off Monish in the 23rd over of the chase. Monish then had Anirudh Sita Ram (0) leg-before to have Rovers in trouble at 88 for 4.
 
 With 128 still in arrears, Ankeet and S   (41, 2x4, 1x6) got together to alter the complexion of the contest. The pair accrued runs with minimum fuss and mixed caution with aggression. They raised 71 runs off 89 deliveries for the 5th wicket before Washington trapped Ankeet leg-before with Rovers still 57 away from the target.
 
 Despite surviving a few anxious moments, Rovers got contributions towards the final phase of the game from R Sathish (14, 1x6), Sandeep Sharma (14 n.o.), Jayant Yadav (15, 2x4) as they overhauled the target with 7 balls to spare.
 
 Earlier in the day, Globe Trotters --- who called correctly and batted first on a slow track --- were bowled out for 215 in 49.4 overs. Left-arm spinner DT Chandrasekar (3-42) and offie Jayant Yadav (2-48) caused the initial damage as Trotters found themselves at 76 for 3 in the 20th over.
 
 Opener S Aniruda (24, 4x4) and No 3 Washington Sundar (27, 1x4, 2x6) got starts, but failed to carry on. Aniruda was trapped leg-before by Chandrasekar, while Washington's expansive drive only managed to find Sandeep at point region off Jayant's bowling. Trotters, who were placed at 90 for 4 in the 23rd over, saw a revival of sorts thanks to their 5th wicket between Sheldon Jackson (34, 4x4) and Thalaivan Sargunam (25, 1x4) which yielded 47 runs off 69 deliveries before Rovers stuck back. Sheldon was cleaned up by Jayant in the 34th over. Thalaivan was the next to go, caught at long-on by Suresh Kumar off Sathish as Trotters were 165 for 6 in the 41st over.
 
 A 45-ball 34 by No 7 Gnaneshwara Rao towards the end saw Trotters finish with a total in excess of 200. Apart from Chandrasekar and Jayant, Sandeep Sharma (2-33), R Sathish (1-38) and J Kaushik (1-44) too found themselves on the wicket-takers' list. 
 
 
 Globe Trotters 215 all out in 49.4 overs (S Jackson 34, S Thalaivan25, Gnaneshwara Rao 34; Chandrasekar 3-42, J Yadav 2-48, Sandeep 2-33, Sathish 1-38, J Kaushik 1-44). Jolly Rovers 217-7 in 48.5 overs (A Bawne 56; Suresh Kumar 41, Sunil Sam 1-40, Monish 3-30, Washington 2-34). Rovers won by 3 wickets
