Vijayawada: In a bid to eradicate manual scavenging and simultaneously improve air quality, Krishna district administration is planning to give   to all 970 panchayats in the district.

 Sweeping machines have proven to be a success in Vijayawada, said district officials. They believe locals have to be on board for the machines to do their job. The government is providing 35 per cent subsidy on the cost. Every unit is for Rs 20 lakh.
 
 The district administration will supply these machines to local villages through bank loans. The ownership of the machine will be with the the local bodies and persons specifically chosen. As the government is giving 35 per cent subsidy, the group is going to get a benefit of about Rs 7 lakh and the government will facilitate the group to get the remaining Rs 23 lakh as bank loan. The amount that the local panchayat pays to the group will be used to pay back the loan through EMI and the revenue generated will be distributed among the group members.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Krishna district collector B Lakshmikantham said particulate matter has reduced to 82 µg/m3 from 102 µg/m3 in Vijayawada after the introduction of sweeping machines. In addition to this, they will be creating jobs. “We are planning to give the machines to Dalits, so that they avail the subsidy as well as earn money on a regular basis. They will become owners of the machine over a period,” said the collector. There are 970 village panchayats, 150 major panchayats and 5 municipalities in Krishna district.
