 In the eight months through November, new land allotments to industrial units declined by half to 98.63 acre compared to 192 acre in the same period last year, according to the documents in possession of TOI. Even though the rot already started in the previous year as land allotments fell to 353.51 acre in 2016-17 compared to 434.23 acre in 2015-16, but the indifference continued. The same story of neglect can also be seen in new land acquisition.
