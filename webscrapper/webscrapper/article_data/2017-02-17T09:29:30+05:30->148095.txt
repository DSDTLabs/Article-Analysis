PUNE:   ( ), the nodal body for the trade of pulses in the country, recently submitted a representation to the government urging it to review and remove the current export ban on pulses in the country.

 Sources in IPGA said higher yields could create glut conditions impacting farmers' incomes, while exports could help in balancing out price dips.
 
 The representation, with the association's views, has been sent to the ministry of commerce and industry.
 
 The IPGA said, while the severe drought-like conditions of 2006-07 had forced the government to impose an export ban on pulses, the scenario is different today. It argued that the government's focus on developing a long term, sustainable solution in creating a larger domestic supply base of pulses can happen only if the farmer is incentivized to view pulses as a profitable crop.
 
 According to IPGA sources, the country is expecting high domestic production of 21 million tonnes of pulses this year. “While the government has been quick to take proactive steps to procure the produce, the quantities obtained are still low and more measures are needed to ensure feasible prices to farmers,“ the representation said.
 
 IPGA proposed that the removal of export ban on pulses will enable farmers to get an additional source of revenue apart from selling in the domestic market and will level out spikes and troughs, beside giving elbow room to government to manage prices better during shortages.
 
 As per the IPGA, resuming pulses export will help reduce the number of farmers moving from production of pulses to other remunerative crops.
 
 Pravin Dongre, chairman, IPGA said, “This is an opportune time to remove the ban and enable exports of pulses from the country , especially in the current scenario of rising production, prices falling below the minimum support price and government's intention to bring agricultural reforms.“
