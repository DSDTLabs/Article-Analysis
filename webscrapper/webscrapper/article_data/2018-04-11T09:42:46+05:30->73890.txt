PANAJI: The Dubai court's 500-year sentence awarded to their son on Sunday has left  's family distraught. "We're completely shocked and down,"  , father of the 25-year-old, told TOI from Siolim. 

 "He's innocent and has been made a scapegoat. I feel the judgement is unfair. How can Ryan receive the same sentence as the owner  ?" There has been a mix up. Ryan was not  ' right hand man as he is being made out to be. He only worked in accounts for four months before the company was sealed. Lemos' right hand man, the sales manager has managed to escape," Martires said.
 
 Ryan completed his   in Tourism and Travel Management and was a footballer who played in the professional league in Goa. "He was picked up by Lemos' football team   in Dubai and later roped into the company in June 2014." 
 
 "He worked as an office administrator till February 2016 when he was promoted to senior accounts specialist. On the whole he worked for four months in accounts, before the Dubai department of economic development sealed the company in June. How can they say he's responsible?" he said, adding that Ryan resigned from the company and as his visa was due to expire, he decided to return to Goa.
 
 "He was detained at the airport on February 10, 2017, with allegations that the company was involved in a fraud. They took his statement and kept extending his detention," Martires said. 
 
 "My son was just an employee. There were so many young boys and footballers from Goa who were employed by the company," he said, adding that his family too invested in the company and had two accounts of US $25,000 each.
 
 Martires doesn't blame Lemos for the catastrophe either. "There is a clause that states that there is a risk involved in investing in stock markets. He should have kept account of where he invested his money," Martires said.
