Kozhikode:   Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday urged all political parties in the state to end   and asked people to isolate forces that create violence.

 “Politicians should understand that they are not enemies. They just differ in their ideologies and in the means they adopt to serve people,” Naidu said, adding that party workers should use their political ideology for the welfare of the community.
 
 Naidu’s remarks come in the backdrop of political violence in Kannur where Youth Congress leader S P Shuhaib was murdered earlier this week. 
 
 Inaugurating a seminar as part of the Ruby Jubilee Celebration of the legal career of BJP leader P Sreedharan Pillai, Naidu said the ballot was more powerful than the bullet and had the power to change the world.
 
 The Vice-President also praised the residents of Kozhikode for organizing a mega event to honour the literary and legal skills of Pillai, who is also a political leader. He said: “It is appreciable that leaders of various political parties have come together to felicitate one who follows a different ideology”.
 
 Speaking about secularism, Naidu said it was safe in India. “Secularism in India is not the contribution of any political party. It is there in the DNA of India,” he said.
