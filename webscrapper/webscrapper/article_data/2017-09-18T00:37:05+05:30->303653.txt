 She grabbed everyone’s attention when she participated in one of the first seasons of the mega reality show,  , a few years ago. Even though it had been a while since she had given up films,   was the cynosure of all eyes with her glam turnout on the reality show. Now, the actor is back once more on the small screen and this also happens to be her debut fiction show. Chandrika is part of the serial Eradu Kanasu and we spotted her hotting up the scenes like she always does. The actor did a special number as part of a wedding scene in the serial and her act upped the ante of the proceedings. Her role though, we hear, is being kept under wraps and the only aspect audiences are privy to is that she is staying with the protagonist Rudra Pratap’s family, who incidentally is being played by veteran actor Srinath.
