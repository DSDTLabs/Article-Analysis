NEW DELHI: The social justice ministry is set to write to the law ministry to file an appeal against the   judgment on SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, with a demand that the original law be restored. The apex court earlier this week said the POA Act was being misused and ruled that the police conduct a preliminary inquiry before lodging a case under the stringent law. 

 
 It also introduced the provision of anticipatory bail in the law. The top court’s order sparked a row after principal opposition party   took the lead in protesting the “dilution” of the POA Act and accused the   government of not adequately defending the law during the hearing. After hectic discussions among the BJP leadership, the government has finalised its stance. 
 
 Sources said social justice minister   will soon sign a note to be forwarded to the law ministry seeking an appeal against the judgment. The social justice ministry argues that all categories of crimes under the POA Act, from administrative to heinous to symbolic casteist atrocity, should result in an FIR against the accused. 
 
 According to sources, the ministry is of the opinion that the original Act, as it existed before the apex court judgment, should be restored. Junior minister for social justice   questioned the order and said the government would file an appeal. Pressure within the saffron camp against what is being called “dilution” of the POA Act is rising, with the constitutional Dalit watchdog taking the lead. 
 
 The National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) shot off letters to the PM and the President on Friday demanding that the court order be challenged. A decision on the issue was taken in a meeting on Thursday. Also, sources said, the NCSC has sought time from the PM and the President with the idea of conveying the demand in person.
