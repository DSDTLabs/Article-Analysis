Eat for the season, practitioners of alternative medicine say. By this diktat, when the weather turns hot and sultry and appetites run weak as lethargy takes over, it is time to turn to Nature’s basket for produce that refreshes and cleanses the palate.

 This time of the year is definitely sweet-sour squashes/juices and salad time, and while Goans may not be big on the later, the three delicious thirst quenchers we whip out form the hallmark of the summer months — mango panha (a squash prepared out of raw mango pulp), kokum juice, and squash of the less heard of karmala or star fruit (Averrhoa carambola).
 
 Sadly not many prepare star fruit squash, despite India being one of the largest producers of this tropical and sub-tropical fruit that is easily recognizable from the five distinct ridges it bears.
 
 It is a sweet-sour fruit and is preferred in hinterlands not so much because it is rich in anti-oxidant properties and vitamin C inasmuch as the fruit with it sour bite easily lends itself to a variety of preparations, including pickles, preserves and squashes.
 
 The slightly crunchy raw fruit can be simply munched on with a dash of salt to balance the flavours. If you are ready to put in a little more effort, a pickle can be readied in a jiffy. Or simply toss it into the prawn curry as a souring agent, instead of tamarind or bimbli. In short, where there is a need for the tart drop in the star. 
 
 Coming to ‘the’ summer-friendly concoction prepared from the fruit, pick out the juicier riper variety.
 
 Boil the fruit for 15-20 minutes and when cool grind it with a dash of cardamom and cumin seeds. Filter the pulp and boil once again with half a kilogram of jaggery. Your squash is ready. All you need to do is add cool water to two tablespoons of this concentrate and a spot of salt.
 
 The drink, besides packing cooling properties has several health benefits. However, those suffering from kidney disorders cannot partake it.
