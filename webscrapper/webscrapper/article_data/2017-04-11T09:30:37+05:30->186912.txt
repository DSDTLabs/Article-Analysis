The petitioner had requested that in the old premises on  , old there was a temple, but on the new campus, there was no place for worship for lawyers, court employees and litigants. The petitioner demanded that a place should be earmarked for the purpose.
 
 Consigning the petition to records, the bench said, “There is nothing which can impel us to conclude that the high court's administration is under an obligation to earmark any particular place allowing those coming inside the premises to practise their religion and worship in their own form. Such obligations and rights can be performed by the individuals and communities in the vicinity outside the premises where such facilities are commonly available.”
