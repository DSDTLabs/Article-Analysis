 For an album that took four years in the making, it seems British pop star James Blunt has given his fifth studio album, which released on March 24, a considerable amount of time. Was it worth the wait? Hardly.
 The 10-track-long album, with three bonus/ extended tracks is a mix of pop, house and EDM, showing that Blunt has moved on with times. The standout tracks are easily ' ', which alternates between peppy and moody, and has the singer take a dig at his own biggest hit, 'You’re Beautiful'. The next one, 'Bartender', is a well-written song and clearly a club number. His finest writing though, is on 'Courteney’s Song', where he pays tribute to the late actress Carrie Fisher. Blunt has also collaborated with buddy   as a writer on 'Make Me Better' and 'Time of Our Lives', which are just about okay, and Sheeran’s star power still can’t turn them to chart toppers. Still, the effort and humour throughout the album is commendable.
