NEW DELHI: The   on Thursday filed a chargesheet against   chief Hafiz Saeed, Hizbul Mujahideen head   and 10 others in the Jammu and Kashmir terror funding case alleging that they along with their Pakistani handlers, separatists, stone-pelters and terrorists are creating an atmosphere of terror and fear in Kashmir.

 Apart from global terrorists Hafiz Saeed and Syed Salahuddin, the NIA has named seven separatists - Aftab Ahmad Shah, Altaf Ahmad Shah alias Funtoosh, Nayeem Ahmad Khan, Farooq Ahmad Dar, Mohammad Akbar Khandey, Raja Mehrajuddin Kalwal and Bashir Ahmad Bhat; a prominent businessman from valley - Zahoor Ahmad Watali and two stone pelters/organisers Kamran Yousuf and Javed Ahmed Bhat in its chargesheet.
 
 The agency filed a 12,794 page chargesheet at   court in New Delhi. During its probe in the first ever major investigation against separatists, the NIA raided 60 locations last year, examined 300 witnesses and analysed 950 incriminating documents and 600 electronic devices.
 
 According to the investigation agency, the threadbare scrutiny and analysis of the documents and digital devices established that the accused persons i.e. the Hurriyat leaders, the terrorists and the stone-pelters are carrying out terrorist attacks and orchestrating violence, stone-pelting and other subversive and secessionist activities in Jammu & Kashmir as a part of their well- planned criminal conspiracy hatched with the active support, connivance and funding from terrorist organisations based in Pakistan and its agencies to achieve their objective of secession of the State of Jammu & Kashmir by waging war against the Government of India.
 
 The chargesheet added that "the secessionist and separatist leaders belonging to the All Parties Hurriyat Conference have established a network of cadres throughout Kashmir Valley who incite the youth to attack all symbols of Indian sovereignty, especially Indian security forces who are deployed there for the maintenance of law and order."
 
 "Under the overall guidance and instructions from Hafiz Saeed, Syed Salahuddin and their Pakistani handlers, the separatist leaders of Jammu & Kashmir and stone-pelters form strategies and action-plans to launch violent protests and communicate the same to the masses in the form of 'protest calendars' released through newspapers, social media and religious leaders, creating an atmosphere of terror and fear in the State of Jammu & Kashmir," said the NIA.
 
 "The investigation based on scientific and oral evidences has conclusively established that for carrying out all these terrorist and subversive activities, the gang of the accused persons is receiving funds from Pakistani agencies through hawala conduits such as A-10 Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali and others and are also raising funds by generating illegal profits from LoC barter trade by doing under-invoicing and cash-dealings. The money is also routed through fake and bogus companies floated abroad and remitted to the Hurriyat leaders in Jammu & Kashmir. All these funds are then pumped by them into fuelling mass violence and terrorist activities so as to cause damage to public property, disrupt the essential services throwing normal life in Jammu & Kashmir into chaos with an intention to threaten the unity, integrity and sovereignty of India by striking terror in the minds of the public and by waging war against the Government of India," the agency added.
