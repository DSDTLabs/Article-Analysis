TV presenter   said she secretly messages wrestler-actor Dwayne   Johnson   and even wants to marry him.

 McCall, 50, thinks Johnson seems like the 'nicest guy' and she wants him to propose, even though he has a long-term pregnant girlfriend  
  
  
  
 "I think   is hardworking, gives more than is expected, funny... I want to meet him. He's so big, I'd have to climb up his thigh," McCall told.
 
 She added: "I have a blue tick next to my name so I'm sort of thinking, do you think Dwayne Johnson is going to look at his tweets and go, 'Oh hang on, there's a blue tick from a British girl, I'm gonna click on her. And oh, she seems like a nice person, I'm going to answer her'." 
 McCall split from   last year after 17 years of marriage.
 
 Johnson, meanwhile, is expecting his first child with Hashian. The two have been dating since 2007.
