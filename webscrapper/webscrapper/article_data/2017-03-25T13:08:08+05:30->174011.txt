PATNA: Two days after Uttar Pradesh chief minister   banned chewing pan masala and use of plastic bags in government offices,   deputy CM   on Friday dared him to enforce a complete liquor ban in his state if he was a real ‘yogi’ (saint).
 
  “If Aditya Nath Yogi is a true votary of ‘dharma’ (religion) and a ‘yogi’ in real sense, he should first issue orders for total prohibition in his state like Bihar and then take tough action on the lines of the grand alliance government to enforce the ban,” Tejashwi said here.
  
  Tejashwi asked the UP CM to form an ‘anti-liquor squad’, in the lines of his anti-Romeo squad, to enforce the ban.
  
  “Yogiji please do not deviate people’s mind ‘edhar-udhar’ (here and there). First enforce liquor ban. Liquor is more dangerous than gutkha and pan masala. The ‘yogis’ and ‘sanyasis’ always talk against addiction and use of liquor,” Tejashwi tweeted.
  
  JD(U) spokesperson   said that his party too appealed Yogi to ban liquor.
  
  Earlier on March 18, Tejashwi had dubbed the BJP’s decision to make Aditya Nath Yogi UP chief minister as BJP’s “biggest mistake”. He also said that Yogi was “inept” for the CM post, inviting sharp criticism from   functionaries.
