Nagpur: The civil court of AV Dixit has rejected the anticipatory bail application of prominent chartered accountant   of M/s Demble & Ramani along with that of Kamlesh Dadhe of Divya Builders in a multi-crore land dispute.

 The duo had filed for the anticipatory bail following a complaint by Naved Ali of M/s Pyramid Realtors with the special investigating team (SIT) on June 17 last year. The   was appointed by the government following large number of alleged fraudulent land deals in the city and fleecing of innocent customers by land sharks exposed in the Gwalabanshi episode.
 
 Naved Ali has almost a decade old dispute running with Demble and Dadhe. Pyramid Realtors had in the complaint before SIT alleged that they had paid Rs18.22 crore to them but they failed to deliver the promised 8.5 acres of land at Chinchbhuvan on Wardha Road. 
 
 The complainant also alleged that 6.5 acres of the land was under DP reservation, a fact deliberately not disclosed by Demble and Dadhe while signing the deal.
 
 After Aliâ€™s complaint, the duo entered a fresh agreement with Pyramid for a settlement but just then they got an inkling that the SIT was being wound up and the duo kept postponing registration of the land. The complainant again took up the matter with the SIT on September 25. 
 
 Taking advantage of the wrapping up of SIT on October 24 last year, Demble and Dadhe applied for ad-interim bail though no FIR was filed against them till that date at the Sonegaon police station. The ad-interim bail was granted but the anticipatory bail application was rejected by the court on January 9.
