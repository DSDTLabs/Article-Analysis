MYSURU: Though there have been demands to reopen Mysuru   with even the CM setting a month’s deadline, the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals, Bengaluru, director SM Byregowda on Saturday made it clear that the zoo has to remain closed for a month as per guidelines and its reopening depends on sample test results.

 Mysuru Zoo is the fourth zoo to be closed in India following reported incidents of   influenza. Delhi Zoo was earlier closed in October and those in Gwalior and Rourkela (Odisha) have remained shut for the past one month.As per national-level guidelines, an infected area will have virus presence for nearly a month, and hence it was decided to shut the zoo for the said period, the director claimed appreciating the efforts taken by the zoo authorities. 
 
 Though there are no reports of the H5N8 virus spreading to humans, the authorities have decided to restrict entry of visitors for 30 days as a precautionary measure. “Humans may act as carriers of the virus. There are also chances that human intervention might lead to surfacing of new intermixed viruses,” said Byregowda, who is also the nodal officer for avian influenza in Karnataka. 
 
 “Since the incident was reported in an enclosed area, it would be easy to take biosecurity measures to prevent spread of the virus. There are no guidelines to cull birds in captivity in case of reported avian influenza in zoos, unlike in poultries,” he added. 
 
 Byregowda said that the chief minister too had stressed on reopening the zoo as early as possible. “But we explained to him during the meeting in Bengaluru about the national guidelines to ensure the place is disinfected completely,” he said. 
 
 Pointing out that the Delhi Zoo is still closed to visitors, the director said he would recommend to the   to reopen   when two consecutive samples test negative. The first sample test result has come negative, he said, expressing hope of a similar result in the second test too.
