It’s been widely speculated that   will play a dual role in her upcoming film, Madhesh’s horror action thriller  . While one role is that of a baker, we have now learnt from reliable sources that the other is that of an architect.

 The source tells us, “Yes, Trisha plays a double role in the film, and both are distinctly different from each other. She plays a baking enthusiast who also records and uploads her recipes on her own blog, and she also plays an architect. While there aren’t much differences in her physical appearances in the two roles, Trisha had to work hard on the different body language required for them. Her manner of speaking, too, will be distinct in each of her two roles.”
