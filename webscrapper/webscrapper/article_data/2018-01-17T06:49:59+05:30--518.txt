 NPS subscribers can withdraw money for treatment of specified illnesses for himself, legally wedded spouse, including a legally adopted child and dependent parents. Subscribers can withdraw money for hospitalisation and treatment for cancer, end stage renal failure, primary pulmonary arterial hypertension, multiple sclerosis, major organ transplant, coronary artery bypass graft, aorta graft surgery, heart valve surgery, stroke, myocardial infraction, coma, total blindness, paralysis, accident of serious/life threatening nature and any other illness of a life threatening nature stipulated in the circulars, guidelines or notifications issued by PFRDA from time to time.
