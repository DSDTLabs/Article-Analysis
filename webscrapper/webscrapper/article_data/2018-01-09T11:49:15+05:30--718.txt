  Alongside a photo of herself bundled up in a jacket, she wrote, "I was sexually abused and physically growing up from the day I can remember till I was 14, when I finally had the courage to lock my door at night and sit by it. All damn night. Waiting for someone to take advantage of my life again. Over and over I waited for it to stop and finally it did."
 
  
  
  
  She added, "But some of us aren't as lucky to get out alive. Please today stand up for every soul Mistreated."
