Visakhapatnam: The forest department has begun setting up fences from Kambalakonda Wildlife Sanctuary to the ACA-VDCA cricket stadium in PM Palem as well as in Seethakonda area in view of the frequent instances of wild animals from the forests straying towards the highway. The fencing also needs to be extended towards Visalakshinagar zoo area.

 Animals like deer, wild boar, sambars, civets and jungle cats are often spotted out of the sanctuaries and have the risk of being run over. Even though, road kills have not been recorded, but the risk is present and at times some of the wild species get chased or attacked by stray dogs.
 
 The fencing that existed earlier around the reserved forest area was damaged during cyclone Hudhud and animals at times kept straying towards the highway.
 
 Divisional forest officer (DFO) Alan Chong Teron said: “To prevent the animals from escaping, we have repaired the fences and laid new ones for around one-and-a-half kilometres from Animal Rescue Centre up to the nursery near PM Palem cricket stadium. There are proposals for some more including along the Seethakonda reserve forest, for about two kilometres.”
 
 There is also a need for fencing from zoo to Visalakshinagar last lane, as wild animals are often spotted escaping from the forest to feed on the food waste that is dumped by locals. “Vehicles passing through the stretch may hit an animal at night. There needs to be fencing around all such vulnerable forest areas to prevent road kills,” said Chilakala Malakonda, a local resident.
 
 Meanwhile, the forest department is awaiting World Bank funds. They have selected six companies for technical and financial bids of which one will prepare the detailed project report, based on which renovation works can be carried on in Kambalakonda and other reserve forests, the DFO said.
