FATEHGARH SAHIB: The public accounts committee (PAC) of Punjab assembly, led by its chairperson  , took stock on Wednesday of alleged misappropriation of public funds in the construction of a cattle fair ground on the GT Road at Nabipur village here. 

 The ground was built for Rs 7.5 crore. The committee comprising legislators Harpartap Singh Ajnala, Nirmal Singh, Satkar Kaur, Sangat Singh Gilzian and   held the meeting with panchayati raj department director   at the local Bachat Bhawan, after which they inspected the ground.
 
 The committee found serious lapses in the construction of the ground. It was noticed that potholes filled with water had appeared all over the surface even though Rs 19.88 lakh was spent on raising the level of the ground in 2016. The shelters for cattle were dilapidated even though they were not yet operational.
 
 The committee asked the panchayati raj department director to fix responsibility for the irregularities. Nagra said it was beyond doubt that public funds were not put to proper use.
 
 The committee also issued directions to ensure holding of regular cattle fairs here from October 2 to make it convenient for livestock-keepers of   and the adjoining districts to buy and sell cattle. Fatehgarh Sahib additional deputy commissioner (development)   was asked to ensure proper sanitation.
