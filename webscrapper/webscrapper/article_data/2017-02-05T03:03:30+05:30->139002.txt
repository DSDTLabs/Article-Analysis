NEW DELHI:   on Saturday demanded that Prime Minister   take back his remarks in which he reportedly alluded to PoK as “Pakistani territory”. AICC spokesperson Tom Vadakkan lashed out at   for his speech in Meerut where he spoke about surgical strikes on Pakistani land.

 “My simple question to the PM is when he says that this operation took place on ‘Pakistan ki dharti’, I want to know when did PoK become part of Pakistan’s territory. The PM should make it clear,” he said. “If anybody else in any political party had said this, he would be immediately painted as anti-national.
 
 The PM needs to withdraw the statement,” he added. AICC also criticised Modi for using the abbreviation ‘SCAM’ for BJP’s political rivals —Samajwadi Party, Congress, Akhilesh and Mayawati. “Instead of delivering or what the road map ahead is, we hear him speak in abbreviations. He is extremely worried because he has realized what demonetisation has done across the country,” Vadakkan said.
 
 He said SCAM actually stands for “Satta bhogi, kapti dhongi Amit Shah Modi”. The Congress spokesman also showed a video of the wife of BSF jawan Tej Bahadur Yadav who he alleged has been kept in illegal detention since he put out a video of the alleged poor quality food provided to BSF jawans.
 
 “I want to draw your attention to a surgical strike on the dignity and honour of a BSF jawan,” he said, demanding an inquiry into the allegations of constable Yadav.
