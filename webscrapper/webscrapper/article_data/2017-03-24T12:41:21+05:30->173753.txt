INDORE: The evaluation work of the ongoing Class X and XII exam of   has begun across the state on Thursday. MPBSE has made elaborate arrangements to ensure timely publication of results and error-free and hassle free evaluation process.

 The answer sheets will be checked at 51 districts and selected teachers have been involved in the evaluation process. The board aims to complete the evaluation process in time to ensure timely announcement of MPBSE results.
 
 “The evaluation work has started and we are expecting to finish the work on time. The examination for both the classes will get over by the end of March,” said SK Chaurasia, spokesperson from MPBSE.
 
 "Board officials have provided special orientation to examiners, who have been selected for the evaluation work. To check erratic evaluation, the board has formed teams, comprising five teachers in each team. The answer sheets checked by the teachers will be verified by in-charges appointed by the board. Action will be taken against examiners who will be found guilty of dereliction of duty or faulty evaluation, said board officials.
 
 List containing names of teachers selected for evaluation work has been uploaded on the Board's website. Teachers have been asked to download the list and report to their respective exam centres.
 
 In Indore the evaluation work is going on at   at Moti Tabela like the previous year. Teachers have been asked to be active and finish the work on time else Indore once again will be left behind in completing the evaluation process on time like last year.
 
 During the 2016 board exam evaluation a number of teachers had been absent from the evaluation work despite a number of notices and that had caused the delay in finishing off the evaluation process.
