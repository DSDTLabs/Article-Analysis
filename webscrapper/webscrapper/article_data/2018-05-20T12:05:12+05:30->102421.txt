HYDERABAD: Cyberstalking, online blackmail and harassment seems to be becoming an upsetting trend in the city, with over five cases being recorded in the past two months. But the number of FIRs filed is in no way an indication to the extent of the problem as only a few women choose to approach the cops in such cases.

 
 “Only 20% of the women who face social media harassment and cyberstalking file an FIR. Mostly, victims end up giving only verbal complaints fearing society,” said D  , assistant commissioner of police, She Team.
 
 This is because several victims were in relationships with the accused in the past. “There have been several cases of stalking where the victim was in a physical relationship with the accused. Later, when the relationship ends, the man stalks, blackmails and harasses her to take revenge,” Kavitha added.
 
 On Friday, cyber crime police solved a similar case in which the accused had uploaded photos and videos of his ex-girlfriend on porn websites and was blackmailing her for money and sexual favours.
 
 Last year, the cyber crime police recorded 24 cyberstalking cases. Shockingly, 15% of the victims were minor girls. They are particularly afraid to file cases for fear of action from parents.
