KOCHI: With railways beginning the process of demolishing the old   railway overbridge ( ) in a hush-hush manner, Kochi is losing the footprints of a foregone era.

 Though railways argued that it has hundreds of such old bridges that can’t be retained, it couldn’t even document the features of the bridge which has much historical importance. In 1930s, it was the Venduruthy old railway bridge that led to the extension of train services to the city centre and west Kochi.
 
 “It was in 1902 that the construction of   railway line was finished. Then, train services started from old railway station near the high court. Following the construction of railway overbridge at Venduruthy, five more stations came up in Kochi – Ernakulam Town, Ernakulam Junction, Perumanoor, Mattancherry and   (CHT),” said  , former civic body official.
 
 “The railway bridge is of much historical importance. So, there should have been some sort of measure to protect it. If the protection was difficult, authorities should have documented the features of the entire bridge. The bridge had been constructed using riveting technology. Steel for construction of the bridge was imported from  ,” Sohan said.
 
 People from across the country who travel to foreign countries like the USA used to board ships from Kochi. “Food grains, cement and other goods imported from different countries were transported to different parts of the country through trains from CHT,” Sohan said.
