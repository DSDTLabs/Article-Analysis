AGRA: Mafia don turned politician, DP Yadav's nephew, Jitendra Yadav, who recently quit BSP to join BJP, has been allotted ticket for Sahaswan constituency in Budaun.

 DP Yadav, who had launched   in 2007, had fought and won from this constituency. Just before the 2012 election, he had tried to join the  , but was denied entry by Akhilesh Yadav.
 
 Sahaswan is considered a stronghold of the SP due to Muslim-Yadav domination, is set to witness a triangular political contest this time with two Yadavs and one Muslim in the fray. While the BJP is laying its bets on Jitendra Yadav, the SP has announced the candidature of sitting MLA and state minister, Omkar Singh Yadav, and the BSP has fielded Arshad Ali. The BJP's decision to announce a ticket for Jitendra has, however, caused heartburn among local leaders with many seeing him as a “paratrooper“ dropped on them from the top. The fact that he is related to D P Yadav is adding fuel to fire, with many local leaders questioning the decision. A local leader, on condition of anonymity , said, “It seems now the BJP, which was called the party with a difference, has no qualms in joining hands with crime lords through their relatives." The leader also predicted that the decision would backfire, as Jitendra joined the party less than a year ago.
 
 Jitendra, however, claimed that joining the BJP was a “homecoming“ for him, as he was with the party in 2005, as zila panchayat member. He said he subsequently joined the BSP and was elected MLC. Sources in the BJP claimed that D P Yadav was also trying for a ticket for his brother-in-law but could manage one for his nephew only. D P Yadav was at one time very close to Mulayam Singh Yadav and was a minister in his government. He also held the post of general secretary in the SP.
