Filmmaker   is known for her out-of-the-box conceptualization when it comes to her films. Her next film again reiterates the same. This film is a   project about Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “We aren’t trying to showcase his political ideologies or his manifestos. Instead, this will try and showcase a side to him that hardly anyone knows. This film will see his journey from a youngster till now and all his spiritual beliefs that have made him the world-renowned diplomat that he is,” says Roopa. She adds, “Not many know that he used to do theatre as a child and also participated in debate competitions. I am meeting with his mother next week and getting to know more such information that we will incorporate in the film. We’re yet to cast for the film. We will have different actors playing   the child, the youth and the Prime Minister.”
