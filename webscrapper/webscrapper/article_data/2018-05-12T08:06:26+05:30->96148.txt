CHENNAI :   BJP president Tamilisai Soundararajan on Friday raised political eyebrows in the state by stating that the resolution process for the   issue was delayed due to elections in Karnataka. She also went on to say that all political parties indulge in such politics from time to time.

 “The process to resolve the Cauvery issue (recommending a scheme as directed by the Supreme Court) by the Centre is delayed due to elections in Karnataka. Hence, we had sought time before the court,” Tamilisai told reporters in Trichy.
 
 She said, the party had no qualms in accepting this. “The   will come to power in Karnataka. Once that happens, the Karnataka government will release water in Cauvery,” Tamilisai Soundararajan said.
 
 When the DMK and the   were in alliance for 10 years and ruling at the Centre they failed to do anything to resolve this issue, she said. “We had just asked for a few days, since elections were taking place in Karnataka. There is nothing wrong in it. All political parties indulge in such politics from time to time,” she said.
 
 It may be recalled that the Supreme Court had directed the Centre to recommend a scheme to resolve the Cauvery issue by May 3. But, the Centre had sought additional time of 10 days, citing the preoccupation of Prime Minister   and others with the Karnataka elections. 
 
 After reminding the Centre that it was supposed to come up with the scheme by May 3, the   had posted the next hearing to May 14.
