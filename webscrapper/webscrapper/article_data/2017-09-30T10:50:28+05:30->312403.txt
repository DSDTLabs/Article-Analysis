PUNE: Santosh alias Lubhya Chandilkar, a 36-year-old   on   record, who had escaped along with two of his accomplices while being brought back to Yerawada jail from a Khandala court in Satara district by a Pune police escort team on April 10, was arrested in Walwa, Sangli, on Wednesday.

 While on the run, Chandilkar had formed a new gang of criminals and committed eight serious offences in Satara and Pune districts, including the kidnapping of Kothrud-based businessman Suhas Bafana and robbing a cellphone of a scrap vendor in Hinjewadi.
 
 Investigations revealed that Chandilkar and his three accomplices had abducted Bafana (51) on September 5 for a ransom of Rs 50 lakh. Bafana was in their custody for three days and was released on September 8, on the promise of giving the ransom amount later. After the Kothrud police confirmed the involvement of Chandilkar in Bafana’s kidnapping, nine teams comprising nine police officers and 125 policemen were deployed to nab Chandilkar.
 
 Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Pankaj Dahane received a tip-off that Chandilkar was at Walwa in one of his accomplices house. “Crime branch inspectors Raghunath Jadhav and Sitaram More rushed to the spot and arrested Chandilkar with the help of the Sangli police,” Pune police commissioner Rashmi Shukla said on Friday in a news conference.
 
 Shukla said the police would have arrested Chandilkar in the last week itself. “We had perfect leads too, but around the same time, seven-year-old Om Kharat was kidnapped from Chinchwad. Our main concern was Om’s safety and his rescue. As soon as Om was released on September 25, our team immediately rushed to nab Chandilkar,” Shukla added.
 
 Late on Friday night, crime branch sleuths arrested Chandilkar’s accomplice Aba Sawant (25), a resident of Walwa and who had helped him in Bafana’s abduction. The police have also recovered two cars, a country-made pistol, six cellphones, a knife and a digital camera from Chandilkar.
