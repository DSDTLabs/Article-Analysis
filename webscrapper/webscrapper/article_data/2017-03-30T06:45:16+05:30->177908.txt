HYDERABAD: Disturbed by the attacks on Nigerian nationals in Greater Noida,   students in Hyderabad express their anxiety.

 “My parents sent us to India to study not to be killed,” an   in the city said. ‘Rambo’ George is from South India and is studying law in Osmania University. “I simply could not watch the videos of the Nigerians being beaten up. I am deeply hurt,” George said referring to the incident on March 27 in a mall.
 
  The 20,000 strong students from as many as 24 African countries in the city are equally disturbed at the attacks. George said if anyone has committed a crime, they should be punished as per law. “But mob attacks on Nigerian nationals have completely discouraged us. Are we not humans? It is better we go back to our own country,” an emotional George said.
 
 This appears to be the feeling of most African students in the city. “Hyderabad is a friendly city. We have had no problems here. People are good to us,” said Peter O, president of African Students Association, Telangana. However, much as comfortable they are, Peter said they would be approaching the city police to express their fears in the wake of the incidents in Greater Noida.
 
  Peter who is from Nigeria is also studying law in Osmania University. He said a letter would also be addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and union minister for external affairs Sushma Swaraj seeking that security for African students has to be ensured.
 
 To express their anguish at the incident in Greater Noida, the African Students Association, Telangana, wants to hold a peaceful demonstration in the city for which they will seek police permission.
 
 Meanwhile, the Association of African Students in India (AASI) has said it would organise protests all over India. “We will ensure that a detailed report on the barbaric racism students are facing is sent to the high levels of African governments and heads of state,” ASSI president, Samuel T Jack said.
