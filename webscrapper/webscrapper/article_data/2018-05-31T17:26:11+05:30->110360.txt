SRINAGAR: In an audio clip released after the controversy involving Major Leetul Gogoi and a   woman at a hotel here, the Hizbul Mujahideen has asked girls from the Valley to desist from coming into contact with Army personnel as the former were being used as "honey trap" to catch militants. 

 
 "The Army has touched a new low by employing Kashmiri girls as honey trap after using them as spies," Hizbul commander   said in the audio clip. "We have received information that the Army is luring girls and using them to spy on mujahideen. The Army is blackmailing girls and pitting them against us," he said in the audio clip that has gone viral in the  .
 
 The audio clip comes days after Major Gogoi was briefly detained by the police along with the Kashmiri woman and a third person following an altercation over them getting a room in a Srinagar hotel. The woman had subsequently told a magistrate last week that Major Gogoi was her "Facebook friend" and that she had gone to see him "of her own free will".
