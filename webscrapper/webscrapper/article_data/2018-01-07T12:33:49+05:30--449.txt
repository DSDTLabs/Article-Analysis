RANCHI: Special CBI court judge Shiv Pal   recommended that all the 16 convicts in the fodder scam case related to the Deoghar treasury, including  , stay in an open jail where they could rear cattle. 

 While pronouncing sentences, he said 'gau palan' (cattle rearing) was a good option for the convicts as they have 'good knowledge of fodder and cattle medicine'. His direction came after one of the convicts requested him to reduce the quantum of sentence by six months so that he could obtain bail and stay with his family.
