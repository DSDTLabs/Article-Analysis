JAIPUR: City police arrested eight people and seized new currency notes worth Rs 31 lakh from their hotel room at   area of the city on Friday morning.

 Sindhi Camp police station had received information about a brawl at a hotel at 7.30 am on Friday, following which a team was sent to the hotel room which found new currency notes lying on the table and bed.
 
 According to ACP  , the cops quizzed eight people about the money, but they failed to provide any answer. “We have seized the money, and informed the   department about the police action. The rest of the probe into the matter would be carried out by the I-T department,” Pathak told TOI.
 
 Police said that hotel staff had called up the police station that some people are fighting over money inside a hotel room. When cops raided the room, the eight tried to flee but were arrested by the police force.
 
 “All currency notes are in the denomination of Rs 500 and Rs 2,000. We have arrested them for disrupting peace and law and order. Two people are from Rajasthan’s Pali and Nagaur districts, while the rest are from New Delhi,” the police said, adding that all accused are garment merchants and had booked the hotel room for a meeting which soon turned into an argument.
 
 “There was some dispute related to the payment of money due to which they fought with each other. We have informed the Income Tax department to check if the money is legitimate. The sleuths of I-T will determine the source of the money and take action against them as per I-T rules,” police official said on Friday.
