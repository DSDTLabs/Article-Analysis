MUMBAI: NCP president   on Saturday made it clear that if the   withdraws support to the state government, he will not bail out the BJP.

 “I am surprised that the Shiv Sena has terminated its alliance with the BJP but continues to be in the government. NCP will not support the BJP if Sena withdraws from the government,” he told mediapersons in Kolhapur.
 
 Pawar’s statement assumes significance as it was being believed that he was moving closer to Prime Minister   following his nomination for Padma Vibhushan and that he may bail out the BJP government.
 
 After the assembly election results in October 2014, NCP leader Praful Patel had declared support to the BJP, following which Devendra Fadnavis had staked claim for formation of the government. 
 
 On Saturday, Pawar also took a dig at Mumbai Congress president  , saying his contribution to the city was nil and activists were rallying around him only because he was chief of the party’s city unit. “Nirupam is a fool,” Pawar said.
 
 Nirupam declined to respond on Pawar’s comment but said that there were reasons to believe that there is a pact between the NCP and the BJP. “It’s a known fact that Pawar is moving closer to the BJP, particularly Modi. When the Shiv Sena was negotiating with the BJP, the NCP was insisting on an alliance with the Congress and now that the Shiv Sena has snapped ties with the BJP, it will not hesitate to ink a secret pact with the BJP,” Nirupam said.
 
 Meanwhile, state Congress president Ashok Chavan said that barring the  , Congress will join hands with the NCP in all municipal corporation and zilla parishad polls. “We are in the final stages, we will contest the elections with the NCP,” he said.
