HYDERABAD: The   on Tuesday warned striking   to return to duty before January 12 failing which it would be left with no option but to take strict action against them.

 Education minister   issued the warning saying that if the lecturers continued their strike, they would most likely lose out on regularisation of their services as promised recently by the state government. Srihari, also a deputy chief minister, said it was unfair for the lecturers to be on strike for demands that have already been addressed by the state government.
 
 He said the state had on February 26, 2016, issued a government order to regularise the services of contract lecturers working in junior colleges. While the government was prepared to implement its orders, he said, its hands have been tied following a case in the court against the order filed by a group of persons belonging to the   Joint Action Committee. “The government cannot take any action on regularisation of services until the court gives a final verdict,“ Srihari said.
 
 Referring to the other major demand of the striking lecturers, the deputy chief minister said, the government had decided to go ahead and increase wages by 50 per cent for contract lecturers. “Orders for the hike will be issued in the next two or three days," the minister said.
 
 With intermediate-level exams scheduled for February, Srihari asked the lecturers not to place the future of more than 1.7 lakh students in jeopardy by striking work. “If they fail to return to work and stay away from their duties for a period beyond 34 days, then regularisation of such persons may be affected,“ he said.
