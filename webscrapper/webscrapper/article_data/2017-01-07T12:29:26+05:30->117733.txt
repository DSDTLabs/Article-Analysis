NAGPUR: The state government-run  , operated by BVG   (MEMS), has turned forest officials into health warriors for  . Recently, in a pilot project,   were trained in first aid, to stabilize patients till an ambulance arrives. They have also been trained to summon ambulances over their walkie-talkies in emergencies, since poor phone connectivity in Melghat means tribals cannot always contact 108.

 Melghat in   district has eight 108 ambulances and since the launch on January 26, 2014, the ambulances have attended 9,436 calls.
 
 MEMS head (East Maharashtra) Dr Deepak Ukey said, “The villages are surrounded with forests, so ambulances often deal with snakebite and animal attack. But poor connectivity leads to huge gap in calling ambulances. Sometimes, calls from border areas in Melghat even get diverted to neighbouring states.”
 
 MEMS chief operating officer Dr Dnyaneshwar Shelke said, “To solve this problem, we have trained 346 officials. As Chikhaldara and Dharni stations have repeaters, their walkie-talkie calls can be directly connected to our base station at Pune. Officials in other areas have been told to directly call our ambulance driver or doctor.”
 
 Dr Shelke said, “We are proud that all officials now know how to establish connection with 108 and give first aid in the meanwhile.”
 
 The MEMS team trained 82 officials at Chikhaldhara, 49 at Kolkhas and Semadoh, 41 at Harisal, 65 at Dharni, and 109 at Shahnoor and Akot.
 
 Dr Ukey said, “The forest department has been extremely supportive. In fact, officials from other forest reserves like Navegaon and Karhandla too have approached us to get trained in first aid. After Melghat, MEMS is planning to launch similar projects at Gadchiroli and Nandurbar.”
