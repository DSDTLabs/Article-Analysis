Today is the day when we have to decide whether we take our rights seriously or not. Voting is a right that citizens of the country have and it’s time they realised its importance and exercised it.

 
 For years, many in the educated class, particularly in urban areas, haven’t bothered to vote. The common grouse has been that it does not make a difference whether one votes or not. This is a wrong perception. I do see change now, thanks to awareness programmes and the media, but it is very slow.
 
 These days, people are given NOTA (none of the above) as a choice at the voting centres. In case they disapprove of the candidates in the fray in their constituency they can always convey the message using the option.
 
 Having said that, I would want people to cast their vote if they are in town. Barring personal emergencies, this is one unmissable activity for today. Elections come once in five years and I am sure we can spare some time. It is not a valid excuse if people say they don’t have time.
 
 I have been very regular in exercising my franchise. This time too, my family and I will vote. We were away for two weeks, but have got back in time to cast our vote.
 
 Our offices at the badminton academy too will be closed today. This is an indirect message to our employees that voting is important.
 
 I am not pitching for any party in particular. But one thing I don’t want is a hung assembly and a coalition government. One party should get the majority, whichever party it may be. Compared to a coalition government, there are better chances of good governance and stability if a single party comes to power.
