Pronam, a joint initiative by   and The Bengal, a city-based NGO, for the elderly citizens of Kolkata, celebrated   at   on Wednesday. Along with 110 elderly members of Pronam, the event saw the presence of director Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury, culturist  , who is also the secretary general of   and fashion designer Agnimitra Paul, the joint convenor of   Project.

  
 Following the lamp lighting ceremony, the members of the organisation paid floral tributes and singer Madhabi Majumder performed Rabindrasangeet, Partha Chatterjee recited poems and read excerpts from Tagore’s works. “We cannot possibly measure the contribution of Tagore in Bengali literature. This is the smallest thing we can do to remember him,” said Sailen Basu, a member.
 
  
 “Pronam has now a membership of over 14,000 senior citizens in Kolkata and every day several senior citizens are expressing their wish to join the organisation. We are working on expanding the scope of the organisation in the coming years,” Sundeep Bhutoria.
 
  
 Pronam has a dedicated 24-hour helpline service for the senior citizens manned by specially trained Kolkata Police personnel and executives for receiving emergency calls and take follow up actions. The organisation also tries to sensitise the society about the plight of the elderly people and extend their support to them round the year. 
 The Bengal, on the other hand, is a city-based NGO which represents a group of conscientious and eminent citizens from across the state, drawn by the common zeal for social good and community service.
