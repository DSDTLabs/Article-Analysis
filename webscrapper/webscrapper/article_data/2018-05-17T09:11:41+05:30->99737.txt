GUNTUR: Many people are suffering from   due to the fast changing lifestyles, and the disease that was mostly found among the denizens of urban areas is also affecting those living in the rural parts of the state. 

 Most of the people are not aware of the ill-effects of hypertension, which is called silent killer. Doctors are worried over people’s misconceptions and wrong notions about   (hypertension), which often leads to sudden deaths. 
 
 “Leaving the hypertension untreated may result in dysfunction of vital organs like heart, brain and kidneys. Lack of awareness among people is making the disease more complex,” said noted cardiologist and managing director of Ramesh hospitals group, Dr Pothineni  . He added that like common people, many physicians also have misconceptions about measuring blood pressure. 
 
 “Everyone who has over 130/80mm Hg blood pressure should be treated for hypertension. Earlier, doctors considered 160/80 mm Hg as normal blood pressure rate, which was wrong,” he said. 
 
 Recent studies revealed that about 30 to 33 per cent of urban population as well as 24 per cent of   in the state have high blood pressure. Family issues, pressure at workplaces, financial issues, food habits and extended night life are cited as main reasons behind the disease. “Earlier, rural people would lead stress free life even with their meagre income. Now the situation has changed and many villagers are having high blood pressure these days,” said Dr PNS Haritha, a cardiologist. 
 
 According to Dr Ramesh Babu, blood pressure should be checked through automatic monitor as manual monitoring by physicians may also go wrong. Everyone, aged above 30 years, should check their blood pressure at least once in a year and those who have hypertension should do the same once in a month. 
 
 “Undergoing cardiac CT for calcium score will provide customised treatment to the patients of hypertension. The risk of stroke will be less in those people with normal calcium score even if they have high BP,” said Dr Ramesh Babu.
