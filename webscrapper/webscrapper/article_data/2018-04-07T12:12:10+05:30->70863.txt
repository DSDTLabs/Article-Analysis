Actress Manju Warrier is very much like every Malayali, who in their deepest of feelings would have an inclination towards the versatile actor that Mohanlal aka Lalettan is, and she grabbed the opportunity to show the world the fandom she has for the actor in real life, through the film Mohanlal. 

 The filmâ€™s second song Va Va Vo was out recently, and it is a lullaby, and features the characters played by actor Indrajith and Manju Warrier, who are awaiting a child. 
 The highlight of the song, however, is that it is sung by actress Nithya Menen, alongside Suchith Suresan. 
 
 Manju Warrier made sure to send Nithya Menen her token of love and gratitude on social media for lending her voice for the same. 
 
 The lines of the song composed by Tony Joseph Pallivathukal are penned by Manu Manjith. 
 
 Below is the song:-
