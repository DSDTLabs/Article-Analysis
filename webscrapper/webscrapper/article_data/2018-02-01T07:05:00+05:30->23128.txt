GURUGRAM: The GMDA at its first meeting on Wednesday finalised two road projects — both were announced a few years ago — that, once ready, will help reduce traffic snarls mainly in old Gurugram.

 The two projects are a four-lane   along with an underpass at   on Old Delhi-Gurugram Road and a six-lane road connecting Umang Bhardwaj Chowk with Dwarka Expressway.
 
 “A six-lane road from Umang Bhardwaj Chowk to Dwarka Expressway will be constructed at a cost of Rs 111 crore and the project will be allotted by August 15. Rs 81 crore will be spent on the construction of a flyover along with an underpass at   Chowk and the work will be awarded by May 1. This chowk is a bottleneck and requires a flyover and an underpass to ease snarls,” said chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who chaired the GMDA meeting.
 
 In 2013, the authorities had proposed a flyover on Hero Honda Road at Umang Bhardwaj Chowk. The PWD was supposed to build it while MCG was supposed to share the cost. But last year, the plan was amended to convert the stretch from Hero Honda Chowk to Basai into a six-lane thoroughfare connecting Dwarka Expressway. Huda is supposed to acquire the land while   is supposed to develop the project and MCG is to share the cost.
 
 Similarly, the flyover and the underpass at Atul Kataria Chowk were announced way back in July 2015 by the then MCG mayor. The chowk receives a huge volume of vehicles going from old Gurugram to Huda City Centre and other parts of new Gurugram.
 
 The chief minister said the government was working on software, ‘One Map Gurugram’, to keep tabs on encroachments, especially on government land. “Every month, mapping will be done to check if there has been any encroachment on public land. We will also have a GMDA meeting once every three months and the second meeting will be held before the end of three months since we need to discuss the budget among other things,” he added.
