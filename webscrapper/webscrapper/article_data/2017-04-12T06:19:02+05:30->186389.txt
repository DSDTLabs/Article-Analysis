HYDERABAD: In the wake of the   warning of extreme heat wave condition this summer, the   Board has asked the Telangana State Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (TSSPDCL) to provide uninterrupted power supply. 

 Except Osmansagar and  , the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Swerage Board (HMWS&SB) uses pumps to draw water from other sources like Singur/Manjeera, Krishna and Godavari. To pump Godavari water, the board utilises 18 megawatt (MW) through 220 KV sub-station and for Krishna water, it uses 12 MW power through 132 KV sub-station.
 
 “In view of high water consumption during summer, the Water Board is supplying 402 million gallons of water per day (MGD) to nearly 9.25 lakh consumers. For pumping water from reservoirs and supplying it to lakhs of consumers, we have to take more efforts to ensure uninterrupted water supply,” HMWS&SB general manager-electrical, P Anil Kumar, told TOI.
 
 For this, the Water Board has approached Telangana State Transco and Telangana State Northern Power Distribution Company Limited (TSNPDCL) authorities to provide uninterrupted power supply till the onset of monsoon. “Anticipating power cuts in summer, the Water Board has asked both TS Transco and TSNPDCL authorities to ensure uninterrupted power supply in the entire summer season,” he said.
 
 In another week, the Water Board will set up emergency pumps at Puttamgandi village of Nalgonda district to pump water from Nagarjunasagar reservoir and supply Krishna water to the city.
 
 The HMWS&SB pays Rs 50 crore monthly power bills, but during summer the bill usually increase upto Rs 65 crore.
