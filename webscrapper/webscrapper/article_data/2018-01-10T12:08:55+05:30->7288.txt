PUNE: Most cities in central  , some in   and a few in Vidarbha recorded below-normal day temperature on Tuesday as severe cold day condition prevailed over a number of places in Bihar, east   and other regions up north.

 The day temperature in this region was below normal by 1-2 degrees. Mahabaleshwar (23.2°C),   (27.2°C), Nasik (27.2°C) and   (27.5°C) were among the places experiencing a comparatively colder day in central Maharashtra.
 
 A Met department official told TOI that as the minimum temperature (ranging between 10-11°C) dropped in the city over the past few days, the day temperature dipped, too. “Pune is still better-off, because the day temperature in states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh are as low as the minimum temperature seen in peninsular India — 18-20°C. Pune normally sees low maximums in January and February, when the day temperature rarely crosses 30°C,” he said.
 
 A western disturbance over north India has brought another round of snow in regions like Jammu and Kashmir. Cool winds from the north are penetrating into Maharashtra, causing a dip in the day temperature. By January 12, both the day and night temperatures are expected to rise to 30°C and 12°C, respectively.
 
 On Tuesday, Shivajinagar’s day temperature was 1.5 degrees below normal, while that in Lohegaon was 28.1°C — 1.9 degrees below normal. The night temperature in Shivajinagar was near normal at 11°C and above-normal by 1.1 degrees in Lohegaon (13.1°C).
 
 Against this backdrop, many residents are starting to get winter-weary. Working professional   said while the afternoons had become pleasant, it was about time winter took a break. “Early mornings and nights now have that characteristic nip, which seeps into one’s skin when outdoors. The season is adding its share of pain to those vulnerable to body ache,” she said.
