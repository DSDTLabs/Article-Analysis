 AGRA/FIROZABAD: More than a year after the   banned  ,   in the state, the   continues to litter Agra, Firozabad and other neighbouring areas.  , primarily containing the ubiquitous yet harmful polythene bags, is seen beside roads and public spaces. The UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) had earlier raised objections over the lackadaisical approach of the municipal corporation and directed the civic body to carry out special drives in both Agra and Firozabad from May 20 to May 31. But UPPCB’s reprimand seemed to have fallen on deaf ears as no drives have been carried out by the civic body till date.
  
  District magistrate Gaurav Dayal said, “Plastics bags are one of the primary substances causing blockage of city drains. Polythene bags are casually thrown on the roads and these end up in sewers and drains. These items also cause soil pollution. A drive will be started in the city to ban its use.”
  
  When contacted, Firozabad municipal commissioner Pramod Kumar said a drive will be started this week here.
  
  Following the Allahabad high court’s order on November 18, 2015 the state government had imposed a complete ban on the use of polythene in UP from January 21, 2016. There is complete prohibition on the use of plastic even for covering books, magazines or invitation letters. Following the order, a drive was launched last year to discourage people from using polythene bags. But little seems to have come of it.
