BENGALURU: As the ‘resort politics’ returned to Karnataka with a bang, the Eagleton resort near Bidadi is getting decked up to receive Congress MLAs.

 With fears of intense poaching activities, post a fractured mandate in Karnataka, Congress decided to keep its flock together.
 
 To keep its bete noire BJP at bay, Congress has lent its support to the JD(S). Kanakapura MLA-elect   led MLAs in a luxury bus to Eagleton Resort.
 
 While the JD(S) MLAelect have camped in International hotel chain Shangri-La, Congress found the Eagleton Restort off Bidadi a safe location.
 
 Bidadi falls in Ramanagara, a JD(S) bastion — Congress’ new coalition partner.
 
 Tense moments prevailed when Vijayanagara Congress MLA was not reachable, though a winning Congress’ candidate went to meet him.
 
 The sprawling resort had hogged the limelight lastyear when Gujarat Congress MLAs camped there as Congress feared defection of MLAs ahead of the Rajya Sabha elections.
