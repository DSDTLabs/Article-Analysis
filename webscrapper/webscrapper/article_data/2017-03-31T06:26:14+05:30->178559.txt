BERHAMPUR: The women's wing of the Congress on Thursday demanded resignation of women and child development minister   as a 16-year old girl was recently raped by five persons in a jungle near Ankuli, the minister's constituency Chikiti in Ganjam district.

 "As the women and children are not safe in her constituency, she has no moral right to continue as the minister. She should resign immediately," said Sulochana Das, spokesperson of the Odisha pradesh Congress committee.
 
 A delegation of the Congress' women wing, headed by its president  , met inspector general of police, Berhampur, Amitabh Thakur and in-charge SP (Berhampur) Asish Singh and urged them to arrest the rapists immediately basing on the FIR lodged by the survivor. The delegation, however, could not meet the survivor, who is lodged in an observation home for girls, as they did not take prior permission from the collector.
 
 On Wednesday, the   and district unit of the CPM had demanded immediate arrest of the rapists.
 
 Meanwhile, police produced the survivor before the district child welfare committee after conducting medical test and recording her statement before the magistrate. No has been arrested yet. "We have followed the procedures and launched an investigation into the matter," said sub-divisional police officer, Chikiti, P C Jena. 
 
 The survivor on Tuesday complained before the SP that she was kidnapped by the five persons on March 9 and they raped her in the jungle for 10 days before leaving her there. They committed the crime because her father supported their opponent's candidate in the just-concluded panchayat elections, she alleged in her complaint.
