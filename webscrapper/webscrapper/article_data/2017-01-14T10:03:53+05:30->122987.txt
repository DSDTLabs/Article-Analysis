SURAT: There is a possibility of it being extremely a cold day in Surat on Saturday when the country would be celebrating   to mark the transition of the Sun into Capricorn on its celestial path.

 The minimum temperature has been hovering around 12 degree Celsius with 35 per cent humidity since January 11. The north-easterly wind has been blowing at a speed of 8km per hour, keeping the atmosphere cold. If on   on Saturday, the pattern continues, then it will be second time in 15 years when the mercury may have dipped to 12 degree Celsius on the day of Makar Sankranti. People are shivering and don’t venture out of their houses without wearing woollen clothes. 
 
 Dr  , assistant professor, meteorology department,  , said, “The wind moves in upper atmosphere from North to West direction this time. When the temperature is high in one area, the wind moves in that direction from a lower temperature area like North India. This is why Gujarat will experience a cold Makar Sankranti. Till there is cold wave conditions prevailing in the upper parts of North India, we will have cold days here. The chill would go away from Gujarat once the temperature starts to rise there.”
 
 A number of people in the city have taken out their sweaters from cupboards to ensure that the warmth doesn’t fail Uttarayan when they are on the terrace to fly kites.
