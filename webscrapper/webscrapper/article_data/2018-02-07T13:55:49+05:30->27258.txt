COIMBATORE: When the city municipal corporation sent property tax notices to the residents of   in  , it received a strong message in return—clear   from the area first.

 Corporation’s sanitary workers were not collecting garbage from the area—which has about 150 houses— for the last six months. Mounting garbage and lack of civic amenities in the colony forced the residents to file a petition in the high court.
 
 The case was filed when the corporation officials forced them to pay Rs 60 as garbage collection charge along with property tax. Their tax payment was not accepted until they paid Rs 60. “But, we were not willing to pay the charges as civic workers never came to our colony. We made several representations to the city municipal commissioner, but no action was taken,” said secretary of the Co-operative Colony Resident Welfare Association R  .
 
 The situation prompted the residents to collect Rs 150 every month from each household and use the money to pay a man, who collected garbage.
 
 Later, when they wanted to set up a pathway using their own fund and sought permission from the corporation, there was no response, Manoharan said. “Our request to set up speed-breakers in the area was also met with silence. After all that, when they imposed these charges, we decided to take it up with the court,” said Manoharan, an advocate by profession.
 
 The high court on January 4 ordered the city corporation commissioner to consider the residents’ petition and pass orders based on the merit within two weeks. 
 
 Corporation officials told TOI that they have started sending sanitary worker to the colony. “There was some miscommunication. It has been resolved. Workers are going to the area regularly for the last one week,” said an official.
