The actress received a mixed response for her recent Met Gala 2017 look, and now is all set to grace red carpet at the 70th Cannes Film Festival for the first time. While, all her fans are super excited to see what she dons at the prestigious event, let's take a look at her recent appearance at Loreal's event for   in Mumbai. 

 Deepika wore a midi dress with waist cutouts and puffed sleeves from Alexander McQueen’s Spring 2017 collection. She teamed up this outfit with earrings from Tom Ford, stilettoes from Giuseppe Zanotti, and ring from Chloe. The actress looked elegant, and did not experiment much with her hair and make-up this time. She opted for loose, wavy locks and a red matte lippie to add drama to her look.
