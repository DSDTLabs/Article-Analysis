Pimpri Chinchwad: The state government has appointed municipal commissioners as nodal officers for the urban homeless people under the Centre’s Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana. 

 The state issued a government directive on March 20, under which tenements should be constructed at railway stations and bus terminals. The municipal commissioners have been directed to give a review for the homeless after 15 days. The directive also states that the reports should be sent every month. 
 
 The survey for the homeless is being done as per the 2011 Census. According to a survey in March 2017, there are 105 homeless people in Pimpri Chinchwad. The estimated cost of the tenements’ renovation is Rs50.27 lakh and the civic general body has approved the proposal.
 
 Senior PCMC officials said the night shelters were being run earlier, and after renovation, PCMC can run day and night shelters. The scheme was started to help people below the poverty line with employment and shelter.
