THANE: Candidates applying to   to the first-year   will no longer have the option of provisional admission which would allow them to block the allotted seat in the first list by paying a standard minimum amount. 

 As per the new changes, the applicant has two options, either to pay the full fees in the allotted college and avail the seat or wait for the next list. Teachers, principals claim that the board’s new decision to remove provisional admission will not only reduce time and responsibilities of the staff, but will also ensure that the academic year begins on time. 
 
 Suchitra Naik, Principal, Joshi Bedekar Junior College said, “Many students and even parents are unaware about the admission system. Parents should sit with their child, analyze last year’s cut off and then only make a proper preference list.”
