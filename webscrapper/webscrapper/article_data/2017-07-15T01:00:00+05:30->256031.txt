Though   has always wanted to be an actress, she never expected her dream to be fulfilled. Nidhhi, who makes her   debut opposite   in ' ', says, “That goal seemed impossible, considering that I come from a non-film background. I didn’t know how to pursue my dream. However, the people around me would always say, ‘You have a Bollywood face’.”

 Eventually, she started modelling. It was only when she was offered a Kannada film did she realise that Bollywood could be possible as well. Her next stop was Mumbai where she started attending auditions. 
 
 “I went through four rounds of auditions before I landed 'Munna Michael',” reveals Nidhhi, adding, “I used to hate it when people would say, ‘Oh, you are going to Mumbai to try and make a mark in the Hindi film industry’. Isn’t everyone trying to make a mark in their chosen field?”
