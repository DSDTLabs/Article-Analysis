SURAT: Western Railway (WR) has initiated a number of steps to reduce its dependency on   (SMC) for supply of water for passengers and its use in trains. 

 Chief public relations officer of WR   says Surat station is one of the most important stations of WR, which caters to 55,000 passengers per day. With such a huge volume of passenger traffic, Surat provides watering facilities to around 32 trains and cleaning facilities to eight trains every day. 
 
 Bhakar said there is requirement of 30 lakh litre of water per day for Surat station and around 90 per cent of demand is met by SMC. Now, WR has taken multiple steps to reduce its dependency on SMC for water. 
 
 “At Surat railway station, four borewells have been cleaned. Post cleaning, yield from borewells has increased from 2.5 lakh litre per day to 4 lakh litre per day,”   said. 
 
 Bhakar added, “Boring work for two new borewells is also under progress, which is targeted for completion by March 31. This will provide an extra yield of 2 lakh litre per day. Also, water from one borewell, which was earlier distributed to both the station and railway colony, will be kept exclusively for station area, giving an additional supply of 1 lakh litre per day. Water from borewells will be used only for station cleaning, C.C apron cleaning and cleaning of trains.”
 
 He said potable water supplied by SMC will be used for station building, running room, retiring room, waiting room, drinking water supply on platforms and for water filling in trains. Supply of potable water by tankers amounting to approximately 4 lakh litre per day is also planned as backup during peak summer season in May-June 2018.
