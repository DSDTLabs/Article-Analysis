Pune: Members of the organising committee of Elgar Parishad on Tuesday condemned the searches the Pune police conducted on Tuesday at the houses of four members of Kabir Kala Manch, a left-leaning cultural organisation

 They were at the December 31, 2017 meeting in Shaniwarwada and accused of making "provocative" and "inflammatory" statements. 
 
 The members said Tuesday’s action was to divert attention from Sambhaji Bhide of Shree Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan booked for inciting a mob to violence in Koregaon Bhima on January 1. “We will agitate till Bhide is arrested,” the members said at a news conference in Pune on Tuesday.
 
 Akash Sable, a member, said the searches started at 4.30am on Tuesday. "The teams were there till 2pm. Nothing objectionable was found. They seized leaflets and scripts of street plays. It shows the state government’s bias. Ekbote and Bhide have cases against them but their houses were not searched ," he added.
 
 M N Kamble, city president of Bharip Bahujan Mahajan Sangh, said he was a member of the coordination committee formed by inspector general of police (Kolhapur region) Vishwas Nangre-Patil, after the Koregaon Bhima violence. 
 
 "The committee in its report to the police did not find Elgar Parishad's role in the violence, but mentioned Ekbote and Bhide's involvement. Initially, the police suppressed the findings, but are admitting everything before the court after Ekbote's arrest," he said.
