KOLKATA: The state has opposed the proposed   2016. The bill, it thinks, may jeopardize the ongoing projects. At the behest of the  , the resident commissioner of Bengal in Delhi, R D Meena, attended a meeting with the officials of   on Wednesday to convey the state’s reservations.

 The proposed bill has an enabling provision for private initiatives or public private participation in   projects. 
 
 In a major policy shift, the ministry has paved way for private construction and operation of Metro rail projects across the country. The ministry has drafted the proposed   2016 to push further privatisation of urban infrastructure. The bill also proposes to privatise Metro rail administration and once it’s done, it will be allowed to take up property development and commercial activities to cover costs.
 
 There has been a series of exchange of letters between the state and Centre on this. Principal secretary (transport) Alapan Bandyopadhyay issued a letter requesting the Metro works under way in Kolkata be kept out of the ambit of the proposed bill. “The Metro corridor construction works have gained momentum after overcoming a series of roadblocks. We don’t want further hurdles,” said a state official.
 
 An officer said the experience of private participation in Metro projects is rather “dubious”. The PPP models, with viability gap funding by the Centre, were followed in two projects — Mumbai Metro (Phase-I) and Hyderabad Metro. In case of an 11-km line of Mumbai Metro, the government agencies of Maharashtra challenged in Bombay high court a proposed fare hike by Reliance Infrastructure-owned Mumbai Metro One Pvt Ltd.
