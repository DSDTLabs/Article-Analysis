Gandhinagar: After spending several crores for preparing plans, conducting feasibility studies for island tourism, and proposing the establishment of the Island Development Authority (IDA), the project has hit a wall. 

 Nearly Rs 10 crore was spent in conducting studies after the Niti Aayog and the Centre assured support for the tourism development plan. 
 
 
 The islands for which the proposals were developed include Pirotan islands, Piram bet, and Alia beyt.
 
 The plan has been put in cold storage because the GIDB (Gujarat Infrastructure and Development Board) — which is run by the state industries and mines department — and ports development department are clashing over the nature of their responsibilities in the project.
 
  Now, no department wants to initiate any action, including forming the authority.
 
 Ashwani Kumar, the CEO of GIDB and secretary to the chief minister, said: “The GIDB prepared the initial report. The government has directed the Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB) and the fisheries department to form a new special purpose vehicle or authority.” 
 
 Ajay Bhadoo, the CEO of the GMB, said: “We have no instructions on the island development authority plan. It’s the domain of the industries and mines department.” The Niti Ayog had identified seven islands in the state for development.
