LUCKNOW: After a wait of 31 years—Vinita Vijai Srivastava, finally achieved the honour she deserved. The 51-year-old, who topped in her class, MSc, Mathematics in 1986 from  , could not receive her seven medals because the university didn’t hold a convocation. Vijai had not only secured highest marks in her subject, she had secured highest position across all faculties. 

 On Monday, Vijai, now an associate professor at  , received her medals from LU vice-chancellor S P Singh. “It’s a dream come true. I had never thought about getting medals until November 2015 when I saw an article in TOI which talked about a student getting his medal after 44 years of passing out, citing which I put forward my case,’’ Vijai told TOI, adding that “I met the new VC in March and he accepted my request and awarded me the medal.’’ 
 
 After completing her course in 1986, Vijai, joined the Mahila Mahavidyalya, also affiliated to LU in 1988. A year later, she joined the IT College as assistant professor in the department of mathematics. She was promoted as associate professor in 1999 and is presently the head of the department.
