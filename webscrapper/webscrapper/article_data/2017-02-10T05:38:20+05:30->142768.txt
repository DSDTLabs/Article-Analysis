MUMBAI: The 100-plus stalls at Bandra's popular shopping hub,  , continue to remain shut for over 10 days. Stall owners are protesting against  's plan to relocate them without requisite permission. They alleged that the   arbitrarily demolished parts of their stalls, which have been there for many decades. The Aam Aadmi Party ( ) has come out in support of the stall owners.

 Linking Road Stall Owners' Association members have demanded an FIR against civic officials for demolishing several stalls with false notices. “We replied to each notice but several stalls were demolished in January . We want an FIR to be filed against BMC under Section 166 of the Indian Penal Code, which deals with public servants disobeying the law. We are being harassed for putting up bamboos, tin sheets, and extending stalls. We have decided to suffer this temporary loss to find a permanent solution,“ said association president Faisal Qureshi.
 
 AAP took out a rally from Santa Cruz police station to the deputy police commissioner's office at Hill Road in Bandra on Wednesday . Preeti Menon Sharma, national executive member of AAP , said BMC cannot relocate the stalls on any footpath without legitimate permission.“The stall owners are more than willing to be relocated but only when adequate approvals are in place. We want an FIR against BMC for the illegal demolitions. The stalls have registered licences, most of which date back to the 1970's, so random demolitions cannot be done.We want an FIR so that stall owners can at at least end their strike, while the rest of the battle can be fought in court,“ said Sharma.
 
 Local activist Aftab Siddique said, “No one has opposed the relocation, but only after receiving adequate permission.“ Assistant municipal commissioner (H west ward) Sharad Ughade said relocation and demolition were two different issues. “We found serious violations... stall owners have also increased their space by 100%,“ said Ughade.
