KOLKATA: Minutes before   players left the Salt Lake Stadium dressing room to enter the ground on Saturday, Khalid Jamil exhorted his players by saying that destiny is not a matter of chance, but of choice. He was referring to the window of opportunity that opened for his team in the   title race after favourites Minerva FC suffered a dramatic loss to Gokulam Kerala FC four days ago.

 
  and his mates not only grabbed their chance with both hands but also made a strong statement of intent by blowing away   7-1. It was East Bengal’s biggest home win in I-League/NFL history. It was also the biggest victory-margin recorded by any team this season. Dudu was easily the star of the show with four goals as Jamil’s side moved up to the second place with 29 points from 16 matches.
 
 Mahmoud Al Amna and second-half substitute   were also on target while Chennai City defender D Ravanan added to East Bengal’s tally by netting an own goal. The visitors pulled one back through Masoor Shereef in the 59th minute, but by that time East Bengal were already 5-0 up and had killed the game as a contest.
 
 The red and golds are now level on points with Minerva FC but enjoy a better goal difference as well as head-to-head record. East Bengal will now travel to Shillong to face Lajong FC on March 5 before winding up their campaign at home against current leaders Neroca FC (31 points) three days later.
 
 It’s as good as it gets for the home team. Chennai City returned to the city buoyed by the fact that they had beaten Mohun Bagan last month.
