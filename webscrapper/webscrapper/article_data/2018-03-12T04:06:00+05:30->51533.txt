Vadodara: Raising serious questions on the secrecy surrounding internal exams at M S University’s biggest faculty – the Faculty of Commerce – a student outfit has made viral the list of paper setters, who are responsible for preparing question papers of each of the subjects.  The National Students Union of India (NSUI) blew off the lid over the secrecy being maintained on the exam process by making viral a list of subject coordinators and paper setters of undergraduate subjects. The list contains names of paper setters and subject coordinators of the exams along with the subject names and the contact numbers of each of the paper setter.  The exams are conducted by the Department of Accounting and Finance.  It is worth mentioning here that such list of paper setters has to remain secret during the exams so that no student can get in touch with the subject coordinators or paper setters and influence the outcome of the exams. In fact, within the faculty such list of paper setters is restricted to a couple of officials like head of departments or faculty deans.  But in this case, the list which has been made viral on social media group contains subject names, subject codes, name of the subject coordinator and even their mobile numbers.  Despite repeated attempts made by TOI, Dinkar Nayak, dean of Faculty of Commerce, who is directly responsible for maintaining secrecy over such exam matters, was not available for comments.
