BENGALURU: It looks like civic bosses of Bengaluru want bulk generators of   to be more responsible for the garbage they discard. Come June,   will stop lifting wet waste generated by residential and   with 20 units or more.

 The Palike is gearing up with a policy under which garbage contractors will be asked to collect only   from such buildings. Those who generate wet waste in bulk will have to compost it within their buildings.
 
 BBMP joint commissioner (health and solid waste management) Sarfaraz Khan said the move aims to ease the pressure on landfills in and around Bengaluru. “The garbage contractors will be soon asked to lift only dry waste for disposal. Bulk generators can compost their waste and sell it directly to farmers or to the BBMP or use them in their own complexes for growing plants,“ Khan said. The official added BBMP will sell the compost to the agriculture department and it will reach farmers. After re-classification, apartments with 20 units and more are considered bulk generators. Earlier, they used to be complexes with 50 units or more.
 
 BBMP is also planning to chip in with cocopeat, a base material that assists in vermi composting. “Cocopeat can be used with wet waste in two drums for composting. It does not require any advanced mechanism,“ Khan said.
 
 Zonal offices are sending workers for door-to-door campaign to create awareness on composting. While BBMP is keen on migrating to the advanced level of garbage disposal, bulk generators are worried about segregation and finding space to store the compost.
