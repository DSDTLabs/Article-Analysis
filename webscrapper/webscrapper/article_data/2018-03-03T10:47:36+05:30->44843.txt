DHARMAPURI: A 37-year-old man committed suicide by setting himself ablaze on   police station premises near   here on Friday after police personnel sought more time to reunite him with his wife, who had left him over a family dispute.

 The deceased was identified as M Asaithambi, of   village at Eriyur panchayat near Pennagaram. He was a coolie. Asaithambi is survived by his wife  , 30, two daughters and a son.
 
 According to police, Asaithambi was an alcoholic and he used to quarrel with Palaniammal often. “She used to complain us and we often settled the matter amicably,” said a cop.
 
 A few days ago, the couple picked up another fight and following this Palaniammal left for her mother’s house in   near Nagamarai village. Upset, Asaithambi approached the Eriyur police. “He requested us to provide counselling to Palaniammal,” they said. Palaniammal, however, refused to return to her husband’s house.
 
 On Friday, Asaithambi arrived at the police station with a bottle of diesel and sought their help to reunite him with his wife. When the police asked him to wait for another couple of days, Asaithambi suddenly doused himself with diesel and set him on fire.
 
 People nearby tried their best to put out the fire, but in vain. Asaithambi died on the spot.
 
 The police have registered a case and further investigation is on.
