 Organised by Queer Campus Hyderabad in association with various allied organisations and support of civil societies, the parade also highlighted the need to protect the community from discriminations based on sexual orientation and gender identity. 
 “Through this Pride Parade, we want to draw attention to the LGBTQ community’s collective struggle to survive in a society that shuns difference, stifles free expression and violently rejects the existence of sexualities and genders that differ from the norm. Our struggle is to build a society that function on the basis of kindness, compassion, love, and conversations and not by prejudices, judgments, and ignorance,” he adds.
