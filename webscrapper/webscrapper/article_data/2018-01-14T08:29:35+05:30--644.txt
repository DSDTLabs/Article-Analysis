CHENNAI: One defeat after three successive wins has put   in a tight spot. A crushing 78-run loss against   meant that TN now will have to beat Hyderabad in their last round   (South Zone) match to enter the Super League phase at the Dr YSR ACA-VDCA Stadium, Vizag on Sunday.

 TN, with a net run rate of +0.314 are placed second with 12 points from four matches along with two others — table toppers Karnataka and Andhra. The top two teams from the group will make it to the Super League starting on January 21 in Kolkata. Karnataka face Kerala, while Andhra take on Goa in their respective last round matches.
 
 Dinesh Karthik has been the only batsman thus far for TN to register fifty-plus scores in the four matches. He has three half-centuries to his credit and has been the only consistent batsman for TN.
 
 While Washington Sundar has been contributing with quick 20s at the top, there hasn’t been a substantial effort from him as of now with the willow. The 18-year-old off-spinning allrounder would be eager to give his side a resounding start against Hyderabad alongside Abhinav Mukund, who has struggled in the competition so far.
 
 Skipper Vijay Shankar, who made a comeback after an injury, too hasn’t been at his fluent best in the last two matches registering scores of 2 & 20. Vice-captain B Aparajith has played a few cameos alongside R Sanjay Yadav and N Jagadeesan in the back end to finish things off.
 
 But the bowling unit has fired in unison led by pacers K Vignesh and slinger Athisayaraj Davidson. Both right-arm pacers have taken a five-for each in the T20 league and have struck early to push the opponents back.
 
 The spin quartet of Washington, Sanjay, R Sai Kishore and M Ashwin have been tidy in the middle phase and haven’t let the opposition run away with the situation. It remains to be seen whether TN opt to play some of their power-hitters such as S Anirudha and K Bharath Shankar, who have played a game each, for the crucial contest
