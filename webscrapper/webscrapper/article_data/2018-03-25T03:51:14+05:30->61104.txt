NAVI MUMBAI: The Navi Mumbai police have arrested an 18-year-old college student who was on the run for 40 days after being booked for raping a classmate and causing the minor's death by making her consume abortion pills. Akshay was nabbed from outside   railway station on Friday night when he was returning home from Nagpur by train. 

 The girl died on the way to a private hospital on February 11 due to excessive bleeding after delivering a dead foetus at her home. Police said the girl allegedly consumed 'abortion' pills for three consecutive days. 
 
 A police officer said, "He was hiding in Nagpur in the locality where he had previously visited for an NCC exam." Police said that the boy worked as a waiter in a roadside eatery (dhaba) and stayed there to evade arrest. "He was traced to Nagpur after he used the mobile phone of a waiter to talk to his father and a friend. Based on the waiter's mobile SIM, we reached the Nagpur dhaba, but by then the accused had left the place. His co-workers said that he had boarded a train to Navi Mumbai," the officer said. A police team waited outside Panvel station and caught him when he arrived.
 
 The sessions court has remanded him to police custody till March 29.
