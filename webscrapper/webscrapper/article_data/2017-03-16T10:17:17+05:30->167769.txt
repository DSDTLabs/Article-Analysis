A   from Bellary City Corporation has set an example by   in his own vehicle.
 
 Govindarajulu M, council member from Ward 24, is the man who has been transporting dead bodies in his own vehicle at his   to  .
 
 Interestingly, he himself drives the vehicle carrying the dead bodies.
 
 The life-changing experience of Govindarajulu took him to the cause about 10 years ago. Speaking to Bangalore Mirror, he said, “I noticed a poor family struggling to lift a body when an old man died of wall collapse. That particular incident made me take up such work.”
 
 Describing one of his hardest experiences, he said, “A few years ago, there were seven people from the same family who died in a car accident near Challakere. I got the information from one of my friends. But the real tragedy was when I went the house of the deceased persons’ family, there was a mother who was watching TV. She was totally unaware of the incident. I managed to take her to the spot, but her grief after that I cannot describe.”
 
 Speaking about another incident, he said, “Once there was a gas cylinder explosion in some house, and when I got the information, I went there. One person had died on the spot and the other two were severely injured. I hospitalised them, but even they died. These incidents make me very emotional. Thus I strongly believe we need to help people at least during their last breath. Otherwise, there is no use of whatever we earn.”
 
 The corporator has transported more than 4,000 dead bodies to the graveyard in his vehicle which he bought in 2007 for Rs 8 lakh.
