NAGPUR: Nagpur Municipal Corporation ( ) remains firm on its decision to change reservation of   from water body to a project— Beautification and Rejuvenation of   Tank— so it could issue transfer of development rights ( ) to owners for acquiring the lake. Municipal commissioner   informed the civic body’s stance to the state’s urban development department (UDD) during the hearing on the subject held on Monday.

 Following high court orders, principal secretary of UDD   held the hearing at Mantralaya, Mumbai. Mudgal told TOI the decision on giving TDR or cash compensation would be taken up later. “NMC started the process of changing reservation under Section 37 of MRTP Act and that will continue. HC had directed the NMC not to take any final decision before its order. So, HC will take final decision,” he said.
 
 Petitioners Prashant Pawar and TH Naidu had objected to NMC’s decision to change reservation of the lake and proposal to issue TDR instead of cash compensation during hearing on their PIL. HC had then directed the UDD to hear all parties and submit its report before May 2.
 
 Naidu and advocate A Kesari were present in the hearing. “We registered our objections. NMC should do property tax assessment of the lake that has been pending since 1971. Compensation should be decided for period between 1971 and 1999. Public money began to be spent on the lake from 1999. Amount of property tax should be deducted from compensation and rest should be paid to the owners,” he said.
 
 Dr Ashish Bhiwapurkar also gave his representation in the hearing. Ashish is son of Dr  , one of the two owners of the lake. Other owner Dr Sudha Sutaria had passed away.
