TRICHY: The row over setting up a Tasmac wine shop in Goldren Rock residential area once again surfaced in the city with the residents of the area protesting on Friday against the proposed opening.

 Around 200 people from Thendral Nagar, Keezhakalkandarkottai, Keezhakurichi, Anna colony, VIP Nagar and Amal Nagar from   area gathered in front of a TASMAC wine shop near Maavadikulam on Friday.
 
 The proposed opening of the wine shop on Thursday provoked the people to resort to the protest. They demanded to close the liquor shop. On getting the information, the Tahsildar of Thiruverumbur Taluk, A Shoba and the police officials visited the spot.
 
 The protesting people expressed their displeasure over the ignorance of their demand by the TASMAC officials. They recalled that the news of the setting up of a wine shop in the place had led to the protest last week. The officials had also assured that the shop will not be opened in the area.
 
 Shobha held talks with the protestors and assured that the inauguration of the shop will be put on hold. But the final decision will be taken after the consultation with the TASMAC officials, she said, following which the protestors dispersed.
 
 In another incident, the officials from TASMAC visited   area near Lalgudi on Friday after the villagers in the area petitioned the district collector K Rajamani to close the wine shop in the area. During the inspection, people in the area told the officials that they would remove the shop if the officials failed to do it in one week.
