MUMBAI:   will hand over 77,500 sq feet (1.8 acres) for shifting   of  , which will be interfering with track electricification lines for   III.

 A government resolution for handing over the   to Reliance Energy was issued by the state agriculture, animal husbandry and dairy development departments on Friday. The land will be transferred to the state revenue and forest departments, which will then be handed over to Reliance Energy.
 
 At present, these lines are on the 29.2 hectares (72 acres) handed over to Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (MMRCL) to build the car-shed for Metro III. The land was handed over to MMRCL in August 2014.
 
 Last January, MMRCL, following a public outcry, had proposed a double-deck car-shed reducing land requirement to 20.82 hectares and impacting only 446 trees.
 
 An MMRCL spokesperson said the lines are coming within the area where depot tracks will be laid. “Track electrification lines conflict with high tension lines and hence need to be shifted,” said the spokesperson.
 
 In March, MMRCL wrote to the government asking for the high tension lines to be shifted. In fact, the new location, which is across the Marol Maroshi road near a Reliance sub-station was identified by MMRCL. According to a GR issued by the Dairy Development Department, MMRCL has said the 1.8 acres have been excluded from the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) around Sanjay Gandhi National Park.
 
 In the final ESZ notification issued last December, the Union ministry for environment and forests and climate change had excluded 165 hectares (407 acres) from the ESZ around the national park.
 
 D Stalin, director the Vanashakti NGO that has filed a plea before the National Green Tribunal to declare the whole of Aarey as an ESZ said, “Aarey is a no-development zone and there is a public hearing which is under way, yet the government in the most undemocratic manner is giving out parcels of land.”
