Mohali: Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has sought constitution of a committee to be headed by the technical adviser to the chief minister for formulation of a strategy to   the Airport Road.

 GMADA’s chief administrator Ravi Bhagat, who has written a letter in this regard, said the Punjab government gave in-principle nod for constitution of a committee to be headed by CM’s technical adviser Lt Gen BS Dhaliwal (retd) and comprising scientists of Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), GMADA’s chief administrator and chief engineers, B&R officers, besides senior technical experts from the state.
 
 Bhagat said, “We fear that the Airport Road may have to be scalped first and then re-constructed. This will require huge amount of money for which a high-level committee has to be constituted to decide the course of action. In their preliminary report, the vigilance and experts from CRRI have hinted at scalping and reconstruction. The committee will also decide on repair of other portion of the road from Singh Shaheedan Gurdwara towards Balongi.”
 
 Bhagat said the road has been constructed on bare soil, called black cotton soil, without creating required layering of the foundation for the highways.
