CHARMINAR: Hidden in a nondescript lane of   in Mehdipatnam, the   dargah is a prime example of neglect and apathy by local civic authorities towards local  .

 While the entire structure has vegetation growing on it, huge cracks have developed on the walls due to abutment. The ceilings of the structure are also in bad shape, with chunks of paint and lime plaster peeling off. Water can be seen seeping through the dome, and other parts of the walls.
 
 
 Heritage activists and local residents have brought the issue to the notice of officials time and again, but no initiatives were taken to begin renovation of the masjid, they said.
 
 “The mosque was built almost 400 years ago during the reign of the   dynasty,” Shamsheer Ali, a resident of Maruthi Nagar said.
 
 Leaky roofs, blackened algae on the walls and alcoves of cobwebs are a common sight inside the premises. “The entire structure looks so fragile, like it can crumble any time. The dome which has water seeping through it can fall any time,” Ali said.
 
 “We have been coming here since my childhood and to date, we have not seen anyone coming to carry out repairs of the mosque. Though it is from the Qutub Shahi era and holds an importance of a heritage structure, its slowly falling apart,” said  , one of the devout.
 
 Heritage activists say the tomb has been in this condition for many years, though it has been in existence for a quarter of a millennium.
 
 “This mosque is located in one of the busiest places in the city and this is its condition. The lack of attention towards this mosque is also encouraging land grabbers. Authorities should register the mosque as a heritage structure, and take immediate note of this and safeguard the mosque in every which way,” said Anuradha Reddy, a heritage activist.
