VISAKHAPATNAM: Residents of   colony, near the  , have finally been provided with electricity connection by the Andhra Pradesh Eastern Power Distribution Company Limited (APEPDCL), after the move was authorised by the Greater   Municipal Corporation (GVMC). E A S Sarma, convener of the  , who switched the lights on in a house in the colony, here on Saturday observed that this was a move in the right direction.

 Sarma noted that the residents had been fighting for their right to live with dignity for a long time. “Over 150 families moved here 40 to 50 years ago, out of which 70 to 80 of the families shifted to Gnanpuram, while the remaining stayed back. Land sharks tried to forge papers to evict them. Even the GVMC authorities had tried to evict them in 2013, when the matter was still in the court,” said Sarma.
 
 He further pointed out that non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and concerned public had came forward to help them in their cause and strengthened their agitation against land sharks and when the authorities tried to evict them. “Today, they have electricity and will also get toilets under the Swachh Bharat Mission. However, they are yet to get their land pattas as the matter is still in court,” Sarma said. Most of the settlers, according to sources, are migrant labour who moved from old   district to Visakhapatnam in search of work.
