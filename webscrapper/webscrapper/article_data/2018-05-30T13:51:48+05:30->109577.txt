SURAT: At least 300 porters have approached the   high court against the Western Railway’s (WR) decision to give contract to a private party to operate electric trolleys to ferry luggage and passengers at the  . 

 
 
 Sources said a private contractor from Uttar Pradesh has won the contract from the   for operating more than 20 electric trolleys at Surat railway station. The electric trolleys will not only ferry the luggage, but also passengers, including women and elderly people. 
 
 A few days ago, two electric trolleys were launched at the railway station, but the contractor had to remove them following protest by the porters. The porters threatened to torch the electric trolleys. 
 
 Porters’ leader Hari Rathod told TOI, “The trolleys were introduced without giving any notice to the porters. Most of the porters have been working here since five decades and their families depend on their daily earnings from lifting luggage of passengers. Introducing electric trolleys means rendering porters jobless. We won’t allow any private company to operate electric trolleys at the station. We have filed a case in the high court against the Indian Railways and the contractor. We hope to get a stay on Western Railway’s decision to introduce electric trolleys by June 13.” 
 
 A spokesperson of Surat railway station said, “The contract has been given and the contractor even paid the licence fee. However, talks are going on between the contractor and the porters’ leaders.” 
 
 Navsari MP C R Paatil said, “Introducing electric trolleys at the railway station here will render 300 porters jobless. The Indian Railways should immediately revoke its decision on electric trolleys.”
