KV Anand worked as an apprentice in cinematographer PC Sreeram’s films like Meera, Devar Magan and Thiruda Thiruda. Director Priyadarshan had approached Sreeram for his film Thenmavin Kombath (1994), but the latter didn’t have the dates. He, in turn, recommended Anand’s name, who went on to bag the National Film Award for Best Cinematography for the film.
