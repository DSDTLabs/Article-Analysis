SHIMLA/CHANDIGARH: Fresh spell of snowfall in several parts of Himachal Pradesh on Monday has not only intensified the cold conditions but also added to the woes of people living in snowbound areas. While people in tribal Pangi-Bharmaur areas of Chamba and Lahaul-Spiti districts are solely dependent on helicopter service for connectivity with other parts of the state, snow-blocked roads in mid hills forced many to carry patients on their shoulders to the nearest hospital. However, inclement weather has grounded the state government's plans to start flight service to tribal areas. Flight schedule announced for LahaulSpiti on Sunday was cancelled due to that.

 Some residents of   of Seraj assembly constituency in Mandi district had to walk 20km in snow to reach the nearest road to take a fellow villager to a hospital in Banjar on Sunday . In another case, a 90-year-old resident of Kahar panchayat in   area of Mandi district died on the way to Barot hospital as the roads were covered with snow and driving was impossible.
 
 In Kinnaur, snow has blocked most link roads and   remains erratic. According to   officials, more rain and snow are expected in the state till January 18. While, people in the northern plains on Monday received slight respite from biting cold wave conditions as the minimum temperature rose by afew notches even as some cities in Punjab and Haryana received light showers.
