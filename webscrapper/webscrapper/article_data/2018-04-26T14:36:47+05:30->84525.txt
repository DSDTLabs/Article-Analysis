VISAKHAPATNAM: The Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority ( ) will soon issue the draft notification of the area development plan for Madhurawada-Anandapuram-Bheemili zone to seek comments from public. 

 The private player who was entrusted with the responsibility of preparing the development plan had already submitted the final draft proposals. Vuda estimates that an area of about 230 square kilometres will be available for the developmental activities.

Considering the growth potential of the areas, chief minister N   personally mooted the project and directed Vuda to execute it. The development plan will take into account infrastructure development as well as better mobility options in the unexploited areas of Madhurawada-Anandapuram-Bheemili zone. The unexploited land will be developed under various zoning classifications such as housing, commercial, recreational, industry, transportation and mixed-use categories for the horizon year of 2031.

A Vuda official said the ‘area development plan’ aims to create attractive neighbourhoods where people can ‘walk to work’ and have access to public transport. “We will soon issue a notification of the draft of the area development plan,” he said.
