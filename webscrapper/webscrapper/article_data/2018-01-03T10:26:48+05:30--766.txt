BHOPAL: After starting the construction work of the state’s first GIS power substation, officials of the Madhya Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company are now planning to construct a similar sub-station in   here. The move is aimed at ending the power woes. 

 The power sub-station of 33/11 MVA that is being built in city   will cater to the power supplies in old city. The sub-station that to be constructed in the E-4 of Arera colony will cater to the power supply needs of the colony and nearby areas. 
 
 In the absence of a power sub-station in Arera Colony, the power supplies are ensured through sub-stations situated on the city outskirts. In case of any fault, a lot of time is wasted in identifying the fault. 
 
 “Till now, the space was an issue. Traditional power sub-stations needed at least 30m by 40 m area, but these sub-power stations could be built in a room and require only 12m by 16m space,” general manager (city circle)  , Binay   told TOI. 
 
 He added, “The Kotwali sub-station is being built with an investment of Rs 4 crore only. The cost also includes cable laying costs.” 
 
 “Space is a big problem when we think of constructing sub-stations in centre of the city, but the new technology-enabled sub-stations require little space, they are also safe as they are gas insulated,” Sinha said. 
 
 Sources said that if the discom officials fail to find appropriate place, then they are planning to convert half portion of the office situated at E-4 into a sub-station. However, the plan will take a few months’ time to start off. Once done, it will be providing great respite to the consumers of Arera Colony, said an official.
