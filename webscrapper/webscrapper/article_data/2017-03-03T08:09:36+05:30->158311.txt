NEW  : The   searing   the city witnessed in the last week of February has seen a dip. On Thursday, the maximum   came down to 28.5 degrees Celsius, four degrees less than Tuesday’s 32.5 degrees.

 “The rise in temperature was due to a western disturbance that was affecting the Himalayan region. It initially increased the temperature over the plains, including Delhi and on Wednesday, led to thunder. This WD has now moved eastwards and westerly, northwest winds are blowing over the plains now, which have brought down the maximum temperature,” said an official of Delhi’s regional weather forecast centre.
 
 The Thursday’s minimum temperature was three degrees above   at 16.5 degrees Celsius. This was a result of the cloud cover that had enveloped the city during the morning hours. “When there is a cloud cover, it does not allow heat to escape, which results in above normal minimum temperatures,” explained a Met official.
 
 RWFC officials said that both maximum and minimum temperatures would remain normal or a degree or two above normal till March 6.
 
 “The maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to fall by one or two degrees till Friday and then it is expected to remain steady for the next few days. We are also expecting a partly cloudy sky with possibility of thunder development on March 7 and possibility of rain or thunderstorm on March 8,” said an official.
 
 For the rest of northwest part of the country, the Met department has forecast scattered to fairly widespread rain or snow over the western Himalayan region.
