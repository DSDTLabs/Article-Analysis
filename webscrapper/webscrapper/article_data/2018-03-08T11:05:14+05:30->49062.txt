GURUGRAM: It has been a whirlwind year for young  . He has been ticking all the boxes, and now comes the Masters invite. “I wasn’t really happy with the way I finished the World   Championships in  , and then all the pain got washed away. Normally you get an invitation but I got a call from the senior director of Masters, Mr. Buzzy Johnson, just after I landed.”

 
 The 21-year-old is grounded, confident and aware of his potential. “In golf, anything is possible if you have four good days. Now that I’ve won on a high stage and competed at the highest level in the world at the WGC, I feel like my best over four days will be good enough to contend anywhere in the world.”
 
 It was all about setting the bar high. “I turned pro when I was 16, when a lot of people discouraged me from doing so. It was tough at the start. Whenever I have pushed myself, I tend to do better. I’ve played on many Tours. I’m thankful that at such a young age, I’ve gathered so much experience.”
 
 All the attention will be on the world No. 66 when he tees up Thursday morning. Any pressure there? “I don’t think I’m the top contender... Playing here actually brings pressure compared to last week, because I’m playing at home.”
 
  paid a huge compliment to the youngster when he said the latter had no weaknesses. Shubhankar just smiled. “I do have a lot of weaknesses otherwise I would have won last week.”
