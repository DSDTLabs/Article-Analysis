Chandigarh: After wining the Panjab University (PU) polls, the victory of National Students Union of India (NSUI) in Delhi University came as a reason of celebration for NSUI in PU. NSUI, Panjab University, on Wednesday celebrated victory of NSUI in DUSU by distributing sweets and laddoos at students centre on Wednesday. NSUI won two major posts of president and vice-president after a gap of four years in Delhi University.

 Former Panjab University Campus Student Council (PUCSC) president Chandan Rana said the victory is a reflection of how mood of India’s youth has started changing. “After Punjab University and Guwahati University, this is another feather on the hat. Last time when ABVP had won the same election, Amit Shah said it showed how youth was with Modi. So this must show how youth has lost faith in them,” added Rana. 
 
 NSUI won the polls in Panjab University last week and with winning three seats of office-bearers including president, vice-president and secretary. The new PUCSC has assumed the charge. However, they are yet to take the oath. The oath taking ceremony will be held on September 14.
