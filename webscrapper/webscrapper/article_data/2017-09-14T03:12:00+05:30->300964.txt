Panaji: The state cabinet on Wednesday decided to appoint Economic Development Corporation ( ) as joint venture partner to develop a permanent infrastructure that will be used to host the International Film Festival of India (Iffi). Chief minister Manohar Parrikar said the first phase of the 10-screen multiplex and 5,000-6,000 seater convention centre will be completed in time for the 50th edition of Iffi, which will be held in November 2019.

 Parrikar said that EDC and its joint venture partners — Infotech Corporation of Goa (ITG) — will launch the special purpose vehicle that will develop Iffi infrastructure.
 
 “In 2016, it was decided that the Entertainment Society of Goa (ESG) will be the development agency for the infrastructure. But ESG only conducts programmes, it cannot be an infrastructure development agency. This may have been done due to some ignorance at the time by those who took the decision. After deliberations, now, we have realised that as the construction is coming up on a PPP model, we don’t even require an agency that has detailed construction knowledge. Rather, we need an agency that has financial expertise,” said Parrikar, on the appointment of EDC to manage the project’s development.
 
 The permanent infrastructure for the film festival is expected to come up at Dona Paula.
 
 Parrikar said that the infrastructure will come up in two phases. The first phase will also include a structure to accommodate the ESG, in addition to the multiplex and a convention centre. 
 
 “The second phase will have around 1,000 rooms of 3,4,5 star categories. A committee headed by the chief minister and the IT minister will monitor the work,” Parrikar said.
