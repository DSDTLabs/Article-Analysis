While the newly launched women's collective in Malayalam cinema has been getting lauded from all quarters, there are a few who are not completely happy with the developments. Actress and writer had recently announced through her facebook page that she is not part of the collective and has not been invited. 'Perhaps it is because I have a political stance that I was not invited,' she told a publication.
 
 The same sentiments have been echoed by dubbing artist and actress   as well. "I was part of the initial discussions of the formation of the collective. Nobody updated me afterwards. At the same time, I'm happy a women-only collective has been formed in Kerala," she added. 
 
 Launched by a group of prominent women actors and directors in Malayalam cinema, the collective is the first of its kind in Indian cinema.
