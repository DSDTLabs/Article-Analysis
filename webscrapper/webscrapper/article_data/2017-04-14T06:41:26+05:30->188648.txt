PANAJI: Slamming the state BJP-led government for not doing enough to protect the interests of the liquor traders and minority communities, Goa Pradesh   Committee (GPCC), on Thursday, said that the central BJP leadership was trying to bring in the prohibition policies of   to Goa.

 Party spokespersons Agnelo Fernandes and   were addressing a press conference to question the state government’s role in providing relief to traders and retailers affected by the Supreme Court’s ban on the sale of alcohol 500m from state and national highways.
 
 “The earlier government ditched and the present one is fooling the people of Goa. What is stopping the government from denotifying the state and national highways to give relief to retailers and restaurants affected by the ban?” Fernandes said.
 
 He went on to add that the BJP was “testing the waters” before “going for the Gujarat model in all the BJP-ruled states.”
 
 The party, which has 16 seats in the 40 member state assembly, said that BJP’s failure to rein in senior BJP leader Subramaniam   was an indication that they supported Swamy’s stance on a ban on beef consumption in Goa.
 
 “These are BJP’s tactics. Swamy’s statements are condemnable and the chief minister should have condemned the statement. BJP state and central leadership should have taken action against Swamy and ensured that he is acted upon, but they are not doing that,” Naik said.
 
 Naik pointed out that the BJP kept raising the issue of a complete ban on beef consumption in the country and suggested that the saffron party was trying to create communal tension.
 
 “Swamy’s statements are not in tune with a liberal nation. The articulation of a ban was first propagated by RSS leader Mohan Bhagwat. This issue has been raised for political reasons,” Naik said.
