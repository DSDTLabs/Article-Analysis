PATNA: The   ( )-Bihar will take the help of DMs and state urban development and housing department in conducting a survey to get the exact data on the ongoing building construction projects.

 “The purpose is to identify the builders who have not applied for registration of their projects with the Authority,” RERA-Bihar chairman   said at a press conference on Friday.
 
 Registration of new and ongoing projects with the   is mandatory under the Real Estate (Regulation & Development) Act, 2016, and the deadline for it in Bihar was April 30.
 
 “Though there’s no mechanism to know the number of construction projects underway in Bihar, it is estimated there are more than a thousand of them,” Amanullah said and added only 345 builders had, however, applied for registration with the Authority so far.
 
 Not a single developer or promoter from 30 of the state’s 38 districts has registered any project with the Authority. Almost 90% of the applications received till April 30 are from Patna alone, while the rest are from Muzaffarpur, Bhagalpur, Purnia, Gaya and Begusarai, among others, Amanullah said.
 
 Of the 345 applications received online till April 30, hard copies of required documents were received for only 181 of them. While 15 projects have been registered, queries have been issued in connection with 40 other projects.
 
 The RERA-Bihar has also decided to penalise the developers and promoters for delayed registration. “In order to safeguard the interests of consumers, we have decided to impose a fine of Rs 1 lakh or 100% of the registration fee of the project, whichever is higher, on the projects being registered after April 30,” RERA-Bihar member Rajiva Bhushan Sinha said.
 
 According to another member, Subodh Kumar Sinha, even those applicants who filed applications online till April 30 but do not submit the hard copies of the required documents till May 11, will have to pay a penalty of Rs 1 lakh or 100% of the registration fee.
