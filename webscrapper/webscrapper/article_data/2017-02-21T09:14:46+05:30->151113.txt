KOLHAPUR: The district education department and deputy director education office has instructed schools across the district to apply for the Shala Siddhi certificate by February 28.

 Education officer, Subhash Chougule on Monday said, “It is mandatory for all the government aided and unaided schools, private schools and state board schools to fill in the application within the proposed deadline.”
 
 “On March 30, last year the state government had issued a resolution stating the grounds to decide the grade factor. It was said that the schools will have to self-evaluate on 999 marks in seven different categories. These seven categories were further divided into 46 sub-categories. Schools scoring more than 900 marks in the self-evalution process will be later evaluated by the external agency,” he added.
 
 Earlier the grading was based on   (ISO) which later became obsolete.
 
 “Now, schools regardless of their medium will have to apply through online mode for the Shala Siddhi certification. The domain that the Shala Siddhi focuses on are teaching learning and assessment, learner’s progress, school leadership and management, health and safety and productive community participation in schools.”
 
 Deputy education director, Kolhapur division, M K Gondhali, said, “Schools have been given a unique ID and password for submitting their details online. This will give us a clear cut idea of the progress chart of these schools. Since, the high scoring schools are going to face an external agency’s evaluation; schools will not be able to exaggerate their scores while submitting their self-evaluation in the first stage.”
 
 A city based education activist, Sattappa Mohite, said, “Self-evaluation is a necessity. However, the authenticity of the evaluation must be probed even if schools are scoring less than 900 marks in their assessment.”
 
 He added, “The concerned department also needs to provide internet facility to schools residing in the remote areas of the district.”
