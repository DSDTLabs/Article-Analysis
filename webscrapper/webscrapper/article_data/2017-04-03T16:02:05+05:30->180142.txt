After the recently released film 'The Great Father', the makers of Mammootty’s next movie   are all set to keep the audience glued. The teaser of the film was out recently, and the actor is seen in an intense look, wherein he is taking up a pistol, and setting out on a mission. 

  plays the role of businessman Nityananda Shenoy in the film, and the teaser gives a gist about what journey he is venturing out on this time. By the looks of it, the audience can expect him to take on rivals vigorously, and might as well have thumping action scenes. Puthan Panam is a Ranjith directorial, and it is expected to be a tangential project, with regard to the filmmaker’s earlier outing Indian Rupee which had Prithviraj in the lead role. It also has Ineya, Renji Panicker, Sheelu Abraham and Siddique, among many others. 
 
 Mammootty has Syam Dhar's yet-to-be-titled film and cinematographer Shamdat's directorial debut in the pipeline.
