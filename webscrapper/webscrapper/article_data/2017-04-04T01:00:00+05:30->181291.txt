Nothing else caught the fancy of these young Chennaiites other than a party last weekend. This pub saw good footfall on Saturday night and the staff there ensured that the guests had a kickass time. Foodies had a great evening with a plethora of beverages to choose from and delectable platters of eats they were offered. The boisterous ones had equal share of fun as the DJ filled the air with music that was too irresistible for them to stay off the dance floor. This summer, floral prints seem to be back in vogue. We spotted at least a few like Fan and Poulami in floral print outfits. Vidhya looked cute in her red dress and loved all the attention from the photogs. Pooja and Apporva were in eye-catching LBDs and sure it fetched them quite a few compliments.
