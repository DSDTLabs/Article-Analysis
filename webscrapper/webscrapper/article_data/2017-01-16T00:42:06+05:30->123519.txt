 Coimbatore: Talks with Kerala government seeking permission to tap water below the dead storage from Siruvani dam have hits a deadlock with the neighbouring state insisting on additional water from Aliyar reservoir for irrigation as quid pro quo.
 
 Since January 7, authorities attached to Tamil Nadu Water Supplies and Drainage Board (TWAD) had not withdrawn water from Siruvani dam as the water level had reached dead storage level following a poor monsoon season. This time, the Siruvani reservoir had not reached the full capacity of 49.50ft.
 
 At below dead storage level, according to TWAD sources, the dam has at least 10ft water. “We can pump water from the dead storage level. But we need permission from the water resources department of Kerala. We can pump 30MLD daily for at least three months,” the source said.
 
 The TWAD authorities had initiated talks with Kerala water resources department authorities to withdraw water from below dead storage level. The first round of talk was held in Palakkad and the second in Kozhikode. But the talks hit deadlock as Kerala authorities demanded additional 100cusecs water from Aliyar dam.
 
 Water level in Aliyar dam is also low, said the sources. As per the agreement, Kerala gets 100cusec water daily from Aliyar dam through PAP canal. Now, Kerala wants additional 100cusecs from it. The Public Works Department (PWD) authorities from Tamil Nadu has, however, refused the same, as the state is largely dependent on it at this point of time.
 
 TWAD sources said PWD, TWAD and TANGEDCO officials would hold a meeting with Kerala water resources department of Kerala this week in Chennai or Thiruvananthapuram.
 
 “We hope potable water issues will be resolved within a week. If we get permission from Kerala, we can tap water from Siruvani for three months,” said a source.
