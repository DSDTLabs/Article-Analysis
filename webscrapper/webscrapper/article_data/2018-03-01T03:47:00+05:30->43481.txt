Nagpur: “In the recent years, there has been a sharp decline in the number of students opting for science. This is a serious concern for our country,” said VK Gupta, professor at the department of applied chemistry, University of Johannesburg, South Africa, on Wednesday. 
 
 He was speaking as the chief guest at the National Science Day programme organized at CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri). Every year, Neeri organizes the event to highlight the contribution of environmental science and engineering. 
  
 Gupta stated that people going away from science was very unfortunate for the country. On the rising pollution, he said that the main cause is people’s lack of awareness. 
  
 “A country like South Africa, which is far behind India when it comes to literacy and development, is pollution free. This is because that country has managed to protect and conserve its forest and green cover,” he said. 
  
 Addressing the youngsters, Gupta said that more number of trees need to be planted to control pollution. Wanton destruction of nature has brought the situation to such a passe and therefore it is the duty of every citizen to contribute wholeheartedly by planting as many trees as possible and help bring pollution under control, he added. 
  
 In his address, chief scientist JS Pandey, who is also the head of Centre for Climate Sustainability and Skill Development (C-CSSD), said that the country should launch a massive awareness drive on environment protection. 
  
 “We have a technology for treating waste. But there is a vast difference in the quantity of waste being treated and generated. This imbalance can only be countered by creating environmental awareness on a massive scale,” he said. 
  
 Around 150 students of engineering colleges of the city and Wardha took part in the event. To give them a chance to explore the world of science and scientists, the institute also opened its laboratories for a visit after the programme.
