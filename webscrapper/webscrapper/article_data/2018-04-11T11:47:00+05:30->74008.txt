HYDERABAD: After a minor fire broke out at Hotel Sitara Grand in LB Nagar on Sunday, the Telangana State Disaster Response and Fire Services Department inspected the hotel and found that the building is in violation of fire norms.

 
  
  
 
 The fire department has shot off a letter to the   commissioner asking the civic body to initiate necessary action to halt regular operations in the building until all deficiencies are addressed.
 
 “It was actually a small fire, but with the potential of escalating into an even bigger one than the one at   which took place in Mumbai last year. We were swift and could contain it soon. With lack of even basic fire safety measures, the building could be dangerous for the public. We generally book building owners,” said  , district fire officer, RR division.
 
 The Hotel Sitara Grand which is a 19.5-metre high building has to have mandatory fire safety norms. As per GO Ms No. 168, buildings above 15 metres should have minimum seven metres open space on all four sides of the building. However, this building had only three metres open space.
 
 “Available open space is completely occupied by a generator and other equipment. Though actual available open space is 4.6 metres, landscape and other structures have reduced this to 1.65 metres. Also the open space on the east has been covered with steel frame structure with a head clearance of 2.9metres whereas the required head clearance is 4.5metres. This space is not enough for firefighters and vehicles to enter the area," Reddy said.
 
 The officer said that at least one staircase should have a minimum width of two metres, while the one at the hotel has a width of 1.5 metres. "The sprinklers and fire alarm do not work," the   said.
