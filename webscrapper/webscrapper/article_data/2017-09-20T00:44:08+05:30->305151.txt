Coimbatore: With officials turning a blind eye to road conditions, citizens in some areas have pooled in money and taken up the task of filling up the potholes. On Mettupalayam Road near the NSR Road junction, a private company spent Rs 7,000 in the past one week to cover the potholes and level the road in front of it. Small shops also have pooled in Rs 100 each to do the same at Saibaba Kovil Junction and Thadagam Road.

 At NSR Road, shopkeepers collected sand from the road side and filled up the potholes. “We use the roads every day and since officials were not taking any action, we decided to buy some sand and fill up the potholes. But after a few days, the sand was washed away by the rain and the potholes have become bigger,” said Anandhan, a shopkeeper on NSR road. 
 
 The employee of a premium car showroom said customers were able to come only if the road in front of it was clean and not water logged. “We cannot risk irking our customers. So we spent our own money and filled up sand in front of the showroom to ensure there is no water logging and all the potholes are filled,” he said. 
 
 Also on Mettupalayam Road, small shop owners got together and requested a construction firm to sponsor sand. “We used the sand and filled up potholes for a stretch of 500m. But it did not help. The engineers are experts and they should hold meetings and suggest ideas. They are collecting taxes. If they are willing to fill up the potholes, we are all ready to contribute,” said Rajashekar, a shopkeeper.
