 The VC has clarified already that his wife won’t claim any salary for holding this post.

The syndicate then decided to write in the proposal’s footnote and the recommendation of the VC couldn’t be enclosed because Neera Grover happened to be his wife. Her appointment was challenged in the high court.   activist   had cited this case as evidence of “nepotism” in the  .
