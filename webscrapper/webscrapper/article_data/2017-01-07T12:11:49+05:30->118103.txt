JAIPUR: Carrying out a massive drive, the   ( )   sealed six   in the Moti Doongri zone on Friday. 

 The team also demolished a pavement in the Hawa Mahal (west) zone near Gulab Bari situated at Uniyaraji Ka Rasta. Following this, the team had to face massive protest from the locals. The locals alleged that there was no hindrance to traffic due to the pavement and JMC has adopted a dictatorial method. 
 
 “Illegal constructions in Himmat Nagar, Sethi Colony, Jawahar Nagar, Malviya Nagar, Raja Park and Anandpuri areas were sealed during the drive. The house owners were constructing the buildings violating the norms,” said a JMC vigilance team official. 
 
 It appears the directions of former urban development and housing (UDH) minister   and ex-city mayor Nirmal Nahata have fallen on deaf ears of the (JMC) officials. Despite the decision being taken in the recent executive committee meeting by public representatives that no building in the city will be sealed, the JMC officials continue to seal buildings in their respective zones. 
 
 Sources in the department said, the minutes of the meeting have not been released and this is the reason the practice is continuing. 
 
 Former UDH minister Rajpal Singh Shekhawat had earlier pulled up JMC officials and public representatives over ‘promoting’ illegal constructions. On October 19, Nahata and other public representatives had decided that no building in the city will be sealed. The decision was taken to put an end to the practice of sealing illegal buildings as officials and councillors were allegedly extorting money from the owners. The JMC decided to either demolish or regularise the illegal constructions falling under its jurisdiction.
 
 Following the decision, a special committee of three members was constituted to open the seals. However, till date the officials have not opened a single seal following the committee recommendation.
