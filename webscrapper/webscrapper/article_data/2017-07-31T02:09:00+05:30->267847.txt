GURUGRAM: To ease   congestion on  , one of the busiest junctions on  , NHAI is going to construct an  . 

 At present, commuters from Delhi to Nuh or Alwar have to take a left on NH-8 at Rajiv Chowk, and negotiate heavy traffic on Sohna road at Subhash Chowk, Badshapur, Bhondsi, Nuh, etc. Once built, these commuters will not have to stop at Subhash Chowk, and can reach Sohna from   in around 18 minutes, from the 30-40 minutes or more it takes at present.
 
 With the underpass on Sohna road, the junction, which already has a   on Subhash Marg, will become three layered, joining the league of Hero Honda Chowk, Rajiv Chowk, Signature Tower and Iffco Chowk, all on Delhi-Gurgaon expressway, as junctions to have both underpass and flyover.
 
 The underpass will be built simultaneously with a proposed elevated corridor on Gurgaon-Alwar highway (NH 248A), also known as Sohna road. The latter will come at a cost Rs 1,897 crore. “The place where the underpass emerges on the road will be the starting point for the proposed elevated corridor, which will end beyond Badshapur village,” said PWD minister Rao Narbir, adding ‘bhoomi pujan’ for the project will be performed on August 14.
 
 Rao Narbir, the Badshapur MLA, said this will resolve Badshapur village’s traffic woes. “Once built, commuters will be able to reach Sohna from Gurgaon in just 18 minutes,” said the minister. The corridor will benefit commuters going to Sohna, Nuh, Palwal or Alwar, who now have to face heavy traffic during peak hours. The project is likely to benefit the large number of real estate projects coming up along Sohna road and across Sohna, what with Sohna being projected as Gurgaon’s latest real estate destination, after Dwarka Expressway and the SPR.
 
 Traffic has risen significantly on Sohna road since Huda transferred the road to PWD in 2012. In August 2016, NHAI declared the 95km-stretch from Rajiv Chowk to Naugaon on the Haryana-Rajasthan border a national highway.
