PUNE: Bumper-to-bumper traffic on the Pune-bound carriageway of the expressway snowballed into a massive traffic jam on Saturday afternoon, as people headed to “cool” destinations   and Mahabaleshwar to beat the heat in the long weekend.

 
 
  
 
 Equally chaotic was the Pune-Satara section of   highway. The queue of vehicles stretched up to almost a kilometre at Khed Shivapur. There was congestion at Nasrapur, too. The Pune rural police officials claimed that these vehicles were heading towards the hill stations of Mahabaleshwar and Panchgani.
 
 The congestions were the fallout of hundreds of people heading to getaways to cash in on the leaves for   (Monday) and Maharashtra/Labour Day (Tuesday).
 
 According to the highway safety patrol (HSP), Pune, officials, the Baur ghat section of the expressway witnessed long queues of vehicles. The smaller vehicles took about three to four hours to cross the section and reach Khandala from Mumbai. The queues of vehicles extended up to 3km.
 
 An official of HSP said the vehicles heading towards Pune were diverted through the old Pune-Mumbai highway at Baur ghat. This reduced pressure on the expressway to an extent. The vehicles were allowed to join the expressway at Kusgaon near  .
 
 The HSP and the Pune rural police deployed a large number of personnel on the Pune-Mumbai expressway as well as on the old highway at Lonavla-Khandala. Yet, traffic chaos prevailed in and around Lonavla city throughout the day. HSP officials stated that all precautions were taken to avert any untoward incident on the highway.
 
 Cricket fans contributed to the traffic jam in the evening. Many people from Mumbai travelled down to the Maharashtra Cricket Association’s Gahunje stadium in Pune for the IPL tie between Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians. The chaotic vehicular movement continued till late in the evening, the police said.
