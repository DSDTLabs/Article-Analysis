HYDERABAD: One man's pain is another man's gain. Milking the water crisis to their advantage, private tanker operators are collecting huge sums from desperate consumers. For a 5,000 kilo litre capacity tanker, the private operators charge anywhere between Rs 2,000 and Rs 2,500 and collect another Rs 500 excess towards 'batta'. 

 
 Making no bones about his displeasure at the "loot" by the tankers, a resident of Autonagar, Hari Kishan Reddy said: "We are getting water three days in a week and that's why we depend on private tankers. We are forced to hire the private tankers 4-5 times in a month."
 
 Hyderabad   (HMWS&SB) operates 750 tankers per day. But apartments which do not have a proper water supply network are heavily dependent on the private tankers. Nearly 300 private tankers operate daily in Manikonda, Madhapur, Gachibowli and other areas in the IT corridor.
 
 "Though Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board is making efforts to provide potable water to   (GHMC) peripheral areas, some of the apartments are located far away from the main drinking water pipelines. Several new colonies have emerged on the outskirts of the city and these private tankers are minting money at our expense. They charge not only for supplying water, but also increase the per kilometre rate for operating the tanker," P  , a resident of Manikonda, told STOI. 
 
 Surprisingly, the water board has little or no control over the private tankers and the exorbitant rates they charge. "But we try to see that every tanker operates eight trips a day," a senior Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board official said.
 
 Keeping in view of the exploitation of groundwater, digging of borewells on private land has been restricted on the outskirts of the city. "Despite issuing notices, digging activity is continuing. We will alert the officials concerned to seize the borewell machines," a top goundwater official said.
