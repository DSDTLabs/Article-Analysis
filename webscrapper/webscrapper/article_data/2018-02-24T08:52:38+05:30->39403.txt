CHAMARAJANAGAR: Building a temple in his village was a labour of love for Raju alias   since it was his wife's ardent wish. But it wasn't complete until he installed an idol of hers in the temple and worshipped her along with the deities. "Our love was divine," he said. 

 People from even nearby villages now visit   village of   taluk in the district, and ask about the temple of Rajamma. The temple was built in 2006 and Raju, a farmer, has been performing puja every day for the past 12 years. Rajamma's idol, sculpted by her husband, stands in the temple along with four deities - Shanishwara, Siddappaji, Navagraha and Lord Shiva. 
 
 The temple, Raju tells TOI, has a long story. Raju, who has 3 acres of farmland in the village, married his sister's daughter. "My parents were against our marriage. Somehow, we got married as my sister and brother in law didn't oppose us. A few days after the marriage, my wife said she wanted me to construct a temple in the village. But before the completion of the temple, she passed away. So, I decided to install her idol in the sanctum sanctorum." Raju took around two years to build the temple. 
 
 Many people opposed the idea and some tried to talk him out of it. "She predicted her death well in advance. She had a special power. S he was always dreaming about a temple. She was a spiritual kind of person. These things convinced me that I should build a temple and worship her as a deity," he said.
