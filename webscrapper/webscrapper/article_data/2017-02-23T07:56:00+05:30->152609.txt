GURUGRAM: A 25-year-old man and a woman (23) were found dead on the railway tracks between Rewari and Gurgaon on Wednesday evening. 

 The duo, Sandeep and Munesh, was from Rajpura village near Pataudi and attended coaching classes together for the   exams, police said. They lay a little apart from each other. Both bodies were mutilated; the man’s head had been severed. 
 
 Their bodies were spotted between Pataudi and Jatola stations by the driver of a passenger train going from Rewari to Gurgaon around 5pm on Tuesday. The driver informed the station superintendent, who called the railway police. Parmanand, the cop who led the team that retrieved the bodies, said the duo had left home apparently to attend classes at their coaching institute in Rewari on Tuesday morning. Both were science graduates. The families have not filed any case with the police. 
 
 Police said the bodies were identified with the help of the phones that the victims were carrying. When the police team was around, the phones of both Sandeep and Munesh rang. 
 
 “The caller on Sandeep’s phone claimed he was his brother  . The caller on Munesh’s phone claimed he was her brother Harish,” said Paramanand. That’s how the two were identified. “They were from different castes. We are waiting for the autopsy report,” Parmanand added.
