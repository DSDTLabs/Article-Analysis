LUCKNOW: Ahead of its convocation on January 23,   (AKTU) on Saturday announced the government college medal winners. The university , since its inception in 2000, only awarded medals to students of private colleges.

 This year, 15 medals, five each of gold, silver and bronze, will be conferred on the students of five government colleges affiliated to the university .Top three engineering students of each government autonomous college, across different engineering branches, will be awarded medals.
 
 The gold medal at Madan Mohan Malviya Engineering College, Gorakhpur, which is now MMM   , has been won by Sheena Garg from civil engineering department.
 
 At Lucknow's Institute of Engineering and Technology , Rishabh Garg, a mechanical engineering student is the recipient of gold medal.

 The university said AKTU vice-chancellor   cannot include the five government colleges in the main medal tally because they are academically autonomous. They prepare their own syllabus and conduct their own examinations. As a university , we only give them the degree. “We decided to honour toppers by drawing a separate medal tally ,“ said Pathak.
