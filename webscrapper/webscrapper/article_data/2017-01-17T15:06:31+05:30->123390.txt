Aamir Khan's 'Dangal, which also stars Fatima Sana Shaikh, Sanya Malhotra, Sakshi Tanwar, Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar in key roles, has held its ground as it entered its fourth week at the box-office. Continuing its winning streak, the Nitesh Tiwari-directed film has collected an estimated Rs 1.94 crore on Day 22 at the domestic box-office, thus taking the total to an all-time record high of Rs 361.81 crore. Although the film faces new competition at the ticket window with films like 'OK Jaanu', Nawazuddin Siddiqui's 'Haraamkhor' and Deepika Padukone's 'xXx: Return of Xander Cage', analysts predict an upward rise on Saturday and Sunday.
