Tirupur: Communist Party of India (Marxist) on Thursday flayed BJP after the party distributed pamphlets carrying the name of the district collector, which were distributed ahead of the visit of National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) vice-chairperson L Murugan to the city.

 Murugan is scheduled to receive grievance petitions from dalits in KVR Nagar, Community Center in Nallur and also in BJP’s Makkal Sevai Maiyam on Friday. “Apart from making public announcement as if it was a party meeting, BJP has been distributing pamphlets, in which it has printed the names of collector KS Palanisamy and two other government officials apart from Murugan,” CPM district secretary S Muthukannan said. 
 
 “The saffron party is trying to gain political mileage. It does not suit the NCSC vice-chairperson to participate in the event organised by a political party,” he added.
 
 BJP had not sought the permission of the collector to use his name in the pamphlet, a press release from CPM said.
 
 Reacting to the charge, BJP district president Chinnasamy said, “We wanted to solve the issues of dalits and wanted to publicise the NCSC’s vice-chairperson’s visit to the city.”
