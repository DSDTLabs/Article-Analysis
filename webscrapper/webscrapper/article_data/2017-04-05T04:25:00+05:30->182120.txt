Ahmedabad: Gujarat high court on Tuesday asked Sabarkantha police to reconsider the criminal complaint against mining lease holders filed by parents of six youths drowned in Sabarmati river near Galteshwar near Prantij town.

 The parents of the deceased have been seeking criminal action against the sand mining lease holders for not following norms and excavating the riverbed up to 5-6 metre, which they say led to the drowning. The youths from nearby Raslod village had drowned on August 18, 2015 â€“ on the day of Rakshabandhan festival.
 
 When police did not act on their complaint and registered the deaths as accidental, parents of the deceased moved the HC through advocate B P Gupta, who submitted that according to the guidelines laid down by various Supreme Court orders, sand mining in a river bed is permitted up to 3 metres or to the level of the water. But the digging in this stretch of the river was much deeper, and the boys might have slipped into deep waters. tnn
