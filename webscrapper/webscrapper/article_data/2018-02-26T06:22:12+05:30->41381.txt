LUCKNOW: The state government on Sunday scrapped the one time settlement ( ) scheme that allowed defaulting power consumers to settle their pending dues.   secretary, energy,   said that the scheme has been done away with since it encouraged defaulting electricity consumers at the cost of honest consumers who paid their bills regularly on time. 

 The   (UPERC) had also been critical of the OTS scheme and had even pulled up   (UPPCL) for not recovering full dues and allowing the defaulters to go scot-free. 
 
 Rural power users may pay in six easy instalments
 
 The pending dues, accumulated over a period of time, are considered to be contributing to power tariff increase.
 
 In another decision, the state government at the same time gave relief to the rural electricity consumers by allowing them to pay their bills in six instalments, instead of four. This, UPPCL officials, said would ease the pressure on rural consumers and help the corporation in recovering pending dues.
