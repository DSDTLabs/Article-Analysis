RANCHI: On a pitch which offered little assistance to the pacers,   produced a lion-hearted effort to return figures of 3 for 106 in 31 overs at the   on Friday.

 The Vidarbha pacer, however, was keener to talk about his teammate   who picked up his eighth five-wicket haul in Tests.
 
 "Jaddu (Jadeja) is going through the best phase of his career. He has got a few five-wicket hauls and is bowling really well. I think he's the kind of bowler whose bowling style suits all types of pitches. He has a lot of variations and he picks his spots and keeps pegging away tirelessly. If he gets a tiny rough he knows where to pitch it and he usually reaps the rewards," Yadav said at the end of the second day's play.
 
 The Vidarbha pacer who produced bursts of speed with the new and old ball alike, feels bowling to Australian skipper   is quite a challenge. "At times it is quite difficult against him. You in with a particular plan but he often changes his stance, shuffles from leg to off stump, upsetting your calculations," Yadav conceded.
 
 With India getting off to a decent start (120/1) in their first innings, Yadav believes it was a good effort on the part of the Indian bowlers to restrict Australia to 451. "It is difficult to stop runs on this pitch. They (Australia) took four-and-a-half sessions to score 450 and in one session we have already managed to score 120. The outfield is fast and singles keep coming so we will try to get these runs."
 
 Yadav attributed his own success to his newfound level of confidence after having played matches on a regular basis. "I am doing the same thing but the confidence level is much higher as I have played more matches and I have come to realise my strengths and weaknesses," added Yadav.
