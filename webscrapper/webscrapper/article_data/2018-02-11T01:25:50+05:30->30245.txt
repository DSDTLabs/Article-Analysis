GURUGRAM: More than 120   of   have filed a complaint at the   against supply of contaminated water for over two months now.

 Residents alleged they are getting drinking water mixed with sewage water, despite the pipeline being recently repaired. “Local authorities were apprised of the problem. After repeated reminders, local staff took up the issue and repaired the damaged 4-inch-wide water pipeline. Despite that, the problem persists as officials are not able to locate the intermixing of water from the main 6-inch- wide water pipeline. in the east zone of the sector,” said the complaint.
 
 Aseem Takyar, a city-based activist who also lives in the area, said the water pipeline has not been changed for the past 20 years. “These water pipelines are over two decades old, with repairs at multiple places. As stormwater drains are not covered properly and sewerage lines are leaking at some places, the sewage is getting mixed with drinking water. After years of struggle and multiple complaints to Huda, we have now written to the CM window,” he said.
 
 Another resident, Rachna Singh, said, “Our water purifiers have been choked due to supply of contaminated water. Though supply of contaminated water has been a big problem for many years now, it has worsened with continuous supply of smelly brown-coloured water in the past two months. My eight-year-old daughter often falls sick due to stomach troubles. Doctors blame it on the water”
 
 Sources said a leakage in the sewer pipeline might have led to the contamination. Huda officials declined to comment, saying   of the area is being handled by the MCG. “We will resolve the issue at the earliest,” an MCG official said.
