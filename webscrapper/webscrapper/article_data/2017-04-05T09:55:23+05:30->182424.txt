CHARMINAR: Scorching   has forced many clubs in   to change their schedule. Players are seen practising cricket, tennis and football only after dusk as they find the night schedule suitable. 

 Saleem Bin Hussain, AC Guards' Sport Association president, said that most cricket and football tournaments have been postponed due to the high day temperature. "Presently, we are conducting sports events in the evening. Earlier, players used to come to the ground early in the evening but now, they are arriving late for practice sessions,''   said.
 
 Youths have been playing cricket, volleyball, football and tennis in areas including Murad Nagar, Syed Ali Guda, Zeeba Bagh and Jhirrah. Many youths say that after their work, they turn up to practice cricket, etc. between 8 and 9 pm.
 
 "We have changed our schedule due to the heat wave. We are unable to step out during the day. The temperature is rising with each passing day. So, instead of playing or practising in the afternoon, we prefer playing after dusk under lights," student Md Azhar said.
