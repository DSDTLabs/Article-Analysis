NEW DELHI:  , unveiled on Wednesday, will use sustainable   to clean water and long-term   to create city-level assets for all. A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between Delhi Jal Board (DJB) and   in 2016 to work on the five-year project. 

 Launching the project at India Habitat Centre, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal asked DJB to start work at the earliest. Citing it as the most “concrete” plan he had seen in the past 40 years, Baijal asked officials to focus on any one aspect for the next four months to show people that the   could indeed be cleaned through it. “Then even sceptics will become believers,” the   said after seeing an exhibition showcasing plans to execute the project. 
 
 Several plans had been drafted in the past to clean up the river but nothing had happened on the ground, said Baijal. “Within six months, they have prepared” such a detailed plan and “now it is time to take action”, he added. “The implementation of the plan has to start and I promise all help and support from DDA and the Delhi government. The members working on the project can meet once every 15-30 days and get the project started on the ground.” 
 
 University of Virginia’s School of Architecture researched and showcased a three-year river improvement project, Re-entering Delhi, in 2013. DJB has undertaken the project with the irrigation and flood control department as an important delivery partner. 
 
 “University faculty and students are excited and energised by this partnership and the opportunity that it represents to revive a great natural resource in India,” said its president, Teresa Sullivan. “We hope that the project will lay the groundwork for many additional collaborations in India.” DJB CEO Keshav Chandra was also present at the event.
