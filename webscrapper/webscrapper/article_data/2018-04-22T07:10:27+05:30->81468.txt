BENGALURU: The state police uprising, which jolted the home department two years ago, has taken an interesting turn with the government giving its green signal for prosecution of six police personnel, including the president of a pro-police organisation, on sedition charges. 

 The Central Crime Branch (CCB) police filed a chargesheet before the court last week against the accused for instigating police personnel to rebel. Those named in the chargesheet are: V Sashidhar, president of Akhila Karnataka Police Mahasangha; Basavaraj  , a former police constable; Gurupadaiah, husband of a woman police constable; M Manjunatha of Honnali police station in Davanagere; R Dhananjaya of Mico Layout police station in Bengaluru and Shivappa S of Alamatti police station in   district.
 
 The accused are facing charges of instigating police personnel to go on a mass leave on June 4, 2016 to protest against low wages and poor working conditions. Sashidhar and others used social media platforms, including   and WhatsApp, to allegedly provoke police. 
 
 Yelahanka New Town police registered a case of sedition against Sashidhar and others and arrested him on June 3 from his residence and Koravankar in Dharwad. The government handed over the case to CCB for investigation. The DG&IGP wrote to the state government in August, 2016 seeking its nod for the prosecution of the accused which is mandatory in sedition cases. Sashidhar was released on bail after 86 days in jail.
 
 The accused are charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, The Karnataka Essential Services Maintenance Act 2013, The Police (Incitement of Disaffection) Act, 1922 and The Police Force (Restriction of Rights) Act, 1966.
 
 Sashidhar said he’s fighting for reforms in the present police system. “I heard about the chargesheet filed against me and others. I’ll face it in court,” he said.
