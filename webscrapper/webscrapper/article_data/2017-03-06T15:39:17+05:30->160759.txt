 who is on cloud nine setting a world record recently for playing the maximum number of songs on a single string musical instrument, Gayathri Veena, in the shortest possible time, gives all credit for her parents and teachers who stood by her and encouraged her to chase her passion. 

 “My parents identified my talent and sacrificed all their happiness to make it happen and my teachers believed in me and bestowed with music!” she says adding that she used to hum when she was one and a half year old and her dad used to put songs in cassettes to encourage her. 
 
 And about the engagement which she had called of recently, all Vijayalakshmi wants to add is, “I have heard once, singer P Leela’s husband had asked her, what is more important to you- music or me? She replied, Music, it is my life. You came in the middle of my journey so you will be placed after music,” she chuckles.
