NEW DELHI: In the past two days, the   issuance of   permits have already seen over 10,000 applications. 

 “They will be reviewed and letters of intent will be issued to applicants based on the seniority of their licence,” a senior official said.
 
  After the first-day hiccup, the online   has turned out to be a hit, officials said.
 
 “Last time it was a physical process at the local transport office in Burari where we received a total of 15,000 applications only. This time, we have already received 10,600 applications in two days,” the official said. 
 
 The online process follows other processes which have gone online recently, including fitness certificates for commercial vehicles etc, the official said.The primary reason to go online was the allegations made by drivers that the   were being issued arbitrarily to autorickshaw syndicates, and not to genuine applicants. This had forced Delhi government to cancel the entire scheme. 
 
 All the 10,000 autorickshaw permits are being issued under the general category.
