CHANDIGARH: A sober groom caught in a the traffic jam of a drunken driving naka near the ordnance cable factory at the Industrial Area Phase-I on Saturday night lost his cool and caused a high drama at the checkpoint. The officer in charge called backup and the ruckus maker had the misfortune of going to a police station on his wedding night and leaving his bride out on the road. 

 Sector-47 resident   was taking his newlywed wife home when he hit this trap and got stuck in a logjam of vehicles, as drivers waited to take the alcometer test. He waiting half an hour and then his patience ran out. He came out of his car and started abusing the cops, blaming them for the traffic jam. He was not drunk but still out of control because of rage. Seeing that his men couldn't calm him down, sub-inspector   rang up 100 and called backup to the spot.
 
 A team from the Industrial Area Phase-1 police station responded to that call and pinned Sukhwinder down. The groom and the bride, who were on way to an after-wedding function in a hotel at the Industrial Area, were now forced to have a change of plan. When they were putting Sukhwinder in the police car, his wife kept pleading with the cops to not snatch him on their first night together.
 
 Later, cops took pity on him and let him off from the Industrial Area police station without registering a case. Both parties reached a compromise. Industrial Area Phase-1 station house officer (SHO) Z P Khan confirmed that police had made only a DDR (daily diary report). "After the man apologised for his behavior, we had no reason for keeping him," he said. He sure wasn't drunk by maybe Sukhwinder should have bottled up his anger.
