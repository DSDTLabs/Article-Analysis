 Replying to state   chief Sachin Pilot's remarks on rising incidents of rape especially of minors, Saraf lashed out at the Congress. 
 
 "Should we deploy police at each and every house? Did rape incidents never happen during the Congress regime?" Saraf asked after he met a minor rape victim at J K Lon Hospital here. 
 
 Saraf said the victim is being provided best possible treatment and asked the Congress not to politicize the matter. 
 
 Conceding that crime graph has indeed shot up in the state, he asked the Congress to "suggest measures" and "guide" the state government to "get rid of the problem". 
 
 “We invite suggestions from the Congress to get rid of the problem,” he said taking a pot shot at the opposition. 
 
 Reacting on Saraf's statement, Pilot said that it is an “irresponsible statement” coming from a minister. "Such kind of statement boosts morale of the criminals. Government should take some serious steps," he added.
