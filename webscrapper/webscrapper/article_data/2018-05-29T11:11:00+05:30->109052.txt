Speed lovers in   were in for some treat when a local racing group in Kolhapur named   organised a bike racing championship. The event took place in   park of Kolhapur where dirt truck riders performed brilliantly at the racing. The riders had to ride 350 cc bikes during the race while competing with each other at topmost speed and various obstacles. They had to go off-roading and through the muddy roads, thus justifying ‘dirt’. The racers stunted their bikes in air whilst the race and amused everyone with their thrilling presentations. The racers at the championship gave a neck to neck competition to each other but   came out to be the winner of the championship.
