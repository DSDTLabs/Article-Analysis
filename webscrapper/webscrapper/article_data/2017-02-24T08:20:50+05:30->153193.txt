MANGALURU: The Karnataka government will write to the central government for not earmarking funds in the budget for distribution of sugar to BPL card holders at subsidized rates. 

 Minister for food, civil supplies and consumer affairs   said the Centre has not earmarked funds in the recent budget for distribution of sugar to poor at subsidized rate. “The central government has been sanctioning funds in the budget to distribute sugar at subsidized rate for poor. While the central sanction was Rs 18 per kg, the states were bearing the remaining cost to purchase sugar from the market and towards commission to fair price shop dealers. However, in the recent annual budget presented by finance minister Arun Jaitley, funds have not been sanctioned for the distribution of sugar to the poor,”   said. 
 
 In fact, the Karnataka government will have to pay Rs 70 per kg as commission to fair price shops for the distribution of sugar under subsidized rate. This is in addition to the rate difference in the wholesale market price of sugar that is being purchased for the purpose, Khader said, adding that the department supplies one kg of sugar at Rs 15 to BPL families every month through fair price shops.
 
 “Many states have raised concern over central government not reserving funds in the Budget. It is an indication that the central government has no plans to continue the scheme that was implemented by previous government. Hence, we have decided to communicate with the finance ministry in this regard and request the central government to continue the sanction,” Khader said. On distribution of kerosene, Khader said that chief minister   has agreed to distribute kerosene for ration card holders in rural areas without considering their LPG connection status.
