MUMBAI: The   (RTO) has registered and certified 20   as ‘road-worthy’ and ready for launch in the next 10 days.

 “Developed indigenously, the 32-seater Tata Starbus hybrid-electric   have been handed over to the MMRDA after registration. We will ask the BEST to start plying them by mid-March,” said a senior MMRDA official. Procured at a cost of nearly 1.7 crore each by the MMRDA, the buses will be operated on the route between Bandra and Sion stations via Bandra-Kurla Complex. The bus services will cater to thousands of officer-goers and those who visit the government offices and family court. Five more buses will be registered soon. 
 
 The minimum fare will be Rs 15 and maximum Rs 25, said sources. But when the bus fare hike, which was cleared by the BMC on Saturday, comes into effect, the minimum fare will be hiked to Rs 20.
 
 The hybrid-electric bus is economically viable, with improved 25-30% fuel savings and will run on only electric mode for 30-35% of the total travel distance, said an MMRDA official.
 
 A BEST official said, “We will launch the buses after getting approval from the MMRDA. Our drivers and conductors have been trained on operating these buses, which incorporate intelligence transport system for public announcements indicating expected time of arrival at bus stops and route announcements inside the vehicle via GPS.” 
 
 The buses have a wide passageway for free movement, wider window panes for better visibility, along with wider and lower doors and ramps for the disabled. They will also be equipped with CCTV cameras, wi-fi hotspot, mobile phone charging points and emergency stop button for passengers.
