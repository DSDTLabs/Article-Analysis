PUNE: Maratha Light Infantry (MLI) battalions posted across the country will on Saturday commemorate the sacrifice of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s warrior, Tanaji Malusare, on February 4, 1670. 

 Maratha Day is observed on February 4 every year to commemorate the warrior, who had laid down his life while capturing Sinhagad fort — then known as Kondhana for the Maratha king. 
 
 According to the MLI records, February 4 commemorates the momentous day, when Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj had resolved to reclaim his lost territories. About 347 years ago, Chhatrapati Shivaji had started the victory march by capturing Kondhana fort (present-day Singhgarh fort) in Pune. This was victory was a comer stone in the King’s conquest. 
 
 A senior officer from MLI, who did not wish to divulge his identity told TOI, “The warrior Tanjai and his men fought a fierce battle with the Mughals headed by  , a Rajput sardar. In the battle, Tanaji lost his life, but his men captured the fort. His supreme dedications and sacrifice should be celebrated proudly as he is still an inspiring figure for all Maratha soldiers.” 
 
 The victory of the Kondhana was harbinger to a series of victorious battles, capture of six fortresses and marked the gallant resistance of the brave Maratha warrior which reached its pinnacle under the rule of Peshwa Bajirao, the MLI records state.
 
 The regiment is associated with sister services like the  , 20 Sq Air Force (Sukhoi) based at Lohegaon Air Force Station, Coast Guard Air Station Daman. 
 
 Lt Gen DB Shekatkar, who commanded 6th Maratha battalion at the Line of Control, said a very few people are aware about the Maratha's contributions in the Navy, “Kanhoji Angre was one of the first chiefs of the Maratha Navy in 18th century and fought relentlessly against the British, Portuguese and Dutch naval interests on the coasts of India. Despite several attempts by the British and Portuguese, the warrior Angre remained undefeated until his death.”
