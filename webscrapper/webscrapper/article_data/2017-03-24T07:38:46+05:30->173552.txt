NEW DELHI:   on Thursday echoed with allegations of harassment of boys and girls by “anti-Romeo“ police squads and targeting of Muslims and Yadavs in  , forcing the government to refute the allegations and assure that the BJP regime in the state would be even-handed in its treatment of communities.

 Raising the issue, Congress MP   expressed concern that “anti-Romeo“ squads of UP police were rounding up boys and girls sitting in public places and parks and were humiliating them by making them undergo punishment. She said even brothers and sisters going out were being seen with suspicion.
 
 The allegation came amid reports that “anti-Romeo“ squads of UP police, mandated with targeting eve-teasing, were resorting to moral policing.
 
 “Is it wrong to be in love in India?
 
 Is it wrong to be 'a boyfriend or a girlfriend'? If they are sitting in a civilised manner in a park, what right does the police have to tell them that they cannot be there?“ Ranjan asked, pointing to the newly-elected   government.
 
 “Just because   is an ascetic, he thinks everybody is a celibate,“ she told reporters outside Parliament. Ranjan said Muslims were being persecuted in the name of closing abattoirs and certain castes were also being targeted, in what appeared a reference to Yadavs.
 
 There have been reports of shops selling meat being torched in UP. Defending BJP, home minister Rajnath Singh said his party did not discriminate on the basis of caste, creed or religion and refuted allegations that certain communities were being targeted in UP.
 
 He said the BJP government was barely a couple of days old in the state and the chief minister had stated that he would follow the dictum of “sabka saath, sabka vikaas“.
 
 Singh said the government would look into any specific incident of harassment that was reported.
