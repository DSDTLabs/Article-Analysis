When a garden hose is flushed with water, there is some invisible wear and tear that the inside walls experience due to the flow of the water. The greater the pressure of water, the worse is the abrasion. After a point, lesser water tends to reach the end of the hose due to obstructions caused by the damaged walls. This is believed to be the case even for damaged blood vessels that result from high blood pressure. Stroke and heart attack are common consequences of  , and now, scientists believe that vascular   (a condition in which the brain cells receive less blood supply, possibly due to stroke) may also be added to that list. 

 A recent study, conducted at the  , Maryland, addressed the association between hypertension and the risk of developing vascular dementia. Researchers analysed the medical data from 4.8 million people who did not suffer from any known heart ailments or dementia. In the span of seven years, o\ver 11,000 people developed vascular dementia. People with high blood pressure and between the ages of 30 and 50 years were at 62% greater risk of having vascular dementia, while the risk was 26% higher among people between the ages of 51 and 70 years. Irrespective of the incidence of stroke, high blood pressure bore a strong association with the risk of vascular dementia. The results of this study underscore the necessity for adopting a lifestyle that promotes the lowering of blood pressure through diet and exercise, in order to minimise the risk of developing diseases that are consequent to hypertension.
 
 It is not really possible to turn off the tap and lower the pressure in our blood vessels. It is, however, easy to take up an activity that gives us joy, while at the same time working on restoring the body and mind.
