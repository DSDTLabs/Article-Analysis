NAVI MUMBAI: Even before the arrival of monsoon, sewage water from septic tanks has been overflowing on roads in the developing   node in  . Residents have to wade through the dirty water and endure the stench due to the absence of a much-needed sewage treatment plant (STP) to remove the sewage from the residential pockets for recycling.

 According to Cidco, residents are at fault as they don’t clean the septic tank periodically which has led to overflow. Conditional occupancy certificate was issued to many housing societies and individual houses stating that septic tanks have to be installed and maintained by the owners unless their kitchen and toilet outlets are connected to   sewage line to STP.
 
 “We have to pass through the dirty water. Cidco has failed to address our grievances. When we bought houses here we were told our sewage lines will be connected to the Cidco drainage system soon. But several years have passed and we still rely on septic tanks,” said a resident Nitin Singh.
 
  Cidco superintending engineer and administrator for Karanjade node, P S   said, “Residents were issued conditional occupancy certificate of the buildings to install and maintain septic tanks till the sewage line is connected to the proposed STP in the node. We will soon complete the work on the STP and connect it to households.”
