KOCHI: Alleging that the BJP-led central government failed to keep their promise of creating two crore jobs within a year of coming to power,   leader and former   minister P   termed the promises made in the   as ‘jumlas’.

 The former finance minister, who was in Kochi to deliver keynote address at a seminar on the state of Indian economy, lambasted the government’s newly-announced health insurance scheme, minimum support price for food grains and promise to create new jobs.
 
 “The   (ILO) defines job as an employment that is certain, regular and reasonably secure. Is the government planning to recommend to ILO that frying and selling pakodas as also a job,” asked Chidambaram.
 
 He also observed that the government has not given a proper clarification regarding whether MSP would be calculated on the basis of comprehensive cost (also known as C2 which includes rentals or interests forgone on owned land and fixed capital assets) or on A2, which includes paid out expenses such as seeds, fertilizers and chemicals.
 
 “The government has not defined whether it is C2 or A2 constitutes the ‘cost of production’. If the price is fixed at 50% over and above C2, inflationary pressures are likely to be felt on food prices,” said Chidambaram.
 
 The Union budget has promised farmers an MSP that would be 1.5 times the production cost of kharif crops. The government promised that support prices of the kharif crops, including paddy, should be fixed at least 50% higher than the cost of production.
 
 He also noted that all deficits have crossed the budget estimates. “Cutting capital expenditure and increasing revenue expenditure in the budget is a double whammy. GST and demonetisation were the old double whammies,” he added.
 
 Though the former minister admitted that GST was a good idea, he, however, said the implementation of the mammoth tax plan was bad.
 
 The seminar was organized by SCMS Group of Institutions, Kochi.
