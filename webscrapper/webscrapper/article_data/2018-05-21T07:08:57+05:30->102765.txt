PATNA: Students who appeared for Class XII examination conducted by   (BSEB) have to wait for their results as the board has been taking every possible measures to ensure that there is no loss of face like in 2017.

 BSEB chairman Anand Kishor told this newspaper on Thursday the board has not declared any official date for the results, but it would be announced a little earlier than last year. “An official notice will be issued a day before the declaration of the results. The invigilators and the officials are compiling and cross-checking the results to detect any error in the marks. All I can say is that the results will be announced in May and earlier than last year, while the results of matriculation will be declared in June,” he said.
 
 Last year, the Intermediate results were announced on May 30 and that of matriculation on June 22.
 
 This year, around 17.7 lakh candidates appeared for Class X exam between February 21 and 28 whereas 12.08 lakh appeared for Class XII exam conducted from February 6 and 16 across the state. Practical examinations were held in January.
 
 Education minister   said the BSEB is taking several measures not to repeat the past mistakes. “This is one of the reasons why the results are being delayed. But we are hopeful that there won’t be any ambiguity in results once it is be announced,” he said.
 
 A BSEB official said the results would be announced after physical verification, IQ test and writing test of the top ten rank holders of Intermediate. Last year, the board had conducted physical verification of toppers only a few days before the Class X results. The board has taken this precautionary measure after an overage   alias Ganesh Ram was announced the arts topper and later he was caught for forging his documents to write Intermediate exam.
