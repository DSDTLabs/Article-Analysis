AGRA: Declaration of Uttar Pradesh Board’s   and   in Agra district may be delayed as 82 schools are yet to send internal assessment marks to the board’s regional office in Meerut. In some districts, the evaluation process has already been completed.

  According to   officials here, carelessness on the part of these schools can lead to delay in declaration of high school and intermediate results across the district. The board aims to complete the process of declaring the Class X and Class XII results within this month.
 
  A senior teacher at a government-run secondary school here said, “In case of high school, the internal assessment marks include performance of a student in class tests and other academic activities. These are added to the marks secured in the board exams before final results can be declared. Similarly, in case of intermediate results, marks attained by a student in sports and physical education at the school level are added with the final result. School authorities every year are required to send internal marks to the board’s regional office as without this, the final results cannot be declared.”
 
  According to the list of defaulter schools, available with TOI, 40 schools in the district have not sent high school internal assessment marks and 42 have not sent marks of sports and physical education of intermediate students. More than 2,000 students of these schools appeared in the board exams.
 
  District inspector of schools, Agra, Vinod   said, “Schools which have not forwarded the list of internal assessment marks have been warned that they will face strict action if they do not sent the assessment report. We will ensure that declaration of results is nor delayed due to carelessness of school authorities.”
