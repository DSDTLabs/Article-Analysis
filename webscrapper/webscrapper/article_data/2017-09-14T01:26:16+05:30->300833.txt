NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Wednesday made it clear that  , operating illegally in   especially in  , will have to abide by the law.

  asked the coaching centres, which train students for various competitive examinations, to come up with a timeline by which they will shift to a different place or else the court may pass directions.
 
 “File an affidavit that you (coaching centres) would move out and specify when will you move out,” a division bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and AC Hari Shankar directed, while hearing a bunch of PILs against proliferation of coaching centres in residential areas.
 
 The court slammed the owners of coaching centres for converting a residential area to a commercial zone. It questioned the educational value the coaching centres were imparting students by running tutorials in residential areas. “This concept of having a clinic next to my house and bank in front of my house has to go,” the court observed.
 
 The PILs said that in places like Mukherjee Nagar, every floor in each building has at least 100 students and if a fire breaks out, evacuation would be difficult.
 
 The petitioners also alleged that Mukherjee Nagar was converted from a residential to commercial zone in connivance with the authorities who gave full protection to the illegal and unlawful activities carried out by property owners.
 
 All these premises houses professional institutions, coaching centres or academic institutions which train students for competitive examination. It also accused the Delhi Jal Board and North Delhi Power Ltd for colluding with inhabitants of the area by “flouting and ignoring terms and conditions” and in “fundamental breach of leasehold policy”.
 
 The property owners are accused of converting residential land for commercial purposes by installing water and electricity supply at premises and having created traffic jams in the area, the petitioners added. The court listed the matter for September 18.
