PATNA: A day after   asked Bihar chief minister to maintain his secular image, HAM-S chief   on Friday also said if   wants to come back to the Grand Alliance, he would be given due consideration.

 “No one is friend or foe in politics. Action is taken according to situation. All would sit and take a final decision after assessing losses and profit,” Manjhi told reporters here.
 
 Bihar Congress acting president Kaukab Qadri on Thursday appealed to Nitish to take a final call on communal clashes in the state and maintain his secular image.
 
 “Nitish is known as a secular neta. He had come with us and RJD in 2014 to counter the   and RSS. But he again went back to them, citing development issues. Now that several districts in Bihar are affected by communal tensions, Nitish must decide whether he wants to stay with the BJP-RSS or leave,” Quadri said.
 
 JD(U), on the other hand, has maintained that Nitish-government would not compromise with law and order. “The government is not at all liberal; we do not make any compromises with regard to enforcement of law. Nitish ji has his own image and a peculiar way of working. We want to maintain his good governance motto,” JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said.
 
 Manjhi joined   and Congress on February 28 this year citing his neglect in the NDA. Manjhi was appointed Bihar CM by Nitish on May 20, 2014 but he was asked to step down before the 2015 assembly elections and had to resign on February 20, 2015.
 
 Sources said Manjhi’s dissatisfaction further aggravated when his party was given no representation in the new NDA government in Bihar formed in July last year after Nitish came out of the GA.
