PATNA: State JD (U) president and   member   on Sunday announced the name of party’s former MLA Abhiram Sharma as its candidate for the Jehanabad assembly seat.

 The announcement has left Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) and Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), two more allies of the ruling NDA, with no seat to contest in the upcoming bypolls. The two parties were trying to outwit each other in the race for Jehanabad seat.
 
 Although JD (U) had ruled out fielding its candidates in any of the three seats where byelection will be held, it changed its stand following BJP’s request to reconsider the decision. Voting will be held on March 11 for bypolls in Araria Lok Sabha seat and   and Bhabhua assembly seats which had fallen vacant upon the death of the incumbents.
 
 RLSP national general secretary Madhav Anand said the   should have honoured the coalition dharma. “We will sit together and sort out the issue. The NDA will win the Jehanabad seat,” he added.
 
 The BJP is expected to nominate  , widow of former MLA Anand Bhushan Pandey, as its candidate for Bhabhua seat. Former MP Pradip Kumar Singh is likely to be the BJP’s face for Araria Lok Sabha seat.
