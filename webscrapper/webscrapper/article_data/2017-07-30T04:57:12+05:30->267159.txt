 : The   is levying penalty on a daily basis on the   constructing the multi-level   project in   for the past two years, ever since it got delayed. The facility, delayed since July 2015, is around 90% complete. Drawn up to decongest the shopping complex, the project is likely to be ready only by   this year.

 According to officials, work on the project commenced in July 22, 2013 and was initially slated to be complete by July 21, 2015. Till now, the project has missed six deadlines. Since July 2015, it chased deadlines including December 2015, March 2016, June 2016, August 2016 and July 2017. It is now likely to be complete by October 2017.
 
 To expedite the facility, Noida Authority started levying a penalty on the construction company building it. “For one year up to July 2016, we imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 each day. From August 2016 to June 30, 2017, the fine was raised to Rs 10,000 per day,” said S C Mishra, Noida’s project engineer in charge of the project. 
 
 “Since July 1, 2017, the fine has further been raised to Rs 15,000 per day. So far, we have fined the company more than Rs 27 lakh for the delay,” he said. 
 
 “We are trying our best to have the parking project in place as soon as possible,” Mishra said.
 
 Announced by former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav in April 2013, the multi-level parking plan was chalked out to decongest the shopping complex. “The project has been facing a delay as the company constructing the facility has been facing a financial crisis in the past,” said Mishra. “We had in August 2016 also issued the company a show-cause notice asking why its contract should not be cancelled,” he said.
 
 Officials further said they were fast-tracking the project, considering the dire need for the facility in the gridlocked commercial area. “Once this facility is ready, we will not allow any vehicles to park along the streets of the market complex. Nearly 2,000-2,500 vehicles park in the sector daily. Our facility has a capacity to house more than 3,000 vehicles. This will ensure decongestion in the badly gridlocked area,” he explained.
 
 In 2015, Noida Authority, in an attempt to decongest Noida’s shopping area in Sector 18, had thrown open the partly constructed facility to the public. 
 
 However, a PIL was filed in the Allahabad high court in September 2015 against the use of incomplete structure and without an occupation certificate. The court had then directed Noida Authority to desist from using the facility for parking with immediate effect and until it was complete.
