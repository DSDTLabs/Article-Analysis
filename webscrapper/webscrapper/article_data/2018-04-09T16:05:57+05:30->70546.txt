This Gangtok-based band’s name — inspired by the idiom ‘Still waters run deep’ — reflects their ideology and music. With a series of changes over the years, their current line-up comprises   (vocalist),   (lead guitarist), Lokes Mangar (bassist), Ronald Pradhan (drummer) and   (rhythm guitarist). Hailing from Kurseong in Gangtok, they believe their North Eastern roots, with a very Indian touch of rock-n-roll, is their USP. “We are simple, non-flashy rock stars,” they say in unison.

 Fans of bands like AC/DC and ZZ Top, they want to be remembered as the ‘feel good riff rock band’. With underlying themes of happiness, humanity, peace, travel and friendship in their songs, they would like to bring composer and mandolin maestro   back to life. “We admire the peace his music exudes along with his discipline,” says Abhishek. Currently working on something “very happy”, they would like to compose for filmmaker Nagesh Kukunoor someday. 
 
 Ask them about that one thing the Indian music scene could really do with, and Abhishek says, “We can construct a strong bridge of friendship through music with the rest of the world, regardless of genre or language… music is universal.”
