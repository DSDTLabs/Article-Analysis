Udhagamandalam: In a first, a mass cleaning drive was held at the government headquarters hospital in Ooty on Wednesday. About 25 sanitary workers of the municipality and the Ooty GH joined hands to clean the hospital surroundings.

 The Ooty GH was selected for the cleaning drive due to its vulnerability, Udhagamandalam municipal health officer Murali Shankar said. “Today, we dug two big pits in the hospital campus for disposing wet waste. Till now, wet waste was discarded along with plastic and medical waste,” he told TOI.
 
 “We are also planning to dig a couple of pits at the Government Sait Memorial Maternity Hospital soon,” he added.
 
 Meanwhile, a patient at the hospital called the cleaning drive an eye wash. “The hospital has been ignored by the hospital authorities and the Ooty municipality for a long time. The overflowing garbage bin and water stagnating in front of the hospital laboratory are ample proof for this,” L Sekahr told TOI.
 
 However, municipal engineer and commissioner in-charge C Ravi refuted the charges. “We are inspecting every place in the municipal limit.
 
  The mass cleaning programme will continue in public toilets, main bus stand, bridge near the Ooty Lake and Charing Cross, among other places. Most of the garbage bins in Ooty town will also be removed as door-to-door collection of garbage has already started,” he said.
 
 According to Ravi, door-to-door collection of garbage has already started in commercial areas in Ooty town. About 14 wards out of the 36 in Ooty have been brought under the programme.
 
  “By the end of October, all the 36 wards will be brought under the programme. If segregation is not done at the domestic level, fine will be levied accordingly,” he added.
 
 The mass cleaning programme at the GH was inaugurated by the Nilgiris collector J.Innocent Divya.
