 Kule has been tireless about spreading health awareness in her community. Having lost her husband to alcoholism at an early age, Kule was left with two children, in-laws and little money. Today she is a trained community health worker and helps people fight the menace of tuberculosis.
 
  Vinherkar has been instrumental in getting water schemes operational in her village. She is also leading a micro finance initiative for women in her community. 
 
 After Jadhav’s son was detected with TB, she decided to spread the message of health and nutrition among other tribal community members. “Vidya, Rajshree and Sandhya represent everything that we at Swades stand for,” stated Ronnie Screwala and his wife Zarina.
