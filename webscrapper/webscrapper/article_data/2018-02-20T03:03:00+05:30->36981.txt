Nagpur: The cash-strapped Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) plans to recover Rs700 crore Local Body Tax (LBT) from traders, with the possibility of the figure going over Rs1,000 crore in the coming days. Undeterred by abolition of LBT, NMC has continued to assess traders and their turnover from the time LBT was in force, using data obtained from the sales tax department. Taking advantage of provisions in LBT rules, the civic body is levying LBT along with penalty and interest on traders who did not file annual returns or declared lower annual turnover and failed to submit supporting documents. Abolishing octroi, the state government had introduced LBT from April 1, 2013. Following strong demand from traders, the government abolished LBT for traders with annual turnover less than Rs50 crore per annum on August 1, 2015. With implementation of GST, the government also ended LBT for all traders, even those with turnover over Rs50 crore per year, from July 1, 2017. However, NMC official say it is mandatory for the civic body to assess annual returns filed, or not filed, by traders for every fiscal within last five years. “We have to assess around 27,000 traders for two fiscal — 2013-14, 2014-15, and four months of 2015-16. Majority of the traders did not file annual returns, so show cause notices were issued. A few traders then filed annual returns. We obtained data from sales tax department and started assessment of all traders. Huge difference came to fore in submissions made by traders to NMC as compared to data from sales tax department. Accordingly, we completed assessment of 70% traders for 2013-14, and 30% traders for 2014-15. We levied LBT of 4% along with two times penalty, additional penalty of Rs10,000 and interest on delay of payment,” he said. NMC officials added arrears of Rs225 crore were calculated from difference of amount paid by the traders in first fiscal 2013-14. LBT was introduced from April 1, 2013. Government had finalized product-wise percentage to be levied on traders. Government had reduced percentage on many products from July 6, 2013. Traders demanded retrospective effect of revision in percentage. But it was not possible as LBT was indirect tax. “Traders did not pay the difference amount and filed writ petition in the high court. Hearing the petition, HC had directed the government to take a decision by December 2017, but this decision is still awaited. Thus, LBT demand along with arrears of Rs225 crore account for around Rs700 crore as of now,” he said. NMC official also said the amount is likely to go over Rs1,000 crore once assessment of remaining traders for two fiscal and four months of 2015-16 is completed. “We received revenue of Rs54 crore in the last fiscal and around Rs40 crore in current fiscal as some of them paid the LBT demand. Our first target is to complete assessment of remaining traders and then concentrate on recovery,” the NMC official said. NMC sources told TOI recovery will be done at any cost if the LBT demand is distributed among traders.
