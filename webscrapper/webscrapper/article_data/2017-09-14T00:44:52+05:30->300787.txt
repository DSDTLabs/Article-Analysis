Erode: Fearing that damaged floorboard may lead to an untoward incident, the   of a government bus plying between Panahalli and Thalawadi have urged the transport department officials to replace it with a new bus. 

 “The government bus (registration no: TN33N2271) is in very bad condition and the the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) officials should replace it to avoid any untoward incident,” said K Sukumar, one of the passengers. According to passengers, the engine condition of the bus is also not good.
 
 The passengers said that the wooden floor of the bus has been damaged in many places underneath the seats. “We have to travel with fear while sitting in the seats,” said P Prasannakumar, another passenger.
 
 The passengers also said that the bus usually carry as many as 100 students between Panahalli and Thalawadi during the school hours. Recalling an incident of a school student who fell through a gap on the floor of a school van and died near Chennai, the villagers said that similar incident might happen in the bus also. 
 
 When contacted by TOI, TNSTC officials from Sathyamangalam bus depot said that they will look into this issue at the earliest. They also said that replacing with a new bus is not in their hands. “We have to get permission from our higher officials before replacing the bus,” an official said.
