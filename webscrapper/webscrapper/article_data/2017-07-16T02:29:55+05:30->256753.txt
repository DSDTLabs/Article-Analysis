  An on-campus study over the past several years showed that the women BTech students outperformed men counterparts in terms of grades despite sometimes having lower JEE ranks, Joseph said, adding that they plan to incorporate new measures to improve the overall environment on campus catering to the needs of women students.
 
 “While IIT-D already has a large population of women postgraduate students, this year, based on the estimates from second round of counselling, we were expecting 30% increase in number of undergraduate students.
