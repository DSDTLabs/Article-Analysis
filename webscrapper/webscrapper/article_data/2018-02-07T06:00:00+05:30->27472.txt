Farewell parties are all about celebrating special friendships and reminiscing about memories made on campus one last time before bidding adieu to friends and teachers And the recent farewell bash at St Maryâ€™s College, Yousufguda turned out to be an unforgettable fare for all who were present. It was a bitter-sweet occasion for the students of the senior-most batch. Each of them held a candle, and took an oath to be loyal to the institution, serve the society, and be better human beings. The best of the lot were awarded with certificates and mementos. Then it was time for naach-gaana as students set the stage on fire with stirring dance performances on Tamma Tamma,  ,  ,  ,  . A farewell party is incomplete without someone performing on the song Yaaron Dosti Badi Hi Haseen Hai. A mellifluous medley of farewell songs made everyone emotional. Celebrations continued till late in the evening as the students bonded with each other over scrumptious food, and captured the special moments with selfies.
