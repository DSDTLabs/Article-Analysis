HYDERABAD: A   constable who met with a   recently ended up saving several lives after his  . 

 On March 4, T Kiran, 25, a constable with the 17th battalion I Karimnagar met with an accident, after he fell from his two-wheeler in Karimnagar. He was immediately rushed to a hospital, where doctors tried to revive him.
 
 Unable to do much due to limited infrastructure, they referred him to KIMS Hospitals, Secunderabad, for treatment the very next day where Kiran was eventually declared brain dead on March 8. Following counselling by doctors of KIMS hospitals, Kiran's family members finally agreed to donate his organs through the state government's flagship Jeevandan scheme.
 
 Doctors said that as Kiran died young, his vital organs were useful. His liver was donated to two recipients at KIMS hospitals, and his kidneys were donated to two recipients, one at KIMS and the other at Deccan hospital. His heart was sent to Chennai for transplantation via a special flight.
 
 "A positive change in the mindset of family members on the concept of organ donation can play a significant and vital role in the lives of many. We continue to create maximum awareness and guide several others on the Jeevandan initiative," said Dr   MD and CEO of KIMS Hospitals.
 
  Experts while praising Jeevandan for the recent success, say that the current organ donation rate is not enough as more and more patients are added to the wait list every day.
 
 A nodal centre for Jeevandan, was first inaugurated in June 2012 at Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS).
