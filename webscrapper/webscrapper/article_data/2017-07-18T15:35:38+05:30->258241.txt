BHOPAL: The MP police on Monday have released a banner carrying pictures of around 80 ‘wanted’  , including many women commanders. Some of them are also wanted across four states on the red corridor, including Odisha and Maharashtra.

 “We’ve updated our records and released new banners of all wanted Maoists to police stations in the region. We’re getting regular inputs about their movements,” said Amit Sanghi, Balaghat SP.
 
 After strengthening their base in Balaghat district, the Maoists have changed their strategy to expand support base in the region. They are inducting members of endangered Baiga tribe, sources said. Members of this tribe had kept themselves away from the Maoist movement for years. According to intelligence reports, six Baiga youths from   tehsil of Balaghat district have joined Malajkhand Dalam. There are 18000 Baigas in 190 villages of the region.
 
 NGOs working in the region claimed they have noticed that Baiga youths are shifting their loyalty. Deprived of benefits from government welfare schemes, many of them are seen evincing interest in the Red literature. “Crores have been spent in Balaghat and Dindori districts for development of Baigas. Many officials, involved in the development work, have become rich while the Baigas remain the same. Audit into expenditures will expose the scam,” said an NGO member, wishing anonymity. In a strategic shift, Maoists have set their sight on recruiting Baiga teenagers who have recently passed out of school. 
 
 There had been diktat from   for Baigas and Gond tribals living in Balaghat to handover a child from every household till few years ago. It had also sparked panic in Baiga villages, but none of them reportedly joined the group, said sources.
 
 Over the years, the state intelligence agencies have managed to collect irrefutable proof of Maoist presence in  . However, their presence have not been ascertained in Mandla, Seoni, Umaria, Sidhi, Shahdol, Anooppur and Singrauli districts.
