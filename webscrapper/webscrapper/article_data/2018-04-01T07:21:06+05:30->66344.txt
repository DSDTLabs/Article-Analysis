LUCKNOW: A man and a woman   were arrested for trying to extort Rs 6 lakh from a woman doctor at a private hospital in Indiranagar on Saturday and taking Rs 36,000 in cash.

 
 The accused were identified as   of Krishnanagar and   of Gosainganj. Police recovered Rs 6,000 in cash and a laptop from them.
 
 
 Circle officer, Ghazipur,   said Dr Rama Srivastava lodged a complaint that the two miscreants were demanding Rs 6 lakh and had forcibly taken Rs 36,000 on March 28. “She also alleged the miscreants claimed to be senior reporters of a news portal and blackmailed her by saying they had filmed a video clip and threatened to post it on the internet,” the CO said.
 
 
 “The doctor called us on Saturday saying the same persons had arrived at the hospital and were demanding cash. A police team was dispatched and the two were rounded up. They confessed their crime,” he said. The CO said the accused woman met the doctor on march 27 at the hospital and asked about undergoing an abortion but the doctor denied.
 
 
 Neha, aka Sakshi, told the doctor she had got an ultrasound done at a hospital in Kanpur and was told that she was carrying a girl child and she did not want a girl child as she already had two daughters, the CO said.
