GURUGRAM: Residents of   are dealing with overflowing   in their area for the past two months but despite repeated complaints, the civic agencies have failed to figure out the problem or take steps to prevent it. 

 The road close to the girls’ government college gets flooded with foul-smelling water, each morning, causing queasiness and other health-related problems among residents, office-goers, students and other commuters.
 
 “This problem is most apparent in the morning when sewer water floods the road. This has been happening for at least two months. By afternoon, this water dries up but the situation is repeated the next morning. The stench is so nauseating that even if I roll up the window of my car, it is unbearable,” says Jagdish Kumar, an office-goer who takes the road daily.
 
 Residents say they have complained to the civic agencies repeatedly but no steps have been taken to resolve the issue which is affecting a number of people. 
 
 “Apart from several residential houses in this area, there is also a hotel and a few offices on this road. Despite complaints to   and  , there has been no respite. The officials have inspected the area a couple of times, but they have not figured out the cause of the problem. If this issue is not resolved quickly, it will result in the spread of diseases,” says Satish Yadav, another resident.
 
 The municipal corporation says it is trying to identify the cause of the problem. 
 
 “The sewers in the locality seem to be jammed. As a result, the sewer water flows on to the road. We are trying to increase the capacity of sewer lines and other drains in the area to solve the problem. I will see to it that the issue gets resolved at the earliest,” said M R Sharma, chief engineer, MCG.
