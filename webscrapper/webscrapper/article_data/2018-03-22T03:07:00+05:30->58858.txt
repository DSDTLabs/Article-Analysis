Nagpur: The popular Ambazari Swimming Pool, which was shut 13 back, is set to reopen on April 1. The Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT), which runs the facility, will also rope in a private operator for its development, operation and maintenance. The civic body spent Rs8 crore for its repairs and upgradation.

 Even though it has missed many deadlines, the NIT is confident of reopening three of the four pools. Divisional officer (west) Pankaj Ambhorkar told TOI that the main pool, warm-up pool and baby pool will be start functioning from the first day. “The diving pool will take some more time to open,” he said.
 
 The good news for pool users is that NIT has not revised the rates. They will be greeted with new filtration plants, grouting, water proofing, changing of side and underground surface tiles, pipeline network and an underground lighting system. The plan to begin ozonation did not work out.
 
 Another NIT official said the process to appoint a private operator has started. “After the reopening, the NIT will continue to collect charges and maintenance. Chlorination will be done through an existing private agency. A transaction adviser has been appointed to prepare a detailed report for appointing a private operator,” he said.
 
 This would be the first time that the NIT is handing over the pool to a private contractor. The operator would be permitted to develop and operate an abandoned building and restaurant.
 
 Earlier, the NIT had shut the pools for six months between October 2015 and March 2016 for repairing showers, toilets and offices etc.
 
 The pool was shrouded in controversy as the NIT had planned to construct a sports complex near the pool and had even started demolishing the baby pool. The plan was dropped following strong opposition from swimmers and citizens residing nearby.
