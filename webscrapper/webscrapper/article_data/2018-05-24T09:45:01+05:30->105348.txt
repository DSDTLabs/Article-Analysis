PANCHKULA: The municipal corporation (MC) has come up with a new idea to stop foul smell emanating from the   — covering garbage with sand.

 “The foul smell has lessened owing to spreading of sand all over the garbage. During the monsoon too, there will be less stink now,” said MC commissioner  .
 
 Last year, fire broke out six times at the dumping ground during summer. The fire occurred due to gas generated from the garbage in the dumping ground.
 
 The dumping ground is located just 200 metres away from a residential area. The problem of foul smell increases during night. During monsoon, life of residents becomes hell due to the foul smell.
 
 Shifting of dumping ground from residential area had been discussed regularly in house meetings since the MC was formed, but nothing concrete has emerged till date. MC mayor   said, “All councillors have passed the agenda of shifting the dumping ground from residential area. Now, it is up to executive officers to take the next step.”
 
 The MC collects 168.3 tonnes of garbage every day from 80 garbage collection points in the district with the help of the tractor-trolleys, dumper placers and mini trucks.
 
 A 13-acre site in   village had been decided for the new dumping ground. The plan is to shift it from a residential area and to develop it as a solid waste management plant.
