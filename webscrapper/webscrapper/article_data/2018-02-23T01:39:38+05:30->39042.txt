NEW DELHI : A probe into the death of a 54-year-old man accused of impersonation and cheating, who mysteriously fell off the second floor of   on Wednesday, has revealed lapses on the part of the policemen present there. The man had tried to climb out of a lavatory’s window during which he slipped and fell down.

 
 Family members of the deceased,  , said they are not convinced by the police’s theory about the man trying to escape. They claimed that he was forced to jump out. “It’s unlikely that he tried to escape from custody as he knows how cops operate,” said his son, Vijay Singh.
 
 Singh had been dismissed from service by   around four years ago. He was arrested on Tuesday afternoon after he left his house in   to get medicines. Vijay said the family came to know about the arrest early on Wednesday after getting a call from the cops, just when they were planning to file a missing complaint.
 
 The man had used forged stamps and letterheads to prepare fake prescriptions. He had then approached a medical store near Delhi Cantonment claiming subsidy on the medicines. However, the forgery was detected and he was handed over to the police.
 
 He was produced before a court on Wednesday afternoon and granted a one-day police custody. He was brought to the police station around 5pm. He rested in the investigating officer’s room for an hour and then requested constable Parvesh to accompany him to the lavatory.
 
 As the lavatory on the ground floor was under construction, Parvesh took him to the second floor, sources said. Singh suddenly pushed him out of the lavatory and shut the door. “He climbed out of the window, hit his head on a concrete slab and fell unconscious. He was taken to a hospital where he died,” said a police officer.
 
 Singh’s family was handed his body on Thursday after an autopsy conducted by a medical board.
