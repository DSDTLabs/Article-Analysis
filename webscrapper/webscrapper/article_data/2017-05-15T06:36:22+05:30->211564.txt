DEHRADUN: A recent pilot project conducted under the Indo-German Energy Programme (IGEN), has illustrated how watermills, or gherats in the state can become a source of income for villagers in Uttarakhand. The project worked on five watermills that had been lying unused in   village of  , and helped train villagers on how to use these watermills to produce goods that can be sold to supplement their incomes. “The watermills were equipped with faster metal turbines and the villagers were trained to grind flour and spices. We also trained them in packaging and marketing skills, so that they could sell the products in retail stores in Dehradun and Delhi. Self-help groups were formed to manage their affairs and the project turned out to be a great success,” said  , a technical expert with  .
 
  Over 1,500 watermills had been set up across the state in the past 30 years by the state government for locals to grind wheat and masalas, but with the advent of newer technology and machine-made products, the gherats gradually fell into disuse. However, they are now being seen as a potential income generator for villages. A K  , chief executive officer of Uttarakhand Renewable Energy Development Authority ( ), told TOI, “We will be upgrading the gherats so that they can be used for grinding during the day and producing electricity for 2-3 houses in the evening.”
  
  Leeladhar Sharma, deputy chief project officer of UREDA, said that a major challenge is in training the villagers and convincing them to use the watermills since they usually do not show interest in running them, assuming them to be government property. “They forget that these machines are for personal use. The state government gives a 90% subsidy on their purchase while the villagers are required to deposit only 10% of the amount.”
