Ahmedabad: After the former DGP PP Pandey directed removal of air conditioners from chambers of police inspectors and sub-inspectors, now it is the state government’s commissionerate of technical education that wants to turn on the heat in chambers of professors and assistant professors. The commissionerate has issued a notification asking professors and assistant professors in government polytechnics to refrain from using unauthorized air conditioners in their chambers. 

 The commissionerate has asked heads of departments in government polytechnics to ensure air-conditioners are removed from chambers of the ‘undeserving’ with immediate effect. Apparently, the decision to withdraw air conditioners was taken to reduce power bills in the polytechnics.
