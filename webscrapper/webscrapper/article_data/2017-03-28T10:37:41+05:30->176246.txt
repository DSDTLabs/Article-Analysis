Panaji: The Corporation of the City of Panaji has decided to discontinue with the   when the contract for the   in April. The civic body is open to the idea of floating a tender to appoint a new contractor or to   in the capital on its own.

 The pay-parking system in Panaji failed to bring discipline to traffic while simultaneously denying revenue to the civic body. Straight Deal Services, the company chosen to implement the system failed to pay   Rs 24.75 lakh but continues to collect fees. 
 
 Straight Deal Services was required to pay CCP Rs 63.01 lakh a year and in turn collect parking fees for two- and four-wheelers. 
 
 “We will have to discontinue with the service. It is now for the council to decide whether to tender the work again or to do it ourselves,” mayor   said.
 
 With the contractor unscrupulously collecting pay parking fees across the city, CCP is likely to take possession of the bank guarantee given by the contractor and simultaneously file legal recovery proceedings in court, CCP officials said.
