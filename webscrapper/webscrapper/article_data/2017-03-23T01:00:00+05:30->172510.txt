This one was for the shoppers. A recent textile collection by a city-based designer had some bold, floral and colourful designs, that were made keeping in mind the strong and independent women who love to make a fashion statement. There were also photographs by Chennaiâ€™s photographer Sundar Ramu, who told an inspiring story about Frida Kahlo through each of his pictures. As an added attraction, the event had a third dimension with the addition of terrariums, kokodemas and air plants.   There were one too many pretty ladies at the event. Roshini looked gorgeous in a black dress with a pink cape. Shilpa looked like a Greek goddess in her white off-shoulder dress. Aum who came in a blue suit looked dapper for the event and so did Rina, who made heads turn in her black dress. Actress Janani was seen chatting with friends and having a good time.
