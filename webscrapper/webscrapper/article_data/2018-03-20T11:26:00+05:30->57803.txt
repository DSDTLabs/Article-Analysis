KOCHI: When Rajesh  , an   based in Dubai, wished to take his   out for a ride in Kerala, he didn’t think twice before importing it to his home state. He was under the impression that the import would be customs duty-free. He also planned to export it back within less than six months.

 However, the Hummer imported for temporary use a week ago is now stuck at a parking garage of the Cochin Customs as the exemption notification does not have mention of IGST, forcing Pillai to pay a duty of Rs7 lakh.
 
 The exemption which earlier used to allow import for temporary use, free of duty, terms the taxes exemption as ‘exemption for additional duty in lieu of sales tax’ which has now become ‘IGST’.
 
 Pillai, to his shock, realized at the Cochin Customs office that the exemption notification for import of vehicles for temporary use terms it exemption for ‘basic customs duty and additional customs duty in lieu of central excise duty and sales tax’ and not as IGST.
 
 Customs sleuths said that they were trying to contact various ministries in the past few days to check whether a follow-up notification was issued exempting IGST for such an import. On Monday, they confirmed that such a notification was not issued, which has landed the importer in soup.
 
 “So far, duty-free import was allowed through the exemption notification. For the additional duty, which is now IGST, no exception has been issued separately. For this, the old exemption notification has to be re-issued or amended to add on IGST, which is yet to be done. It will be a time-consuming process, which may take weeks or even months. And for a person who wants to use his/ her car for a short period it won’t be useful by then,” said commissioner of customs Sumit Kumar.
