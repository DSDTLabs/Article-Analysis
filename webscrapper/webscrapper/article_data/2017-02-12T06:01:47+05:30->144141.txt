PATNA: The ruling JD (U) on Saturday refuted reports in a section of the electronic media that it has suspended Darbhanga’s Hamida Asgari who allegedly took money from youths on the promise of getting them jobs in the  

 Reiterating that the woman was in no way associated with the JD (U), party’s state president   asked, “Why should we suspend her? And how can we suspend her when she is not a member of the party?”
 
 Hamida’s name surfaced in media reports after two youths, Prashant Kumar and Mohd Usman, alleged that the woman, claiming to be the minority cell head of JD (U) in Darbhanga district, took Rs 2.5 lakh each for securing them clerk’s job in the Patna civil court.
 
 An FIR was lodged in the   police station in Darbhanga by Prashant on Friday against six accused, including Hamida, husband Owaid Hashmi, sons Mohd Sattar and Mohd Dulare as well as neighbours Mohd Kallu and Mohd Ashraf. A CD containing talks between Prashant and Hamida over phone was also submitted to police as evidence.
 
 Meanwhile, the Darbhanga police were yet to quiz Hamida in connection with the alleged fraud. Darbhanga SSP Satya Veer Singh told TOI the duo reportedly gave money to her on March 23 last year. “Investigations are on,” he said.
