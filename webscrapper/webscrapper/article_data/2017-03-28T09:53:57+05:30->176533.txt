Surat: Confusion arose over use of words in tribal language and its interpretation by police and forest officials in Dang district on Sunday when a farmer claimed to have been attacked by a tiger. However, investigation by forest officials revealed that it was actually a leopard that is called ‘vagh’ in tribal language. 

 A police complaint registered in Ahwa police station forced forest officials to verify if the claims of a tribal farmer were true. Investigation revealed that the farmer told police that he was attacked by a ‘vagh’ but he actually meant a leopard  . In past too, similar confusion has been reported in tribal area of Surat.
 
 In the incident, Ganu Bhoye, 37, a resident of   village went to his farm near Chinchli village when he noticed a leopard near cattle in the farm. He shouted to move that leopard away but in turn the animal attacked him. Bhoye suffered minor scratch injuries on leg and hand. He was shifted to a hospital in Ahwa where he was provided treatment. His condition was stated to be normal.
 
 Later, in his complaint, Bhoye claimed that he was attacked by a ‘vagh’ which led to confusion among tribals and forest officials. Forest officials examined the spot and it was found that the farmer was attacked by a leopard.
 
 “It was not a tiger and the forest of neighbouring regions dosen’t have tiger. So, there is no possibility of movement of tiger here. Tribals identify leopard as ‘vagh’ and in other languages ‘vagh’ is tiger. Hence, there was a confusion,” said  , deputy conservator of forest, Dang north. “The farmer suffered minor scratch injuries and he is out of danger,” Kumar added.
