CHENNAI:   who queued up in front of   bus depots in Chennai to renew their free   passes had to return home disappointed on Monday as they could not produce the additional identity proofs sought. 

 The Tamil Nadu government on February 2016 launched a free bus ride scheme for senior citizens in MTC buses. This was one of late chief minister J  's signature schemes. 
 
  are issued to the beneficiaries on a quarterly basis using which they can travel free of cost in all MTC buses, except air-conditioned buses. 
 
 More than 1.93 lakh people avail these coupons every year. 
 
 Besides this, an ID card is issued to all these applicants with their recent photographs to ensure that the tokens are issued only to the eligible candidates. 
 
 Number of tokens issued is entered in the columns printed on these ID cards. Users are supposed to renew these cards annually. 
 
 "We usually discard the ID card every December as it does not have the space to record beyond that," said Jayaram Sivaram from the T Nagar Resident Welfare Association. 
 
 Without prior intimation, MTC now wants the applicants to return these discarded ID proofs along with photocopies of   and ration cards, he added. "No such procedure was in place when we renewed it last year (2017) and the authorities have come up with a new set of requirements."
 
 Responding to this, an MTC official at the headquarters said instructions had been given to collect Aadhaar card details as letters and numbers of ration cards were illegible in many instances. The official, however, said that he was no aware about giving instructions to collect the old IDs. 
 
 This is not the first time when senior citizens are facing an issue in renewing their free passes. Last year, those from suburbs were denied applications stating that they were not residing within the city limits.
