CHENNAI:   will soon have the distinction of being a prominent public space that is accessible to the disabled. 

  has appointed a private architecture firm to design a pathway on the beach which confirms to CRZ norms and also enables a person with disability to use the beach or reach the water independently. Designs are expected to be reviewed in February.
 
 It all began on   last December 3, when the civic body made temporary arrangements just for the day so that wheelchair users could experience the beach and waters. A ramp was built from the service lane to the sand and a coir mat was rolled out up to the beach. Experts see this initiative as setting a benchmark for an inclusive city. 
 
 Smith Sadasivan, member, Disability Rights Alliance said , "The new Rights of Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2016 mandates the right to leisure. This step will help evolve access in tourism, cultural venues and sports stadiums." Corporation will also be purchasing sand buggies in addition to police from the Mylapore station offering their beach patrol vehicles. Meanwhile, the civic body is fixing the pavements, handrails and boulders that were damaged during the week-long protest for jallikattu on Marina.
