 The expulsion of Shivpal's close aides, say political observers, could be an indication of possible action against him as well. On Friday, Shivpal blew the bugle of rebellion in the party by declaring to form a secular front under the leadership of Mulayam Singh Yadav and demanded resignation of Akhilesh Yadav from the post of the national president. Akhilesh came out with a cryptic reply, saying he very well know 'aasteen ke saanp' (traitors).
 
 "I had not been the member of the illegal convention of the party which elected Akhilesh as the national president, so he does not have any right to expel me," Shahid reacted to his sacking.
 
 "I had joined the Samajwadi Party as a follower of great socialists Mulayam Singh Yadav and Shivpal Yadav and would continue to work for them as I refuse to recognize Akhilesh as the national president of the party," he said.
 
 Meanwhile, insiders in the party revealed that with a unilateral declaration about the secular front by Shivpal, Akhilesh is actively considering to act against him and that includes his expulsion from the party. But he is gauging the mood of his father as Mulayam's backing to Shivpal is a hindrance, they say.
