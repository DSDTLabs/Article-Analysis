VASCO/PANAJI: The issue of lack of funds for development work sparked off a heated debate at the gram sabha of   panchayat, with the elected representatives and members setting a 15-day deadline for release of funds.

 The members expressed disappointment over the non-release of funds, said to be to the tune of approximately Rs 24 lakh for the panchayat after it was bifurcated from Cortalim body nearly six months back.
 
 "We have been waiting for the funds and it is very crucial for a newly-formed panchayat like ours. There are so many works pending," sarpanch   D’Souza said.
 
 The members grilled the sarpanch regarding non-allocation of funds. D’Souza said that they have received only assurances so far. Further, they have asked panchayat minister   to intervene and resolve the issue. Irked by the stalemate, the members and panchayat body resolved to go on hunger strike after the deadline.
 
 The issue of Mini India project in eco fragile cultivable lands was also discussed, and villagers demanded that the panchayat should withdraw the provisional approval given to it. 
 
 The   (IPB) had already withdrawn a similar approval to it. The sarpanch alleged that Godinho was interested in the same project and had even asked her to take up the issue in the gram sabha.
