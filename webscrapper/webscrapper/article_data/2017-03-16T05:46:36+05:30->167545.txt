BHOPAL: A major fire broke out in Modern bread factory at Govindpura industrial area on Wednesday afternoon. A short-circuit triggered the fire, which was doused with the help of more than a dozen fire tenders of the civic body. Raging fire and leaping flames were snuffed out after a struggle of more than two hours. Luckily, there was no loss of life. Barring chemical kept in barrels, there was no damage to other properties. 

 Govindpura fire brigade personnel said, the fire began during a renovation work inside the factory. Some workers were welding a structure during which a spark ignited 12,000 litres of inflammable liquid and some liquid chemicals kept in barrels.
 
 Iftikar Khan, assistant fire officer, Govindpura fire station, said, “Six fire fighters and 24 fire tenders were pressed into service to put out the fire. It seems the fire erupted around 11.45 am, but was noticed after workers returned from lunch.”
 
 Khan said they upon receiving the information about the fire around 12.30 pm, they rushed to the spot. It took them more than two hours to douse the fire. Around 5,000 litres of liquid was burnt by the time the fire was smothered.
 
 Virendra Chauhan, SHO, Ashoka Garden police station, said, “The factory was empty as renovation work was on. Otherwise, it could have caused greater damage. No loss of life or property was reported by owners of factory.”
