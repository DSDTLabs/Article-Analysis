BENGALURU: As the debate over cow slaughter and beef ban comes more strident and the city gears up for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Karnataka for his first campaign rally in the run-up to the 2018 assembly elections, the state   started its 24-hour Ashtayama Yagna on Friday, seeking divine intervention for cow protection.

 The BJP cow protection cell, unfazed by the lack of a crowd at the yajna, began the religious programme on Friday afternoon at the Sathya Ganapathi Temple on Puttenhalli Main road, JP Nagar 6th Phase. The yajna will end on Saturday.
 
 While BJP state president BS Yeddyurappa and other party leaders were supposed to show up at the yajna to lend credence to the event, no one had turned up there till late Friday evening.
 
 Party sources said the entire yajna has, in fact, become a nuisance for the BJP to tackle, considering there is the Modi rally in the next 48 hours and other important developmental issues that have to be debated on the public forum.
 
 “The yajna has attracted a lot of negative publicity to the party and all top leaders are considering it a nuisance that needs to be tackled,” said a party functionary.
 
 However, according to  , convener of the cow protection cell, the yajna is being organised to create awareness among people about the importance of the cow and the need to protect cattle to strengthen the rural economy.
 
 The event will also see a special theatre performance by a troupe from Janakapuri, the birth place of Seetha, wherein a dance event titled ‘Sri Rama’s Wedding’ will be performed.
