HYDERABAD: Three people, who cheated buyers by posting advertisements selling cheap   on an app, were arrested on Saturday at DVM College, LB Nagar. The gang would fly between various cities and dupe people.

 LB Nagar police said Mohammed Nazim, Mohammed Irfan, Mohammed Sajauddin were arrested, while their accomplices Mohammed Ashraf, Mohammed Saleem and Raheemuddin are on the run. Police seized Rs1 lakh in cash from the accused.
 
 Nazim, Irfan and Ashraf came to Hyderabad in January 2016 and joined Sajauddin and Saleem, who lived in LB Nagar. The accused advertised iPhones at low rates on the   classifieds app and attracted buyers from across the country. “The modus operandi of the accused was to show an original iPhone during the first conversation with the buyer. After closing the deal and collecting the cash, they would divert the attention of the victim and pack up a duplicate iPhone. The customer would realise that he had been cheated only after he checked the handset on getting home,” said deputy commissioner of police (LB Nagar) Tafseer Iqbal.
 
 They obtained voter identity cards and other documents with fake names. The voter IDs were in turn used to secure driving licenses . Police said they committed at least 10 offences in Hyderabad using OLX. They are also wanted in Bengaluru and New Delhi police said.
