COIMBATORE: Police have arrested a 22 year old man from Assam who attempted to flee from the city on Monday after murdering his lover.

 The accused identified as Abdul Jaffer, son of Sirajudeen from Panipara village of Thupri district in Assam, was working in a spinning mill in Sulur. The deceased Chitra Devi, 22, who was married, had eloped with Jaffer four months back. “Since she insisted Jaffer on marrying her, he strangulated her to death,’’ police said.
 
 According to police, Jaffer who came to Tamil Nadu four years ago was working in a private spinning mill at Kalangal near Sulur where Chitra Devi and her husband Easwaran were also working. The couple hailing from Parapatti near Rajapalayam in Virudhunagar district had two children, aged three years and 18 months. Easwaran used to reach home drunk everyday leading to quarrel between the two. Jaffer who was living nearby used to placate the couple and eventually developed an affair with Chitra Devi.
 
 “Four months back, she eloped with Jaffer, leaving her two children with her husband. After working in few mills, they joined   in Nadupalayam on December 28, 2016. Introducing themselves as husband and wife, they stayed in the workers quarters there,’’ police said. They changed their names as Abdul Nazir and Indhu while joining the mills.
 
 Jaffer had told the police that Chitra Devi started pestering him to marry her, but he was not interested. “On January 1, when Jaffer was about to send money to his family back home, Chitra Devi objected and demanded that he first marry her and hand over the salary to her. This led to an argument between the couple and Jaffer strangulated her to death using a shawl,’’ police said.
 
 Subsequently, he fled the workers quarters and the body of Chitra Devi was found by the mill manager who informed the police. Jaffer then attempted to flee Coimbatore in a train when police tracked and arrested him. He was remanded and sent to the central prison here.
