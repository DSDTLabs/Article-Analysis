NOIDA: Following a ban by the apex court on the purchase and registration of   from April 1, the officials at the   regional transport office (ARTO) are in a fix as registration applications for such vehicles continue to pour in. 

 The owners have claimed they could not pay the registration for their vehicles by March 31 on ARTO’s website, as per the   order, due to server breakdown.
 
 Assistant regional transport officer (ARTO)   has written to the senior officials seeking a solution after at least three complaints were received in this regard. After the apex court banned the BS-III vehicles on March 29 in a bid to curb pollution, the vehicle manufacturers offered huge discounts on the vehicles to push out the inventory. 
 
 The showrooms in the district witnessed mad rush of vehicle buyers availing discount of up to Rs 21,000. Cnnsequently, the sale of BS-III vehicles had shot up especially on March 31, a day before the ban was enforced. 
 
 Several vehicle owners, however, claimed they could not register the vehicles on the ARTO website.
 
 A committee has been formed under RTO Mayank Jyoti to look into the matter.
 
  “The applicant will have to produce the sale invoice and the receipt of the tax submission. Only then, the vehicle will be registered. It has to be proven that attempts were made to submit the tax,” he told TOI.
