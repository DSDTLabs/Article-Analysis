KOLKATA: Father of a one-year-old baby lodged a complaint against Ramakrishna Mission   on Friday alleging that the hospital nurses had given   to her daughter.   said they will send the complaint suo-motu to the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission and wait for their directions. The hospital authorities admitted it was a “mistake on their part” and said the baby was doing fine.

 According to  , a hardware engineer from Howrah, his daughter Shivangi was admitted to the hospital on Sarat Bose Road on Thursday around 1pm. She was having a bad cough and suspected to have blockages in heart. “She was advised nebuliser by the consulting doctor. Till 10am on Friday, she was administered the medicine eight times. When I took lunch for her around 12noon, I found that she had not improved at all. I was checking the medicine when I found that it had expired in August 2016. But the nurses dismissed my claims,” alleged Manna.
 
 He said the nurses also took away the medicine pouch from him claiming they needed to consult the pharmacy. “It was my wife who managed to retrieve it and informed the administration. We first lodged a complaint with the Maharaj before forwarding a copy to Tollygunge police,” said Manna.
 
 The engineer now plans to meet the health secretary at Nabanna. “I believe in the hospital administration that has promised to look into it,” he said. “We will ask for medical details of the child and the X-ray reports from the hospital. We will send it to the commission on Monday,” said police. Swami Shailajananda, assistant secretary at the hospital, said: “It’s a mistake on our part. But the baby needed the medicines soon after her admission. Hence, the confusion during the rush. But, it’s a learning experience. The baby will be released on Saturday.”
