PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Parking woes of thousands of patients and their relatives visiting the multi-speciality   (YCM) Hospital in Pimpri are likely to reduce soon with the construction of the first multi-storied parking lot with ramps in the city in the hospital premises.

 Speaking to TOI,  's (PCMC) engineering department spokesperson   said, “The parking facility will be constructed in the open space near the pay and park area. It will be a four storied building, which will have capacity for parking of 450 two-wheelers and 150 four-wheelers. There will be a 6 metre wide ramp for vehicles to go on the upper floors. The area of each floor is 2,250 sq feet.“ It is expected to be completed within two years at a cost of around 4.5 crores.
 
 Patients from Pimpri Chinchwad as well as from Maval, Khed, Junnar, Ambegaon and other talukas of the district come here for treatment. There are migrants from various parts of the state living in Pimpri Chinchwad city. So their relatives coming from different parts of the state also undergo treatment here, as such medical facilities are not available in their native places. All the 650 beds are always occupied. Around 1,000 to 1,200 people visit the Outdoor Patient Department(OPD) of various departments for treatment daily . There is a pay and park facility at the 650 bedded PCMC-run hospital in Sant Tukaramnagar, Pimpri.The patients and their relatives find it difficult in getting vacant space to park their vehicles. So they park their vehicles on roads outside the hospital causing traffic congestion.
