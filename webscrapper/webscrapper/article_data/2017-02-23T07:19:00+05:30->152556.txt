CHANDIGARH: While it keeps round-the-clock vigil outside strong rooms housing electronic voter machines (EVMs), the   (AAP) has now demanded that its candidates be allowed to put their own locks and paper seals.

 In a letter to the   (EC), AAP’s head of legal wing Jastej Singh Arora has stated, “Returning officers of all constituencies should be directed to allow AAP candidates to put their own locks on the   premises.”
 
 Congress candidate from Lambi, the AAP has pointed out, has put his own lock outside strong rooms housing EVMs and the returning officer has openly endorsed his action. “It is also pertinent to mention that this demand also tests unbiased approach of the commission. If Captain Amarinder Singh can be allowed to do so then why the AAP candidates are being withheld? If private locks are not allowed, then why conduct of the returning officer of Lambi has not been probed so far and why the AAP candidates were informed about it during training sessions?”
 
 The party has also demanded that its candidates be allowed to put their paper seal outside the strong rooms as done by Amarinder in Lambi. The AAP has also sought permission that its candidates be allowed to sit from where the lock of the strong room is visible. “For the safe custody of the EVMs, these demands of the AAP should be immediately implemented with instructions to returning officers across the state,” the letter states.
 
 “It is a known fact that the SAD and the Congress are not only conventional parties but also wealthy and powerful and the AAP has every trepidation that they will use their means to tamper with the EVMs and cause irreparable loss to the AAP,” the party has told the EC.
