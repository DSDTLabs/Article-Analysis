For every parent, the many firsts in their child’s life always hold a special place. And for  , it is no different. The actor wanted to cherish each and every moment of his child’s growing up years, so much so that he even got his first heartbeat tattooed!

 The ' ' actor was in   recently and got the design — which is based on the first heartbeat of his child as he saw it on the sonography — inked on his left bicep there.
 
 He says, “If I’m getting myself inked, then it has to mean something to me. When I heard my son’s heartbeat for the first time, I knew that was a milestone in my life and that it would change things forever. This   is to show my love and gratitude for him for choosing   and me as his parents.”
