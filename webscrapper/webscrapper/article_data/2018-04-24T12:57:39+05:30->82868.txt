Weekends are never boring in Chennai as these peeps know how to spice them up. One thing that they all love to do is partying and thatâ€™s like a must-do thing at the end of every week. After a lazy Saturday morning, to jazz up things, they made plans for a nightout and they all huddled up at this watering hole with so much energy that their spirits did not flag for one moment though they partied hard and partied long. With the disco lights and peppy numbers, the ambience was perfect for their happy night-out trip!
