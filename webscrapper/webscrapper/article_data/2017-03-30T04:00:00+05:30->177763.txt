Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Wednesday adjourned to April 4 an application for stay moved by HUL against   for its icecream advertisement. Hindustan Unilever had filed a “product slander” plea against Amul for the commercial on ‘frozen desserts’. HUL said the advertisement was misleading. Amul said it would prove that it wasn’t. The ad in the meantime can continue to be aired, as the court passed no immediate order to stay it. The couirt posted the matter for final hearing on April 4.

 Virag Tulzapurkar, counsel for HUL, made preliminary submissions on the background of the suit. Seeking a stay on the airing of the TV commercial, he said it essentially “denigrates the Kwality Walls’  , a product of HUL, as it uses the words ‘vanaspati’ in the ad”. Ravi Kadam, counsel for Amul, opposed grant of any ad-interim stay on the ad and said that “truth is a complete justification” of the ad and said he would file a reply.
 
 In his order, Justice S J Kathawalla asked   — which markets dairy products under the brand name of Amul — to file its reply. The application was adjourned and not refused, said a HUL statement later.
 
 HUL manufactures and markets icecreams and frozen desserts in India. Both contain milk/milk solids contrary to the depiction in the advertisements, and do not contain ‘vanaspati’. The company said it moved the court to stop the airing of the “factually incorrect advertisement on frozen desserts being aired by Amul as it is misleading consumers”.
