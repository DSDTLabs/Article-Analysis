Gandhinagar: Former MLA from Savli assembly constituency in Vadodara district and senior   leader   on Friday formally joined the   in the presence of Gujarat Congress president Bharatsinh Solanki.

 Gohil was also a minister in the Dilip Parikh government. Gohil lost the 2012 elections an independent candidate who is now in the BJP and close to the brass, so Gohil was unlikely to get a BJP ticket in the coming elections.
