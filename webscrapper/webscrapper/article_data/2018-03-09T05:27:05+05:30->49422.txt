MUMBAI: Three years after CM   took charge, the state’s financial situation continues to be critical owing to mounting debt burden, poor resource mobilisation, huge expenditure on farm loan waiver, recommendations of the Pay Commission, the massive revised cost of irrigation projects and huge expenditure on populist decisions.

 Leader of opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil expressed concern over the situation, saying it was high time the CM came out with a white paper on the state’s economy. “Our debt burden is the highest ever. The CM must inform the people where such a huge amount was utilised and steps taken for reducing it,” Vikhe Patil said.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 In three years, the debt burden has risen from Rs 2.94 lakh crore to Rs 4.13 crore and there are no signs of it reducing. At the end of the next financial year (2018-19), it may cross the Rs 4.5 crore mark, which will be the highest in the country. When   was in opposition, Fadnavis and   would insist on a white paper. Khadse now feels a status report must be published.
 
 A bureaucrat said despite warnings, no steps have been taken to reduce expenditure on salary and pension. Salary expenses rose from Rs 62,123 crore to Rs 87,147 crore, while the pension amount increased from Rs 17,385 crore to Rs 25,567 crore in three years. “Our cost of establishment is 47.53% against Gujarat’s 33% and Karnataka’s 27%. We had proposed to reduce workforce by 30% in the current year to reduce this cost to 35%, but owing to lack of political will, we were unable to implement the decision,” he said.
 
 The bureaucrat said implementation of the 7th Pay Commission recommendations for 17 lakh employees would result in a burden of Rs 22,000 crore, the farm loan waiver scheme will cost Rs 34,022 crore, while an additional Rs 33,000 crore will be required for completion of 205 ongoing irrigation projects which are awaiting revised administrative approvals.
 
 Secondly, the bureaucrat said, it was expected the BJP-led government would take bold decisions on winding up chronically sick and loss-making state-run enterprises. “We have a large number of corporations and boards. Most have lost relevance or have been sick for long. Successive governments decided to wind them up but didn’t do it,” he said.
 
 The bureaucrat said the excise department generated Rs 11,336 crore against a target of Rs 14,340 crore, while the urban development department mobilised Rs 2,500 crore from sale of additional   and additional premium rates against a target of Rs 5,000 crore.
