 Two constables and a sub-inspector in   who circulated messages on WhatsApp to garner support for a proposed silent protest on January 6 against alleged pay anomalies in the force have been suspended.
 
  While  , an undertrainee sub-inspector in Tehri, was suspended on Friday, Mahesh   and  , both posted in  , were suspended on Thursday after posting messages about the protest named ‘Operation Mahavrat’ on WhatsApp.
  
  The constables are demanding a pay scale at par with employees from other departments, more leaves, allowances, relaxation from VVIP duties and reservation for their children in the Army.
  
  Police brass said more suspensions are expected in a day or two. Ashok Kumar, additional director general of police (ADG) law and order, said, “We have suspended the three for trying to incite the staff. We may take action against more people who are found to be involved in circulating such messages.”
  
  The ADG added, “There will be no protest on Saturday as all the constables have been clearly told that there is no place for indiscipline in uniformed services like police.” Police also appealed to rank and file of the department on its official   page asking them to “not cross any disciplinary line and put their grievances at the right platform within the department”.
  
  The Facebook post read: “Police is a disciplined force and is not like any other government department. It has been tasked to inculcate discipline in the society. We all have been recruited for keeping law and order under control and if there are some problems, they will be sorted out within the department. If policemen will resort to indiscipline, they will also lose moral authority to enforce discipline in the society (sic).”
