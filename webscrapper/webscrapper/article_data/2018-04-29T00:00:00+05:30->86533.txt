A collaboration that began with Godhi Banna Sadharana Mykattu has been growing steadily. While actor-director   and producer Pushkara Mallikarjunaiah went on to collaborate on  , director Hemanth M Rao joined the duo on a few more collaborations that are currently under production. The latest, however, is yet another announcement of a lucrative three-project deal that Rakshit has signed with Pushkara. While the two have a couple of films that they are jointly producing, their latest signing has Pushkara as the sole producer.
“The first film will bring back a part of the Kirik Party team together. But this is for a story based on one of the chapters of Rakshit’s directorial, Ulidavaru Kandante. This time, we will take the story of Richie, played by Rakshit, forward as a full-fledged story,” says Pushkara. Rakshit adds, “Rishab Shetty, the director of Kirik Party, will direct me in this film. He is the right person for the job, as he was my associate director on Ulidavaru Kandante. He understands the story and characters as well as I do because we have lived through it.”
 The second film in this line will bring back director Hemanth into the fold. “Hemanth is currently working on the script, which requires a bit of research. This fictional investigative thriller is set during the independence era, and we have been working out a look for me to suit the time and setting,” says Rakshit. The third film will be directed by Rakshit himself. “I have a skeleton of an idea for this film right now. I will begin working on this script only after I am done with Avane Srimannarayana and Charlie,” he says.
 With so many projects together in the pipeline, Rakshit tells us, “It is great to work with someone like Pushkara, because he is an involved and hands-on producer who does not interfere in the creative process. I find that to be the most comfortable aspect of this collaboration.”
