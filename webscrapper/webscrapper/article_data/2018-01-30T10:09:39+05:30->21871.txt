Chennai: Tourists are giving the thumbs down to the weekly voyage organised by the Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) to the   islands. Last Tuesday, the ship   set sail from Chennai to Port Blair carrying a mere 385 passengers against its total capacity of 1200.

 SCI officials said they expect improved patronage in the coming weeks, although they admit that the two   – 26-year-old Nancowry and 19-year-old Swaraj Dweep – operating between Chennai and the islands are well past their prime. Both have suffered technical failures several times over the last three years during the three-day voyage. 
 
 The reported complaints included engine breakdown, faulty air conditioners and generator failures, delaying the voyage by a day or two. Nancowry, which left Chennai last Tuesday, took five days to reach Port Blair. The ship is docked at Port Blair and scheduled to return to Chennai by February 3, but technical failures may delay the journey. Bookings for the return voyage opened on Monday.
 
 Due to the frequent delays, the ships are mainly used by residents of the islands who receive a 50% discount on the fare. For the bunk class, island residents are charged only Rs 970, while others have to pay Rs 2,630. The 1st class cabin, 2nd class cabin and deluxe class have fewer takers as the charges are equivalent to airline fares which range from Rs 4,000-10,000. The arduous journey, riddled with uncertainties, does not attract tourists. Passengers of the ships, however, are entitled to bring baggage weighing 55kg whereas air passengers have a 15kg limit. 
 
 An official said, “We get the most number of passengers during the summer holidays from May to July. But most of them are residents of the islands and not tourists.”
 
 In an effort to attract tourists, the Union ministry of shipping has ordered two passenger ships from the Cochin Shipyard Ltd to replace Nancowry and Swaraj Dweep. “The new ships will be ready in 2019,” an official said.
