A glowing   of 5 km was organised in   the last Sunday which saw over 1000 enthusiasts running through the clean lanes of Indore taking a vow to keep the city   to bag number one position in Swacch Survekshan 2018 as well. The   was a wild and psychedelic experience with people donning glowing attires to mark the occasion. The event was less about speed and more about enjoying a night of glowing neon lights reflecting from the outfits of the participants and their crazy make up and props that they were carrying. The run started from   and after covering five different glow zones, it ended there only. The glow run was continued with a workout session in the night which turned out to be quite an after party for Indoreans.
