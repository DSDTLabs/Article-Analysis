HOWRAH: A “yoga guru” from Mumbai, Mahesh Ramesh Rao (40), was arrested from Uluberia station on Saturday morning by a joint team of   and Howrah Police on charges of kidnapping a Mumbai youth in 2012. Rao allegedly extracted Rs 1.51 crore from the victim’s father, promising to send the youth to the US for higher studies.

 Originally a resident of Bangalore, Rao shifted to Virar in Mumbai in 2012 where he opened a yoga and gym facility after donning the name of Chandrasekhar Umanath Shetty. The victim, Hitesh Vorse, became the member of the gym. A few months later, Rao called Hitesh’s father Dilip, a businessman in Mumbai, and offered to help send the youth to the US. Convinced, Dilip paid Rao Rs 40 lakh in advance.
 
 However, Rao abducted Hitesh and took him to one of his hideouts in Maheshtala, located in the city’s fringes. Later, Hitesh was taken to Goa where he was kept for a year and then to an ashram in Surat for 14 months. All this while, Dilip would visit Rao who would allegedly connect the father to Hitesh over Skype. Reportedly, Hitesh used to tell his father he was in the US. Dilip became suspicious and lodged a complaint accusing Rao of abduction. The   then fled and took shelter in Bauria, Howrah.
