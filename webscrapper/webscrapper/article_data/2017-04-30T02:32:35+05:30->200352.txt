GURUGRAM:   chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Shriram Siwach has shunted out a staff   of   for turning away a gang   in   last Sunday.

 During the preliminary probe, ordered by Mewat deputy commissioner Maniram Sharma last Tuesday following media reports highlighting the ordeal of the mentally challenged woman, staff nurse Nisha Arora has been found guilty of negligence and disobedience, said Siwach. “What she did was unethical and unprofessional. We have transferred her to a primary health centre delivery hut in Nagina (Mewat),” Siwach added.
 
 Sources said after being turned down by doctors at General Hospital in Punahana, the woman was rushed to Al Afia General Hospital at Mandi Khera around noon last Sunday. Her water bag had already broken and she was having contractions. However, the nurse asked her attendants — a man and a woman who had taken her to the hospital — to take her elsewhere. She said the rape   “is homeless and mentally unstable, and the hospital staff cannot look after someone like her”.
 
 The attended then approached CMO Siwach, whose office is on the second floor of the same hospital. “I immediately called her (Nisha Arora), who gave me the same reason. At this, I asked her to arrange for a psychiatrist and make necessary arrangement for her delivery,” said Siwach, who proceeded on a weeklong leave soon after. Ignoring the instructions, the nurse referred the patient to Shaheed Hasan Khan Medical College at Nalhar.
 
 “Further action will be taken after the probe is over. We are also probing as to why General Hospital in Punahana turned away the patient in the first place,” the CMO said.
