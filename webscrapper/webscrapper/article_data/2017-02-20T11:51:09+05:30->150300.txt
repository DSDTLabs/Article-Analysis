BENGALURU:   snatched England all-rounder   for a staggering 14.5 crore while his fellow English teammate   was bagged by Royal Challengers Bengaluru for Rs 12 crore at the IPL player auction on Monday.

 Stokes was the highlight of the morning session of auction having bagged a blockbuster deal from a base price of Rs 2 crore. RCB, who came into the bidding with Rs 17.825 crore, bought Mills paying 24 times more than his base price of Rs 50 lakh.
 
  
  
 
 Stokes, who earned his maiden IPL contract, will only be available for the first 14 matches of the upcoming IPL season as England are scheduled to play Ireland (from May 5) followed by South Africa (May 24).
 
  
  
 
 Rising Pune Supergiants, who came into the bidding with a purse of Rs 17.5 crore, were left with just Rs 3 crore after splurging on Stokes. However, Sajeev Goenka, owner of Rising Pune Supergiants, said they were satisfied with the purchase. 
 
 "I think Ben Stokes is a complete player and he completes our squad. We have many heroes in our squad but we lacked one hero. Ben Stokes can fill that position," said Goenka.
 
 "We are aware that Ben will be available for the first 14 games. At this moment our focus is only on the first 14 games. We worked out a strategy and we knew we wouldn't have got Ben for a lesser price. We had earmarked a set of price for each player and we are happy," Goenka added.
 
 RCB showed interest on Stokes but made early exit after   stepped in. Thereafter   entered at 4.2 crore and exited after   joined the fierce competition at 11 crore before Pune finished the deal in style to complete the first session.
