TRICHY: A 23-year-old construction worker on Sunday surrendered before the   police in Pudukottai with the severed head of his mother. He had allegedly beheaded the 50-year-old woman in a fit of rage following an argument over a property dispute on Sunday morning, police said. Police arrested the man and have begun an investigation.

 The accused was identified as T   â€” the fourth son of   and T Thilagarani of Maravanpatti village near Karambakudi taluk in   district.
 
 As Thangaraj died a few years ago,   and her son Anand had been residing at their ancestral house at Maravanpatti. Anand was a construction worker who frequently quarrelled with Rani, asking her to hand over a share of the property to him. However, Rani had refused to do so.
 
 On Sunday, during one such quarrel, Anand picked up a knife and hacked her all over her body. As she collapsed, Anand beheaded her and surrendered at the Karambakudi police station with the severed head.
 
 Shocked after seeing Anand with a severed head, police arrested Anand and rushed to the spot where the incident took place. They conducted an inquiry with the neighbours and sent the body to Pudukottai Government Hospital for post-mortem.
