SHIMLA: Hundreds of farmers from upper Shimla areas under the banner of ‘Kisan Zamin Bachao Sangarsh Samiti’ gheraoed the state secretariat in Shimla and raised slogans against cutting of apple trees from their legally-owned land, allegedly under the garb of removing encroachments.

 They demanded the state government to intervene in the matter as ‘rightful owners of the land were being made to suffer for no fault of theirs’.
 
 Earlier, farmers held a   march from Kisan Panchayat Bhawan, Shimla and it concluded at the secretariat. Various speakers, while addressing the protesters, said under the garb of high court orders, the special investigation team was ruining the small and poor farmers. They alleged that the divisional forest officer, Rohru, had got their trees axed but the state government had not taken any action against him so far.
 
 They demanded registration of FIR against the Divisional Forest Officer, Rohru. They sought that the government gave an affidavit in the high court on the issue to stop felling of apple trees and regularizing encroachments on land up to 5 bighas.
 
 Police had erected barricades near the secretariat that some protestors managed to cross. Theog MLA Rakesh Singha was leading the protest march and he was accompanied by former MLA Sanjay Chauhan.
 
 Singha alleged that the Rohru divisional forest officer was working on his own whims due to which farmers of   were suffering. He said apple trees planted in the legally-owned land are also being axed due to which poor farmers are facing huge losses.
 
 He demanded that the government should remove the DFO and five bighas of land should be provided to the landless farmers. A delegation of protesters also met chief minister Jai Ram Thakur with their demands. Thakur said the government was in favour of small and poor farmers and soon the high court would be apprized about the stand taken by the government on the issue.
