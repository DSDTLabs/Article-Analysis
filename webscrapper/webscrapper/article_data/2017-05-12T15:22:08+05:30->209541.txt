NEW DELHI: Suspended   member   today decided to make public a letter from his mother to party chief Kejriwal, in which she chides him for "spreading falsehoods" about her son and for "outright lying".

 "How many lies, Arvind? Ultimately, how many?" asks  , a BJP leader, in the letter her son posted on Twitter. 
 
 "That my son is asking you questions and that you won't answer them - I never thought this could happen," she writes, referring to Mishra's question to Kejriwal on how some AAP leaders funded their foreign trips.
 
  
  
 
 Over the course of two letters this week, Mishra told Kejriwal he remembers him saying AAP has no money even to campaign for elections. "So then how were these foreign trips funded? Where did the money come from for that?" Mishra asked.
 
 Kejriwal hasn't yet replied to these specific questions Mishra asked since his shocking Sunday 
  in a questionable transaction.
 
 Since the allegation, some AAP leaders have said Mishra is lying or that he's a "BJP agent." Annapurna referred to those allegations as well in her letter.
 
 "Arvind, you've worked with Kapil, but I don't think you've really gotten to know him. He's very stubborn. He hasn't eaten for three days...As a mother, I just want to say give him the answer to his small question. He isn't anyone's agent, he's just an agent for truth," Mishra's mother writes.
  
 Annapurna also expresses her disappointment that Kejriwal is standing silent while his "friends" are calling not just her son but her corrupt as well.
 
 "I was the one who organised the first mohalla sabha in Delhi. In 2007. You too had come to that sabha, all your friends had come as well. There was no party then, nothing like that...You even talked in your book 'Swaraj' about how I work. Today, how far you've fallen," she writes.
 
 "These lies won't help you. Learn to fear god," she signs off.
