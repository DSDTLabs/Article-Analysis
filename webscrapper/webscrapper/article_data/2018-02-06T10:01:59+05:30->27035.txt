AURANGABAD: Veteran actor   on Monday said financial help alone is not enough to prevent farmers’ suicides in the state and that they need moral and social support too.

 The founder-president of the NGO, NAAM Foundation, in the city to promote ‘Apla Manus’, the Marathi film in which he plays the lead role. 
 
 Speaking to reporters, he said, “Considering the rising suicide cases in the drought-prone districts of Latur, Beed and Aurangabad, the NGO is undertaking initiatives such as providing psychological support to distressed farmers,” said Patekar. 
 
 “All they (farmers) want to know is that they are not alone. It is not merely about financial support. We take help from psychologists, who assist them through camps or personal interventions. They should know that we are with them,” the actor-cum-social activist said. 
 
 Patekar highlighted the various projects his organisation has undertaken to empower villagers in Marathwada.
 
 NAAM Foundation was jointly founded by Patekar and actor   in 2015 to work in villages across Maharashtra.
 
 Asked about the depleting ground water levels in Marathwada and the advent of water crisis ahead of summer this year, the actor said the water rejuvenation project undertaken by his organisation has ensured water in wells that had gone dry. 
 
 “Building toilets and soak-pits are the two criteria that we ask the villages to meet to attract help from us. The soak pit system, which is sending the waste water into the ground instead of diverting it to gutters, has done wonders. The once dried-up springs and wells have come alive again,” said Pateker, adding that these villages are increasingly becoming less dependent on water tankers.
 
 Owing to the water management by NAAM in Arvi village of Beed district, around 500 acres of land in the village is covered under drip irrigation. The new work for 5km river rejuvenation, which was started this year, is expected to provide cent percent water availability in the village.
