NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party’s   faction and   appear to be on their way to 
  . Sources in Congress said that the the two sides were nearing an understanding where the Uttar Pradesh chief minister would leave over 100 of the state’s 403 seats for Congress.

 The 
  are being conducted by senior Congress member  , who is in charge of UP, and Akhilesh’s chief strategist  .
 
 “They (the talks) have progressed well and this is best indicated by the Congress member of Rajya Sabha and former Union law minister ( ) appearing for the Akhilesh faction before the EC to claim the cycle symbol of the party,” the source said.
 
 If true, Congress’s assessment that the UP CM might leave more than “100 seats” for them marks 
  that seemed to be staring at irrelevance in the elections for the control of India’s largest state.
 
 The party, which entered the UP arena with big fanfare and, with the avowed ambition to contest all the 403 seats, even declared   its CM candidate, was soon forced to scale down its goal and appeared keen to have 
  of preventing BJP from winning.
 
 However, the party did not seem to have any option, with both BSP and SP, under Mulayam Singh Yadav, ruling out an alliance. The split in SP gave Congress, along with Akhilesh’s need to posit his faction as the real  , a better instrument to gather the support of Muslims who are perceived to be determined to defeat BJP in the coming elections. 
 
 A formal announcement of the tie-up may come soon after the EC rules on the competing claims of SP’s rival factions for the “cycle” symbol of the party on Monday.
