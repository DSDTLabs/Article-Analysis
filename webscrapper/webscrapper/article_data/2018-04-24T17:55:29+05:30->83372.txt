NEW DELHI: The   (CBSE) Class 12 Economics retest is scheduled to be held on Wednesday, April 25, 2018. The paper, conducted on March 26, was cancelled due to alleged leaks. 

 
 The Economics paper is considered to be the most important and one of the toughest subjects for Class 12 Humanities and commerce stream students.
 
 "The CBSE Class 12 Economics paper that conducted in March was very easy and direct from the NCERT. We don't know how the paper will be set this time. Going by the trends we expect it would be easy and questions would be asked from the CBSE prescribed syllabus only," subject teacher   said. 
 
 "For the past several years, Economics has become the bane of the students as most of the students are failing in this subject only," Mishra added. He also welcomed the CBSE's decision of introducing the practical exam for this subject, "now the results will definitely improve from this year onwards" he opined.
 
 Now, the students have already appeared once for the exam, they would be well aware of the pattern that had seen the significant changes from the last year examinations.
