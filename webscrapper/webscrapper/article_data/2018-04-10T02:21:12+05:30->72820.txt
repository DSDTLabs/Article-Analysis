NAVI MUMBAI: Two of the city’s long   projects—construction of an auditorium in   and a multi purpose hall in Vashi—are set to be revived by the civic administration. 

 Both   remained incomplete despite getting approvals from the General Body. 
 
 “The revised proposal will be tabled for approval in the coming general body meet. We are now committed to complete the project at the earliest,” said municipal commissioner   N.
 
  In case of the Airoli auditorium, officials said the infrastructure has been now designed as an auditoriumcum-community centre. 
 
 “in the previous design the facility was supposed to be only an auditorium but now the structure can be used as a community hall as well. The project has been re-tendered,” said city engineer  . 
 
 A similar fresh proposal has been readied for the   at a cost of Rs 17.54 crore. The project, estimated to cost over Rs 13 crore, has been planned in sector 3. 
 
 “Both the projects were given to one contractor but due to financial issues the agency couldn’t complete the work. While construction of auditorium is pending since 2014, in case of the multi-purpose hall work has been pending since 7 years. Since the community centre project cost has got escalated, fresh approvals from the general body is necessary before seeking tender bids,” said Dagaonkar.
