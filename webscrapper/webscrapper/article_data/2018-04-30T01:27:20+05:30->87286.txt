NEW DELHI: After days of sizzling heat with temperatures going up to almost as high as 42 degrees Celsius, the capital received some much needed respite on Sunday night with intense rain and thunder reported from several parts of the city. While the day-time   remained high, with the maximum temperature recorded at 40.4 degrees Celsius at Safdarjung, it crossed the 42 degree Celsius mark at Palam on Sunday.

 Met officials attributed the rain to favourable local conditions, saying it was normal for this time of the season to see such rain. These showers usually develop within a matter of hours, officials added.
 
 “There was rapid local development, which is a typical characteristic of thunderstorm activity in the pre-monsoon season. We had an active circulation from northeast Rajasthan that came to the capital by the evening, while the moisture content was already high,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at the regional met office. 
 
 Srivastava said similar thunder development is likely to continue till Friday, with light rain possible in isolated parts. “We will see cloudy skies for the next few days, with thundershowers possibly taking place in the form of a drizzle or light rain. These are due to local conditions. The maximum temperature is going to come down to as low as 36 degrees Celsius over the next few days.”
 
 On Sunday, mercury levels were above the 40 degree Celsius mark at all stations in the capital, with Palam being the highest at 42.2 degrees C. Ayanagar, Ridge and Lodhi road, meanwhile, recorded a maximum of 41.2, 40 and 40 degrees Celsius respectively.
 
 According to the met, there is a possibility of rain or thunderstorm activity on Monday as well, with duststorm in parts of the capital.
