NEW DELHI: Even though the   has not decided yet on the schedule for the   assembly bypoll,   has declared its   for the seat. As a norm, bypolls have to be held within six months of the seat falling vacant. The Bawana seat fell vacant after AAP MLA Ved Prakash resigned about two months ago to join BJP.

 The assembly byelection in Bawana is going to be important for AAP as it will put to test the partyâ€™s popularity in the wake of the recent assembly poll outcomes in Punjab and municipal election results in Delhi. Also, it will reflect on how Delhiites perceive the performance of AAP-led government and its 49 councillors in the three corporations.
 
 AAP has chosen to give ticket to a party worker, Ramchandra, who was earlier associated with India Against Corruption. In 2008, he had contested an election on a BSP ticket.
 
 AAP has justified the candidature of Ramchandra on the grounds that he is a dedicated party worker and a known social worker in Bawana. A resident of the constituency, Ramchandra has helped locals get ration cards and Aadhaar cards to enable them to get access to social entitlements, AAP said in a statement. 
 
 It appears that AAP does not want to repeat the mistakes it made in the candidate selection for the   bypoll. 
 
 Questions were raised even by a section party workers about the whole process. It was then felt that there was a need to reach out to people with a more focused campaign.
