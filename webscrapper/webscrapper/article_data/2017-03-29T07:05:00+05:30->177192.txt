CHANDIGARH: If the vetted draft of recruitment rules for the post of director-principal at   (GMCH), Sector 32, gets endorsed by the  , the term of the director shall be for five years instead of the present three. Director-principal Dr   shall be completing his extended term on April 23. The   administration had decided to drafted the amended rules for the post after many senior faculty members at GMCH sent their representation for changing the rules this January.

 According to the draft prepared by the UT administration on Tuesday, which is on pattern of  , director-principal shall have a maximum age of 54 years and there shall be a relaxation of another five years. This mean that instead of being eligible for the post until the age of 56 years, the director-principal can remain so until turns 59. 
 
 Also, the draft reads that even after the director-principal completes his five-year term, he can be the head of the department until he turns 62 years old, the age of retirement. 
 
 Does this mean another extension for Dr Atul? “The post will be advertised and filled up through UPSC once the revised recruitment rules are approved by the UPSC,” said Anurag Aggarwal, home-cum-health secretary, UT. 
 
 As this entire process takes longer, it is expected that the present director principal will get more time to serve. 
 
 Sources said when the recruitment rules were made; the retirement age of teaching faculty was 58 years. This meant that those who were more than 55 years were not eligible for the post of director-principal. “With this as the basis, the faculty had sent a representation for the change in the recruitment rules for the post,” said an official in the UT health department. 
 
 The UT administration has asked the GMCH to upload the draft on its website so that the stakeholders can give their comment
