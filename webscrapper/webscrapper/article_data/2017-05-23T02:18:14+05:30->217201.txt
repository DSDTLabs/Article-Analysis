NAVI MUMBAI:   on Monday arrested an 18-year-old collegian for allegedly creating a minor’s fake account on a social networking site and posting lewd messages on it. The accused, Pranav Dhepale, is a Juinagar resident. The 17-year-old girl resides in the same locality and both are from the same college. 

 Dhepale has been booked under Section 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the IPC along with Section 66 of the Information Technology Act.
 
 Senior inspector   said, “The accused had sent ‘friend’ requests from that fake Facebook account to the girl’s relatives and friends. The girl got to know of the account when some of her friends and relatives accepted the ‘friend’ requested and were shocked to see the obscene messages. Last week, the teenager, accompanied by her father, lodged a complaint and using technical expertise, we tracked down the accused.”
 
 Dephale was arrested from his residence on Sunday. He has been sent to judicial custody.
