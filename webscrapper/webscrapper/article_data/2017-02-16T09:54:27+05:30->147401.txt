MUMBAI: The last time the Committee of Administrators (COA) ­ appointed by the   to run   ­ met, 12 employees of the   lost their jobs. On Friday, the   is meeting again.

 Those in the know of things say COA will be looking into the roles of more such individuals in the BCCI who, in the administrators' view, could be conflicted. Apropos of the protracted arguments that have taken place in the last one year over what amounts to conflict and what doesn't, the COA has made up its mind to take fresh stock.
 
 However, that is not top of the agenda that has been set for the February 17 meeting. The bigger headache for the administrators tomorrow will be to sit and discuss how they are going to work on the single-most important task assigned to them by the country's highest court: To have 23rds of the BCCI members vote in favour of implementing the   reforms in the SGM.
 
 It's a task they're already sweating over. The COA needs to call for a general body meeting of all BCCI members and seek a vote on the reforms to be implemented. However, given the present scenario of absolute confusion ­ especially with the Attorney General of India Mukul Rohtagi joining the Supreme Court hearings on behalf of the government representatives in BCCI ­ it is very unlikely that BCCI's member associations will agree to the implementation in totality. For this, sources say, the COA may have to go back to the Supreme Court, to seek further clarification. 
 
 “It's too early to say anything but the COA can certainly ask the court that it be allowed to appoint a representative administrator for each state association much like the COA itself ­ who could then bring about the required 23rd majority. But for now, that doesn't even sound logical enough for a discussion,” say sources.
 
 Ex-CAG Vinod Rai, who heads the COA, was out of the country and returned to the country on Wednesday night. Rai will lead discussions in Friday's meeting.
