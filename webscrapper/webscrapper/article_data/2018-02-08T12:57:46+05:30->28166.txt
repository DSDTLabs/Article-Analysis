RAJKOT: A 48-year-old man was hacked to death allegedly by his own son-in-law in   village of   taluka in   district between Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning. 

 Police identified the deceased as Velji Rawalia (48). Velji’s body was found in a pool of blood at his orchard on Wednesday morning. 
 
 “According to the complaint by Velji’s brother Narayan Rawalia (45), who lives in   (East) in Mumbai and is on a visit to his village, Velji’s son-in-law   allegedly murdered him,” said Adesar police station sub-inspector M S Rana. 
 
 “In his complaint, Narayan said that Hitesh’s wife had deserted him and had come to stay with her father Velji. She had also filed a case against Hitesh in a Rapar court. Hitesh suspected that his wife had filed the case at the instance of Velji and had a fight with Velji outside the court premises after a hearing in the past,” added Rana. 
 
 Hitesh is a prime suspect in the case as his house was found locked and he was missing when police went there.
