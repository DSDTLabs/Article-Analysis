SURAT: Hundreds of commuters going toward   and Dumas were stuck in a   near   on Saturday evening. 

 As a temporary arrangement, traffic going towards Parle Point and Dumas at   was diverted from Indoor Stadium lane as the main road near   remained blocked due to construction for a flyover span to connect the much-hyped cable-stayed bridge. 
 
 Though the movement of traffic was normal till afternoon, it started troubling commuters in the evening due to the heavy jam near Indoor Stadium. 
 
 There were not many traffic personnel and cops around to manage the situation. 
 
 Jaimin Vyas, a resident of Nanpura who was going to Dumas with his family in the car, said, “It was total mismanagement on the part of police to manage the traffic flow at Indoor Stadium. We were stuck here for the last 20 minutes and vehicles could not move an inch.”
 
 Another commuter, Rajesh Patel, said, “There were no cops around to manage vehicles coming from the opposite direction. The road from Indoor Stadium is one-way, but still commuters keep approaching from the opposite side, which creates jam.”
 
 Most two-wheeler riders risked their lives and decided to drive on the wrong-side of the main road to skip the traffic jam. 
 
 “We can’t help, but opt to drive on the wrong side of the main road. At least, it is better to reach early than to remain stuck in the traffic,” said Dhruv Shah, a student.
