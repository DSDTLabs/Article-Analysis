HYDERABAD: Increasing number of trespassers pose a serious threat to the wildlife at the   (UoH).

 In the most recent case, a group of students nabbed 15 trespassers on campus. This is not the first time that the team of  , a group formed to protect wildlife on campus, has caught trespassers. Around 65 trespassers, including poachers, have been caught between 2014 and 2016. “The number has now increased to 80 with fresh trespassers caught by us on Sunday. The main reason for increasing number of trespassers is the short compound wall at many places around the campus. This makes it easy for trespassers and poachers to hop over easily,“ said  , founder of Wild Lens. The trespassers caught on Sunday were found to have carried out unauthorised activities on campus. “When I enquired, I got to know that many of them were cutting trees, collecting tamarind and selling it outside. A few of them were even poachers who hunted wild animals such as boar, peacocks and deer,“ said Jillapalli.
 
 The trespassers were handed over to campus security. “In the past too we caught many trespassers. But no action was initiated against them,“ said Jillapalli. Not just trespassers, but stray dogs too pose a threat to the wildlife.
