PANAJI: Mining leaseholders on Monday demanded that the state government issue a specific order letting them continue pump water for   and irrigation lest they fall foul of the Supreme Courtâ€™s order which halted mining activities in the state. 

 Eight mining companies filed their written submissions to   collector  . Some stated that they fear being hauled up for contempt if they continue pumping of water. They asked how they could pump water when their consent to operate under the Water Act and Air Act was withdrawn. 
 
 A source informed TOI that some mining companies have for years pumped water from mining pits to supply the same for drinking and irrigation to villages in the vicinity. TOI has learned that some mining companies are continuing to do so, but fear contempt in case someone approaches the courts. 
 
 Mohanan, in her capacity as district magistrate, North Goa, has invoked Section 133(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, and passed a conditional order that all mining leaseholders can continue releasing water for drinking and irrigation. She said that failure to comply shall attract criminal action under Section 188, CrPC.
 
 Earlier, the directorate of mines and geology directed leaseholders to continue pumping water from mining leases for drinking water, agriculture, and horticulture. Director   had said that various village panchayats, locals, and public representatives asked the department to permit the pumping of water and other safety measures as they were undertaken before March 15.
