PATNA: The infamous sex scandal involving a retired IAS official’s son and a dalit ex-minister’s daughter has taken a fresh turn with automobile dealer   consenting to tie the knot with his girlfriend, who has accused him of rape.
 
  The couple submitted their marriage proposal in the form of a joint compromise petition before the SC/ST court of judge Akhilanand Dubey in Patna on Thursday.
  
  An FIR in this connection was lodged by the girl in the SC/ST police station in Patna on December 22 last year. She accused Nikhil, his father  , elder brother   and Nikhil’s friend Sanjeet Kumar Sharma of sexually exploiting and thrashing her in January 2016 when she was a minor.
  
  Nikhil’s father Krishna Bihari is a retired IAS official of Jharkhand cadre. The girl’s father is a Congress functionary and a former state minister.
  
  In course of investigation into the case, police made former Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee’s vice-president Brajesh Pandey a non-FIR accused in the case. He and Sharma have eluded the police dragnet so far.
  
    and his father were arrested by   police near a checkpost in Pauri Garhwal on March 14 this year. They along with Manish are lodged lodged in Beur jail.
  
  Defence counsel Janardan Rai is now hopeful of a favourable outcome. “You cannot make a case out of a complaint that ceases to exist,” he told this reporter.
  
  However, special public prosecutor Shyam Nandan Kumar Singh Santosh told TOI the compromise petition was not valid as the victim was a minor at the time of crime. “The nature of the Sections used against the accused is such that compromise cannot be entertained,” he said, adding the case was likely to come up for hearing next on Friday.
