NEW DELHI:   professor   resigned on January 23 over alleged contentions with the vice-chancellor and other members of the university administration. 

 Dimri of the School of Environmental Sciences had investigated the assault on   who has been missing since October 15. He had sent show-cause notices to four students, also members of ABVP. 
 
 When contacted, Dimri confirmed his resignation but refused to spell out the reasons for it. 
 
 Registrar Pramod Kumar, too, confirmed it and said Dimri “is one of the best academicians of our institutions and he may have resigned to focus more on his academic activities”. But sources close to Dimri said he was unhappy with the administration’s behaviour. “He felt that the administration should introspect why the students have been continuously protesting ever since the VC was appointed. He believes JNU is known for a certain character and if the administration curbs the voices then the very character of the university would be jeopardised,” said a source. 
 
 This is the second such instance of a chief proctor resigning at JNU in one year. Krishna Kumar had resigned as chief proctor after the February 9, 2016, controversy. 
 
 Several students have also raised questions over the sudden resignation. SFI activist Shehla Rashid took to Twitter to attack the VC over the resignation. “What is most striking about this resignation is that the VC has not even completed a year and two chief proctors have resigned already,” she told TOI. 
 
 Rashid alleged that this was because of the attack on the autonomy of the proctor’s office by the administration. She believed that the issue began when the proctor, in his inquiry report on the Najeeb issue, had acknowledged the attack. “But this report was diluted by the VC who then gave a token punishment to the students,” she said. Meanwhile, JNU said in a press statement that professor Usha Tandon had been appointed the new chief proctor on Tuesday.
