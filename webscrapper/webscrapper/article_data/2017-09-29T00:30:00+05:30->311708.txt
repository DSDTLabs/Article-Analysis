Belagavi: Dayanand Swami of the World Animal Welfare Board, said sacrificing animals is rampant in   district, which is represented by chief minister  . “I’m happy to hear that the government is bringing in laws against superstitions, but at the same time, the chief minister should prevent the sacrificing of thousands of animals in the name of deities,” he said.

 At a press conference here on Thursday, the   said thousands of sheep and goats are scarified during the annual Mahadeshwar Jatre fair at Kudaluru in Kollegal taluk and Chikkaluru Siddeppa Jatre in Chamarajanagar district. “The Karnataka high court banned   in 2008, and directed the authorities to take precautionary measures in this regard. Despite this, the heinous and brutal practice has not stopped in Chamarajanagar district,” he said.
 
 Dayanand Swami, who is also a head of Basava Dharma Jnanapeetha, is fighting for the rights of animals since over a decade. After hearing his petition, the Karnataka high court in 2008, ordered all deputy commissioners and police department heads to take appropriate measures, to stop the sacrifice of animals.
 
 Since the past few years, the seer is struggling to stop the sacrifice of animals at Kakkeri in Khanapur taluk in Belagavi district, where thousands of animals are slaughtered in the premises of the temple of deity Bhistadevi, during Dasara. He is creating awareness among villagers about the law. “I will visit villages during Dasara, to stop the practice of animal sacrifice,” he said.
 
 Shortly, programmes will be held at Daddi village in Hukkeri taluk in Belagavi district, where animals are sacrificed in large numbers, during the annual fair of the local deity. Dayanand Swami said killing cattle is an offence under the Karnataka Prevention of Cow Slaughter and Cattle Prevention Act-1964.
