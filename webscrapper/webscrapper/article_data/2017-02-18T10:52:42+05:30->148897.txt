AHMEDABAD: For Anil Selsikar, 34, a resident of Hatkeshwar, the happy times after his wedding to the beautiful  , 25, of Nashik lasted only eight days. Selsikar tied the knot on January 29, and found his wife missing on February 5, 2017. 

 Worried over her disappearance, Selsikar discovered that he had been duped by Parghi, who vanished with jewellery worth Rs 1.90 lakh and Rs 20,000 in cash.
 
  When Selsikar, who works at a private factory, narrated the story of his   with Parghi, police immediately understood that a gang was at work and had conned Selsikar into the marriage.
 
 “Selsikar told us he had paid Rs 1.5 lakh to the bride and Rs 60,000 to five others as commission for arranging the match. We arrested the agents who fixed the marriage, Ramesh Ninave and his wife Pushpa, both residents of Nashik in Maharashtra. Three others, Asha Jadav, Vibhote Manik and Suresh Autowala, are still on the run,” said a senior police official.
 
 According to police sources, Selsikar contacted Ninave to find a match. “Ninave and his wife Pushpa introduced Ninave to Asha Jadav, who pretended to be Parghi’s mother. Manik pretended to be her father and Suresh introduced himself as a close relative. 
 
 “They made Selsikar give Rs 1.5 lakh to the girl and took Rs 60,000 themselves, for arranging the match. On January 29, Selsikar married Parghi and gave her gold jewellery worth Rs 1.90 lakh as a wedding gift. Selsikar considered himself lucky to get a wife like Parghi until she went missing with his fortune,” added a police official.
 
 Police sources said they are in touch with their counterparts in Nashik to find the absconding accused and are investigating whether the gang duped other ‘bridegrooms’.
