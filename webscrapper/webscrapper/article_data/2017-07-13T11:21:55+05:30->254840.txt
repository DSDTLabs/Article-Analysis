BATHINDA: Blaming the   mayor Akshit Jain of stalling all developmental works in the town and not convening any meeting of the house for over six months, over 20 councillors on Wednesday held a protest outside the municipal corporation. Three councillors led by   president and councillor Tarlochan Singh sat on hunger strike for the third day.

 The councillors with the agenda ‘Mayor bhajao Moga bachao’ (get rid of mayor to save Moga) accused Akshit of taking Congress’ support and not heeding anyone, especially the house members from   (SAD) and BJP. They also accused the corporation authorities of not releasing the payments to contractors worth over Rs 6 crore.
 
 Akshit, who is son of former Moga MLA Joginderpal Jain, was elected mayor as an SAD nominee in the house of 50 councillors. 
 
 Councillors Tarlochan and Prem Kumar alleged, “All the developmental works have come to grinding halt for the last over six months. The sewerage in the town has not been cleaned. We fear accumulation of water in the town with monsoons having set in. Payments to the contractors who have declined to work further till their dues are cleared have not been made. We are sitting on hunger strike for the last three days but the authorities have not bothered to assure us to start the development works.”
 
 When contacted, mayor Akshit said the state government was playing musical chairs over the appointment of the municipal corporation commissioner. “In the last four months, six commissioners have been changed and due to that work has suffered and payments of nearly Rs 6 crore could not be made to the contractors. Now a meeting of the house has been called for July 19 where all the pending works will be cleared.”
 
 Moga MLA   alleged, “The developmental works would be started at the earliest and the money will not be a constraint. I have met the protesting councillors and promised full cooperation. The councillors would sit for talks to resolve the issues.”
