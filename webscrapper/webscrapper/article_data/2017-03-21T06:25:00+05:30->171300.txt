Ranchi: People gathered in large numbers at   in   on   to witness the   when the rays of the sun fall perpendicularly over the equator resulting in equal length of day and night. This unique phenomena can be seen from this megalithic site, about 120 km from the state capital. The clear sky over Hazaribag ensured good visibility as the sun rose from the horizon. 

 Amateur megalith expert Subhashis Das, who has authored several books on megalithic sites in India, and has been researching on the subject for more than 20 years, guided locals to view the sun from a particular angle at the site. He said the sun does not rise from the save spot every day. “The point of sunrise shifts from one point in winter called the winter solstice (where it appears on December 22/23) to summer solstice (which occurs on June 22/23) every year. The sun passes through a particular point twice every year called the vernal and autumnal equinox,” he said.
 
 Tribals believe the point of sunrise on vernal and autumnal equinox is considered the true ‘east’. Ancient tribes here erected two stones (menhirs) to form an angle through which the sunrise can be viewed. 
 
 Though most of the megalithic sites of Jharkhand are burial sites, Pankri Burwadih is not just a burial site but also an observatory to study the transit of the sun. Das found that the Punkri Burwadih site is also aligned to the summer and winter solstices and also to that of the equinoxes.
