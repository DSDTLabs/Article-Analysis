Actress 
 , who worked with director Remo Dâ€™Souza in '  2' shared a sweet post to wish him on his birthday.

  
  
 The 'Baaghi' actress took to her social media handle to post a picture of the birthday cake captioning it, "Happy birthday remo sir!!! @remodsouza #GoodVibesOnly #ABCD2Reunion @dharmesh0011 @raghavjuyal @sushi1983 @punitjpathak missed you @varundvn !!!"
 
 
  
 
 Looks like, Remo's birthday was also a reunion for the entire cast of 'ABCD 2' but 
  seems to have missed it due to other work commitments.
