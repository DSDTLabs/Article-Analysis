Vadodara: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has been forced to issue a notice stating that apartment blocks constructed by the civic body itself are dilapidated and dangerous for occupants. And, it is not as if the houses for the urban poor were made decades back.

 The residents of Nilgiri Housing Scheme off Sun Pharma Road are peeved at the VMC’s move and have been making demands that they should be given alternative houses. The VMC has in its notice asked the residents to bring down their homes and stated that if they continued to live in the houses, it would be at their own responsibility.
 
 Residents of the area point out that the 240 houses were constructed in 2002 and they were given possession subsequently. They added that they had not expected the houses to become unlivable so soon.
 
 Said a residents Sabina Sheikh, “Most houses are in a bad condition. They have some or the other problem. We stay on the fourth floor and are particularly afraid for our safety.” The residents have pressed the panic triggers as many do not have an alternative accommodation and will have to take up a property on rent despite having paid for the house. In-charge VMC city engineer Shailesh Mistry said that the condition of the houses would be examined to ascertain the extent and reason for damage. He added that after the VMC handed them over the properties and sale deeds were done, it was the responsibility of the residents to maintain the buildings. “The bad condition could also be because of lack of maintenance,” he added.
 
 Mistry pointed out that a possible solution was to bring down the blocks and reconstruct them under the public-private partnership mode. “There is a provision for this under the policies of the state government. But for this all residents have to consent,” he said.
