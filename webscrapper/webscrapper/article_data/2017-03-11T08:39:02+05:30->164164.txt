NOIDA: To ensure heightened security and minimum disruption, all four roads around the   vote counting centre in Sector 88 will remain closed for vehicular movement on Saturday from 6am till the ballot counting process is over, a traffic advisory said. The counting of votes will begin at 8am.

 Commuters travelling from   in   towards Noida via the Dadri-Surajur-Chalera (DSC) Road will have to take a left from the T-point near the SMC company, Phase 2, the advisory further mentioned. From the SMC T-point, the commuters would have to take a right near the Himgiri Automobile Company, from where they can reach DSC Road via the inner roads of B block, Sector 88.
 
 Dharmendra Yadav, traffic inspector, told TOI a team of traffic policemen would be deployed ahead of the Hindon Bridge, where the diversions would be enforced.
 
  Meanwhile, the vehicular movement from the Gejha T-point towards Greater Noida via DSC Road will be unaffected.
 
 Further, election officials and mediapersons will be allowed entry from Gate 2 of the voting centre where parking space has been allotted to them near the vacant ground opposite the administrative building of the complex. Gate No. 1 and 3 of the complex will remain closed. Gate No. 4 will be open for poll observers and senior officials of the administration while poll agents and candidates can enter the premises from Gate No. 5.
 
 District magistrate N P Singh said the votes polled through ballot papers would be counted first, and then the EVMs. “The counting of votes of Noida, Dadri and Jewar constituencies will be held simultaneously, but the results of Jewar are likely to out earlier as it has fewer voters,” he said.
 
 Security personnel have been deployed at the poll counting venue. “Both civil police and paramilitary forces will be deployed at the spot. Police teams will escort the winning candidates to their homes,” Noida SSP Dharmendra Singh said.
