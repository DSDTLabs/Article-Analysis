NEW DELHI: Nepalese businessman Shamsul Hoda, a key suspect behind the failed attempt to cause train derailment in Ghorasahan, had met his Pakistani handler Safi Shaikh, who is linked to ISI, in Dubai last January, just after news of the arrests in India and Nepal broke out.

 Hoda, during his interrogation by an NIA team in Nepal, revealed that he had met Safi in Dubai once after the Ghorasahan case arrests and thereafter remained in touch with him over the telephone.
 
 Hoda was arrested in early February after he returned to Nepal from Dubai.
 
 Hoda has confirmed that he had travelled with Safi to Pakistan after the fasting month of Ramzan last year. It is here that he was asked by some of Safi's aides, supposedly linked to ISI, to cause largescale casualties in India by engineering stampedes, train derailments, riots and attacks on government installations.
 
 Safi not only sponsored Hoda's air ticket, but also ensured that his visa to Pakistan was arranged promptly. Hoda is believed to have been accommodated in an ISI safehouse in Karachi. He was told that he should tap Indian criminal gangs for executing terror attacks in India and that he would be paid handsomely. Probe has already thrown up money trail of a Rs 8-9 lakh transfer made by Safi to Hoda's bank account at a Himalayan Bank branch in Birganj, Nepal.
 
 After Hoda left, Safi stayed back in Pakistan. Hoda has said he was not sure when Safi returned to Dubai.
 
 While NIA has already questioned Hoda and pointsman Brij Kishore Giri in Nepal, there are discrepancies in their statements. Sources indicated the two may be questioned together. While they have confessed to their role in the failed attempt to plant an IED on the tracks in Ghorasahan, they have not talked of any link to the Kanpur or Koneru derailment.
