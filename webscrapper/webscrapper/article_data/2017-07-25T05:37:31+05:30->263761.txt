KOLKATA/PURULIA: Two   desire to surrender in front of the chief minister led to chaos and confusion on Monday with   rushing to   to take stock of the situation and check if there was any   at the city’s most-guarded address — 30B Harish Chatterjee Street, CM Mamata Banerjee’s residence. Both were released later in the day.

 According to sources, Suchand Singh Mura alias Sujato Singura (35), a resident of Chantrajara village at Ayodha hills, and Sundari Singh Sardar (28), a Saipuddi village resident, were intercepted around 9.15am near the CM’s house. Cops went into a tizzy as loaded firearms were found on them.
 
 After interrogation, police came to know that the   duo, both cadres of the Ayodhya squad, had come to surrender their arms to Mamata Banerjee. Mura was a temporary member of the Ayodha squad (kara) and was presently running a small business as a decorator. His brother claimed Mura was looking to earn some compensation even though he has no cases pending against him. “Every former Maoist now earns handsomely. My brother wanted to avail of the opportunity,” claimed one of the brothers after being informed of the detention. 
 
 Sundari, on the other hand, is reportedly a housewife. Police are ascertaining if her husband Baldev Singh was a squad member. “We will take them to state IB and a thorough background check will be done,” said a south division officer.
 
 A probe has been ordered for a possible security breach. On Monday, DC (South) Praveen Tripathi rushed to Kalighat police station to question the duo. “They were intercepted right at the first security post. So there is not question of any breach?” said a senior officer.
