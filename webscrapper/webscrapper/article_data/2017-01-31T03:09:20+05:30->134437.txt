THANE: Residents will wake up to the aroma of delicious sweets and melodious bhajans as the city will be celebrating Maghi   on Tuesday.

 Residents celebrate Maghi Ganpati, the birthday of Lord Ganesha, with the same pomp and excitement as Ganesh Chaturthi. 
 
 “This is the day when Lord Ganesh was actually born. We have been celebrating it for the last 10 years. As kids, we used to make our own idols. However, this year we bought a 32-inch Ganesh idol. The idol will be adorned with eco-friendly   that have been made using flowers, leaves and newspapers,’’ said Shraddha Sawarkar.
 
 ‘‘The one-and-a-half-day celebration will begin from morning with prayers, followed by merriment. We will also gorge on some mouth-watering delicacies like ukdiche modak, puran poli and the likes,” the Kolshet resident added.
 
 Kameshwari Kulkarni, a Vartak Nagar resident, said, “While we bring home an idol of Lord Ganesha during Ganesh Chaturthi, we also celebrate Maghi Ganpati in a small way at home. We pray to the Lord at home and offer him sweets and flowers. We also abstain from meat during the entire week.”
 
 Meanwhile, many pandals have been set up across the city. Some organisers will be celebrating the festival on the lines of Ganesh Chaturthi with 10 days of pooja, cultural programmes and other activities.
