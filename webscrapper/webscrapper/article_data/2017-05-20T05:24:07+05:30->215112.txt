CHENNAI: Ten days have passed since four people died and eight others were injured when a fire engulfed an illegal   in Vadapalani that they lived in, but police are yet to file a case against the owner of the complex.

 Till government agencies determine that the five-storey structure was built in violation of a sanctioned plan, police officers said, they cannot take action against the building owner,  . Police said they have written to the corporation, CMDA, the PWD and electricity board, seeking details of the building.
 
 “We need to have material evidence before registering a case against him [the owner]. The reply from these departments will reveal the kind of violations,” Vadapalani assistant commissioner of police Annadurai said. “We filed a case under CrPC Section 174 (unnatural death) and could alter it to IPC Section 304A (causing death by negligence not amounting to culpable homicide).”
 
 For their part,   said the corporation must initiate further action with regard to the building. The owner built 28 apartments in the building, which was occupied by 22 families. Many residents paid lease amounts of several lakhs of rupees; others paid montly rent. 
 
 Dasarathan, a tenant who moved into the   a month ago, said he had paid Rs 10,000 as advance. “The authorities asked use to move out after the fire. But we have not been repaid the advance as the house owner cannot be contacted,” he said.
 
  A neighbour said the tenants are in a desperate situation. “We saw a woman weeping last week outside the building. She had paid a lease amount of Rs 10 lakh,” he said.
