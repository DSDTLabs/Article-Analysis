 Avhad said the police had first registered a case of kidnapping and had begun the search. “A team of about 20 policemen from Nigdi police reached Chikhali to trace Atharva,” Avhad said.
 
 At 10 pm, one of the policemen went to check the neighbouring construction site. He found two chappals floating in the underground water tank.
 
 “Our policeman then entered the underground tank and fished out Atharva’s body. He was immediately taken to the hospital, but the doctors there declared him dead,” Avhad said.
 
 Atharva’s father works for a private company, while his mother is a housewife. 
 
 “The victim, Atharva, was the student of a local primary school,” Avhad added.
