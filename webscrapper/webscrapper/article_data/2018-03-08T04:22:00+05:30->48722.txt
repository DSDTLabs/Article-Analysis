Vadodara: Around 1,900 engineers of the Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL) and its subsidiaries on Wednesday took part in token hunger strike protest programmes at around 32 locations across the state. 

 The token strike call was given by the GEB Engineers Association (GEBEA) to press for its long-pending demands regarding revision of salaries and allowances of engineers. 
 
 “Our protest programme was successful. Now, we have given call for work to rule on March 13 followed by a ‘dharna’ protest programme at Gandhinagar on March 14 in which 1,000 engineers will join,” said B M Shah, secretary general of the association. 
 
 “On March 20, 5,000 engineers from across the state will go on mass casual leave,” he said, adding that the demands put forward by the association are also meant for all the employees of GUVNL and its subsidiaries. 
 
 “The issue of betterment of emoluments of engineers and Assured Career Progression (ACP) is being discussed since a year-and-a-half now. The association had made oral and written representations regarding this to senior officials and the government. The demand for ACP has also been agreed in principle. But there have been unexplainable delays in its implementation,” he said. 
 
 The charter of demands of GEBEA includes salary and allowances in line with the seventh pay commission. The association has also demanded that the salaries of class one and two engineers should be at par with other officials in the same class. 
 
 “We have also demanded leave encashment as the burden of existing staff is increasing while we are working with 25 % less staff,” he said.
