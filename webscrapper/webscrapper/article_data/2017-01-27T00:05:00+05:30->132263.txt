Karavali has clearly become a hotspot for Sandalwood folk to shoot their films. The region which would only witness songs being shot in its precincts, is today witnessing key scenes of films being based here as well. And close on the footsteps of two other biggies 
  and 
 , comes Suri’s 
 , which is the latest flick to be shot in the pristine Karavali coast. 
Starring Century Star Shivarajkumar and Mangaluru’s own girl  , the film crew shot in the scenic town of Malpe for three days. The Hanging Bridge at Kemmannu, Kaup and Bengre beach were also some of the locations where prominent scenes were filmed. 
 The highlight though was Shivanna hitting the temple trail with his family that included wife Geeta and daughter Niveditha after wrapping up shoot. The actor visited the Udupi Sri Krishna temple and spent much time soaking in divine bliss. Locals vouch for the actor’s simplicity and many took to social media to express their happiness and put up selfies with the star. Meanwhile, Puneeth Rajkumar paid a visit to his brother on the sets and their sibling revelry was the talk of the town.
