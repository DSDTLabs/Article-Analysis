NEW DELHI: Three days after a dhaba owner and his son were shot dead after an argument with a group of customers over switching on an air cooler in Najafgarh, Delhi Police has   three men. The accused were a part of a gang led by one Monu, who used to run a chit fund business with his mother near Dwarka. They claimed they were drunk before the incident and had shot the two men without provocation during a petty argument.

 The men have been identified as Raja Bihari, Amit Prajapati and Monu. “A team led by inspector of special staff   tracked them down. We had arrested one of the gang members earlier who was interrogated to find out about their location,” said M N Tiwari, DCP outer.
 
 During interrogation, they claimed that the 57-year-old dhaba owner and his son were shot dead after they had refused to listen to their “orders”. 
 
 The accused had fled after the incident, but one of them was caught at night. The dhaba owner died on the spot, while his son succumbed to his bullet injuries during treatment on Thursday.
 
 The incident took place around 10pm on Wednesday. The dhaba owner, Shyam Verma, ran the eatery named Sangeeta Hotel near a bus stop with his son Mayank. Around 9.30pm, five men on two motorbikes stopped at the hotel and asked Mayank to serve them dinner. When Verma asked them to wait, the men hurled abuses at him. Verma then asked his son to take their order.
 
 After some time, one of them asked Verma to keep the air cooler near them. When Verma refused saying there were other customers, one of them walked up to the cooler and kicked it.
 
 In the ensuing argument, one of them pulled out a pistol and shot Mayank in the neck and the men started walking out. Hearing the gunshots, Verma, who was at the cash counter, ran out and tried to stop them. One of the men then held him by the throat and shot him in the forehead. 
 
 Police say that they push for exemplary punishment for the accused and have moved to make a watertight case against them.
