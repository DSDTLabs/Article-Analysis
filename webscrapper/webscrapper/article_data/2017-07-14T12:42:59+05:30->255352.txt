NAGPUR: Students and principals of colleges where online Common Admission Process (CAP-I) for   is in process heaved a sigh of relief after the education department extended the deadline till 12 noon on Friday. 

 Students had made a beeline for taking admission to various junior colleges on Thursday to complete the process after they were allotted a seat in round one of CAP. Students and college authorities were a bit anxious to complete the process in the scheduled time, but are now relaxed after extension of the deadline. 
 
 Commenting on the development, Kabir Rawlekar, vice-principal of  , said, “I am happy with the decision of granting extra time since we have completed 95% admissions. The remaining students will now have time till 12pm on Friday.”
 
 Terming the government decision as good,  , principal, Hemant Jakate School, said, “We completed the admission process for maximum students till 5pm and called the rest on Friday.” 
 
 However, some college authorities said that the extension would serve the purpose only when information reached students in the nick of time. Otherwise, they stand to forfeit their seats. Anand Sahasrabuddhe, vice-principal of Mohota Science College, said, “The decision is good for students provided they knew about the extended deadline and turn up by Friday noon for admission.”
 
 KJ Cherian, principal of  , said “We had to complete 800 admission in three days. The decision to increase the time limit can be successful only when students are aware of it. Most of the students, according to Cherian, are not aware.”
 
 Academician Praveen Joshi said, “First of all, the students should have been given at least a week’s time to complete the admission process as many of them could not arrange money in three days and failed to take admission. Another problem was that some students were not given school leaving certificates by their respective institutions. Therefore, one-day extension is not sufficient to complete the formalities.”
