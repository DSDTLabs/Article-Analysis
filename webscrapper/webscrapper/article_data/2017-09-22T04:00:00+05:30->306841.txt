Surat:  ,   

 High drama was witnessed when BJP and opposition Congress in Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) over the inauguration of a rail overbridge (ROB) which connects Utkalnagar with Aswinikumar here on Thursday. The bridge was inaugurated by state minister Nanu Vanani, who is local BJP MLA. But the Congress leaders too enacted the rituals at the opposite end, much to the the amusement of people. 
 
 The Rs 36.50 crore ROB built by SMC under BRTS phase-II was to be dedicated to the people by Vanani at 10 am, which he did in the presence of BJP leaders and SMC officials. However, Congress councillor Dinesh Kachadia also inaugurated the RoB at Saraswati Circle at the same time. 
 
 Kachadia said, “How can you keep depriving people of this facility even when it is ready? The bridge was ready many days ago but BJP was not finding suitable leader to inaugurate it. We should have dedicated the bridge to people earlier.” 
 
 A BJP leader said Congress is adept at doing corruption and nothing else. People know who has built the bridge, he added. 
 
 Notably, none of the Congress members, who rode on bikes on the overbridge, had worn helmets, a brazen violation of the traffic laws.
 
 Hasmukh Desai, city Congress president, was also not impressed by this violation.
 
 "This (not wearing helmets) shouldn't have happened. Being a senior councillor of the Congress party, we expect Dinesh Kachadiya to follow the law. He and others should have worn helmets while driving two-wheelers."
