JODHPUR: Two weeks after an Indian   (IM) operative Saquib Ansari was produced in the ADJ court, another operative Waquar Azher was produced in the court on Tuesday.

 After the constant rap of the court, Azher, who was lodged in Delhi’s Rohini jail, was produced in the court amid tight security. The court has listed the matter for further proceedings on May 21 and Azher has been directed to remain present in the court for hearing the charges.
 
 Before this, the same court had read out charges against Ansari on April 19, who too had been produced in court from Delhi Tihar jail following the rap from the court.
 
 Busting an IM module, the ATS with support of Jodhpur police had arrested 10 operatives of the organization in March 2014 from different places of Rajasthan and the country.
 
 Chargesheet had been filed in the court by the ATS on September 18, 2014 and charges had been read out to eight of them early this year.
 
 “Of these 8 had already been produced in the court and charges had been read out to them. But Ansari and Azher could not be produced in the court as both of them had been lodged in Delhi jails,” said the public prosecutor Dinesh Sharma.
 
 This delay in production of Ansari and Azher has held up the trial against them in the   and expressing displeasure in this delay, the court had rapped the jail administration and the police for their failure in producing them in the court despite successive orders.
 
 Sharma said that the court has issued notice to the jail officials in order to ensure his presence also in the court, so the charges could be read out to all of them and trial of the case could begin.
 
 Now, with all the accused, having produced in the court, the trail is expected to expedite in the case.
