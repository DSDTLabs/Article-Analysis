PUNE: Concreting of roads in the city, despite a strong opposition to them, is likely to continue according to schedule. The good news is that Pune Municipal Corporation has initiated steps for groundwater augmentation with citizens' participation. 

 The meeting of activists from   ( ) with mayor   on Thursday was inconclusive on the matter of suspending the proposed concreting of roads in their area.
 
 However, on an experimental basis, only small patches at the start and the end of a few roads being concreted now can be covered with permeable material.
 
 The 90-minute meeting was attended by officials of the roads and water department of the civic body besides ABBP activists and groundwater experts. Maps of the areas, water bodies therein and reports of groundwater levels were presented to the officials. 
 
 Steps initiated in the past two years to improve the groundwater table of the area were also discussed, including recharging of borewells by channeling rainwater underground, among others.
 
 The activists made a request to the mayor to prioritize groundwater augmentation, including formation of a groundwater management cell in the civic body, creating a master plan of the city's groundwater recharge zones and inviting expressions of interest from technology solutions providers for laying more permeable roads and footpaths. 
 
 While the first demand was agreed to immediately by the mayor, she sought a detailed report from non-governmental organizations working on the issue relating to the cell.
 
 Vishram Rajhans, a member of the representing committee, said, "We are happy that a start has been made for handling the groundwater table issue. We hope meaningful action will follow in the coming days."
 
 Activist   expressed hope of the civic body establishing the first-ever groundwater management cell that will be emulated by all cities in the   across the country.
