Bambolim: Bambolim: Former deputy speaker Vishnu Surya Wagh who was admitted to Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital on Monday, is critical, doctors said. Medical superintendent, GMC, Dr S M Bandekar, without spelling out the exact medical condition of the former St Andre MLA, told TOI that Wagh was “on life support and has been kept in the ICU since his admission on Monday”. Sources said that he contracted lung infection two days ago and was rushed to the hospital on Monday. He is is suffering from aspiration pneumonia, a doctor told TOI. Since suffering a massive heart attack at a public function in August 2016, Wagh has been bedridden. At the time, he underwent an angioplasty at the GMC. Three days later he was shifted to Mumbai where he was first treated at the Hinduja hospital, Mahim, and was later shifted to Kokilaben Dhirubhai Hospital and Research Institute at Andheri due to the hospital’s better neurosurgical facilities. Wagh returned to Goa in April, after almost a seven-month hospital stay, and his wife, Aruna Wagh had told media persons that doctors at the Kokilaben hospital had given the all-clear for the MLA’s hospital discharge and that his condition had improved. Wagh has since required assistance with sitting and standing. His motor skills were not fully functional and extensive physiotherapy was required. He also needed psychological therapy and 24X7 monitoring. After arriving from Mumbai, Wagh has made just two public appearances.  For the February 2017 assembly elections, the BJP fielded his brother Ramrao Wagh against Congress’ Francis Silveira in St Andre. However, Ramrao lost the seat by a wide margin to Silveira.
