Indiranagar Club recently hosted an afternoon that the cityâ€™s   lovers will not forget in a hurry. American   Anderson .Paak & The Free Nationals were in town; the other performers for the day were Wolf Alice, Tesseract, Watsky, Prateek Kuhad, Divine, Danny Goffey,   and Mahesh Raghunandan. With so much talent on one stage, there was no doubt that the   Saturday was a complete treat to city folk.
