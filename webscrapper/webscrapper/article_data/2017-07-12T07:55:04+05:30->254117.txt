CHANDIGARH: Students and members of   (Students Organisation of Panjab University) brawled outside the Sector-32 GGDSD College on Tuesday afternoon over clicking group selfies.

 It started when police stopped   near the college library and told them to queue up for a shot of their campaigning. A group standing behind was shooting selfies, but the activists assumed the cameras were directed at them for spying. After the cops left, SOPU volunteer Harpreet Bedi demanded to check the group’s mobile phone and found the images of his fellow campaigners in the background. He objected and an argument broke out.
 
 The issue got resolved but when the mobile-phone owner was leaving the college, Harpreet’s cousin, Karan Bedi, who belongs to Sanatan Dharam College Union (SDCU), reportedly came over and slapped the boy. Police intervened and told members of the student party to leave the campus. After a long war of words outside between the two sides, the issue was resolved again.
 
 A college spokesperson said the security team had orders to let no student party in with any sort of campaigning material.
