JALANDAR: Terming the   manifesto released by Union finance minister   as a “jumla“,   (AAP) leader   said it was just a piece of paper as BJP top brass did not agree to treat the manifesto as a legally binding document.

 Phoolka, who held a press conference an hour after the release of the BJP manifesto, said Jaitley's refusal to accept the manifesto as a legally binding document showed that it was just a “poll jumla“.“Even BJP considers its manifesto a waste piece of paper. There is no sanctity of its promises, as proved by the 2014 polls,“ he said. Phoolka argued that the poll manifesto should be legally bindings for all parties and   should derecognize parties which failed to implement their promises.
 
 In its election document, the BJP has tried to woo the poor and industrialists. The party has promised to speed up the process for refund of VAT, simpler taxation, and a slew of benefits for people holding blue cards.
