While   is sinking in festive fervour on the first day of Bengali New Year, our hardworking celebs are working! On  , we spoke to five celebs who are keeping work over festivity today...

 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 I'm shooting till evening today. I believe, when you are self-employed, you pick and choose your schedule. There are times when the entire city is working but we actors are chilling at home. So, when work comes my way, I don't complain! The best part is that my family is very accommodating. I'll be home in the evening and plan to switch my phone off so I can spend quality time with my family, unperturbed. 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 I'm shooting in two shifts today and missing quality time with my family. I'm shooting for Amar Labangalata with Indranil Sengupta and Bhaswar at Lahabari in North Kolkata. I have an invitation at my sister's place to attend at night and I'm looking forward to good Bangali khabar! 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 While I'm loving the fact that I'm working, I'm missing my home-cooked food today. Poila Boishak calls for maa-er haath er ranna and my favourite Bengali dishes but I'm missing all of that today. But then again, work comes first. 
 
 
 
 
 It's a working Poila Boishak for me. I have a gig at Mecheda where I will be performing   from   for the first time. Given how much love the song has garnered already, it will be exciting to perform it on stage. I'm looking forward to it. 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 Nothing can be more auspicious and celebratory than starting work on the first day of the year. My mother, sister and niece have gone for a holiday so there's no one at home.
