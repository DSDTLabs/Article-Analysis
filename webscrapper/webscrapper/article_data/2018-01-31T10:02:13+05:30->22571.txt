SURAT: Municipal charges of   residents are all set to shoot up from the next financial year.  , the   (SMC) has proposed   besides other charges to generate an additional revenue of Rs 543 crore in the financial year 2018-19.

 Presenting the draft budget of Rs 5,378 crore for the upcoming fiscal, municipal commissioner M Thennarasan also increased user charges of water, sewerage and solid waste by nearly 95% besides levying new tax termed as environment improvement charge and name transfer fee. 
 
 These increase in charges would almost double the bill of an individual unit. For example, for a flat in Vesu up to 100 sq m, the owner paid Rs 936 as property tax, Rs 1,440 as water and sewerage charges, Rs 720 as solid waste collection charges and Rs 24 for street light till now. In all, till now he paid Rs 3,120 as municipal bill. 
 
 However, with the increased taxes and user charges, his property tax would be Rs 1,747 , water and sewerage charges would be Rs 2,808 , solid waste collection charges Rs 1,404, street light charges Rs 50, fire charges Rs 200 and environment charges Rs 100 per year. In all, he would have to pay up Rs 6,309 which is almost double than last year. 
 
 While presenting the draft budget, Thennarasan emphasized that 91% of the cityâ€™s population lives in houses much smaller than 100 sq m. While increasing the charges and tax burden on the people, an argument was made that Surat is the only city in the country that has been growing at a rate of 7-8% annually for the last decade.
