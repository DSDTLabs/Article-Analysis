PUNE: The members of the Koregaon Bhima Co-ordination   on Saturday claimed that the January 1 violence was pre-planned besides posing questions on the role of   and   in the violence at Koregaon Bhima.

 The committee, constituted following the unrest on January 1, recommended strict action against the real culprits and formation of a special investigation team (SIT) to conduct an inquiry. The committee members alleged the role of Milind   and Sambhaji Bhide instigated the violence at Koregaon Bhima.
 
 Deputy mayor  , a member of the committee, said the panel was formed by the rural police after the violence and was told to submit a report. He said a detailed report would be sent to the inspector-general of police (Kolhapur range), Vishwas Nangre-Patil, next week.
 
 “The committee comprising 10 members visited the villages around Koregaon Bhima, Vadhu and the other places from where violence was reported on January 1 in the past 10 days. The members spoke to people and gathered information about the violence. Based on it, there is a strong suspicion about the role of Ekbote and Bhide in instigating the violence,” he said.
 
 Dhende said the committee found lapses on the part of police in providing security on January 1 when they were aware of a possible law and order crisis. The committee recommended an inquiry into the failure of the local police authorities in handling the situation. It also demanded arrest of Ekbote, Bhide and the others involved in spreading unrest at the earliest.
