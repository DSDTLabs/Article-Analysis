GHAZIABAD: The   plans to carry out   in the city amounting to Rs 500 crore this year. GDA vice-chairperson Ritu Mahshwari on Monday listed prioritised work, which the development agency will carry out this year.

  said, “This year, the focus is clearly on creating transport infrastructure which will deal with the problem of commuting in the city. Apart from the elevated road and metro line, GDA will build three flyovers at the busy Rajnagar extension, Vasundhara and at Hapur chungi, which is notorious for traffic jams.” 
 
 “In a slight deviation from the earlier plan, a 640 metre 6-lane flyover will be constructed at Hapur chungi which was earlier planned to be 4-lane at a tentative cost of Rs 60 crore. A revised DPR has already been prepared for this and we aim to complete these three flyovers by December 2018,” she said.
 
 In addition to this, a sum of Rs 300 crore has been set aside under the smart city proposal for developing transport infrstaructure in the city.
 
 Maheshwari also hopes that by June 2018 commercial flights from   will commence and logistic issues such as procuring of land in Sikandarpur village close to the air base is being attended to. “Given the pace at which agencies associated with the project is working, we hope that by June 2018 we will fully develop aviation infrastructure in Sikandarpur village on a 7 acre plot,” she said. 
 
 To deal with the issue of solid waste disposal, GDA intends to construct three waste-to-energy solid waste plants at Galand, Newari and Indirapuram. “We have been facing problems in acquiring continuous stretch of land necessary for developing the solid waste plant so we have now identified three places at Newari, Galand and   where the plant will be developed,” said Maheshwari.
