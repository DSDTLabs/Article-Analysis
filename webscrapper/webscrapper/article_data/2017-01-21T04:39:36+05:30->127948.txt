MUMBAI: The   on Friday said   of   on Carmichael Road, South Mumbai, would be subject to the outcome of a PIL that has alleged illegalities. The construction has been going on for two years.

 Residents of   in Malabar Hill had last year filed a petition against RA Realty, BMC and the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) over redevelopment of the bungalow, originally owned by Maharaja Shivajirao Gaekwar.
 
 Their counsel, Janak Dwarkadas, informed a bench headed by Chief Justice Manjula Chellur that the petition raises an important question whether a building occupied by an owner can avail higher FSI under the Development Control Regulation 33/7, which was meant for redevelopment of old dilapidated, cessed and tenanted structures. He said an FSI of 3 was made available to the developers who are now constructing a 20-storey building. “According to us, the tenancies certified by Mhada are bogus,” he said. The court asked Mhada to file a reply in two weeks. 
 
  Rafique Dada and Milind Sathe, counsels for the developer, questioned the locus standi of the petitioners and their “bona fides’’ and pointing to a two year delay in moving court. They claimed that there were tenants and that section DCR 33/7 applies to cesses building even if it is owner occupied.
 
 The court said, “The petitioners have expressed an apprehension that the developer may claim equity and that is why we make it clear that whatever construction is done will be subject to final outcome.”
