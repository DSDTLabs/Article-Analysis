GURUGRAM: The Haryana government has sought a report from   for allegedly using an excess quantity of alumina   to treat water at a plant in Basai, which led to an additional cost of Rs 2 crore and posed potential health hazards, an RTI response has revealed.

 According to the RTI response, a copy of which is with TOI, a probe into the records of Huda division III had also found out that the chemical used for treating the water was sub-standard. 
 
 According to BS standards, Grade II alumina ferric should ideally be used to treat water but in this case, Grade IV/V had been used, the RTI reply said.
 
 “In 2015-16, while investigating records of Huda division III, it was observed that 1,990 metric tonnes of ISI-marked Alumina Ferric Grade IV/V was supplied to the water treatment plant in Basai. The supply of Alumina Ferric was made at the cost of Rs. 2,16,91,000….,” states the RTI response by the Principal Accountant General, Haryana.
 
 “(It was found in the investigation that the chemical) was not of Grade IV/V. The samples were used, despite that they were not approved by the HUDA laboratory and Shri Ram Institute of Industrial Research… On December 6, 2016, the laboratory test report of material was sought so that it can be figured out if the material (used in treatment of water) was sub-standard. However, the division didn’t present any test reports yet,” it adds.
 
 The government has now sought a fresh report.
 
 “The PAG, Haryana, had sought a report on the use of 1,939.15 metric tonnes of chemical at the water-treatment plant. But no reply was given by the development authority for an audit. The chemical was not only overused but was of inferior quality. It was not just unhealthy, but also led to waste of taxpayers’ money,” said Aseem Takyar, who had filed the RTI application.
