Coimbatore:  ,  , used to harvest four tonnes of curry leaves per acre from his four-acre plantation. But this year, the harvest has almost halved as the plants have wilted due to lack of water.

 “We harvest curry leaves every three months. The last harvest was in January. As almost half of the plants have wilted, we didn’t get a decent harvest this season,” said Kandasamy.
 
 P Ravi Kumar, another curry leaf farmer from Madhanur, said half of his six-acre plantation has wilted. “I had planted curry leaves plants in three acres about 10 years ago and another batch on three acres, three years ago. The latter crops have wilted,” he told TOI.
 
 Curry leaves are planted in around 2,500 acres in Karamadai block. About 25 to 30 tonnes of curry leaves were harvested every day from the plantations in the area. But this season, the harvest has come down to around 16 tonnes, local farmers said.
 
 Curry leaves from the area are supplied to markets in Tamil Nadu and also in Kerala. Due to the bad harvest this season, buyers have gone to Andhra Pradesh to get the leaves. Local farmers have started selling off the leaves from the surviving plants for as low as Rs 15 to Rs 20 per kilogram. They used to sell a kilo for Rs 40.
 
 “If we get good rain in the coming weeks, we could salvage some of the plants,” said a farmer.
 
 Meanwhile, a horticulture department official said, “As the area received a few showers this week, the prospect looks better for the coming season.”
