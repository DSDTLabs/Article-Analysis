BENGALURU: Chief minister   on Saturday asked all district in-charge   to visit their respective districts two days a month to review the severity of drought and also assess relief measures undertaken in the affected areas.

 At a meeting with the district in-charge   officers, Siddaramaiah said the prime reason for appointing these senior bureaucrats was their past experience in handling district level issues. He hoped that using their vast experience they'd be able to offer quick response in terms of providing relief measures and manage available resources during difficult times.
 
 “Accordingly, each officer must visit the districts to take stock of the ground situation on one day and on another day, visit the areas where development works are being carried out,“ he told them.
 
 The CM also asked the officers to keep an eye on the various citizen-centric government schemes. “For example, the government has allocated 7 kg of rice under the   scheme. Now, whether this rice is reaching the beneficiaries or not needs to be verified,“ he told the officers. He also warned the officers that there should be no delay in disbursing compensation to families of farmers who committee suicide.
