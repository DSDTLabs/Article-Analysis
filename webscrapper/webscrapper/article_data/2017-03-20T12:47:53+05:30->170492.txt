PANCHKULA: The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Panchkula, directed Myntra.com to pay Rs10,000 for charging extra value added tax (VAT) of Rs120 to  , a Sector-20 resident. Mahajan, in his complaint, informed the   that on 2 July last year, he had purchased a pair of shoes online from Myntra.com for Rs2,517 at 50% discount offer, but at the time of making the payment, Mahajan was not at home and his father paid for the shoes.

 Thereafter, Mahajan noticed that an amount of Rs120 was charged as extra VAT on the invoice price, and when Mahajan contacted Myntra.com officials on the toll-free number, and requested them to refund the amount of Rs120, as the   (maximum retail price) of the product was inclusive of all taxes, they refused to entertain his complaint, after which he approached the forum. Subsequently, the forum sent a notice to Myntra.com,  , and   to appear before the forum, but none of them appeared to contest the claim.
 
 The forum observed the case and informed that a similar question arose for determination before the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, UT Chandigarh, in a case titled ‘Shoppers Stop and others Versus   and Others’, where it was held that no one could charge more than the MRP, as it included all taxes, including VAT. Therefore, the forum held that the act of Myntra.com in charging VAT on a discounted product, clearly proves deficiency in service on their part, which caused immense mental and physical harassment to Mahajan.
 
 The forum directed all three companies to pay jointly or severally and refund the excess charged VAT of Rs120 to Mahajan, and also pay Rs5,000 as compensation, on account of deficiency in service and causing mental and physical harassment, besides another Rs5,000 towards cost of litigation.
