The celebration mood continued for party peeps in the city, as they thronged a popular watering hole recently. High on life, these youngsters enjoyed the night to some high-voltage music, lip-smacking food and amazing company. Most of them didnâ€™t shy away from shaking a leg and also posed for the shutterbugs.   Printed skirts, LBDs, gowns and skirts seemed to be a favourite among the page 3 crowd. Sneakers, printed shirts and denim made the men look dapper. George and Ann looked their best and had a great time with their friends. Smitz looked sexy in a low-neck black dress and Prasanth in his white shirt and denim combination looked perfect for the evening. Newly-weds Archana and Sandeep had a gala time at the party and binged on the delicious spread. Animal print never goes out of trend and Shanmathi proved it just right. Varunya also chose a printed dress and paired it with shoes.
