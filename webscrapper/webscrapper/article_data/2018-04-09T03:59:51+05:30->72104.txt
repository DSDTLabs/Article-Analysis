KOLKATA: A bomb resembling a hand grenade was found at the   railway construction site at   near   on Sunday morning. 

 While the bomb was found to be a dud, the incident triggered a panic among the workers and residentsof the area.
 
 Workers at the   railway construction site went to work around 9.45am on Sunday when they noticed a round object by a tin shade. They immediately informed the cops and a bomb-disposal squad was rushed to the spot. 
 
 The squad found a shell smeared with cloth. There was no pin or striker lever attached to it and the bomb had been soiled over time, a police officer said.
 
 "There are chances of finding foreign objects at Metro construction sites. Antisocial elements try to hide crude bombs or other illegal objects there as these are not frequented by people. We have therefore alerted workers against any unidentified objects. They will have to be more vigilant after Sunday morning's incident," a   official said.
