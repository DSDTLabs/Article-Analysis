AHMEDABAD: Suspects in the 2008 Ahmedabad serial blasts case have topped a test on the life of the apostle of peace, Mahatma Gandhi, conducted at   for the second consecutive year.

 In the absence of Safdar Nagori, the alleged mastermind of the terror strike and founder of Indian Mujahideen (IM), who used to top most of the exams in prison, including last year’s test on Gandhi, three other blasts accused have secured the top three positions in this year’s exam. The test is taken by Navjivan Trust, a publication house founded by Gandhi in Ahmedabad.
 
  
  Serial blasts accused   got the topper’s prize on Thursday, securing 77 marks out of 80. Hasan Raza was second with 69 and   followed him with 68. The third place was shared by Saiyed and an electrical engineer, Harshad Rathod. Navjivan conducted the test in three languages – Gujarati, Hindi and English. The examination based was on three books – Gandhi’s Abridged Biography, Mangal Prabhat and Gandhi Bapu. Eighty five prisoners took the test in September.
 
  
  Besides the seven blast accused, the test was taken by underworld don Fazl-ur-Rehman, who was accused of kidnapping businessman Gautam Adani. Convict in the Bijal Joshi rape case, Sajal Jain and gangster Mohammed Fighter also took for the exam.
 
 A Navjivan official said that the test was conducted in the library hall. Last year, it was held in respective barracks and the examiners suspected mass cheating by prisoners with their answersheets showing that many answers were erased with whitener.
 
 Last year, 363 prisoners took the tests, which were in three categories. Interestingly, all top three honours in one of the categories - Abridged Autobiography - were swept by the six serial blasts accused, who are inmates of the high-security ‘200 kholi’ at the jail.
