Navi Mumbai: Traffic on the Mumbai-bound carriageway of   moved at a snail’s pace through Friday as one of the three lanes was closed for   and traffic police refused to divert heavy motor vehicles (HMVs) to  . Normal traffic movement was restored around 4pm after the public works department completed repairs on joint expansion plates of the bridge.

 ACP (traffic) Nitin Pawar said, “As it was a public holiday, vehicular traffic movement was expected to be less. Hence, we did not find it necessary to divert HMVs for just five hours while repair work was on. However, sufficient personnel were deployed by the Vashi and Turbhe traffic units along the Sion-Panvel Highway. There was a slight bottleneck near the spot where the repair work was being carried out, but they handled the situation efficiently.”
 
 Earlier this week, the public works department had requested the Navi Mumbai traffic department to divert HMVs heading towards Mumbai to Airoli bridge for carrying out hassle-free repairs on one lane of the  . But traffic police said the   would have inconvenienced HMVs as they would have to travel a longer distance which would have been time consuming. 
 
 “The HMVs were not diverted from Turbhe towards Airoli bridge as it would have put burden on the Thane-Belapur Road as flyover work is in progress near Koparkharaine and Rabale,” said Vashi traffic unit in-charge, Rajesh Babshetty. “If the traffic snarl would have extended till Vashi flyover or beyond till Sanpada, then it would have been necessitated to divert HMVs from Turbhe towards Airoli bridge to reach Mumbai. Though, there was a traffic snarl for some time on Vashi Creek bridge, traffic police ensured that each vehicle crossed the bottleneck within two minutes.”
