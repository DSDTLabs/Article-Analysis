One of Ravi's friends, who was watching him play, was also injured. They were taken to the local community centre and then to Ambikapur hospital. Ravi was shifted late at night to the district hospital as his vital signs deteriorated.
 
 Getting an ambulance proved to be a torture as drivers are on strike. 
 
 There were a number of ambulances parked in the hospital, but with Sanjeevani staff on indefinite strike over hike in salary, they couldnâ€™t find anyone to drive and eventually took him to the district hospital in a taxi.
 
 On Tuesday morning, the boy was taken to   where he underwent several surgeries but died a few hours later.
 
 His friend is expected to recover.
