RAIPUR: Canadian national John Szlazak, who went missing in a   in  , triggering a desperate rescue effort in two states, walked to freedom late on Wednesday. He was reported missing on Monday after being intercepted by   sympathisers in Singamadgu village, barely 10km from where 12 CRPF men were gunned down in an ambush near Bheji on March 11.

 Sukma SP Abhishek Meena said Szlazak was freed in Arnampalli forest and security personnel are now escorting him to the district headquarters of Sukma in tribal   region. He is unharmed, said sources.
 
 Szlazak is reportedly a member of the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), USA, and began a cycle expedition from Mumbai on March 14. He reached the forest areas close to the tri-junction of Chhattisgarh-Odisha-Telangana borders earlier this week and went missing on Monday evening.
 
 Police sources said that members of Sangam — village-level supporters of the Maoists — intercepted him on March 27 when he was passing through a forested area in Singamadgu village. He was “detained” by the rebels who started questioning him why he was in the rebel-held area.
 
 Some reports said he triggered an SOS via a GPS-enabled gadget attached to his cycle, which eventually put the governments of Odisha and   on alert. The Maoist sympathisers let him go on Wednesday after verifying his identity and ensuring that he was not connected with police.
 
 Police sources said Szlazak would be interviewed to find out how he reached Bastar, why he ventured into the forested areas and the purpose of his visit.
