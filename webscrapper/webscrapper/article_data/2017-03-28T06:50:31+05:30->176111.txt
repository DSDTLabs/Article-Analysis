AHMEDABAD: When it comes to establishing an individual's free will, certificates don’t always matter. In a habeas corpus petition, a simple 'maitri karaar' proved no less strong than a marriage certificate before Gujarat high court, when a husband sought the writ to regain custody of his wife, but failed to  .

 In this case, Vadodara's  , 23, prayed for a writ of habeas corpus for his wife Chaitali claiming that she had boarded a bus from her hometown in Vadnagar for Vadodara on February 21, but had never reached her matrimonial home. He had reported to local police that his wife had gone missing.
 
 Vyas claimed that he later came to know that Chaitali had been forcibly detained by a headstrong person named   since the day she was missing. Joshi urged the high court to direct cops to free his legally wedded wife from Thakor’s control. The court asked cops to find out the truth.
 
 Police came up with statements of the woman, who refuted her husband’s claims that she was confined by Thakor against her will. She even furnished a friendship agreement (maitri karaar) that she and Thakor had entered into revealing that both of them were living together willingly. 
 
 She also said that she did not want to return to her matrimonial home and had conveyed her feelings to her husband when they had met and discussed the issue while the proceeding was pending before the high court.
 
 A bench of Justice   and Justice   dismissed Joshi’s petition with observation, “In this habeas corpus petition, we are not concerned with the legality of such ‘maitri karaar’ nor of the morality of the action of the petitioner’s wife, so also the police authorities. Our short inquiry is whether the corpus is detained by any one against her wish. Answer to this question is obvious and in the negative.”
