Nagpur: The Old High Court building, a 127-year-old structure adjacent to divisional commissioner office in Civil Lines, is set to become city’s first archaeological site of national importance. A notification issued by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) under Union ministry of culture will bring the ancient monument under the agency’s care.

 The process to declare the building as an archaeological site of national importance has been goin on since last 19 years. The structure was de-listed from the heritage list by the state government in 2015. 
 
 The ASI on May 17 had issued a notification inviting suggestions and objections regarding the proposal. Final notification is likely to be issued next month. 
 
 The G+1 floor building was constructed during the British era in 1890. The HC was shifted to the new premises in 1940 after which the ASI started operating from the building. 
 
 Though abandoned now, a major portion of the building is intact. Currently, daily wage labourers have made it their shelter. 
 
 The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) received a copy of ASI notification a few days ago, which was tabled before the heritage conservation committee for noting purpose. 
 
 After getting the archaeological status, the ASI will be able to seek funds for strengthening the building and its conservation. The ASI plans to develop the building into a museum.
 
 There are many ASI monuments in rural parts of the district and other parts of Vidarbha but there is no ASI monument within the city limit. 
 
 The double-storey structure is know for its courtyard, pointed arches, plastered surface, sloping roof with AC sheet roofing, porch on masonry arches etc. Also, there is enough open space for parking and other purposes.
