LUDHIANA: After a lot of hue and cry, the local   authorities have entrusted the responsibilty of the main   lots of the city railway   to a Jalandhar-based contractor for a period of three years. The parking lot was earlier running on the policy of “park vehicles at your own risk” offering no security to vehicles, stationed inside the city station premises.

 The decision has come as a relief for frequent visitors to the city railway station because earlier passengers had to face a lot of problems while parking their costly vehicles under no-one guidance in the station area for several hours.
 
 Meanwhile railway sources claimed that finally the contract has been given to a company after four failed tendering process. Earlier on, the tender process was ‘spoiled’ by the contractor’s lobby leaving the parking contract hanging causing financial losses to the authorities. 
 
 Station director,  , said, “From Sunday onwards passengers and visitors would not face any problem parking their vehicles at the station premises. Passengers can now travel without any hindrance through the city station with a body taking care of the parking space.”
