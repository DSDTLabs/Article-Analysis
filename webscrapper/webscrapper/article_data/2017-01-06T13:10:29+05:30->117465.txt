HYDERABAD: On the first day of the strike, Krishna G* (name changed on request) willingly joined hands with his colleagues. He stayed off work and raised his voice against the apathy of Ola and Uber managements to drivers' plight. Close to a week later, the cabbie who has been dong this job for over 10 years, is worried because his income has dropped drastically. But for the fear of facing the anger of his peers, he is staying put. 

 "I have decided not to take my cab out on the road to avoid being halted by protesting cab drivers. There have been instances where drivers were beaten up and their mobile devices snatched. If this happens to me, the loss I will incur will be far greater than the loss of pay I have had to face due to the ongoing strike," said Krishna.
 
 Krishna is now running from pillar to post to make ends meet. He is the sole earning member in his family of four. 
 
 "Those protesting had roped us in by assuring that the strike would only last for five days. That's why I had joined the protest. I hoped to get better incentives from the company in the future. Now, however, those protesting have declared an indefinite strike," he said. He began moonlighting as a chauffeur for individuals on Thursday. 
 
 The unwillingness of cab-aggregators to provide protection to drivers, who are ready to break away from the protesting group, has only multiplied Krishna's worries. "The management has simply asked drivers to go and lodge a complaint with the nearest police station in case of any issue. This is hardly the response we expected from the management of a global company," he said.
