BHOPAL: Many of us have woken up in a cold sweat in the dead of night, dreaming of a past-midnight exam, but this nightmare became all too real for students of Model Industrial Training Institute, Govindpura. Some 158 of them — including girls — had to take their semester   on Friday.

 When TOI asked a senior official about it, he snapped: “So what?”
 
 The exam (practicals) actually started at 11am. “It was an online test but there weren’t enough computers. So at a time only 20-22 of us could write our papers. That is why it took so long,” said a student.
 
 The college authorities did not find it odd that 158 students had to stay back till late at night for an exam.  , principal of  , admitted to the 1am test and told TOI: “It’s far worse in other educational institutions. Teachers were present the entire time. We have made other arrangements for Friday’s exam to avoid a repeat.”
 
 A bleary-eyed examinee said: “I have never heard of anyone conducting an exam so late at night. We had no option but to follow instructions. If we had objected, we feared we’d be marked ‘failed’.” Many   that they could not go back home because there was no transport at that ungodly hour. “We left college in the dead of the night. There was no auto, no cab. Most of us had to stay over with friends,” said a girl. Another wondered why the authorities didn’t carry forward some examinees to Friday. “Conducting exams so late at night is cruel,” she said.
 
 Some students tried to take videos of the 1am exam but were stopped by the authorities. “When I was recording the video, the management asked us to move out quickly. They did not want anyone on the outside to know what is happening,” said a student.
