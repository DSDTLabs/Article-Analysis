AURANGABAD: None of the five 100-acre sites shortlisted by the   (AMC) is suitable for establishment of a landfill as per the rules of   (CPCB), a research report says. 

 Environment researcher and civil engineer  , along with his guide  , wrote a research paper in 2016 on determination of potential landfill site for Aurangabad city, using multi-criteria evaluation. The research was published in International Journal of Civil Engineering and Technology in 2017. 
 
 “The AMC requires more than 40.5 hectares (100 acres) of land for the proposed landfill, considering the daily waste generation of the city. Five sites were identified and maps were generated in accordance with distance from the centre of city using the GIS technology. All the sites are less than 10km away from the centre of the city,” Ali said.
 
 Ali has also evaluated the five sites on the basis of 32 criteria listed by the CPCB. The assessment has 1,000 points and only the sites getting between 0 and 300 points are fit to be used as landfill. None of these sites have points below 300, Ali says.
 
 The research was done considering a daily waste dumping of 400 tonne. However, if the ongoing waste management plan of the AMC under the state government becomes a success, the quantity of waste going to the landfill will be around 80 tonne. “In that case the landfill site can be of smaller size and that will open more options for the AMC,” Ali says.
 
 Nevertheless, any site identified for landfill will have to be evaluated on the guidelines given by the ministry of environment & forests.
