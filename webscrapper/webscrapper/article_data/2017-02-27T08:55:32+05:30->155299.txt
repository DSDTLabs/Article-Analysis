 According to assistant commissioner of police (SOG) B C Solanki, the woman in question is considered sister by the other accused, Shantilal alias Bharat Thakore. “Both the accused have been handed over to the Sabarmati police for further action,” Solanki said. SOG sources said Jesingh Thakore, of Modhera in Mehsana, was unmarried and used to live with his sister in Sabarmati. “He, Rakesh, and Bharat often used to have liquor together at a liquor den in Sabarmati,” a police source said.
 
 In August 2016, Rakesh saw his wife Chhaya and Jesingh   behind a bush near Acher crematorium. “Furious, Rakesh beat up Chhaya,” said Solanki. “Chhaya then left Rakesh and went to live with her parents.” Rakesh had informed Bharat about catching his wife red-handed with Jesingh. “Both threatened Jesingh with dire consequences if he tried to meet Chhaya again,” the source said.
 
 Solanki said that on the night of August 2, 2016, Rakesh saw Jesingh at the liquor den. “Jesingh could not get any liqour because he had not settled his pending bills,” Solanki said. “Rakesh saw a dejected Jesingh going back towards the crematorium and thought that would be the right time to kill him.” SOG sources said Rakesh pulled out a knife and called Bharat to come near the crematorium. “Both then intercepted Jesingh and stabbed him repeatedly, killing him on the spot,” the source said. The next morning, when the cops were at the spot, Rakesh and Bharat went there out of curiosity. “After we received a tip-off that Jesingh had an affair with Rakesh’s wife, we put both under surveillance and nabbed them,” Solanki said.
