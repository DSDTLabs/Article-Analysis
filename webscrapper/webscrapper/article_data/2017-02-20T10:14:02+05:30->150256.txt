CHENNAI: Here’s a take on cinema hits and misses: A city resident who purchased a film   for Rs 100 for a matinee show at a city   a year ago is now richer by Rs 30,000.

 A   in Chengalpet near Chennai directed the owners of the theatre to pay the fine to V Mahalingam of Guduvanchery for failing to mention the admission fee on the ticket.
 
 Mahalingam told the district consumer disputes redressal forum, Chengalpet, that he went to watch the Tamil movie ‘Rajini Murugan’ at Vettri theatre in Chromepet on January 21, 2016.
 
 Mahalingam asked for a second class ticket and the man at the counter told him that only first class tickets were available at Rs100 each. Mahalingam noticed that the ticket only had the seat number printed on it and did not contain details of the fee.
 
 He sent a legal notice to the theatre manager on January 26, 2016, asking for compensation. Not receiving a reply, Mahalingam moved the consumer disputes redressal forum to seek reparation for unfair trade practices.
 
 Mahalingam said the state, in a GO of May 20, 2009, fixed the maximum price for a ticket in a municipality theatre at Rs 40 and the minimum at Rs 5. The   Cinemas (Regulation) Act, 1956 made it mandatory for the ticket to state the price.
 
 “The practice of the theatre in denying [a patron] a second class ticket and charging an exorbitant rate... besides not mentioning the admission fee was against consumers’ rights,” his petition said.
 
 Despite receiving a notice from the forum, the theatre sent no representation. A bench of president K Sivananthajothi and forum members K Prameela and D Babu Varadharajan said the theatre was, under the GO, obliged to mention the ticket price.
 
 “Willful omission to mention the rate in the ticket is a breach of law and an unethical business tactic,” it said, fining the theatre Rs 25,000 along with Rs 5,000 as case costs.
