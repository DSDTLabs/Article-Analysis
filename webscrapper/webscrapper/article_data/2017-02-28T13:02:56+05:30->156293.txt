Alankrita Shrivastava's 'Lipstick Under My Burkha' which has been grabbing headlines back home after the Examining and Revising Committees of the Central Board of Film Certification ( ), including Chairman  , deemed it unfit for public viewing, has bagged the Audience Award at the Glasgow Film Festival 2017. The award was presented to her by 'Doctor Who' and 'Broadchurch' star   at the Glasgow Film Theatre before the world premiere of 'Mad To Be Normal'. The film follows four Indian women seeking more from life than docile domesticity. There's a young mother who feels she must hide her professional success from her husband and an ambitious beautician who takes the lead with her Muslim boyfriend even as her family arranges a match with a Hindu boy. A college girl and an older, irrepressible aunt who sets her sights on a hunky swimming instructor.

  
  
 This is the only award presented at the Glasgow festival. Previous winners include  's Oscar-nominated 'Mustang' and Tom Browne's 'Radiator'. "Right now, when the film has been refused certification for exhibition in India because it is a women-centric film with a female point of view, I think the award could not have been more timely," pointed out Alankrita before flying off to London.
 
 Ecstatic producer   says that it deserves all the applause and awards it gets and opines the Indian censors need to look at the film in a mature manner. "For the first time a woman director has shown fantasies women have and which are constantly suppressed by the system. Ironically, it's the same system that is controlling, governing and motivating the Censor Board as well as our society. Most of those who it was screened for have never made a film but are today sitting on judgement. They don't even have the courtesy to ask a lady to sit when telling her that her film doesn't deserve a censor certificate. The same film is being feted abroad," he exults.
