VISAKHAPATNAM: China Gadili and Peda Gadili that fall under ward number 3 of the   (GVMC) have several civic issues that need immediate solution for the betterment of local residents.

 Nearly 250 households live in these areas and most of the residents are forced to live with poor sanitation, roads, and drinking water supply apart from defunct streetlights as well as dog and cattle menace.
 
 A teacher from   said drinking water hardly reaches the houses near the   due to less supply. “Summer has already set in, but the civic authorities have not taken any steps to improve water supply to these areas. The hand pumps have already dried out. The GVMC needs to improve their drinking water supply on a priority basis at least for our locality,” the teacher said.
 
 Another resident P   said water supply through tankers is also not regular. “Last year, we faced a lot of problems with water supply. This time, we expect better planning by the GVMC,” she added.
 
 K Simhachalam, a paan shop owner in the locality, said the government dug the BRTS road for laying some electrical cables a few months ago. “The cables were laid, but they did not level the road properly. Heavy vehicles going towards Simhachalam are forced to apply sudden brakes at the junctions due to the damaged road. The concerned authorities should repair it immediately,” he said.
 
 Cattle menace has also been a major cause for concern. Local resident   said, “Some people leave their cattle on the BRTS Road which leads to several mishaps. “When the cattle suddenly walks on to the middle to the road, the vehicles apply sudden brakes and drivers often lose control. Many road mishaps occur on the road due to these animals,” Rao said.
 
 A senior GVMC official said, “The issues were brought to the notice of the commissioner and inspections will be carried out soon.”
