 Four months after the demise of former LoP Satyadev Katare, it was expected that Congress would announce the name of its LoP before commencement of budget session. Therefore, the Congress Legislative Party (CLP) met at the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) office on Monday afternoon to make the choice. But there, in the presence of AICC observer Ajay Maken, it was unanimously decided to leave selection of the LoP to AICC president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi. Maken said the appointment would be made “as soon as possible” and till then, Bala Bachchan will continue as acting LoP.
