AURANGABAD: Municipal commissioner   on Wednesday asked the town planning officials to allow easy access to the department and clear the building permission files without much delay. He told the officials that the delay in clear the files and proposals that have been pending for a prolonged period may discourage others who are willing to build houses after obtaining due permission.

 Bakoria was addressing a closed door meeting with the officers of the town planning and other departments to review the process of inquiry into irregularities in   (TDR). The civic body has issued over 262 TDRs since 2007.
 
 “While taking the town planning staff to task for not clearing the files, he told them to speed up the process so that people come in big numbers to seek permissions. If not, residents may opt for illegal constructions, which will hurt the civic body as they find it difficult to locate such properties to bring them under tax net. He also urged the town planning department officials to maintain transparency in the whole process,” said civic body sources.
 
 Bakoria, while reviewing the progress in the inquiry into the  , pointed out that he has received information that most of the TDR irregularities were reported from Mitmita and   area in the outskirts of the city. He asked the inquiring officials to focus on the two areas and ensure that everything is on record.
 
 The TDR scam had come to light a few months ago, exposing the role of senior engineers in the whole affair. Following the exposure, the   had earlier suspended the town planning officials, including the assistant director of town planning D P Kulkarni for their involvement in the scam.
