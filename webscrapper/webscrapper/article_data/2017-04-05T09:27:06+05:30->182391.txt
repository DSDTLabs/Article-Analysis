BHOPAL: Hundreds of people took out a candlelight rally in   town of the Chambal region in support of their outgoing district collector Illayraja T on the second day of protests late on Monday night. The district collector was removed by the state government after the   on April 1.

 However, the protests toned down on the third day, as only a handful of residents took out a rally on Tuesday. Earlier, people formed human chain in the town to protest against the transfer of the collector. The former collector had gained popularity among the local population with his pro-active steps and availability to distressed people at any hour of the day.
 
 During his earlier visits to the district, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan too had lauded the official’s efforts. Bind district was plagued with several issues like female infanticide, illegal sand mining, celebratory firings, mass copying in exams when Illayaraja took charge as the collector in October 2015. More than 80% of the examination centres in Bhind were tagged as ‘sensitive or highly sensitive’. To curb mass copying, this 2009 batch IAS officer had initiated a unique painting campaign to create awareness among parents and students against copying. Painting competitions for students from Classes 3 to Class 12 were held and they were asked to draw their imagination on how cheating will affect their career. The paintings were then put up near the board exam centres and it clicked. Mass copying and cheating cases registered a drastic drop in the last two years.
 
 Another popular initiative of Ilayaraja was to provide free coaching to students preparing for civil services. He ensured that senior administrative officials came forward to teach the students, share their experiences and give tips.
