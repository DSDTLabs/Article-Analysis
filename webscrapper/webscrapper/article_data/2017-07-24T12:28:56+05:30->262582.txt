 Shelke said citizens have been cheated in the name of Smart City project. “Gadkari and Fadnavis are taking credit for Smart City Project. A slew of projects including cement concrete road works are underway in the name of Smart City. The works are being done in an improper manner, causing severe problems to citizens. The quality of works too is not good,” he said.
 
 Shelke added that though 14 months have passed, the NMC has failed to complete cement road work even on one side of the 550-metre stretch between LAD Square and the NMC school.
