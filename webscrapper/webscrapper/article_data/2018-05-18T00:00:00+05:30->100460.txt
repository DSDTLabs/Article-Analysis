A three-day, one-of-its-kind art and theatre festival organised in the city recently, became the talk of the town even before it began. On the first day, guests were treated to an exclusive preview of paintings and sketches made by Telangana-based artists. The art pieces included paintings and sketches by several artists including Laxman Aaley’s Systers and Song of the Village series, Twins and Messenger made by Agacharya, Priyank Aaley’s On my way back home, Couple and Nature 01 and Women and Nature 05 by Kumaraswamy B, among others.
"This art exhibition is a combination of Nizamiya and   art," shared Anand Gadapa, the curator of the paintings. Santosh Kumar, a local artist, also showcased his talent while painting live at the do. And while the guests enjoyed their drinks, Rajjika Mittra and Pooja Chadha, the organisers, looked after the arrangements. 
 While the first day of the fest was dedicated to paintings and sketches, the second day was all about two gripping plays. The first play titled Quli: Dilon Ka Shahzaada based on the love story of   and Bhagmati, directed by   awardee Mohammad Ali Baig was staged. This was followed by well-known singer and theatre artist Sharon Prabhakar’s musical That's life! based on Sharon’s life experiences. Sharon’s rendition of the songs Godspell, Evita, Cabaret and the others gave the audience goose bumps.
