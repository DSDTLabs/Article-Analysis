NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli’s Indian team, ranked No 1 in the   Test Championship, is on a roll having put together an unbeaten streak of 18 Test matches without defeat. Their next opponents in a busy season are Bangladesh, who are here for their first Test on Indian soil, to be played at Hyderabad’s Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium from Thursday. 

 And while Kohli’s team has several players capable of bossing Bangladesh in this one-off fixture, there are two in particular who assume greater significance at this venue. In two Test matches played there,   has taken 18 wickets at an average of 10.50 apiece, striking almost every 29 deliveries, while Cheteshwar Pujara has scored 363 runs at a whopping 181.50, courtesy innings of 159 and 204. 
 
 When New Zealand visited in 2012, Ashwin was all over them with 12/85 in an innings victory. In their first innings, after India made 438, he claimed 6/31 across 16.3 overs to help MS Dhoni enforce the follow-on, and six more in New Zealand’s second innings on day four consigned the tourists to an innings defeat and gave India an unassailable 1-0 lead. Ashwin’s 6/54 in 26.5 overs also made him the holder of the best match figures by an Indian in Tests versus New Zealand. He was, unsurprisingly, voted Man of the Match. 
 
 In that same Test, Pujara’s 159 was pivotal to India’s total for only two others - Virat Kohli with 58 and Dhoni with 73 - made half-centuries. He came in to bat with India 49/1 and exited at 387/6, having faced 306 deliveries in 468 minutes. 
 
 In March 2013, Dhoni’s team faced Australia and won by an innings and 135 runs to go up 2-0 in the best-of-four series. In reply to Australia’s 237, India racked up 503 out of which Pujara’s contribution was 204 off 341 balls, with 30 fours and a six. It was a monumental innings once again, and with Murali Vijay he added 370. Apart from the two centurions, the next highest score was Dhoni’s 44. 
 
 When Australia batted a second time, Ashwin claimed 5/63 in 28 overs to help spin them out for 131 and seal a big win. 
 
 The stats show that Ashwin and Pujara have enjoyed their time at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium. Ashwin’s appetite for wickets has grown plentiful since he last played there in 2013, while Pujara’s two centuries in both trips to the crease at the ground indicate how well he does there. 
 
 How these two fair against Bangladesh remains to be seen, but on the basis of their success in Hyderabad and recent run of form in the England Tests, sufficed to say that the visitors have two dangermen ready to strike.
