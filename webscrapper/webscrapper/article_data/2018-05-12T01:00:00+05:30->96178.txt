Actor  , popular for portraying Thanos in a successful Hollywood franchise, is back to surprise fans with his grizzled warrior character, Cable, in '  2'. 

 So impressive is Josh’s performance that  , who plays Deadpool, is in awe of his villain. The two actors share a great camaraderie and have been enjoying good-natured banter on social media. 
 
 Talking about Josh’s charismatic persona,   says, “Josh is basically 600 pounds of muscle in a 195-pound body. He comes with gravitas, a presence that is timeless, which is ironic, considering his character is a time traveller… Cable brings a presence to the film that is really important because when you have Deadpool, who at his core and at his heart is a 16-year-old boy, you need an adult around. And that's what Cable represents, though he is morally flexible and certainly walks a tightrope between villain and hero throughout the movie. But then, everybody that goes on to be a part of X-Force is to some degree morally flexible and anarchic in a way.”
 
 Incidentally, 20th Century Fox have already signed   and Ryan for a follow-up film even before 'Deadpool 2' hits the cinemas. Josh will return to his role as the time-travelling mutant alongside Ryan (Deadpool/Wayde Wilson) and Zazie Beetz (Domino) in the next outing. The studio is optimistic that the follow-up will be a bigger hit than 'Deadpool 2', which releases worldwide next week.
