Mumbai: Several city   said they have already recognized the need for healthier eating and tried to make changes to   available in canteens or even what students bring.

 Fr Jude Fernandes, principal, St Mary’s School, Mazgaon (SSC), said for the purpose of tiffins that students carry, they have themes for each day which all students must follow. “We have a norm in school that we follow themes for Monday to Friday. Parents are expected to send rice on day one, fruits on the second, wheat on the third, cereals on the fourth and so on,” said  . The school also has a mid-day meal programme which is monitored by teachers and only serves healthy options such as poha, khichdi or sheera.
 
 Similarly, soft drinks are a strict no-no at many canteens in schools. “Our school   doesn’t allow soft drinks and we provide Indian food like rice and dal, puri bhaji, which is fresh and healthy. Our teachers and students eat together in the classroom up to Std VIII and this helps us check what students are eating. In case parents don’t send food for the students, we provide for them,” said  , principal, St Joseph High School, Panvel.
 
 Schools also have on board diet consultants who ensure students eat right. “We have a nutritionist who chalks out a menu keeping in mind the health quotient and interests of the children. This ensures students also enjoy what they eat,” said Uday Nare, teacher, Hansraj Morarji Public School, Andheri.
 
 Schools are also speaking to students about the ills of fatty foods. Vandana Lulla of Podar International School, Santacruz, said, “We maintain very healthy food in our canteen, which includes natural fruit drinks. Students have a regular meeting and make a list of food items they should have or want in the canteen. We educate parents and students about healthy eating habits.”
