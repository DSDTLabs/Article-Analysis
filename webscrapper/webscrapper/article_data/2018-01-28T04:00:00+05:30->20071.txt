Ahmedabad: The departure of Rajendrasinh Vaghela alias Rajbha, one of the conspirators for the arson and rioting of January 23, from Satellite police station has led to three constables being suspended. An inquiry has been handed over to an ACP-level officer.

 DCP Zone VII R J Pargi suspended constables Lalsinh Harisinh, Jogendrasinh Pravinsinh and Dharmendrasinh Bhavubha, posted at Satellite police station, on January 26 after a preliminary report. The report was prepared on the basis of CCTV footage that went viral in police circles. The footage showed Jogendrasinh and Dharmendrasinh allowing Rajbha leave police custody. Police rounded up 27 persons from the sites of the rioting in Satellite but before their names were written down, Rajbha was allowed to leave. Moreover, Lalsinh stands accused of giving his phone to Vaghela while the latter was in the lock-up.
 
 “A probe is on to ascertain why was he allowed to go. The constables’ phones will also be analysed to ascertain whether they were in touch earlier,” said a senior city police official.
 
 Sources said Rajbha, who was at the site of the candlelight march by Rajput community members which descended into arson and rioting, was apprehended soon after the mob went on rampage. A group approached Rajbha, the son of a local Kshatriya leader who is influential in Sanand and areas around it, asking him to surrender in solidarity with those arrested by police. Police are yet to ascertain whether those involved are associated with the Karni Sena.
 
 Satellite police impounded 40 two-wheelers from the site of the ‘protest’. Police have started verification the ownership of unclaimed vehicles, to identify those involved in the incident.
