HYDERABAD: This  , the   Police will be marching to the tunes of an all-girl school band.

 The entire police band in Cyberabad commissionerate, after it had been split into two, had opted for Rachakonda commissionerate. The daunting case of a missing band had desperate cops in Cyberabad scouring all other police units, but they found none. Finally , they found one after Cyberabad brass cast their net wide and got a band from   in  .
 
 “All our efforts to get a band from various battalions,   and other wings proved futile as they were all preoccupied. We contacted Telangana   Residential Educational Institutions Society (TSWREIS) secretary RS Praveen Kumar and he arranged the school band," a Cyberabad police officer said. Usually, professional bands, including those from police, conduct 3 to 4 rehearsals before the D-Day . But the band of 23 girls, all about 12-15 years, got it right in their first attempt to the surprise of Cyberabad police. A grateful Cyberabad Police has decided to give these students a participation certificate. And, after the R-Day celebrations, cops plan to take them to a book store and gift each of them books worth Rs 1,500.
 
 TSWREIS regional co-ordinator AV Ranga Reddy told TOI: “Every social welfare school has a student band as part of curriculum. The students are as good as seasoned band members of the police department as they perform regularly."
