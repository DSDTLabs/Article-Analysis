LUCKNOW: Lucknow   is planning to collect, segregate and properly dispose of   generated at various religious spots throughout the year. 

 Until now, the exercise used to happen only around festivals or specific days but the new plan includes lifting and treatment of routine waste also.
 
  Initiated on instructions of the UP government, the project includes cleaning of usual places where people throw puja remains, like banks of the river, on the edge of bridges and near old trees. 
 
 At first, a committee will be constituted to look after the process. Then, a survey will be conducted to spot all religious places where waste is generated in huge quantities including temples, satsang venues and puja pandals.
 
 After the survey, the committee will make sure all waste from these places gets collected on a daily basis. According to LMC, puja items will be segregated and disposed of according to their nature.
 
 Municipal commissioner Uday Raj Singh said, "The motive is to dispose all religious waste generated in the city in a proper way without hurting the sentiments of the people. After collecting it, waste will be segregated into cloth, clay and flower residue and disposed of accordingly."
