PATNA: The   (BSTDC) is likely to resue the service of  , Patna’s lone floating restaurant, from May this year after a gap of one-and-a-half year. The 48-seater air-conditioned floating restaurant, stationed at Gandhi Ghat, had been lying unused since January last year when it developed technical snags during Prakashotsava celebrations.

 BSTDC chief engineer Om Prakash said the repair work would start by the last week of April. “Tender for the repair work has already been floated,” he added.
 
 Prakash said the tourism department has incurred losses due to the delay in resumption of vessel service. “The corporation had earlier floated the tender thrice, but no bidder turned up. This time, one bidder has expressed interest. We are hopeful of getting the repair work done by the end of May,” Prakash added.
 
 The cruise ship, launched by chief minister   in 2009, used to take residents and tourists for a cruise on the Ganga during which they could eat at its onboard restaurant.
 
 Gaurav, incharge of the floating restaurant, said, “The restaurant was a hit among Patnaites, especially the youths. Once repaired, the ship can take up to 80 passengers for a cruise. For every two hours, one has to pay Rs 100 for the journey.”
 
 The cruise ship gives a good view of Darbhanga House, Patna College, Tekari House, Gaighat, Gandhi Setu and some fort-like structures. It can also be used for viewing Ganga aarti along the banks of the river in Patna.
