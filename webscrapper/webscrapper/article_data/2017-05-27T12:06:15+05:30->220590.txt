KOLHAPUR: The recovery process of   ( )   that disburses around 55% of total crop loan has slowed down after Raju Shetti-led   has demanded complete loan waiver for farmers in the district. Bank officials, however, have expressed fear to miss the recovery target. 

 The state has been witnessing a political storm over the last four months over demands of complete loan waiver from the Opposition. Now, partner in ruling alliance, Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana has also launched massive attack against both union and state government by launching Attmaklesh Yatra.
 
 As per the official information, the KDCC has managed to recover 67% of the total Rs 1,436 crore disbursed in 2016-17 till May 19. Last year, the bank had recovered 88% of the total loan by June 2016.
 
 A KDCC official said, "Our bank registered good recovery of crop loan in previous years, but political storm over complete loan waiver has affected our recovery. We distributed crop loan Rs 1,436 crore against the target Rs 1,000 crore. But recovery has halted to 67%. Farmers in the district have slowed down their repayment expecting loan waiver announcement from the state government. As voices for complete loan waiver has increased, we fear to miss our target of loan recovery till June 1. Our bank has already been suffering after demonetisation. Therefore, the state government should make its position clear over loan waiver."
 
 Another official said, "Recently, the government has asked information regarding farm loan up Rs 1 lakh. We have asked the village level societies to provide information. Hence, farmers got a hint about government's thinking of loan waiver. This is one of many reasons delay in loan recovery."
