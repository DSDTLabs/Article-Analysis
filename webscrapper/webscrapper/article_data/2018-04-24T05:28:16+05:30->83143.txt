BEIJING: Ahead of Modi-Xi summit, China put its cards on the table and sent out a public signal about what it wants to achieve during the talks. Beijing wants “positive voices” from India in favour of its efforts to counter the challenge thrown up by US President Donald Trump’s trade actions which might trigger a trade war. “So we have a lot of shared interests, concerns, and positions,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman   said on Monday. “They will discuss the latest trends of the world so there is a stable global development. I believe you will hear positive voices,” he told newspersons.

 
 The biggest challenge facing China is Trump’s campaign to bridge the $350-billion trade deficit against the US by imposing a series of heavy duties on Chinese exports. Trump’s actions can have an unsettling effect on the Chinese economy.
 
 Beijing has tried to hit back with its own taxes but it is apparent that China has a lot more to lose because it is the bigger seller of goods.
 
 Chinese officials usually refrain from naming the US but complain about “rampant unilateralism”, which is the hallmark of Trump’s “America first” policy.
 
 Lu spoke along the same lines when he discussed the Modi-Xi summit, saying, “The world is now faced with rampant unilateralism as well as the rising protectionism in the process of globalisation. All these trends have been closely followed and debated.”
 
 “So against such backdrop, China and India have a lot to discuss. We are newly emerging markets as well as developing countries with big populations, so we believe the two countries will continue to uphold the globalisation so that it is more inclusive,” said Lu. 
 
 However, an important question is whether India would agree to latch on to the Chinese proposals for countering the US without considering the impact it might have on Indian exports, including IT business.
