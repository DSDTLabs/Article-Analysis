KOLKATA: Did you ever wonder how much you would weigh if you get to land on the moon? Or the Sun? You will soon get to know the answer when a revamped Birla   reopens on Tuesday after a 28-month overhaul shutdown. 

 The ‘Know Your Weight In the Solar System’ scale at the planetarium is expected to be a major attraction for visitors. Taking the weight of a person on the scale, a computer chip will extrapolate his or her weight on the moon, the Sun or any of the planets.
 
 Another new section will be the renovated exhibition gallery where visitors can see recreations of the lunar and martian landscape and watch videos of the Kolkata night sky in six different seasons. There will also be an astro corner where astronomical tidbits will be on sale.
 
 The main draw will, however, be the show in the   Stupa-shaped dome theatre where the cosmos will come alive like never before. The opto-mechanical projector that was capable of depicting the night sky as seen through the naked eye has been replaced by a hybrid projection system that consists of the latest version of the opto-mechanical one and nine very high-end digital   projectors especially built for the planetarium. With the advent of multi-media and TV channels that show very vivid, colourful photographs of the cosmos, the upgrade had become necessary to keep audiences interested.
 
 According to officials, the new projectors will depict the artificial sky so realistically and in vivid colour that it will be an immersive experience for the visitors.
 
 The seating arrangement inside the planetarium has been changed from a flat floor to an amphitheatre. This has brought the capacity down from 670 per show to 630, but comfort has increased and ergonomics has improved.
