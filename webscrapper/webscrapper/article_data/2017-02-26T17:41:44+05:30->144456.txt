  After   opting out Aami, the biopic of writer  , many actresses' names have been coming up including   and Parvathy. The latest in the list is actress  . 
 
  Clearing the air, Kamal tells us, "Manju Warrier is not my Aami. I do not know how such fake news comes out on these social networking sites."
