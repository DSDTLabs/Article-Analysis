Visakhapatnam: Anger of rural people and lack of exact words to define  , swipe cards and commission in Telugu vocabulary have given rise to the use of common colloquialisms among the natives. 

 When rural people refer to the act of swiping a card as ‘Gokadam’, it is a heavily loaded innuendo. 
 
 The word ‘Gokadam’, defines the act of making a dirty pass. 
 
 E Raman Prasad, a former army officer turned farmer, said, “People in rural areas find the act of swiping a card as losing privacy and therefore describe it in such a derogatory manner.”
 
 Another phrase that has now become popular is ‘Pavala Vaddi’. Originally, the term was used to refer to an interest subsidy scheme designed to financially empower women self help groups. 
 
 “There was a lot of resentment towards this scheme as this created a shift in balance of financial power towards women,” said Ch Raju, a farmer from Makkavaripalem mandal. “Today, the same term is being applied to those who indulged in charging 25% commission to exchange black money. In fact they are popularly referred to as beneficiaries of the Pavala Vaddi Scheme.” 
 
 In the rural belt of Vizianagaram district, the act of charging a commission for exchange of old notes for new is also defined as ‘Swayam Upadhi Padakam’ (self employment scheme). 
 
 Explaining the reason for use of such words, professor K Pramod Nayar of Central University of Hyderabad said, “Colloquialisms tends to sneak in when people are extremely distressed and is an indicator or expression of disgust, not just anger.” 
 
 Psychiatrist Dr C Radhakanth observed that disgust is an aversive emotion. “When people express their disgust by using dirty slangs, it reflects their aversion for what they have been forced to endure.”
