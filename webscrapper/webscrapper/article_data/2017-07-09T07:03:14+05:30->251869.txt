CHENNAI: MGR was the first Indian superstar to conquer politics, according to noted writer and politician  . “So nothing is more refreshing than chronicling the life of this actor-politician in an objective way,” he said, after releasing R Kannan’s book “MGR: A Life” at Kalaivanar Arangam on Saturday. There were compromises and setbacks but MGR made history, said Tharoor. “No one had the charisma and willpower MGR had. Actor N T   (NTR), of course, showed great talent. While NTR was known for his roles of mythical and epic characters, MGR always remained the hero of the common man. Unlike NTR, MGR died as a hero and that makes him different from others,” he said.

 In the book,   traces MGR’s life from his poverty-ridden years — he was a Class III dropout — to his rise as a matinee idol, before becoming a politician of repute. He examines the former   chief minister’s lifelong association with mentor C N Annadurai and other Dravidian cultural icons, and his tumultuous political tie-up with M Karunanidhi and J Jayalalithaa.
 
 Kannan, who has also authored “Anna: The life and times of C N Annadurai”, dissects the actor-politician’s years in power: His legendary midday meal scheme that fed 65.7 lakh schoolchildren, the subsidies that strained the exchequer, his largesse to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam as well as his unabashed sponsorship of liquor barons and private medical and engineering colleges that aided the transformation of the state, but also fuelled corruption.
