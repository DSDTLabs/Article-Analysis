PUNE: A 25-year-old   allegedly   by jumping off the fourth-floor terrace of a   in Vimannagar on Wednesday, fearing his job prospects in the IT sector amid ongoing layoffs.

 The deceased has been identified as Gopalkrishna Durgaprasad Gowda (25) of Konduru Mandal in Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh. He was staying at the hotel since Sunday and had joined a software company in Vimannagar on Monday.
 
 Before taking the plunge, he had inflicted 25 cuts on his hands and other body parts with a knife, police said, adding that a suicide note found on him stated that there is no future in the IT sector. “In IT (sector), there is no job security. I am worried a lot about my future, my friends… I am scared that I may not (be able to) look after my family properly. Please take care of my family. Sorry guys, I am worried about the future as we are not that much strong. Love you all,” Gowda stated in the suicide note. The knife that he used for inflicting injuries on himself was also recovered from the spot. 
 
 Assistant police inspector D N Jaisingkar said the suicide note also mentioned that no one was responsible for his death. “The incident took place around 1.40am. He moved to Pune on July 9 on securing a job in the Vimannagar company, which had provided him an accommodation (the hotel room) for a fortnight-long stay,” he said.
 
 Prior to this, Gowda was working in a Delhi-based company, Jaisingkar said, adding that he had also worked with a company in Hyderabad before. 
 
 Jainsingkar said a CCTV camera in a nearby balcony captured him jumping off the terrace. “With this evidence and the suicide note, we have concluded that it be a case of suicide,” he said. The body was handed over to his parents on Wednesday.
 
 Gowda belonged to a “well-to-do family farmer’s family”. His brother-in-law, Avinash, said Gowda was not in depression and there wasn’t any reason for him to worry about his finances.
