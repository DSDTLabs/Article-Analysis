Congress hasn’t figured out how to pay for it yet, but more than 360 companies have told the   administration they’re interested in working on the controversial border-wall project.

 Responses to what’s called a presolicitation notice posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website on February 24 have poured in from potential vendors around the world. Among them: Swiss cement giant LafargeHolcim Ltd; British construction company Balfour Beatty Plc; and General Dynamics Corp, a US defence contractor that makes submarines and tanks.
 
 The US Customs and Border Protection agency said it would likely put out a formal request on March 6 “for the design and build of several prototype wall structures.” That leaves the field wide open — allowing companies to suggest what the structure should look like and be made of.
 
 Those raising their hands by responding to the notice might not end up submitting tenders. But the early interest shows the enthusiasm for capitalising on President Trump’s plan to build a “great, great” wall, which he’d until recently repeatedly vowed to force   to finance. “We-’re ramping up pretty fast,” said Ralph Hicks, senior vice president of governmental affairs at San Diego-based R. E. Staite Engineering Inc, which is working on a blueprint incorporating electronic-surveillance gear that would set off alarms if it sensed people approaching or tunneling underway.
 
 Potential bidders have been asked to submit prototypes by March 10. Those that are approved will have to present full proposals by March 24, according to website. Awards are planned for mid-April.
