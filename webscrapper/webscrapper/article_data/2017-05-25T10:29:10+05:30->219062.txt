 According to police, Ghatage had left her   to visit relatives on Saturday and stayed with them for a few days. On Wednesday morning, Mangal’s relative —   and a neighbour saw that the locks of the bungalow’s door were broken. He immediately alerted Mangal who rushed to the spot. After entering the house, she found that gold and silver jewellery worth Rs 5 lakh were stolen.
 
 “We reached the spot with the dog squad and fingerprint experts. The dog squad could not give any leads, so we are checking footage recorded on CCTV cameras in the vicinity. We will soon nab the culprits,” a police officer said.
 
 The bungalow is located near a crowded area in the Rajarampuri seventh lane. “We suspect that the culprits may have kept watch on the bungalow. They may have committed the crime after finding the house locked for two days. We are gathering information from neighbours whether they noticed any gang or anyone roaming suspiciously in the area to get leads,” he said.
