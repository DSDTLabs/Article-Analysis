The natural biodiversity of the garden has been disrupted so much that crows fly at night and owls wander helplessly during the day within the garden, a phenomenon completely at odds with their natural character, they claimed.

 To stop further damage, the Indian Botanic Garden Morning Walkers’ Association ( ) has appealed to the garden authorities to corrective measures within a month. Else, the association will take legal action, said secretary Tapas Das.
 
 IBGMWA member  , an agricultural scientist, said, “Garden authorities have desilted the lakes and dumped the filthy earth around the trees. This is preventing water from seeping down to the roots. Also, they have installed several 25-feet-high lampposts. The bright light is disturbing the trees and birds alike.”
 
 ”We’ll set up a committee to assess the complaints,” said garden director MU Shariff.
