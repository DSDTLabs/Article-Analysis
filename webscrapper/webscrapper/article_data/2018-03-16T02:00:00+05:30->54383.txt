PATNA: Anukul Roy, India’s highest wicket taker in the recently concluded ICC Under-19 World Cup, has been appointed as protocol officer in Bihar State Power Holding Company Limited (BSPHCL).

 Roy, who hails from Rosera in Samastipur district, assumed his duties on Thursday in the presence of Rajiv Ranjan Sinha, general manager (administration), BSPHCL. 
 
 The cricketer expressed his gratitude to energy minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav and company’s chairman-cum-managing director Pratyaya Amrit. “I will fulfil my duties with honesty in the interest of the power company and Bihar,” he said.
