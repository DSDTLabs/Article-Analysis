 loves to spring surprises and she has done it again. The actress, best known for her cop role in TV show FIR, has announced her decision to tie the knot in a few days. 
Here’s an SMS that she sent out to her close buddies yesterday. “Hello, I have a news to share. I’m getting married to my best friend   and starting a new life as Mrs Biswas on January 27. This is an impromptu call and decision taken two days back... You can also call it divine intervention (no, I’m not preggy). Now the main catch — we are travelling close to   to a Shiv-Parvati temple and doing a simple temple wedding. There are no cards printed, no frenzy, no do’s and don’ts and no invites. I know it’s not possible to take all my family and friends up to the   in this weather, where it’s snowing and freezing and most roads closed, so just 15 of us are making this trip. I hope you understand and extend your love and blessings to us. On January 23 and 24, we will have the haldi and mehendi ceremony at home. Please walk in at your convenience... There will be food, games, shaadi ka ghar-type raunak. So do come home and be a part of this simple, sweet union. No gifts please, bring just love and more love. KkRon (sic).”
 While Kavita could not be reached, a close friend says, “Ronnit is her best friend and he has been with her through her tough times, especially after she lost her father to cancer last July. He has an event management firm. Their decision to marry has been sudden, but Kavita seems to be in a very happy space.”
