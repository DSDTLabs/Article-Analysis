PANAJI: The state government, which recently hiked the license fees for casinos, is set to stand by its decision. “There is no question of rolling back the fees,” a senior finance department official told TOI. 

 After the hike was announced, casino operators had made a representation to the state government to reconsider the same. Chief secretary Dharmendra Sharma, who is also home secretary, then sent it to the finance department, who in turn sent it to chief minister Manohar Parrikar, who is in the US undergoing treatment. 
 
 In its representation, made to the home department and the cabinet advisory committee, a three-member panel constituted by Parrikar to run the affairs of the state in his absence, casino operators said the hike varied depending on the casino type, and asked that the hike be rolled back. 
 
 Goa has six offshore and nine land-based casinos. The government, in a bid to boost its revenue, hiked casino licence fees by up to 4.5 times. The order of the finance department came into effect from April 1, and the new rates will boost the state coffers by approximately Rs 150 crore.
 
 
 
 
 The annual recurring fee for offshore casino vessels with passenger capacity of over 400 has been hiked 3.5 times, which means the new fee stands at Rs 40 crore as against the existing Rs 12 crore. The hike in the same fee for other casino vessels ranges between 2.5 and 4.5 times. For offshore casinos with passenger capacity above 200 and up to 400, the fee has been hiked to Rs 30 crore a year as against the existing Rs 11 crore, whereas for vessels with passenger capacity up to 200, it has been increased to Rs 25 crore from the earlier Rs 10 crore a year.
 
 The transfer license fee has also been hiked. For onshore casinos, this has been increased to Rs 30 crore from Rs 10 crore, while for offshore casinos, the new fee stands at Rs 50 crore, up from the present Rs 20 crore.
