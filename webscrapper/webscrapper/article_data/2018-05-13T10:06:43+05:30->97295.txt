CHENNAI: The Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) booked the subregistrar in-charge of Kodambakkam, P  , in a disproportionate assets case and other corruption charges on May 2.

 
 This was after a preliminary inquiry was conducted by the DVAC on a complaint that Ravichandran was abusing his official position and receiving bribes for registering settlement deed and sale deed documents by violating government rules. The complaint also stated that he owns a property at Golden Nagar colony, Anna Nagar, worth ?3 crore, the DVAC said.
 
 The inquiry revealed that Ravichandran in 2016 had registered a release deed, partition deed and sale deed pertaining to 1,404sqft of land, in Choolaimedu, which was classified as government poramboke land. The revenue department had communicated to his office that this was government land so as to avoid registration of the property.
 
 This was a violation of government procedure. The IG registration had issued a letter saying that when a party doesnâ€™t produce a patta, the registering officer should return the document with a check slip containing the facts. If patta is produced, then the officer should keep the document pending for ascertaining the facts, the DVAC said.
 
 Ravichandran was booked by DVAC for forgery under the IPC and corruption under the Prevention of Corruption Act.
