PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: A   a dozen scrap godowns in   on Friday afternoon. No on was reported injured in the blaze.

 “The fire began around 2.15pm and was brought under control around 8pm,” local corporator Rahul Jadhav told TOI. “The fire broke out in godowns located along Dehu Alandi BRT road in Kudalwadi, behind the Gupta weighing machine shop. The smoke from the fire could be seen from a long distance away, in Chikhali village.”
 
 Local NCP corporator Datta Sane said fires are a regular feature here. “These godowns do not have basic fire safety equipment, like fire extinguishers,” Sane pointed out. 
 
 “The internal roads in these areas are narrow, so the fire engines find it difficult to reach the site of the fire. The fire tenders have to come from Pimpri, Talawade and other areas of the city. They get here in 20-30 minutes, by which time, the fire increases in intensity and burns large quantities of scrap goods,” Sane further added. 
 
 “The fire brigade received a call at 3pm, after which fire engines rushed to the spot,” said   fire officer Kiran Gawde. “Around 8-10 fire engines worked for two hours to bring the fire under control. There were large quantities of plastic and rubber goods that were gutted. Around 10-12 godowns were affected,” he said. 
 
 “Narrow internal roads that were lined on both sides with scrap material, making it difficult for fire engines to reach the spot. Also, the godowns were completely filled with various types of scrap goods as a result the fire engines could not go inside to douse the fire,” Gawde further said.
