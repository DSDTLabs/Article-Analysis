NEW DELHI: In a meeting with chief election commissioner Achal Kumar Jyoti, Delhi Congress chief Ajay   on Thursday sought immediate disqualification of 20   for allegedly holding the “office of profit” as parliamentary secretaries.

 Maken urged EC to decide the matter as expeditiously as possible and also submitted a memorandum for it. “We have requested the EC to disqualify the MLAs for holding the  . The AAP MLAs have been continuing as legislators even though they incurred disqualification in March 2015,” he said.
 
 “The CEC has assured us that it will look into the matter,” he said.
 
 The controversy into the office of profit started soon after AAP won a majority in Delhi assembly and appointed 21 MLAs as parliamentary secretaries.
 
 “We had pointed out that the MLAs had been extended facilities and perks, at par with a minister. These people are still continuing as legislators enjoying all the facilities entitled to MLAs,” Maken said.
 
 Last year, the EC had sought the explanation of AAP MLAs concerned in the case. The MLAs pleas to drop the case against them were rejected by the EC in June 2017.
