MARGAO: Deputy collector   has recommended the names of two youngsters from   — Amar Sanvordekar and   — to the district administration for bravery awards, for rescuing at least five persons from drowning after the footbridge came crashing down on Thursday. 

 In his report submitted to the South Goa district collector on Saturday, Fernandes mentioned the heroic efforts made by the two ‘bravehearts’ even as they put their own lives at risk. “Had it not been for their timely action, the death toll would have risen,” Fernandes said.

  Speaking to TOI, on the day of the tragedy, Ghori had said, “The tide was high but I didn’t think of consequences. There were at least 50 persons on the bridge. I jumped into the water and brought at three persons to safety”.
