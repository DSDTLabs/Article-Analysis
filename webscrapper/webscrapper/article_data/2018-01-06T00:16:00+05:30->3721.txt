Kanyakumari: The district administration has asked farmers whose land is yet to be surveyed for agriculture and horticulture crops damage due to cyclone Ockhi or who are yet to apply for compensation to submit applications to the village administrative officer (VAO) or to the assistant agricultural officer to get relief for the damages.

 In a press release, district collector Sajjan Singh R Chavan said that the government is taking stock of the farmers who have suffered more than 33 per cent   and their lands are yet to be surveyed or have not submitted details pertaining to the loss suffered by them to make a representation to the said officers with the details pertaining to the losses. 
 
 They should also submit their Aadhaar number, copy of the front page of their bank passbook and mobile number along with the tax receipt for their piece of land. The collector said that the farmers who do so would be able to avail compensation for the losses and input subsidy to take up cultivation on their lands.
