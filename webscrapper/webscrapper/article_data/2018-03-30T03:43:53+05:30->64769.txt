MUMBAI: A notice placed at a   (RG) in Ghatkopar’s   informing people that the ‘garden will be sealed by the civic corporation’ has sent them in a tizzy. 

 Members of the Garodia Nagar Welfare Federation of Housing Societies received a ‘demand notice’ from the civic body for payment of property tax arrears amounting to Rs 22.73 lakh for one of the five gardens in the area that is being maintained by them. Unable to foot such a large bill, they are worried that this garden visited by hundreds of morning walkers daily could end up being sealed.
 
 “For all the five open spaces we have received a collective property tax bill of Rs 36 lakh, which includes the arrears to be paid from 2012,” said  , secretary of the federation.
 
 Sunil Joisher, a committee member, said, “Vested interests seem keen on moving us out from this park. We were the ones who ensured that this vacant land was converted into a recreational garden for the residents. We are now being expected to pay such sums, which is completely beyond our capacity.” The federation said the calculation of tax seems to be erroneous. “We are not clear on what basis the BMC has assessed and calculated the tax as well,” said the federation’s treasurer, Deepak Desai. 
 
 Devidas Kshirsagar, assistant   (assessment and collection department), failed to respond to TOI’s calls. 
 
 Another senior officer from the department, who was shown the bills given by the BMC to the federation, said it appears there has been an error in assessment. “Every property is required to pay tax even if it is an RG. In case of RGs, it is generally charged property tax that is 1% of the area’s ready reckoner rate. Only in case there is any construction on the RG, then it is charged 10%, which is not the case here. It appears they have been charged sewerage tax, which does not apply in this case,” said the officer.
