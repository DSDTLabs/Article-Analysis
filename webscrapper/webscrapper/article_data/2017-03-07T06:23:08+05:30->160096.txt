HYDERABAD: Coming down heavily on the whimsical ways of functioning by the Andhra Pradesh authorities, the   slapped a penalty of Rs 25,000 on the health department special chief secretary, Ayush commissioner and a few other errant officers for subjecting an Ayurveda teacher to mental agony by abruptly posting him to a doctor’s post.

 Ayurvedic teacher K Srihari was shocked when he received abrupt transfer orders on July 11 last year, posting him as an Ayush medical officer in Dhoolipudi of Guntur. Baffled, Srihari filed a petition in the high court challenging the transfer.
 
 His counsel, P V   told a bench of Justice Sanjay Kumar and   that the transfer was beyond normal comprehension because as a teacher, Srihari could not be transferred as an Ayurvedic doctor under the law. Even the zonal regulations and medical norms will not allow such a transfer, he said. 
 
 The bench summoned the records, examined the details and found that the authorities were acting in a partisan manner in order to help their candidate, a doctor, by posting him as a teacher in Srihari’s place. The bench said that Srihari possessed proven credentials as a teacher and was even promoted as an assistant professor in the past. While condemning the action of the officials in a stern language, the bench directed them to post Srihari as a lecturer in Dr SRS Government Ayurvedic College in   immediately.
