RANCHI: While the   government may have instilled some confidence in investors during the recently-concluded global investment summit, it now senses the need to narrow the distance with the grassroot workers of its own party. 

 Das, who did a tight-rope walk by amending the Chotanagpur and   (CNT and SPT) Acts last year and irked the tribal leaders of the state   unit, is now sending his cabinet ministers to address party workers and their grievances. 
 
 As part of the party workers’ grievance redressal drive, which was launched on Monday, ministers of the Cabinet will personally interact with party workers and address their grievances. The drive will continue till March 30 and will be attended by nine Cabinet ministers. 
 
 “Most of the workers expressed their concerns about various projects that are prevalent in their respective areas such as cleanliness, water sanitation,   and micro-irrigation. Their problems were heard and proper measures were taken through respective departments,” State minister for agriculture, animal husbandry and dairy Randhir Kumar Singh said.
 
 However, sources in the party said the new drive has been carefully timed keeping the upcoming by-election of Littipara assembly seat in   in mind. “The opposition’s campaigning against the amendment in the CNT and SPT Acts have created apprehension in the minds of the grass-root level workers. With an eye on election, it is important to appease the tribal electorate,” a senior leader said on anonymity.
