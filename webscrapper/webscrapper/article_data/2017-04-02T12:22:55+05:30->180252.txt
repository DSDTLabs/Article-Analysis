Bad light halted  's brilliant charge on the second day of the ANA Inspiration, the first Major of the season, at the   (Dinah Shore course) in Rancho Mirage, California, on Friday evening.

 Tied 51st after the first round was completed in the morning, the 19-year-old Aditi, who was an afternoon starter, was two-under through seven holes when play was suspended due to bad light. The Indian sensation, winner of two Ladies   titles last year, had moved up to the tied 25th spot.
 
 Fifty-six pros in the 107-player field were yet to complete the second round. Norwegian ace   (69) had taken the clubhouse lead with a total of seven-under 137, one shot ahead of four other players.
 
 Aditi, who shot an even-par 72 in the first round, birdied the second hole, where she holed a 10-footer, and picked up another shot on the fourth hole, where she nailed the flag with a brilliant 8-iron second shot from 130 yards to move to two-under for the tournament.
 
 After three more pars, light started deteriorating at the Dinah Shore course and the organizers had to suspend play for the day. The Bengaluru teenager will return early on Saturday morning to complete the second round. The top-70 and ties will make the money-making rounds in the $2.7 million event.
 
 "I was hitting most of the greens and had the momentum throughout,"   told TOI after the round.
