HYDERABAD: While the health authorities have given their go-ahead to shift the department of surgical gastroenterology (along with staff and equipment) of the   ( ) to the  , the move has been met with stiff opposition from a group of doctors. In a representation submitted to the Director of   (DME), to withhold the orders, the doctors have citied problems in travel as the reason for their stand.

 
 The opposition comes at a time when there are over 70 registered liver transplant patients on the wait-list.
 
 Hospital authorities say that it is increasingly becoming a problem as the department of surgical gastroenterology, for the last eight years, has been operating without a proper ward or operation theatre (OP). Currently, the gastroenterology department shares the ward and OP with the general surgery department and surgeries are done only two days a week. As a result, several poor patients seeking surgical intervention for liver, pancreatic and other gastrointestinal cancers (and liver transplants), are left the lurch.
 
 “Also with the number of general surgery PGs increasing from 25 to 55, share facilities is becoming a problem,” said a doctor.
 
 When contacted, head of department for surgical gastroenterology, Dr Madhu Sudan said, “We have tried to find several alternative places on campus, but because they are old structures renovating them isn’t possible. Two years ago, we tried to shift the department to the   but it was shelved because the hospital does not have the required infrastructure to provide support in case patients, during complex gastro-surgeries suffer a cardiac arrest or kidney failure,” adding, “there are so many poor patients waiting for treatment but we are unable to help them under these conditions.”
