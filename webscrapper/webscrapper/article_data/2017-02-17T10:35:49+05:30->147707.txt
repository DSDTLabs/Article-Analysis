BHAGALPUR: In order to meet the   (MCI) norms for increasing the number seats for admission in first year   from 100 to 250 at the local   (JLNMC), the health department is making endeavours to convert the college into a centre of excellence for education and health services in the state.

 The department is working on a plan to improve the doctor-patient ratio by increasing the number of seats in medical colleges. Sources in the college said efforts are on to establish a 1,500 bed modern hospital at Barari with adequate infrastructure, round the clock medical services and dedicated paramedical staff to serve the patients.
 
 The health department recently held a meeting with JLNMC administration to discuss ways to increase the number of seats in first year MBBS. Sources said the health department is busy preparing a developmental roadmap so that health services and medical education system can be improved in the region. The city-based medical college and hospital would be made a model centre both for education and health services.
 
 According to sources, focus is on developing state-of-the-art neurology, nephrology and cardiology departments besides other conventional departments like medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology, ENT and orthopaedics. The steps would ease patients’ load on Patna Medical College Hospital, Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna and other Patna-based government hospitals.
 
 JLNMC superintendent Dr   said, “We require a well-equipped 2,000 bed hospital and 250 seats in first year MBBS course. We have already selected the vacant land of   and a proposal for 1,500 bed modern hospital with super-specialty units has already been sent to the state headquarter.” As of now, the hospital can accommodate 600 patients and 100 medical students.
