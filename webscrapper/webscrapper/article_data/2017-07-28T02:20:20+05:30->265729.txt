NAVI MUMBAI: Nearly 12 hours after the bodies of two youths with their heads smashed in with a   were found under   on Thane-Belapur Road, Sanpada police claim to have cracked the case with the   of a 38-year-old man.

 During interrogation, Prabhakar Dhotre, whose jobs involves guiding trucks to their destinations in the Turbhe MIDC area, told police that the two youths would harass him for money and forcibly take cash from him to buy alcohol and drugs. “Dhotre had a lot of resentment towards them. In fact, on Tuesday too, Sandeep Gaikwad (22) and Sameer Aslam Shaikh (20) had forcibly taken Rs 260 from him,” said senior inspector Suresh Padvi. Gaikwad and Shaikh, who were residents of Anand Nagar and Hanuman Nagar respectively, would do odd jobs. 
 
 On Wednesday, around 2am, when Dhotre was sleeping under the flyover, the duo reached there in a drunken state and woke him up to join them smoke a banned substance. Police claimed Dhotre lost his cool and picked up a heavy stone and smashed their heads in. “As the youths were already drunk, they would not have resisted when he hit them with the stone,” said an officer. “On Wednesday morning, when police enquired with victims’ friends, many said the duo was often seen with Dhotre. We arrested him by night.”
