 In the teaser that was released yesterday (February 5), quite candidly, Varun Dhawan tells Karan when he loves someone or feels affectionate, he does strange things. He also gets up and sits on Alia's lap as an illustration. 
 
 
 
 
  
 When Varun is asked what is the one thing that Sidharth has and he doesn't, he quite gives away Alia and Sidharth's relationship status by looking at the actress seated right beside him. 
 
 
  
  
 
 Varun's act of picking the pillow when Alia calls him a shy boy is hilarious. The roller-coaster ride doesn't end there. When KJo asks Alia name of three citrus fruits, she says orange and 'santra' separately, causing the host to break out into laughter. Also, in a very retro way, Varun reveals that a girl should wear a bra, panty and a tee shirt to bed. 
  
 From singing to dancing, Varun Dhawan looks all set to entertain the fans of the show with his antics. Alia Bhatt only adds to the fun. Both of them have earlier appeared on the show, but separately.
