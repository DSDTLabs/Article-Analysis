LUCKNOW: Over 60% of   taking place in UP go unaudited in contrast to union health's ministry's order for getting all such deaths examined. 

 Data from the state   revealed that 16,000 maternal deaths take place in UP every year. The network of ASHA workers is expected to intimate the health authorities about these deaths. But information of about 28% (or 4,500 cases) is received by the health department. 
 
 Acting against the gap, the state health department has decided to engage the community for the job. For this, a scheme to pay an incentive of Rs 1,000 to anyone who informs the health department of a maternal death in his neighbourhood, has been proposed. A toll free helpline number has been put in place to coordinate for the scheme. 
 
 "The Union and state governments have pledged to bring down maternal mortality to below 100 per one lakh live births by 2020. UP has a major role to play in it. As for now, UP's maternal mortality rate is 258 per lakh live birth and the target is to bring it down to below 200 by end of March 2018," said Alok Kumar, mission director, National Health Mission, UP. 
 
 Health experts pointed that community's role in maternal death audit can help in understanding hyper-local trends behind. "Strategies may be made for districts and blocks if the scheme takes off well," said Dr  , women and child health activist.
