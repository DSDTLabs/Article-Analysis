PANAJI: The Goa state museum is gearing up to move to the   palace premises. They have already started packing the sculptures which will be the first to exit the premises to a provisional home at the centuries-old palace.

 “We have already given permission to shift the museum to the Adil Shah premises until their new building is up. This shift will be on a temporary basis only,” said minister for art and culture,  . The palace falls under the guardianship of the department of art and culture.
 
 Sources at the museum said that while they will be packing the 10,000 odd artefacts, the   ltd (GSIDC) will be in charge of shifting the artefacts. Museum officials will, however, supervise the shifting process. “We have prepared the list of artefacts. The stone sculptures will be moved first, so we have started packing them already. Bigger objects will be covered in jute cloth, while smaller ones will be bubble wrapped,” a museum official said.
 
 Prior to this, many artefacts were housed at the old archives department in   which were then moved to the museum in   in 1999. Over the years, this building has started to crumble and faces issues of water seepage and roof leaks every monsoon. Thus jeopardizing the centuries-old artefacts, some of which date back to the pre-Portuguese era.
 
 Museum officials, earlier, had their eyes on the Old GMC building in Panaji, but the entertainment society of Goa (ESG) could not handover the premises owing to the annually-held Iffi celebrations.
 
 At the palace, the museum’s artefacts will be accommodated on the ground floor. The office of the department of archives, some records from the department of records and the smart city office will be shifted on the first floor of the palace.
