LUCKNOW: Artist Zulfikar  , who is busy making a 110-feet-long cutout for Prime Minister  's birthday on September 17, wants the   government to be in power for 110 years.

 The 50-year-old Hussain is not in fact based in India. He has flown to his hometown in Uttar Pradesh all the way from from Dubai just for the special occasion of the PM’s birthday, on the request of his dear friend  , a former BJP councilor.
 
 
 
 
 Hussain hopes the PM’s cut-out will be ready to be placed in front of the BJP office in Lucknow on the day of the PM’s birthday. Apart from the cut-out, the duo will be presenting a 1,500-kg laddoo and a 105-kg bell to the PM.
 
 "This is a dream-come-true for me. I want to personally gift it to the PM," said Hussain. "Like the cut-out, I want his government to be in the helm for 110 years," he added.
 
 Hussain also wants to present UP chief minister Adityanath with a similar cut-out.
 
 "I am an artist. I am not influenced by any ideology. Neither do I want people to associate my religion with this," said Hussain.
 
 Hussain had made cut-outs for BSP leaders Kansiram,  , and SP leader Mulayam Singh Yadav in the past, before he moved to Dubai, where he works as an oil painting artist.
 
 This will be Hussain’s first work for Modi, but he debuted his work long ago. He credits his friend Pandey for this.
 
 "Our friendship dates back to 1985, when I used to paint posters for movies. In 1998, Nripendra (Pandey) asked me to make a 100-foot cut-out of then Prime Minister  ," he said.
 
 Pandey said he and Hussain have been friends for 30 years.
 
 "In those days, he was famous as Raju artist. I liked his posters on Mayfair, Leela, Novelty theatres. We are friends for 30 years. This time, I insisted him that he has to come India as nobody else would be able to do it," said Pandey.
