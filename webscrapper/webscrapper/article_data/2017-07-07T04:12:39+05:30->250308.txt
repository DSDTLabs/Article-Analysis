GURUGRAM:   will revamp the junction on   (SPR) near   to provide relief to residents of the city’s new sectors along SPR who have to negotiate the accident-prone spot daily.

 The divider on the SPR at the junction, near St Xavier’s School, is not aligned with the road coming from Sector 49/50 and  , causing traffic jams and accidents. 
 
 Due to the jutting extension of the divider on SPR, people coming from Sector 65/66 have to take an extended U-turn to go to Golf Course Road, often leading to head-on collisions, because of which residents have been demanding the junction be redesigned. 
 
 TOI had highlighted the problem in March.
 
 “The estimate for improving the junction has been approved. We’re inviting tenders. Work is likely to start by month-end,” said Huda administrator Yashpal Yadav, adding the project will reduce jams and ensure smooth flow of traffic at the junction. It will cost around Rs 31 lakh.
 
 Several residential and commercial projects are coming up along SPR. Thousands of people have already moved into these new sectors, resulting in sharp rise in traffic volumes. 
 
 “The junction has emerged as an accident spot due to faulty design,” said Sachin Sharma, resident of Sector 50.
 
 Residents of the area had another long-standing grouse — the presence of high-tension towers on a sector road of Sector 65/66. It was resolved when the high-tension towers were shifted in April.
 
 Sector 66 resident Prabhat Mishra said shifting of the high-tension line has ensured smooth traffic flow, and that they are hoping the authority will complete the new work at the earliest. “With rise in traffic in the area, the junction is permanently choked. The promised work will help ease traffic congestions,” said Mishra.
 
 Along with improvement at the junction, Huda is also building master roads of the area to improve connectivity of the sectors. “We are making all efforts to improve the infrastructure and connectivity of new sectors,” said Yadav.
