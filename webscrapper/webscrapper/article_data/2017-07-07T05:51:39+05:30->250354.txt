THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The World Bank mission scheduled to arrive here on July 31 to evaluate the   (KSTP) would be crucial.

 The visit by mission assumes significance as World Bank had warned the state in February that it would cancel the remaining loan amount due to huge project milestone delays by KSTP. The bank took a lenient view after   appointed Ajit Patil as project director. However, according to sources no more leniency could be expected from World Bank. Any cancellation would negatively impact the state's ability to attract cheaper international finance.
 
 It is worth noting that in 2015, Japan   had stopped funding of JICA-assisted water supply project following inordinate delays in executing the work. But economists are divided on impact of loan cancellation on the state. Former planning board member G Vijayaraghavan said cancel lation of loan might affect state's prospects of taking other loans. “If there is a cancellation, the lending agency will give us a poor rating.Obviously , all international agencies will check how the state performed on other projects and this rating will give a bad signal,“ he said.
 
 However, planning board member K Raviraman said that a lot of lending agencies are ready to provide loans for devel oping nations. “Of course, it is not advisable to continue with bad governance that derails such works,“ he said. Ravira man said that with options such as   ment Fund Board which mobi lises internal resources, it is not difficult to get loans.
 
 However, Vijayaraghavan said that loans provided by international lending agencies as development funds comes at cheap rates.“Interest rates of   will be high,“ he said.
 
 Sources in World Bank said government of India will prefer other states over Kerala for WB-funded projects as the state is a poor performer.
