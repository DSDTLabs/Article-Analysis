You can’t help but be bowled over by   Bachchan’s beauty – the actress had that effect on the audience in her last release ‘Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’ and now, she has done it again. The actress has turned cover girl for the February issue of Femina and the result is spectacular! While we had caught a glimpse of her adorning the cover earlier, now the inside pictures of the photo shoot are out.

 One of the pictures has Aishwarya looking stunning in a voluminous black gown. The smokey eye make-up and tousled waves add the right dollop of drama to the look. Ash looks breathtakingly beautiful in another picture, where she is dressed in a red gown, replete with a fur coat. The issue is dedicated to ‘India’s Most Beautiful Women’ and who better than the most beautiful woman in the world to adorn the pages of the magazine? We can’t help but drool over Ash in these pictures. Something tells us she will have the same effect on you too.
