Filmmaker   says the film 'Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak' was supposed to initially have a happy ending but looking at the drift of the film, he gave it a sad climax.

 Directed by Mansoor, written and produced by his father  , the film released in 1988. It was a blockbuster which catapulted   and   to stardom. The plot was a modern-day take on classic tragic romance stories such as  , Heer Ranjha and Romeo and Juliet.
 
 "Although my father had initially planned to end the movie on a sad note, he seemed skeptical about the climax and asked us to shoot another ending. However, the flow of the movie gave a feeling that there might be some tragedy soon. Hence, I opted to close the movie the way Romeo and Juliet ended," Mansoor said in a statement.
 
 The film will be aired on a channel to commemorate its 30th year of release on Sunday.
