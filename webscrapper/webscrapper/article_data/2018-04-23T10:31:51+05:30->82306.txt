MAPUSA: Following alerts from the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Service (INCOIS), the water levels along Goa’s north coastline from Morjim to Keri saw a sudden rise on Sunday afternoon. 

 The shacks at Keri are located very close to the hightide line, and placed near the confluence of the   and River Tiracol. This makes the shacks at Keri more vulnerable to damage. 
 
 INCOIS had issued an alert cautioning coastal states of high energy swell waves on April 21 and 22. 
 
 Drishti Lifeguard Services had also cautioned beach goers and tourists to avoid venturing into the sea on April 21 and 22. The India meteorological department (IMD),  , had asked fishermen not to venture out to sea over the two days, and watersports activity was asked to be suspended for safety reasons.
 
 Shack owners from Keri said they saw the sea getting rough at around 3pm and suddenly high waves started to hit the coast, with water entering six shacks. 
 
 “Customers, especially foreigners, were eating at the shacks at the time when the water level suddenly rose and the rough waves hit the sand bags which serve as protection,” said Samir Harij, a shack owner from Keri.
 
 Shack owners said that most of them removed their beach beds, tables and chairs, minimizing the damage and loss. Damage to beach beds was reported at Keri. “We managed to move the tables and beach beds to safety. There was no major damage but business was affected for the day,” said Amar Talkar, a shack owner from Keri.
 
 Sources said water levels also above normal at Arambol, Mandrem and Morjim as well. Here too, shack owners shifted their beach beds to safety in time. The water did not cause any major damage along these beaches.
