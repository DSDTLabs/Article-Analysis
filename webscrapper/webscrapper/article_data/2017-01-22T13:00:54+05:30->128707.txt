PATNA:   (BPCC) president   on Saturday condemned RSS spokesperson Manmohan Vaidya’s call for review of caste-based reservation policy, and said Congress would oppose any move to do away with the   to SCs, STs and OBCs. 

 Speaking at the Jaipur Literature Festival on Friday, Vaidya said even Dr B R Ambedkar, architect of the Constitution, was not in favour of perpetual continuance of reservation and, as such, the reservation policy should be reviewed.
 
 “Vaidya’s statement has exposed the ‘anti-dalit and anti-backward’ mindset of the RSS and its political outfit BJP,” said Choudhary, who is also the education and information technology minister.
 
 The BPCC chief further said quota for SCs, STs and OBCs in jobs has been provided by the Constitution since its adoption, but anti-dalit forces like the RSS and BJP were now looking for an alibi to end the quota system after their so-called review.
 
 He said the country’s common man understands the “hidden agenda” of the RSS behind Vaidya’s statement and people would teach a lesson to the saffron party in the ongoing assembly elections in different states, including Uttar Pradesh.
 
 Choudhary said it was not for the first time that such a statement seeking review of the reservation policy was made by a BJP or RSS functionary. “Prior to the Bihar assembly polls in 2015, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat also raised a similar demand. Bhagwat then suggested the formation of a non-constitutional body for review of the reservation policy. But people of Bihar rejected Bhagwat’s demand by voting against the RSS’s political outfit,” the Congress functionary recalled.
