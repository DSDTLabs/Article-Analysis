Tirunelveli: An analysis of the study conducted by college students on pollution in the Thamirabarani river on March 10 that was compiled by the Anna University Regional Centre threw up some interesting facts. Dean of the centre G Sakthinathan said an analysis of the data collected from 26 of the 68 places where the survey was conducted showed that only 69.3% of the respondents knew the river is getting polluted. Plastic was the common waste that 42.4% of the respondents said was dumped in the river. It was followed by other rubbish (39.7 per cent), human fecal matter (27.9%) and paper waste (24.6%). Some people intentionally or unintentionally polluted the river in more than one way. Despite living on the banks of the river, 18.7% did not know that Thamirabarani was the source of drinking water for Tirunelveli and Tuticorin districts. Thanks to the recent India vs South Africa cricket series, it helped 34.8% of the respondents know about zero day and water scarcity in Cape Town, South Africa. As many as 59.9% of the respondents admitted that they are aware that most diseases are spread due to water pollution. Around 63.5% of the respondents claimed that they had reported pollution of the river to officials concerned. Interestingly 58.6% evinced an interest in taking part in cleanliness drives and initiatives to maintain the river clean.
