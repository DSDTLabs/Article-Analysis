CHENNAI: With NEET for   just 10 days away, the   has directed CBSE to permit 38   to write the examination after   from them. 

 The students could not complete necessary formalities by April 5, which was the last date for online registration of candidates, because of technical glitches over such as non-receipt of one-time password or payment-related difficulties owing to poor internet connection. The last date ended on March 1.
 
 Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana, while lauding the CBSE’s online registration system, said, “Better connectivity has to be addressed or provisions ought to have been made for an alternate method for the situation like the present cases.
 
  Admittedly, a group of students had gone to the same internet centre to make their application form online. Though they were successful till the stage of applying and getting it registered, they were unsuccessful in completing the procedure by paying the required fees. These candidates are from different pockets of the districts in Tamil Nadu. 
 
 The low internet speed and power outage are the perennial problems faced even in the metropolitan cities. No malafides can be imputed to these candidates who could not remit the fees online in the absence of any alternate mode.”
 
 Pointing that the court had on April 20 issued similar direction to the CBSE to consider their request to receive the payment for NEET-UG-2017 examination fees in any other manner suitable to it, said: “CBSE is directed to accept the fees from the petitioners with respect to their application forms as registered online through RTGS on or before May 2. On receipt of the fees, the CBSE is directed to generate the hall ticket and issue the same to them to enable them to sit for the NEET exams”, she said.
