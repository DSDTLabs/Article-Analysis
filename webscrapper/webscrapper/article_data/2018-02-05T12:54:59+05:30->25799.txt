PATNA: Sleuths of   Investigation Bureau recently grilled retired IAS official K P Ramaiah in connection with alleged embezzlement of Rs 5.01 crore in the training programme funds of   (BMVM) under the state SC/ST welfare department. Vigilance sources said Ramaiah was asked more than 50 questions from a questionnaire prepared on the basis of investigation conducted till now.

 The mahadalit youths were to be trained in MS Office, Tally, spoken English and other courses under Dashrath Manjhi Skill Development Scheme run by BMVM. The funds were allegedly embezzled between 2010 and 2016. The BMVM was formed in 2010.
 
 The vigilance department had lodged an FIR against Ramaiah, retired IAS official Ramashish Paswan, S M Raju, Parmar Ravimanu Bhai and six others on October 23 last year. 
 
 A senior vigilance official said Ramaiah was grilled for at least three hours. Despite Ramaiah’s name figuring in the scam, he is still a member of   Land Tribunal. Ramaiah’s counsel had tried to seek anticipatory bail from Patna high court on Friday, arguing that his client was unable to attend tribunal proceedings due to vigilance case against him.
 
 Sources said Ramaiah had disbursed Rs 2.24 crore to   (IIIM) Limited on February 26, 2014, just two days before taking voluntary retirement from service. “Payment to IIIM was made against study material for 15,200 candidates, while only 9,120 were enrolled,” sources said, adding names of same candidates were shown multiple times in enrolment register.
