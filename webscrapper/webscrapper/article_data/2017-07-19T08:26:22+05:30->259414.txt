CHENNAI: Newly-appointed India bowling coach   is all set to join the team for the upcoming Sri Lanka series starting July 26. 

 "It feels great to be back in the Indian scheme of things and work again with the likes of (Ravi) Shastri, (Sanjay) Bangar and (R) Sridhar. I'm looking forward to the Lanka series," Arun told TOI.
 
 Arun's journey with Shastri at the helm began after India lost the Test series to England in 2014. It was followed by a marathon trip Down Under in 2014-2015 including the World Cup where India made the semifinals. The Sri Lanka series in 2015,  's first as full-fledged captain, saw a turnaround in fortunes for the coaching duo of Shastri and Arun as India won 2-1 and then went on to blank South Africa 3-0 at home.
 
 After his exit as the bowling coach in 2016 following the completion of the World T20, Arun joined Hyderabad as the chief coach during the 2016-2017 Ranji Trophy season. He played a pivotal part in guiding an inexperienced side into the knock-outs.
 
 "I really enjoyed my stint working with a young bunch in Hyderabad. However, it's a dream for everyone to be part of the Indian team. Having got back into the side now, it's an even bigger challenge for me to be a good value addition to the team," said Arun.
 
 Even as results didn't go in favour of India during Arun's early stages as bowling coach in 2014, there was a long-term plan in place for every bowler.
 
 The current bowling attack comprising R Ashwin,  ,  ,  ,   and Mohammad Shami share a great camaraderie with Arun and they have at various junctures mentioned the impact Arun has had on their bowling.
 
 Although Arun, who was also the bowling coach of IPL outfit Royal Challengers Bangalore, was out of the team for the past year, he did state that he had this "odd talk" here and there with the players.
