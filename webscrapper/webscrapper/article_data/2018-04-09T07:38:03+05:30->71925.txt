CHANDIGARH: Rohtak MP and chief whip of   parliamentaryparty   on Sunday accused chief minister   and BJP government of having pushed Haryana behind by two decades due to divisive politics.

 Deepinder, who was addressing a workers’ rally at Safidon to invite party workers for former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda’s   from Panipat next month, asked the BJP to count its achievements in the state as well as in the country. He batted for his father while saying that people remember the Congress rule of 10 years before BJP took over in Haryana.
 
 Attacking the government on the HSSC scam, Deepender said jobs in Haryana had dried up during the term of the BJP government and when the government does bring out some vacancies, the jobs get lost in corruption. The rot within the BJP government had been exposed and people had lost all hope. “They announced to bring back black money stashed abroad and promised that every person would be given Rs 15 lakh in their accounts. They promised that two crore jobs would be created every year for the youth and a unemployment allowance of Rs 9,000 would be given to the unemployed. Besides, there have been massive job losses,” he said.
 
 “Thoughtless and directionless policies of the BJP government at the Centre and the state have brought down Haryana from number one position to zero. We took the state forward through our ideas, policies and hard work. This government has pushed back the state to where it was two decades ago,” he said. The MP called on the people of the state to come together to join former chief minister Hooda in bringing back development, growth and jobs to the people of the state..
