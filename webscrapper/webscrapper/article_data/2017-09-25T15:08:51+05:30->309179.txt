VARANASI: Banaras Hindu University   has alleged that the ruckus in the campus, which began on Thursday following allegations of eve-teasing by some girl students, was pre-planned and engineered by outsiders.

 "I take responsibility of untoward incidents on the campus. It was the failure of the university administration. Except 150-200 students, of which 15,000 live in hostels on the campus, outsiders indulged in violence. Had there been support of hostel inmates, it could not have been controlled," he told TOI on Sunday.
 
 The administration has CCTV footage of the stir at the  , he said. "In the footage, it can be clearly seen that many girls are from Allahabad and associated with a particular student organisation. Some girl students are from Delhi University," Tripathi said.
 
 The timing, too, suggests that it was a pre-planned conspiracy, Tripathi said. "The protestors demanded talks with me at the main gate before   was to pass. Had I visited there at that time, the protesters could have created unruly scene. The protestors became further active after the change in route of the PM's cavalcade," he said.
 
 Tripathi claimed that the girls, who had to face eve-teasing, had met him in his office and they returned to their hostels following the university administration's assurance of providing security.
 
 Tripathi said he wasn't motivated by any particular political ideology. "During my two-and-half-year tenure in BHU, there have been several baseless allegations against me, such as imposing ban on non-vegetarian food, enforcing dress code for girls, changing timing of entry in hostels for girls and trying to impose  . Now some people are trying to accuse me of committing recruitment scam," he said.
