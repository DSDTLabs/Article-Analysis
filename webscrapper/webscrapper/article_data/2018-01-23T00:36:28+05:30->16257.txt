MUMBAI: The Bombay high   has allowed the scion of a UAE-based business family to cite a divorce   granted by a Dubai court in a matrimonial dispute initiated by his wife at the Bandra family court. Justice Girish Kulkarni quashed the   order that had restrained the man from raising the foreign court order in the divorce proceedings. The high court further allowed the man to withdraw his consent for a divorce by mutual consent.

 “Technicalities should not defeat the cause of justice,” said the judge. The couple, both Hindus, had married in 1999 under the Special Marriage Act. They have two children, a 17-year-old daughter and 14-year-old son. In 2012, the woman returned to India, alleging harassment. She lodged divorce proceedings in the family court, seeking Rs 5 crore as permanent alimony and a flat.
 
 Last year, the man sought to make changes to his written statement before the family court. He claimed that he wanted to incorporate the fact that in August 2013, a Dubai court had granted him divorce from his wife and given him custody of the couple’s two children. The woman's advocate had opposed the plea, claiming there was a delay in making the claims and the only purpose was to defeat the wife’s claims for maintenance and alimony. 
 
 The high court pointed out that the plea about the Dubai court order had been raised in another application before the family court. 
 
 The court said that there were some lapses on the part of the man as he was not prompt in filing the plea to cite the Dubai court verdict. The judge said his plea would be allowed on the condition that he would pay Rs 50,000 as legal costs to his estranged wife within two weeks. “Needless to observe that all contentions of the woman on facts and law in regard to the legality and validity of the decree of divorce of the Dubai Court and to defend all the issues as being urged by the man are expressly kept open to be urged before the family court,” the high court said.
