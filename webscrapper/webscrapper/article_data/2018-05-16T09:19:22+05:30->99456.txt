MUMBAI: Allegedly reprimanded by his mother for excessive use of cellphones and social media, a 15-year-old leapt off the 14th floor of a Kandivli East highrise early on Tuesday. He left behind a suicide note on Instagram Stories apologising to everyone. 

 The boy was good at his studies and had cleared his Class IX exams in the IGCSE stream of a Kandivli school. 
 
 As his parents travel extensively for their travel and tourism business, the boy and his older sister spent most of their time with their grandfather who lived in the highrise. 
 
 Around 5.30am on Tuesday, a 10th floor resident of the highrise was cooking when she saw the teenager seated on the ledge of the refuge area on the 14th floor of the opposite wing. "I immediately called up a security guard," she told TOI. Ten minutes later, she called up the guard again. The guard told her that he had informed his supervisor and the latter was on his way up. The teen is believed to have plunged to his death just as the supervisor reached the 14th floor.
