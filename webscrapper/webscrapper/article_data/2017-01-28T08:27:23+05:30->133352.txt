HYDERABAD: In a big blow to hookah bar owners in the city,   on Friday ruled there was no law that permits running of exclusive   in the city.

 The judge gave this directive while dismissing a batch of petitions filed by owners of hookah cafés in Hyderabad, who charged police with  .
 
 Section 4 of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003 (COTPA), 2003, permits restaurants and coffee shops to serve hookah if they have a seating capacity of 30 or more and separate smoking enclosures.
 
 The petitioners had challenged police interference in their businesses and the closing down of cafes and restaurants.
 
 Telangana home department counsel H Venugopal told court that under the garb of licences obtained to run restaurants, the owners are converting them into hookah centres and even allowing the place to be used for unauthorized activity.The counsel appearing for petitioners contended that police have no power to interfere in their business and GHMC authorities alone can inspect premises. The judge agreed with the contentions raised by the home counsel and said police have the right to inspect the centres serving hookah under section 12 of COTPA and section 149 CrPC. The judge pointed out that the petitioners had failed to place on record that GHMC authorities are only empowered to inspect their business premises.
 
 While considering the object and provisions of the Act coupled with Section 149 CrPC and taking into consideration violations by police, the judge said “this court is of the view that serving hookah in restaurants without complying with provisions of the Act and the rules and without displaying statutory and pictorial warning notices amounts to violation as pointed out by police.“
 
 The judge directed Telangana DGP to take appropriate action against the officer for their inaction on restaurants being used as hookah centres. However, the judge also asked DGP to look into allegations of highhandedness of police and take action if they violate law.
