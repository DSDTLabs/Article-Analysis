PATNA: State art, culture and youth affairs minister   inaugurated a two-day   film festival at the Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industries on Tuesday. While three   — ‘Nanak Nam Jahaz Hai’, ‘Chaar Sahibzaade’ and ‘Mera Pind’ — were screened on the first day, three more — ‘A Flying Jatt’, ‘Waris Shah’ and ‘Ardaas’ — will be screened on Day 2 of the fest.

 “The film festival, organized by the Bihar State Film Development and Finance Corporation Limited, will create awareness about the rich culture of Punjab and entertain the visitors as well,” said the minister.
 
 Punjab police official Ranjeet Singh, who has come to Patna to participate in the Prakashotsava celebrations, watched ‘Nanak Nam Jahaz Hai’. “Awarded the 1970 National Film Award, this devotional film is one of my favourites as it is based on a true incident. Watching it today after ages, that too during Prakashotsava celebrations, was a great experience,” Singh told TOI.
 
 Even Patnaites attended the film festival and watched different movies screened on Day 1. Rajendra Nagar resident Ranju Kumari, who had come with her two children to the fest, told TOI, “My kids love watching films and they asked me to come along. I came to know a lot about the Sikh culture through the films screened today.”
 
 There was a cultural exchange of sorts when several turban-clad men watched Bhikhari Thakur’s ‘Bidesiya’ at the   on Tuesday. 
 
 Ex-serviceman Randhir Singh Khalsa, who hails from Amritsar, was all praise for one of Thakur’s “best known” works. “This city looks beautiful and it has something new to offer to me every day. After watching the play, I will go to the  ,” he said.
