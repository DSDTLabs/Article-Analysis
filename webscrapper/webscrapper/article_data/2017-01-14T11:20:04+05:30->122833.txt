PATNA: Over 20 lakh posts of teachers in state government schools are lying vacant, leading to unproportionate pupil-teacher ratio (1:56) in Bihar, a recent study by   (Child Rights and You) and Centre for Budgets, Governance and Accountability ( ) said. Besides, the recruitment and training of duly qualified teachers have also not been given due priority as evident from the study findings, which shows only 1.6% of the total school budget has been earmarked for teachers’ training. This is despite the fact that Bihar’s school education budget is 5.6% of the GDP, much higher than the national average of 2.7% for the same in the last four fiscals (2012-13 to 2015-16).

 Sharing the study findings, CRY programme head Mohua Chatterjee on Friday said, “Over the past four years, Bihar has consistently spent almost one-fifth of its state budget on school education and allocated budget for the most marginalized children, but the state lags behind in per-student spending.”
 
 CBGA director Subrat Das said, “India’s prevailing budgetary spending on education is inadequate not just because it falls short of the benchmark recommended decades ago by the  , but also because of paucity of funds for almost all important areas of public provisioning of school education.”
 
 The study states that Bihar spends only Rs9,583 per student, compared to Rs32,263 by   in the country. Per student spending in Bihar also remains less than other states like Goa (Rs67,041), Kerala (Rs38,811), Tamil Nadu (Rs23,617) and Karnataka (Rs22,856).
 
 The study also highlights that Bihar stands as one of the highest among the 10 states with regard to budgetary allocation on education, but it has been reduced by 2% over the last four years (from 19.3% in 2012-13 to 17.7% in 2015-16). 
 
 In 2015-16 total education budget, Bihar spent 51.6% on teachers’ salary, 22% on education incentive schemes, 1.6% for teachers training, 7.2% for infrastructure development, 8.3% for midday meal and only 0.6% for inspection & monitoring.
