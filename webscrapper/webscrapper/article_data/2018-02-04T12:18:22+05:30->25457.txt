  peeled off yet another century as India defeated South Africa by six wickets in the first ODI of the six-match series to take 1-0 lead at Kingsmead, Durban on Thursday. India chased down 270 in 45.3 overs thanks to a measured century from Kohli, his first limited-overs ton in South Africa, who was out after scoring 112 off 119. 
 
 It was India's first ever win in ODIs over South Africa in Durban and in the process they also broke the hosts' run of 17 consecutive wins at home.
 
  saved his team the blushes in the first game with a determined century that alone helped the hosts register a total of any consequence. However, such has been India's stride in this format lately that chasing a total of 269 runs on a slow wicket remained only formality on Thursday evening.
 
 However, an already depleted South Africa are set to miss Du Plessis for the remainder of the series after the captain injured his finger during the 1st ODI in Kingsmead. The stand-in skipper   is low on ODI experience, but on par with Kohli where one particular 50-over triumph is concerned. The 23-yearold local lad had led South Africa to an Under-19 World Cup triumph in UAE back in 2014.
