PANAJI: The Goa Bachao Abhiyan ( ) has urged town and country planning ( ) minister   to expedite the process for participative planning instead of suggesting probes into allegations related to Regional Plan (RP) 2021 to divert people’s attention.

 The Goa TCP Act 1974 and Goa Municipalities Act 1968 need amendments on a priority to fulfill the legal mandate to facilitate planning by the people as per the 73rd and 74th Amendments, a task that has been pending for 26 years, the citizens’ group said. “Probes are potentially infinite and an opportunistic way for the government to keep people engaged with the Regional Plan while it continues to destroy Goa with devious unconstitutional acts, orders and committees,” GBA convener   and secretary   said in a joint statement.
 
 GBA members named the Investment Promotion Board Act as one such legislation that gave the authorities overriding powers on land use. Even more suspicious, they said, was the bill planned for regularising structures. “Once it is an act, many of the suspect beneficiaries of the RP 2021 will become legal, making a mockery of the ongoing debate,” they stated.
 
 The people’s unrest was triggered by a change of zones in a ‘colouring exercise’ and new PDAs that have arisen from an outdated Goa TCP Act 1974, the GBA said.
