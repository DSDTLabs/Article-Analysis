JAIPUR: The rate of affordable houses provided under the chief minister's ambitious   is expected to be hiked by the state government.

 According to sources, a proposal to increase the cost of low income group (LIG) and economic weaker section (EWS) houses will be tabled in the empowered committee meeting on Monday. The meeting will be chaired by urban development and housing (UDH) minister  . At present, the LIG and EWS houses constructed on government land by private developers are sold at a fixed rate of Rs 1,250 per sq feet. The Urban Improvement Trust (UIT), development authorities and local bodies provide Rs 1,000 per square feet to the developers for construction of these houses.
 
 Under provision 4(A) and 4(B), the EWSLIG houses are been developed on government land by private developers. Seventyfive percent of such government land can be used for EWSLIG people, while the remaining 25% can be sold by the developers. However, due to lesser rates provided by the government, the developers are not showing interest to construct houses under these category. “In Jaipur, not a single developer has shown inter est in constructing houses under this model. The   has invited expression of interest (EOI) several times,“ said sources.
 
 To achieve the target of constructing 10 lakh houses by 2019, the UDH is leaving no stone unturned to lure the developers. “As per the new proposal, the department has proposed to provide Rs 1,600 per sq feet rate to the developers.The land rates have in creased subsequently over the period of time, this is why increasing rates has become a need of the hour,“ said sources.
 
 Sources further said the proposal to reduce the number of floors will also be tabled. “The developers are constructing G+3 buildings at present. However, it is not cost effective. It has been proposed to construct G+2 buildings for LIG and EWS category.“
