GURUGRAM: To raise awareness about glaucoma, a medical condition that affects eyes, an awareness walk will be organised in the city on Sunday. Organisers say around 500 people are expected to participate in the ‘Gurugram Glaucoma Walk’ that will begin at Sushant Lok.

 The walk will be inaugurated by Gurgaon police commissioner   and city-based ophthalmologist Dr Animesh Chauhan. It is aimed at creating awareness among the general public about the importance of regular eye check-ups, and camps will also be set up where eye specialists will provide free check-ups and interactive sessions to clarify any doubts about the disease, say organisers. Doctors say glaucoma is a silent disease that causes damage to the optic nerve in the eye and the situation worsens with time. As per an estimate of  , 10 lakh more people are affected by this problem in India every year, and as the population ages, the figure would reach 20 lakh by 2020. As the symptoms are unnoticeable, glaucoma comes a close second to cataract in being the leading cause of blindness in India.
 
 “Glaucoma refers to a group of related eye disorders that causes damage to the optic nerve which carries information from the eye to the brain. People over the age of 50 are prone to it,” said Dr  , senior consultant and director of Complete Eye Care, Gurgaon.
