NAGPUR: The   forest officials under the Nagpur division have failed to make any progress in the poaching of two leopards, a tiger and two sambars even after lapse of eight days.

 As reported two leopards, mother and cub, were poisoned to death to avenge killing of a dog in the farm of Ramesh Raut in Rajna under Khapa range on January 8. However, lax forest officials learnt about it two days later.
 
 A day later, a tigress from   of   and two sambars were electrocuted in Kubala beat in the farm tilled by one Vinayak   and two others.
 
 According to sources, probe in both the cases is heading towards dead end and there are no arrest. This is despite the fact that the accused hail from the same areas.
 
 Sources said night patrolling and monitoring has stopped day after the incident. Even the samples from the spot are yet to be sent to labs.
 
 Surprisingly, round officer of Khapa, who is also holding additional charge of Kubala beat , was very prompt in issuing transit passes (TPs) at Saoner check-post.
 
 When enquired, Khapa range forest officer (RFO)   said, “As the accused are absconding, we are unable to arrest them. Investigations are going on.”
 
 The forest officials have also not raided the houses of accused or their relatives to know whereabouts. They has also not sought police help in tracking them from their numbers.Wildlife conservationists have thus complained that the department has a very sloppy attitude for probing tiger, leopard and other animal poaching cases.
