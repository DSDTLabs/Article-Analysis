When the whole city is out partying, why would someone, who isn’t even a traffic cop, choose to spend his   standing at crossroads and regulating traffic? Well   has been doing just that for the past nine years! “It all started when I was stuck in a jam one day, and decided to get down from my car and start regulating the traffic myself instead of sitting and cribbing. I had just moved to Hyderabad from the UK. I lived in   and worked in  . Although the distance between the two areas isn’t much, the experience of getting stuck in traffic endlessly was frustrating. I realised the gridlocks happened only due to the lack of road sense in people. And I’ve seen that this lack of common sense can even lead to loss of life,” says Suresh, who quit his job to focus on working towards better road safety in Hyderabad.
This December 31 too, Suresh put on his reflective gear and spent a good four hours on the road near Jubilee Hills check post regulating traffic. He says, “I get a lot of calls from friends who want to help but then I discourage them. For one, it’s a night for people to have fun and I don’t want to force some social obligation on them. And two, whenever I have had people join me, I feel more worried about them and their safety, than focussing on traffic, so I’d rather work alone.” But what about his New Year fun? “You know what, I end up meeting more people on the road. I bump into friends, family friends and sometimes, even end up making new friends as people get down to say ‘thank you’, ‘Good job, bro’. And, I still have the remaining 364 nights to party, no?” he quips.
