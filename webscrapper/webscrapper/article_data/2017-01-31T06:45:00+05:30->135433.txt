CHANDIGARH: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president   on Monday asked the   to take note of   (AAP) convener Arvind Kejriwal’s night stay at the residence of an alleged terrorist in Moga.

 Sukhbir said Kejriwal’s night stay at the residence of Khalistan Commando Force (KCF) chief Gurinder Singh, alias Jaswinder Singh Ghali, had vitiated poll atmosphere in Punjab and given a fillip to radical forces. “This kind of conduct must be snubbed,” Badal said.
 
 SAD president said Kejriwal also had a moral responsibility to tell Punjabis why he had stayed at the residence of a “dreaded militant”. “Not only did you stay at the residence of the KCF terrorist, but also held a meeting with radical elements and made calls to foreign countries,” he said.
 
 He said Punjabis had a right to know why Kejriwal was holding repeated meetings with “extremist elements”. “Earlier, you met Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) front organisation Akhand Kirtani Jatha members, including R P Singh, at Mohali. You have also held meetings with radical elements who organized a separatist conclave more than a year ago,” Sukhbir said.
 
 He said such incidents proved that “Kejriwal was hand in glove with radical elements”. “It also proves that the AAP convener is ready to go to any extent for a few votes; even compromise the unity and integrity of the country,” he said.
 
 He said it was impossible to believe that the AAP’s Moga leadership did not know that they were putting up Kejriwal in a terrorist's house. “In fact, it was deliberate. AAP leadership wants to send a signal to radical elements that it is one of them,” Punjab deputy CM said.
