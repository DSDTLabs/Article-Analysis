MUMBAI:   from the rural hinterland are upset at the party's apparent U-turn on the issue of writing off  . 

 Shiv Sena, which is the BJP-led government's alliance partner, had joined the protests along with the oppositi- on on the loan waiver issue in the run-up to the budget. But it back-tracked and cooperated with the government during the budget presentation. 
 
 However minister of state   (Sena) told the legislative council that the waiver would adversely affect the state's investment in agriculture and there was no guarantee that farmers would escape the debt trap. More than 40 MLAs of the Sena are from rural areas. 
 
 "We have to face the consequences in our constituency. People are asking us about the change in our party's stand," said a Sena MLA.
