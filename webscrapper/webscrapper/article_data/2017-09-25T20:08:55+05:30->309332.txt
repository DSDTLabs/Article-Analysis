AGRA: In a dramatic turn of events, a man accused of death threats to Firozabad BJP   Manish Asija jumped out of a police van and escaped while being taken for medical examination.

 On Sunday evening MLA Asija claimed that an unknown person had sent a message threating him to murder. “I’m under stress after reading the threat message and not in good state of mind to share more details about it,” he said while speaking to TOI over phone.
 
 Acting on Asija’s complaint late night, local police nabbed a youth (name withheld by TOI), who later escaped from police custody from   chouraha, while he was been taken for medical examination.
 
 According to the police, the man had sent a   by SMS to the MLA on Sunday night.
 
 Rajesh Kumar Srivastava, superintendent of police, Firozabad city, said, “Police teams were combing the city to arrest the fugitive, and that some more men involved in threatening the   leader has been detained.”
 
 It is important to note that on September 19, the MLA claimed that some unknown assailants opened fire at his home at night. The bullet had allegedly pierced a windowpane of the kitchen on the first floor but interestingly was found on the road by Asija himself in the presence of police.
 
 The alleged firing took place just a day after   MP Akshay Yadav took out a support march for Firozabad municipal commissioner Kamlesh Kumar, who sought transfer after Asija's death threat complaint. Earlier the district’s hospital sole orthopedic doctor had resigned from his post levelling serious allegations against Asija.
 
 On Sunday, the state finance minister Rajesh Agrawal visited Firozabad and met legislator Asija. When he was questioned, as what he has to say on alleged attack on MLA under current BJP regime in the state, he said, “The government has taken cognizance of the matter. Earlier leaders were abducted but now things have come under control.”
