MUMBAI: The city on Wednesday recorded the   February day since 2013 as maximum temperature at the Santacruz observatory of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) touched 37.2 degrees Celsius. Mumbai has witnessed a sudden jump in the maximum temperatures over the past couple of days. 

 Until Monday, maximum temperatures had been hovering around 32 degrees Celsius. On Wednesday, the maximum temperature recorded at the Santacruz observatory was 37.2 degrees Celsius, which was 6.7 degrees Celsius above normal, while the Colaba observatory recorded 36.9 degrees Celsius, which was 7.5 degrees above normal.
 
 Temperatures tend to rise in February, said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general (western region) of the IMD, adding that on February 23, 2015, maximum temperature touched 38.8 degrees Celsius and on February 22, 2012, it was 39.1 degrees Celsius. The all-time record for the hottest February day so far stands at 39.6 degrees Celsius on February 25, 1996. 
 
 The highest maximum temperature in February last year was 33.2 degrees Celsius on February 23. 
 
 Hosalikar said, “Maximum temperatures are markedly high. Sea breeze has been setting in very late. Unlike other days when sea breeze sets in at 1pm, on Wednesday, it set in around 2pm. The wind pattern, which is from south-easterly to easterly, is causing the temperatures to rise.” 
 
 The Met department said that there is an anti-cyclone wind circulation over Mumbai, which is one of the reasons why parts of north Konkan like Dahanu are also witnessing high temperatures. Maximum temperature in Dahanu too was around 37 degrees Celsius.
 
 The humidity levels recorded by the IMD Colaba and Santacruz observatory were 75% and 39%, respectively.
