Bhopal: When   minister of state for women and child welfare   rode his green Bajaj super scooter and went out for haircut and shopped in the market fetching vegetables in   on Saturday, people were hardly surprised. They have seen him doing so for the past many years.

 But, this was his first scooter ride ever since he became a minister in Narendra   cabinet on September 3. Though his security personnel had a tough time chasing him, the minister enjoyed the public attention, shunning the SUV and hooters.
 
 He also enjoyed the media attention which captured the minister’s every movement.
 
 A dalit face of BJP from the backward region of Bundelkhand, he has been representing BJP in the   since 1996. His image of being a down-to-earth leader has been considered his USP.
 
 On Friday and Saturday, Kumar rode his scooter again. He purchased vegetables bargaining with shopkeepers for tomatoes. Then he went for shaving and haircut to the shop that he has been visiting for the past many years in Sagar.
 
 He spent about 45 minutes at the barber’s shop as people gathered outside the shop to watch him. Later, he obliged the barber with a selfie.
 
 But not everybody is pleased.
 
 Former Congress MLA from Tikamgarh, Yadvendra Singh termed it a “tamasha”.
 
 “You do not need to go out to fetch tomatoes to get public attention and show that you are simple,” he said, adding, “as a six-time MP and now a Union minister all you need is to work for the welfare of poor people of the region.”
 
 The region is again witnessing a drought, but mantri ji has so much of time to ride scooter and buy tomatoes to grab eyeballs, Singh said.
 
 Ignoring his criticism, Virendra Kumar said he had been sticking to his roots right from the beginning. I always connect with the common man, because I still consider myself a common man,” he said
