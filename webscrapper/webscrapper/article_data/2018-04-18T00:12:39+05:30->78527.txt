Jaipur: The private school associations have justified the   hike by stating that fees have been fixed by parent-teacher committees as per the Rajasthan Private School Fees Act. The associations have asked in case of disagreement, the parties concerned have to find a solution in accordance with the law by making an appeal in the first appellate.

 The Rajasthan Private School Act says that every school has to form a school level fee committee act including five parents, three teachers and a principal and one person from the management. 
 
 “School level fees committee has been constituted as per fee Act in all our schools. The fee committee after considering all factors has determined the fees which are on an average in between 8-12%. If any school has increased the fees substantially, they must have their own reasons,” said Damodar Goyal, president of Society for Private Unaided Schools in Rajasthan.
 
 Majority of the 40,000 private schools have increased the fees within the bracket of 8%-12%. While some schools which are being run by influential people, including politicians, have influenced the school level fee committee to increase fees above 20%. Some schools, including BVB Vidhyasharm and St Anselm’s School, both in Jaipur, have increased the fees above 25% which is among the highest rise in the state. Facing the wrath of parents, the principal of Vidhyashram, Pratima Sharma refused to comment on the astronomical fee hike to TOI. 
 
 The act provides an appeal by the managing committee to the government which can may maximum check the fairness of the constitution of the school level fee committee.
