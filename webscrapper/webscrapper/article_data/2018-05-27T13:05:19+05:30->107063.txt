In 1953, when young copyboy Gay Talese started his mundane stint with The New York Times, he dressed the part – not for the job he had, but the job he thought he deserved. His pick? A hand-stitched Italian suit. Talese, went on from there to define literary journalism for times to come – and his love for   became legendary. He famously said: “Putting on a beautifully designed suit elevates my spirit, extols my sense of self, and helps define me as a man to whom details matter.”

 A suit has been a power dressing staple for years, deployed by men (and women) to own the room. A research by California State University found that wearing formal clothing makes people feel more powerful, which brings with it a sense of more social distance from others. However, in India, suits stay put as occasion or big meeting wear. And now that the infamous Indian summer is here, suits are going to be dry-cleaned, mothballed and stored away. But wait! Summer suits are here.
 
 
 The key difference is the fabric. Designer Raghavendra Rathore says that light colours such as cream, light grey-blue, white in cotton and linens, and tropical wools are going to be popular this summer. He says, “Summer suits are cut in a way that you could either wear them open or close.” Agrees Suvarna Kale, head of design with a menswear company and says, “For summer, pants should be more tailored with a bit shorter hem.” Designer and bespoke tailor Osman Abdul Razak identifies summer suits as lightweight, unstructured, more breathable. He adds, “The unlined summer jacket is trending.” Salesh Grover, head of a luxury menswear brand, says summer colour palette is also opening up with lilac, pink, lemon or duck egg blue. Wear pastels – it gives a twist without being too edgy.
 
 Summer is ideal to sport pastel/lighter shades. Pair with a white shirt or T-shirt

 Grover says to invest in a summer jacket to up your fashion game. Rathore roots for the classic bandhgala. “Having couple of options in bandhgala for summer — a piece rooted in our heritage — makes sense.” Menswear designer Kunal Rawal suggests summer layering, “Go for cotton dobbies or mulmul and cut down on lining.” 
 Kale suggests making one suit go the distance. For instance: use the waistcoat as a stand alone piece or go for detachable lapels to mix it up. Style it with a T-shirt for a Sunday brunch or a Hawaiian shirt (very on point right now) for a party. Grover says, “Accessories complete a suit. If you’re keeping the suit light and simple, opt for one or two big accessories, such as bright socks and a patterned tie.” For an ideal weekend look, try a crisp white shirt with an unstructured suit and a pair of leather trainers.
 Sneakers with a suit is a big draw. Rathore feels a suit comes alive when the shirt is playful. “If you wear a T-shirt, make sure the neckline is high,” he adds. This summer, let the suit not be a four-letter word.
 
 
 Tropical wool or cool wool is a lightweight wool. It has larger gaps in its weave, making the material airier and more breathable. It’s a casual-looking fabric with wrinkle-free characteristics.
 
 
 - Pair with classic dress shoes such as Oxfords, derbies or bluchers. Add summery vibe with colourful laces. 
 - Loafers work best with summer suits – semi-formal yet business appropriate. Pick tassel loafers or suede sagans.
 
 
 - Pair sneakers with a  . Make sure hems are short. 
 - Wear a well-fitted suit with a soft T-shirt. For a coloured suit, keep the pairing in the same colour.
 - Summer shades of military hues is also big.
