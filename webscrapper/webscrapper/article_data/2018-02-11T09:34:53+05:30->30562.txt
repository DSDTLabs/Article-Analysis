ALLAHABAD: A local   leader on Friday uploaded a poster on Facebook and WhatsApp targeting PM  , BJP president Amit Shah and Union minister   allegedly for disrespecting Congress MP   during a recent debate in Rajya Sabha.

 The poster, uploaded by city   Ahmad, has gone viral. It reads: “Rakshamam... Rahul Gandhi. Ek stri ki hansi Duryodhan ko khal gayee thi — yaad karo, 100 Kauravon ki chita jal gayi thi (Protect us Rahul Gandhi… the laughter of a woman had once offended Duryodhan and remember, hundreds of Kauravas had to lose their lives).” In the poster, Rahul is shown as Lord Krishna protecting Renuka Chaudhary.
 
  
  
 
 
 The poster depicted the PM, Shah and Jaitley as Kauravas. It also carried photographs of UPA chairperson   and Congress Rajya Sabha MP Pramod Tiwari, among others. Senior leaders of city and district Congress committees feigned ignorance about the poster, while the BJP leaders termed it as an attempt to seek publicity. Referring to the Renuka episode, Haseeb said: “It’s sad that the PM has shown disrespect to a woman MP in Rajya Sabha. Modi described the laughter of the woman MP in the context of the Ramayana and we have launched a Mahabharat against him and his team.”
 
 He also demanded Modi to “apologise to crores of Indian women.” Modi, during a debate in Rajya Sabha, had reportedly said that Chowdhury’s laughter reminded him of the 1980s’ TV serial ‘Ramayana’. Hours later, Rijiju too shared a video in this connection that was later removed from his Facebook page.
