NOIDA: While the Karnataka election results have thrown an interesting and unpredictable situation with much uncertainty prevailing, it was a different sight in Noida where the   unit displayed immense confidence in the party’s win.

 
 BJP workers could be seen celebrating the “party’s win” at 3pm at Sanatan Dharm mandir in Sector 19 with the activists stressing that a BJP government will come to power in the state, come what may.
 
 At around 1.26 pm, a BJP spokesperson shared messages about the programme being held at the mandir at 3 pm to celebrate the “historic win” that “BJP was getting in Karnataka.”
 
 This was when the official   trends had suggested that the BJP was leading on 106 seats while the   was leading on 76 seats and the JD(S) was ahead on 38 seats of the total 222 seats.
 
 However, as the BJP’s tally was hovering around 108 at around 2.30 pm, a few local leaders of the party decided to stop the functionaries from going ahead with the planned celebration for the “win”.
 
  It was clear only by 5 pm that the saffron party has not gathered the 111-mark required to form the government on its own.
 
 Local leaders including Noida city president Rakesh Sharma, district general secretary Yudhvir Chauhan, Dimple Anand of  , general secretary Sushil Sharma and BJP media incharge   were present at the spot and took part in the celebration held with over 100 supporters here.
 
 When asked about the over enthusiasm among the workers, Sushil Sharma said supporters were celebrating the fact that the “party had emerged as the single largest party”. “It was done in order to thank the people of Karnataka as our party never had this kind of vote share,” he said.
