COIMBATORE: Gaurav Gill and   made a roaring start in the MRF-FMSCI Indian National Rally Championship ( ), winning the MRF Rally of Coimbatore, the opening leg of the season, here on Sunday. It marked a great turnaround by the two-time Asia Pacific Rally Championship (APRC) winner, as he had failed to finish here last season due to a mechanical problem.

 There was no such problem for Gill this time. He established a healthy lead in the first Special Stage (SS1) and maintained it through the next four stages and also improved his timing.
 
 Defending champion   (co-driver  ) did well to keep   (co-driver  ) - winner here last year - at bay to claim second place.
 
 Ghosh failed to live up to expectations as his car lacked power. The Kolkata boy, who had not raced for seven months, sounded a bit frustrated. "I knew it would be difficult after missing the action for so long. But sadly the vehicle also did not respond well," he rued. His Team Mahindra teammate Gill was quite pleased with his performance. "I haven't driven an SUV for almost a year now. So I was quite happy with the result," Gill stated. "We decided to grab an early lead as we knew the wear and tear can turn gravel tracks tricky in the later stages," Gill explained.
