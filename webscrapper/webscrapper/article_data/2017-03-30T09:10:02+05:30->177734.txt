Vadodara/ Anand: A day after a female employee of The Institute of Rural Management, Anand ( ) registered a police complaint accusing a top official of sexual harassment, Anand police began its investigations at the premier rural management institute. 

 The police team consisting a deputy superintendent of police, a police inspector and a police sub inspector reached the institute’s campus on Wednesday noon after which they recorded statements of around five eye-witnesses. 
 
 “Based on the complaint, we have recorded statements of witnesses. 
 
 We will continue recording statements of other persons whom the woman has identified as witnesses in the matter,” said a police official. 
 
 The police could not meet the accused official as they were informed that he was on a tour.
 
 The police has registered the FIR against the official under various sections of the Indian Penal Code especially under the amended sections of sexual harassment against women – 354 (A) (iv) (making sexually coloured remarks), 354 (B) (assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman). 
 
 The female employee has said that she had earlier raised the issue with the institute’s internal sexual harassment complaint committee ( ) on March 2. 
 
 But she approached the police after the committee did not give her any proper response. In a mail that members of the institute’s SHCC had written to the employee, she was told that the institute’s board of governors after seeking legal opinion in the matter was contemplating to constitute a new committee to decide the case.
 
 The employee was informed that the new committee will communicate with her on the matter. But according to the complainant, she was later never approached to address her grievances.
