NAGPUR: The Nagpur   is now making preparations for the fourth round of Right To Education Act ( ) as almost 20% seats still remain vacant. As of now, 5,596 students have taken admissions, taking the district’s confirmed seats statistics to 79% of total available seats. It’s expected that the fourth round will be held next week and may probably ensure that all vacant seats are filled. In fact, the lottery rounds will continue till all seats are filled up. However, the students who get selected but still don’t complete admission formalities, forfeit their chance for the entire 2017-18 academic session.

 While the situation may sound pathetic, comparison with other parts of Maharashtra puts things a completely different light. Premchand Raut, district coordinator for Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan, said, “We are ranked second in the state when it comes to statistics of confirmed admission. Even the top most district is our neighbour   at 83% confirmed admissions. As far as the remaining seats in Nagpur are concerned, the process is already underway and they too will be filled up soon.”
 
 TOI had reported earlier that Nagpur district had created a record in the number of applications received versus the seats available under RTE. Nagpur had a ratio of 3.22 applications per seat with Pune coming in second, courtesy a ratio of 2.28. For 2017-18 RTE admission season, Vidarbha held an almost complete sway. The number three, four and five spots are occupied by Wardha (1.70),   (1.67) and Akola (1.38) respectively. 
 
 Various reasons are being cited for the slow pace of admissions and prominent among them is that there were issues with documents of parents not being accepted by schools. Major issue was related to address proof specifically of those people who lived on rent, but that too was resolved later.
