Jyothika’s forthcoming film ‘Kaatrin Mozhi’, which is a remake of the Bollywood superhit film ‘Tumhari Sulu’, has finally gone on floors today. Veteran actor Sivakumar signalled off the film's shoot with a formal pooja ceremony.

  
 Taking it to Twitter, Dhananjayan wrote, “#KaatrinMozhi from Dir Radhamohan sir #Jyotika mam #Vidaarth shoot began today with the blessings of #Sivakumar sir. Thanks so much to @Suriya_offl sir being the special guest to start the shoot. Our entire cast & crew were there. A non-stop shooting schedule. Happy to Produce.”
 
  
  
 To be directed by Radha Mohan, the Tamil version will see   reprising Vidya’s role of homemaker turned Radio Jockey. Reportedly, the makers have tweaked the script to suit the Tamil audiences.
 
 Produced by Dhananjayan Govind's BOFTA Media Works, Vidharth has been roped in to play Jyothika’s husband and will reprise Manav Kaul’s role in the remake. Telugu actress-host Lakshmi Manchu will also play a pivotal role.
 
 After much speculation, it was confirmed that independent composer AH Kaashif has been finalised as the music composer. If reports are to be believed, the film is likely to release this year. On the other hand, Jyothika’s much-awaited ‘Chekka Chivantha Vaanam’ is also eyeing a year-end release.
