IMPHAL: Results for   assembly elections 2017 are due on Saturday, elections for which were held in two phases. According to CVoter exit polls, Manipur has shown its inclination towards BJP.

 Meanwhile, elaborate arrangements and heavy security are in place for the counting of votes in the state, for which 11 counting centres have been set up. The process is underway which began with the counting of postal ballots at 8 in the morning. 
 
 The Election Commission (EC) has issued guidelines on security arrangements for counting of votes, and has also set up facilities for disseminating trends and results of the election.
 
 Chief electoral officer VK Dewangan told reporters in Imphal that results of Chandel, Jiribam, Senapati and Kangpokpi would take "minimal time".
 
 He said that the result in the Thoubal constituency, where rights activist Irom Sharmila is pitted against Chief Minister O Ibobi Sing, is likely to take more time.
 
 PRJA's chief, Irom Sharmila said, "I do not feel much affected by the result. It depends upon the people's mindset. I don't feel much affected by it, because people can still change their minds and everybody knows muscle and money power is being openly used by parties."
 
 "What we really need to be is the power to bring the change and make the difference from dark to light. In case of my defeat, I want to try in 2019 election," she added.
 
 Dewangan said central para-military forces were guarding the EVMs as prohibitory orders under Section 144 CrPC were imposed by the district magistrates near the perimeter of all counting halls.
