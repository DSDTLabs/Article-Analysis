AHMEDABAD:  , the man accused of kidnapping Dhaval Mavani and Piyush Savaliya, to extort Bitcoins, Litecoins and cash worth a total of Rs 155.21 crore — could be in more trouble as an FIR accusing him of cheating a man of Rs 13.75 crore, registered by Karjan police, has been transferred to CID crime.

 
 
 Vadodara (rural) SP Saurabh Tolambiya confirmed that the case was transferred to CID. The complainant, Sonesh Patel of Gotri in Vadodara, had approached Vadodara rural police in 2014 with an application.
 
 “The then SP had directed Karjan police to register an FIR but this was not done, for reasons unknown. After Patel filed an   application to know the status of his application, an FIR was lodged on February 27, 2018,” a senior CID crime officer said.
 
 By then, Shailesh Bhatt had submitted application to CID crime regarding his kidnapping by Amreli cops. Bhatt approached the court and pleaded that the FIR at Karjan was registered as revenge by police, because he had accused police personnel, added a CID official.
 
 “Though Gujarat HC stayed coercive action, there was no stay on the investigation. Sonesh Patel, a real estate agent, named Shailesh Bhatt, Anupam Patel, Mittal Hirani and Nagin Patel of Karjan as the accused,” said a CID official.
 
 Patel alleged that Bhatt, projected himself as a trustee of a religious sect to get him to invest in a 36-bigha piece of land, worth Rs 20 crore, promising that the sect would buy the land at double the price. Bhatt paid him a token of Rs 20 lakh also, a CID crime official said. 
 
 “Patel alleged that he paid Rs 13.75 crore in instalments to the owners of the land,   and Nagin Patel of Karjan. However, they did not go ahead and register the sale, but instead sold the land to one Manish Mehta of Mumbai,” a CID crime official said.
