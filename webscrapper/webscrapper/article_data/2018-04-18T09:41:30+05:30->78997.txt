CHANDIGARH: Government schools in   may soon teach sports as a subject in Class I instead of Class VI. The proposal was given an inprinciple approval by chief minister   on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the state will also reconsider the cash awards given to sportspersons who win medals at international events.

 At a review meeting of the sports department, a decision was taken to work out the modalities for health insurance schemes for sports veterans. Amarinder also asked officials to relook at the existing structure of cash awards to sportspersons who win medals in national and international games like Olympics, Commonwealth and Asian Games in order to boost their morale.
 
 On introducing sports period in Class I in place of the current Class VI, the idea is to catch them young. Schools, colleges and universities will pro-actively intensify their efforts to promote sports in their institutions. Amarinder asked the sports department to make use of the state’s excellent infrastructure for hockey, football, basketball, volleyball, badminton, athletics, and swimming.
 
 
 Stating that it was the government’s duty to fend for sports veterans who had done the state proud during their sporting careers, Amarinder asked the sports department to work out a scheme to extend financial aid to them. Pointing out that several such veterans had been found fighting ill health or age related complications, he asked sports secretary to chalk out modalities for a health insurance scheme to ensure the best health and medical care for these veterans.
 
 He suggested an increase in existing pension for sportspersons. The need to involve DCs, who were also the presidents of district Olympic associations, in promoting sports was also discussed.
