PONDA: The mysterious leakage in the 41-lakh-litre capacity swimming   at   was finally solved after engineers from the directorate of sports and youth affairs (DSYA) found a defect in the water-refilling nozzle.

 The leakage had flummoxed officials of DSYA, forcing them to shut the facility for seven months. The department’s staff and engineers initially thought there was a leak in the drainage pipe. 
 
 “We have spotted some leakage points along a water refilling nozzle and have successfully plugged them,” DSYA executive engineer   said.
 
 The department has now decided to reopen the swimming pool to the public on Goa’s first chief minister Dayanand Bandodkar’s birth anniversary on March 12. 
 
 The facility had been built at a cost of Rs 7.4 crore and was inaugurated by   legislator and then chief minister   on February 25, 2009. The leakage was first noticed during the summer of 2017. When the level of water continued to drop, affecting the filtering unit, concerns about the hygiene of the pool began surfacing. 
 
 By July 26, 2017, it was decided to shut the pool for repairs. After the department failed to pinpoint the reason, the baffled officials sought help from a Pune-based consultant to figure out the reason for the seepage of water from the pool into the earth without any conceivable reason. Engineers had even excavated drainpipes along the pool’s periphery, but all efforts failed.
 
  During the fault-finding exercise, engineers even got some of the old underwater floor tiles changed. Additionally, a process called grouting (mortar or paste for filling crevices) of the pool wall and floor had been carried out at a cost of around Rs 6.5 lakh, Lotlikar said.
