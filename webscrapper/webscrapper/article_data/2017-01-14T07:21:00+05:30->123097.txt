ROHTAK: A Rohtak-based tiles trader was duped of Rs 33 lakh in   on the pretext of exchanging them for Rs 50 lakh in   in Hisar last month. Police on Wednesday registered a case of cheating, criminal breach of trust and posing as a public servant with fraudulent intent against eight persons on the complaint of Rohtak trader identified as Dinesh Thakur.

 Thakur, who lives at   in Rohtak, told police that he came in contact of   of Meham town through a common friend Prem in December 2016. Kuldeep offered him to exchange Rs 50 lakh in demonetized currency for Rs 33 lakh. The complainant said he could not resist the deal to get Rs 17 lakh extra in the exchange.
 
 The complainant set out with new currency in a bag in his car from Rohtak on December 23, 2016, with Kuldeep and reached at Hisar where they met four persons. “I handed over my bag carrying Rs 33 lakh to them and a person named Muneem, who was carrying the bag of banned notes of Rs 50 lakh, sat with us in the car,” Dinesh alleged in his police complaint.
 
 When they were about to leave the place, another car stopped by their vehicle in which some persons were seen wearing police outfits and they asked Kuldeep and Muneem to sit in their car with the bag. The complainant said before he could understand, they had decamped with the money from the spot. A senior income tax official told the media that the department would question the trader about the source of new currency in his possession and would act accordingly.
 
 Thakur said he was ready to face any probe to prove the source of his money while raising doubts that the gang might have duped several others.
