PATNA: One passenger was killed and two others were injured when a 10-metre-long piece of railway track tore into a compartment of the Hatia-Gorakhpur Maurya Express in Bihar’s Lakhisarai district on Saturday around 3.30am. 

 Sources said track renewal work has been going on at the spot for over a month now. The piece of track that hit the passengers was one of the many lying a few metres away from the existing line, they added. 
 
 “It seems miscreants placed this piece on the track in an upward position ... It pierced the floor of the compartment next to the engine the moment the   hit it,” Danapur deputy railway manager R P Thakur said. The victim has been identified as Mangal Seth (50) of Azamgarh.
