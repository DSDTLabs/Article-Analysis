 He hit three half centuries with his highest score being 78 runs. “It was quite a satisfactory performance as I had come out of a long injury.

I am glad that I could contribute to my team’s wins and play according to situations,” said Krunal, a left-hand batsman, who has now been picked up for   team for the Deodhar Trophy due to his all-round performance in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. 
 
 “I was disappointed with the injury as I had done well in the IPL last year and was raring to go this Ranji season. A good performance might have helped me get in the Indian team but I am the kind of person who takes things positively even when the chips are down. I never give up,” Krunal TOI. His frustration was obvious as he had missed the entire season in 2015-16 as well due to shoulder injury.
 
 “And it happened again this season. During the treatment, I had to walk with support initially for 21 days and then I spent nearly three-and-half months in rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy. It was tough but  , who is trainer there, and my coach   motivated me a lot,” said Krunal, brother of India player Hardik Pandya.
 
 “The runs I scored and wickets I bagged in Vijay Hazare Trophy have given me lot of confidence for the upcoming Deodhar Trophy. And playing for India is always a dream,” he added.
