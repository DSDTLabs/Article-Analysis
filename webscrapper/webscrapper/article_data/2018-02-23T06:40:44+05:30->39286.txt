BENGALURU: Citing that Friday will be the last working day of the assembly, the   government pushed through five bills though less than 20 members were present in the house late Thursday evening.

 The bills approved included those pertaining to three new universities, revenue land and handing over all Bengaluru lakes to the minor irrigation department.
 Chief minister Siddaramaiah and opposition leaders Jagadish Shettar and H D   were present in the house when the bills were tabled and passed.
  
  
 At one point when the bills were being considered, opposition parties had more members in the house and even joked about defeating the bill on making   (BASE) an independent university. The bill, though, was eventually passed without objections. BASE has been allocated Rs 250 crore.
 
  MLA from Sringeri D N Jeevaraj said: “Having been the chief whip of BJP previously, I can calculate that we have 18 MLAs from the opposition and 17 from the ruling party in the house. We can defeat the bill if we want to. Do not take the opposition parties lightly.”
 
 The other private university bill pertained to setting up of Shri Sathya Sai University for Human Excellence, with both the opposition and ruling parties lauding the private trust of Prashanthi Balamandira for proposing to headquarter its university at Navanihal village of Kamalapura, Kalaburgi. The university has been given the leeway to start campuses or regional and study centres anywhere in the state after five years of establishment.
 
 The bill on private university, Amity, which is based out of New Delhi and has nine universities across the country, saw an exchange of words, with the BJP alleging that the varsity was being set up under “pressure”. However, higher education minister Basavaraj Rayareddy argued that during the BJP tenure, 22 private varsities were approved and 16 of them were located in and around Bengaluru.
