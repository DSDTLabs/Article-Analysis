Chandigarh: The Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) has replaced two power transformers each at 220kV Substation, Dhulkote and 220 kV Substation, Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB), Jagadhari with higher capacity new transformers. This will ensure better power supply in the surrounding areas of Ambala and Yamunanagar in Haryana and also improve voltage. 

 Similarly, the power transformer at Jalandhar has also been replaced. The old transformers were around 50 years old and were past their prime. BBMB decided to introduce new transformers in view of the redundancy of the older ones due to ageing.
