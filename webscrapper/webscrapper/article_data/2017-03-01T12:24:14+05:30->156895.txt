After a 10-day hiatus, Malayali Facebook buffs were excited when they saw a brave message brimming with optimism on the profile of the young actress, who was recently assaulted. 

 In no time, it was viral and even celebrities shared it with excitement. However, we now hear that the Facebook page that shared her message is apparently fake! Actor - director  , one of her friends who had shared the post, withdrew it saying that he learnt that the post is not authentic. "So I am removing it.. Informing u all.. (sic)," wrote the 'Aby' actor.
 
 The actress, who is back to work, had recently started shooting for a Mollywood movie in Kochi. 
 
 Her authentic   page had posted a beautiful picture of hers, captioning it, "Life has knocked me down a few times, it showed me things I never wanted to see. I experienced sadness and failures. But one thing for sure, I always get up. #ThankYouAll #ForTheLove #ForThePrayers.(sic)."
