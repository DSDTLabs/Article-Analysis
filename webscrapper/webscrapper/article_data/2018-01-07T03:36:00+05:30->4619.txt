Vijayawada: The state finance corporations have performed poorly over the years. Out of the 17 corporations, which have come up in the state, only six have taken up development activities in 2017.

 The SC finance corporation, ST finance corporation and BC finance corporations are the only ones extending support to their respective beneficiaries and utilising funds allocated to them. The other corporations remain active but are not utilising funds which are with them. The AP State Kapu Welfare and Development Corporation, which was created in 2015, has shelled out over Rs 77.60 crore against the annual target of Rs 640 crore. The SC corporation tops the list of financial benefits and the number of beneficiaries. It spent Rs 3,717 crore in this financial year against Rs 23.09 crore in 2016-17 and Rs 22.76 crore in 2015-16. The ST corporation has spent Rs 35.72 crore in the current financial year against its annual target of Rs 91.28 crore. Similarly, ST corporation spent Rs 30 crore in 2016-17 and Rs 52.57 crore during 2015-16.
 
 Meanwhile, there are certain corporations which did tap into their funds this year. AP Nayee Brahmin Cooperative Federation, AP Vaddera Cooperative Societies Federation, AP Sagara (Uppara) Cooperative Societies Federation, AP Krishna Balija Poosala Cooperatives Federation, AP Valmiki Boya Cooperative Societies Federation, AP Battraja Cooperative Societies Federation, State Kummari Shalivahana Cooperative Societies Federation, AP State Viswabrahmins Cooperative Corporation, AP Medara Finance Corporation and AP State Christian Minorities Finance Corporation have failed to make any progress in   the allocated funds. Each of these corporations have at least Rs 200 crore to Rs 350 crore in their budget. Two other corporations, AP State Minorities Finance Corporation and AP Toddy Tappers Cooperative Finance Corporation started spending this year with an expenditure of Rs 13.46 crore and Rs 12 lakh respectively.
 
 “It is all about planning. The state government, despite revenue deficit, has given funds. We (SC finance corporation), are utilising every opportunity,” said AP SC finance corporation chairman Jupudi Prabhakara Rao.
