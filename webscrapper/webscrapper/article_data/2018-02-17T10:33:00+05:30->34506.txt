KOLHAPUR: Around 20 closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras were installed in and around   building on Friday, thereby putting   under CCTV scanner.

 Assistant curator of Kolhapur Museum Amrut Patil said, the renovation works, which were going on at snail’s pace, picked up momentum with the sanctioning of Rs 89 lakh. “With the availability of funds, it is just a matter of time to finish the remaining works in the premises,” said Patil. 
 
 He added the CCTV cameras, covering the inside of the museum as well as the outer premises, will help improve the security. 
 
 He further said the museum is situated in the well-known Town Hall building built in 1876. Over the years, soil upto 2 feet above the ground had accumulated around the structure of Town Hall. “The soil has been removed, gutters have been cleared and the ramp facility for visitors with disability is now available,” he said. 
 
 Vintage style poles with LED lamps have also been installed in and around Town hall building to keep the vintage essence alive.
 
 Patil added the museum has hundreds of artefacts which were excavated in 1945- 1946 near Bramhapuri, now a suburban part of the Kolhapur city along with other historical objects. 
 
 Vivek Patil, a visitor to the museum, said the building has transformed drastically from what it used to be a few years ago. “The fountain area, the vintage poles and the overall improvement in the presentation truly makes this place iconic,” he said.
