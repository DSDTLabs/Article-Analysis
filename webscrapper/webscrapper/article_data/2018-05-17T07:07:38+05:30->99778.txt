PUNE: Sixteen-year-old   had complained of severe abdominal pain. The doctors ran certain specific urine tests and diagnosed him with a very rare genetic disorder — porphyria. Ahmed is the second confirmed patient of porphyria from the same family in  . His sister Aayesha had tested positive for the condition two years ago.

 
  
 
 Porphyrias are a group of rare genetic diseases that develop in patients born without the mechanism to make certain essential body chemicals, including heme — one of the most important parts of blood.
 
 Doctors in the city are now in touch with their colleagues at the Kings College, London, and the International Centre for Porhyria for treatment options.
 
 “We are sending the blood samples to the UK to study genetic mutations,” said Jitendra Oswal, paediatrician, Bharati Hospital. “We have appealed to industrialists to help the patient get the expensive injections — human hemin — through their CSR initiatives,” he added.
 
 “Looking at the progression of the disease in Aayesha, the prognosis, without any immediate treatment, is guarded (grave) in Ahmed’s case,” Oswal said. “He has a better chance of survival with immediate treatment — injection of human hemin. It is currently unavailable in India. The cost is approximately Rs 2 lakh for four shots,” he said. Ahmed had the first attack three months ago. “This month, he had two-attacks and his liver is damaged,” Oswal said.
 
 Aayesha too had complained of pain in abdomen along with nausea. She then developed weakness in lower limbs due to peripheral neuropathy. “Aayesha is terminally ill,” the doctor said.
