Mumbai:   Mukesh Ambani’s announcement, that his telecom venture   will offer free 4G-enabled handsets to customers and also cut   for some of its plans, hit telecom stocks hard in Friday’s relatively rising trading session.  , the largest competitor for Jio, lost 2.1% on the   to Rs 411, while  , which is in the midst of a merger with global telecom major Vodafone’s India operations, closed 3.1% lower at Rs 92.

 Along with pure telecom services players,   also witnessed selling pressure as market players feel that Jio’s aggressive data plans could push customers towards consuming more video content on hand-held devices rather than on televisions. Dish TV was down nearly 6% while   was down 2.6%, even as GTPL Hathway lost 2.3% and   closed 2.7% lower.
 
 Over the last 10 months, since Jio announced its commercial launch in September 2016, telecom stocks have been witnessing heavy selling on each of the days that the new telco announced something new — either a service offering, a new tariff plan or a hardware — at extremely competitive prices (see table).
 
 In a note to clients, foreign broking firm UBS said that Jio’s new phone should support mass-market adoption of   data, but prices are not ARPU-dilutive. ARPU stands for average revenue per user. “We expect Jio to thus continue to gain share from smaller operators as the sector consolidates,” it said. 
 
 UBS analysts, however, believe Bharti Airtel — the current market leader with its ahead-of-the-curve investments and strong spectrum profile — is well positioned to gain from the expansion in data market.
