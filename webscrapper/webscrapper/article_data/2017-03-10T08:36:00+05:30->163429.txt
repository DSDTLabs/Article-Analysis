MUMBAI: BMC on Thursday took possession of a 5,000 sq metre plot in Mulund (E) given to   for maintenance. This came after it found that the plot was being used contrary to the terms and conditions for which it was given. 

 BMC in 1999 had given 5,000 sq metres of the 26,213 sq metres   to the gymkhana to promote sporting activities under certain terms and conditions. The plot has a playground reservation but the civic authorities recently found several violations. The issue was tabled before municipal commissioner Ajoy Mehta by the local T ward office, suggesting the plot be taken back and agreement cancelled. 
 
 A civic official said, “We found that the public were being restricted from using the plot. In fact, a wedding function was held on the plot, followed by another function by gymkhana members. We also found that the excise department had raided the spot and found liquor, which was against our terms. A show-cause notice was served to the gymkhana, which submitted a reply to BMC, but we found it unsatisfactory.”
 
 BMC’s T ward on Thursday morning placed its guards around. A municipal chowky has also been put up along with gardeners to maintain the ground. “A wall that was built was demolished. At both entry points, we have put up boards stating that the plot now belongs to BMC so that no one can claim authority over it. The plot will now be open to the public, free of cost,” the official added.
