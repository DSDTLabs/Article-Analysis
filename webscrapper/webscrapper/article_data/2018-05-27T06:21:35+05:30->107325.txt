KOLKATA: No E.coli or salmonella was detected in samples of vegetarian and non-vegetarian breakfasts seized on Wednesday from the kitchen of Doon’s Caterers, the agency engaged to supply food on board the Puri-Howrah   Express. Nearly 20 chair-car passengers fell ill allegedly after having breakfast served on the train. Of them, 14 had to be admitted to the railway hospital in  .

 
 
 The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) Ltd immediately swung into action and seized samples, both from the train as well as the kitchen of the caterer in Puri. All samples were sent for tests and a show-cause notice was also served on the caterer pending inquiry.
 
 “We have received one test report and it states there was nothing wrong with the omelettes or the bread. These two items were blamed by the affected passengers. From the start, we had doubts as 470 non-vegetarian breakfasts were served to passengers and apart from the 20-odd people, nobody complained. However, we will carry on with our probe. We want people to have full faith in the organisation,” said  , IRCTC group general manager, east.
 
 The   carried out its own probe and came to know that the affected passengers were part of two groups. It was revealed that eight of those admitted to the Kharagpur hospital had a late-night dinner on Tuesday and woke up at 3.30am to catch the train. Some of the others went to bed late.
