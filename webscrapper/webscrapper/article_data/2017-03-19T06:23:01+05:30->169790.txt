MUMBAI: Even as the   board examinations draw to an end later this month, the   has begun work on the revamped   process for   (FYJC), first since 2009. A new software agency has undertaken the revamp of the website.

 Following objections from parents and activists, the school education department had announced changes to the online admission process and called for fresh tenders to appoint an agency to handle the system. “The tendering process is complete and an agency from Noida has been selected. It is the first time since 2009 that the agency has changed.We have to start from scratch to develop a new portal, database and forms. The first leg of the process, which is college registration has already begun in phases,“ said BB Chavan, deputy director of education, Mumbai. Since 2009, the admission portal was handled by Maharashtra Knowledge Corpora tion Limited (MKCL).
 
 With the complete system getting an overhaul, the admission process is likely to have a delayed start this year. “Work is already under way, but applications for students are likely to be opened only around the second week of May. More changes may be needed and they are expected to be announced soon,“ said an official. The admission process, which was delayed last year too, was marred with several glitches. The department had to conduct over 10 rounds of online admissions, which went up to the end of September.
 
 Under the new process, students will be able to select only one stream and can opt for a maximum of 10 colleges, instead of 50 in the city; students will no longer have the option of provisional admissions and admissions to higher secondary vocational course and quota seats--religious or linguistic minority, in-house and management--too will be done online.
