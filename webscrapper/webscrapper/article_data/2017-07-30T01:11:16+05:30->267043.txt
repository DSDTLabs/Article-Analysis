Tirupur: Drought-hit villagers of   here on Saturday staged a   against a private petrol station owner for allegedly selling water to a factory from a   set up in his facility.

 The local residents alleged that the petrol station owner had been selling water to a factory run by his relative for many years from the borewell he set up at Chinniyagoundampalayam in Palladam.
 
 “Other bore wells and agricultural wells in the region have gone bone dry. When we don’t have water even for potable purpose it pains us to see him selling water to a factory,” said P Krishnan, a villager, who took part in the stir.
 
 “Many crops and coconut trees have dried up in Chinniyagoundapalayam and Minnagar areas because of the drought. But the petrol station owner had been utilising the ground water source for the commercial purpose without any license. We had requested him not to exploit the water source, but in vain,” he added.
 
 More than 50 villagers, including farmers, staged the protest in front of the petrol station on Palladam-Chettipalayam Road. When alerted, revenue and officials reached the spot and tried to pacify the crowd. The protesters later petitioned Palladam tahsildar and urged him to take strict action against the petrol station owner.
