PALAKKAD: BJP leader  , MP, alleged here on Sunday that AIADMK general secretary   was ruling   through remote control using digital technology from the Karnataka jail where she is lodged along with some of her relatives in a corruption case.

 Releasing the biography of veteran BJP leader O Rajagopal, MLA, Swamy said “we cannot prevent the transfer of Sasikala from Karnataka to a jail in Tamil Nadu as such transfers are allowed.”
 
 On the Ayodhya Ram temple issue he said that “the matter can now be settled only through a court verdict as Muslim organizations are not ready for a compromise. Our stand is that since the disputed land is the birth place of Shree Ram, a temple should be allowed there and a mosque can be constructed across the river Sarayu. The mosques can be constructed anywhere as they are only places to pray and in countries like Saudi Arabia they are shifted from one place to another.”
 
 The meeting was presided over by Justice Chettur Sankaran Nair. Rajagopal and former BJP state president   were among those present. tnn
