 SDMC commissioner Puneet Goel said that since May 11, the civic body had issued 11,000 such challans and recovered Rs 26 lakh under the same category. 
 
 As per the bylaws, Rs 10,000 will be imposed as fine for failing to segregate the waste in case of an event organised for than 100 people, Rs 5,000 for burning waste and Rs 500 for littering. Failure to dispose of construction and demolition waste will attract a fine of up to Rs 5,000.

 Unlike the traditional paper challan, which itself adds to the litter, SDMC’s digital tool now enables officials to capture the GPS location and real-time photographs of the offence, said the SDMC commissioner. 
 
 “The challan is then issued digitally to the defaulter and the receipt of payment is also generated,” he added. 
 
 While 4,505 challans were issued in the central zone of the corporation, 4,395 challans were generated in the south zone. In the west zone, 1,601 challans were issued and 494 in the Najafgarh zone. 
 
 The north and east corporations are also working to start a similar challan system, said a source.
