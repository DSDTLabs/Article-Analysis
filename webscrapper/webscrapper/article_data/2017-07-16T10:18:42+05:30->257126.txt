LUCKNOW: The month of July, 160 years ago, Awadh saw the coronation of Birjis Qadr, the son of King Wajid Ali Shah and   at the   in Lucknow, after a fierce battle with the British at Chinhat where Hindus and Muslims, farmers and Taluqdars, all fought together to ouster the British from India.

 It was the very same day on July 5, 1857, that revolutionaries had hailed young Birjis Qadr, 14 years of age then, as 'Ee hai hamaar Kanhaiya'(He is our Krishna). To relive the very feel of revolution, of brotherhood and secularism and to celebrate the importance of the day, Lucknow is holding the first ever ' ' on Sunday afternoon in memory of the events leading to the day, the first war of independence and the day itself.
 
 And to bring back the day into discussion, the Lal Baradari will once again be echoing with the ideas of the revolution through a painting exhibition on the events, a discussion on 1857: Heritage of Lucknowi/ Awadhi Secular Culture (feminism, republicanism, music, art and tolerance) and a dance performance by Delhi based artists Neelakshi Rai. "It is not just important to relive our own legacy to independence but the events in essence not only unified Indians but also saw the initiation of a democratic process,"said Amaresh Mishra, historian and president of the   that is organising the event with State Lalit Kala Academy.
 
 "It is our shared sacrifice and our shared heritage that we now need to not just save together but also take forward together," added Deepak Kabir, another member of the Forum.
