THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:  , who is facing a revolt within his party over the tie up with the CPM in the Kottayam district panchayat, went on the defensive on Thursday and said that decision taken by the party's district leadership was “most unfortunate“.

 He said the decision was taken without his knowledge. However he termed the decision as a fall out of the insult received from the Congress.
 
 Mani chose to convene a press conference to stress his innocence under pressure from the warring faction within his party led by P J Joseph. It is learnt that at least three MLAs, including  , had decided to drift away from Mani and stay with the  . Hence, Mani had no other option but to open ly flay the decision taken by the “local leadership“.
 
 Earlier in the morning, Joseph had told reporters in Thodupuzha that the plan to get CMP help was not discussed at any party forum and termed the development “very unfortunate“. Following this, Mani assured that the party state committee would look into the issue.
 
 Mani, while trying to appease his party rank and file through the press conference, howe ver, chose to attack the Congress leadership in Kottayam. He said that the   has insulted the   many times and the latest development was a fallout of that.
 
 “The decision to align with the CPM was taken at the local level. The party has not even thought of having any kind of such alliance in the long run.The party has always wanted to be part of the UDF,“ said Mani.
 
 If the Congress is not ready to accept the Kerala Congress then we will also decide not to have any kind of tie up. It is better not to resort to provocation through words, said Mani.
 
 On the questions that the LDF has always been attacking him ever since the bar bribery scam broke out, Mani said, “it does not mean that CPM will remain untouchable forever“.
 
 He also tried to justify the alliance with the LDF by claiming that even the Congress has tied up with the Left parties in the past.
