ONGOLE: Police on Saturday stumbled upon a huge arms dump of Maoists   in   in Prakasam district strengthening their fears that the left wing extremists were   in the state. 

 This seizure comes close on the heels of similar recovery in   less than a week ago. Armed reserve SI YSRK Prasad along with a special party team, who was combing the forest for the last one week, found electrical wires popping out of the ground at Tekulapenta near Palutla in the Nallamala forest. Upon digging, they came across a big dump containing three double barrel guns, 31 rounds of ammunition for .303 rifles, 79 rounds of ammunition for SLRs, 17 rounds of bullets for .500 rifles, two single-barrel guns, a charger and two double-trigger tapanchas.
 
 Superintendent of police Trivikram Varma, who displayed the arms and ammunition before the media, said the dump must have been lying buried there since 2003.
 
 Senior police officials said they suspect Maoists kept the dump to attack people's representatives. "The rebels are trying to recover lost ground in the Nallamala region. But we are maintaining constant vigil," a police official said. tnn
