NEW DELHI: Global food and beverages major   is aiming to ride on the distribution might of its largest bottler in India, Ravi Jaipuria-led Varun Beverages ( ), to take on rivals such as Dabur and   in the juices and sports drinks segment.

 Deepika Warrier, VP of PepsiCo India’s nutrition category, said VBL will sell and distribute the company’s premium brands such as Tropicana juices,   and Gatorade in North and East India, which account for 80% of the overall juice market in the country.
 
 When asked whether VBL will manufacture these products in future, a Pepsi-Co spokesperson said, “For now, it’s just a distribution agreement.”
 
 VBL is one of the largest bottlers of PepsiCo in the world and makes carbonated soft drinks, including   and 7UP, for the company in North and East India, as well as for several overseas markets, including  . In the southern and western regions of the country, PepsiCo makes and sells its products through company-owned units.
 
 “The urban and rural markets are growing faster than metros for juices,” a PepsiCo spokesperson said. “In the North and East, we could only serve 90,000 outlets. The agreement with VBL will double our distribution reach.”
 
 India’s fledgling juice market, which is pegged at around Rs 2,000 crore, has been growing fast due to consumers shifting to healthier beverages and established players, including Dabur and ITC, upping their ante with new products. In comparison, the Rs 14,000-crore soft drinks market has remained stagnant.
 
 Other than handling bottling operations for PepsiCo, RJ Corp, parent of VBL, has a gamut of interests in sectors such as food, education and real estate. It also runs franchise operations for fast-food chains such as Pizza Hut and Costa Coffee.
