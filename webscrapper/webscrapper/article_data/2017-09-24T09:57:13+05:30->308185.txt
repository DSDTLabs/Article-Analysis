AHMEDABAD: Protests were staged outside the   office in   where BJP leaders had gathered to guage candidates for assembly seats in Ahmedabad (rural). A large number of people, purportedly BJP workers, gathered at the place raising slogans that Babu Jamna Patel three-time sitting MLA from Daskroi, should not be given ticket to contest polls from   in the forthcoming 2017 elections.

 People carrying placards of “Daskroi will vote for BJP if candidature given to a local”, “Remove Babu Jamna, save Daskroi” thronged the APMC office where senior leaders had arrived to guage sentiments about candidates for four assembly seats in Ahmedabad rural.
 
 Sources said that the protest was mobilized by three detractors of Patel who have underlined that either one of them, or someone else, but Patel, be given ticket. 
 
 I K Jadeja, vice-president of state BJP and observer for Ahmedabad rural seats dismissed the large scale protest as an ‘internal issue’ which was resolved. When contacted, Patel told TOI that the protest was no public outrage but planned demonstration against him by his detractors in APMC who are unhappy with him for opposing irregularities they commit.
 
 “I have been elected three times MLA with an increase in victory margin in every election. My vote bank in Daskroi will vouch for my work. I am a strong contender to be fielded from Daskroi. The protest was not public outrage, but was planned by Janak Thakkar, Ketan Patel and Mohan Bharwad,” said Patel
