Rajkot:   

 The deceased, identified as Shibaten Shamshad Shaikh, was playing near his house in Rasulpara when he got crushed under the wheels of garbage collection van that was coming in reverse. The frightened driver fled the spot leaving the vehicle, police said. Angry locals ransacked the garbage van, deflated its tires and broke the doors and glass on the vehicle.
 
 People also sat in the middle of the road blocking the Gondal Highway for nearly an hour. When police tried to remove them forcefully there was a minor scuffle after which people moved away from the road.
 
 As news of the accident spread a huge crowd gathered at the spot. Some Congress leaders including leader of the opposition in the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) Varma Sagathiya rushed to Rasulpara and started shouting slogans against civic body officials. Family members and other Congress workers demanded that the RMC commissioner visit the family of the deceased boy in Rasulpara and apologize.
 
 However, when the commissioner did not come, family members and other Congress members took the body of the Shaikh to the RMC office on Dhebar Road about 16km from the place where the accident took place.
 
 Meanwhile, as a precaution, RMC officials called the police when they came to know that people from Rasulpara were coming there. The entire premises of RMC was cordoned off by police and nobody was allowed to enter the compound.
 
 There was altercation between people, civic body staff and police. Later, Rajkot mayor announced compensation of Rs 2.5 lakh for the family of the deceased. Only after this did the family members take the body of Shaikh for postmortem at the civil hospital.
