A film’s   can make or break its fate at the box office, and looks like Sam Anton’s well aware of it. The director shot the climax of  , which stars   (in his first cop role) and  , in the city a couple of months ago, and tells us that this sequence will be one of the highlights in the cop thriller.

 Sam says, “I can safely say that the chase and climax will be one of its kind in the industry. We shot the entire sequence for nine days. In the first four days, we had sought permission to shoot on the highway near Red Hills. It’s a chase scene and required a lot of effort from the entire crew. And on the last five days, we had erected a set in one of the mills in the city. The highlight of the climax sequence is that it will have a smoke effect, and it was quite challenging to get that right. We had to cover a whole outdoor space; so, we had 10 smoke machines covering the entire space, and had to resort to other tricks as well, to build up that intensity. All that smoke made it hard for us to work, but we are happy the audience will have a new experience watching it.”
 
 Even as the film’s nearing post-production stage, we hear the team has decided to make this a franchise of sorts. “100 is the first movie that revolves around the police control room. While the story is not inspired by just one incident, it has been based on several crimes that took place in the country. This film has been set in Chennai, and we are planning to make Madurai or Coimbatore the backdrop for our next film,” informs the director.
