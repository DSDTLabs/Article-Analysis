NEW DELHI: VHP and   are planning programmes to mark the birth anniversary of B R   as the Sangh Parivar looks to prove its "pro-Dalit" credentials in the face of a concerted opposition attack that the government was slack in countering a Supreme Court order diluting" the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. 

  While the BJP top brass has repeatedly rebutted the charge and said it is committed to preserving quotas for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and has in fact strengthened laws to protect the SC/ST community, the effort is being complemented by outfits seen as foot soldiers of the Sangh. 
 
  The Delhi unit of VHP and Bajrang Dal on Sunday organised a motorbike rally as part of the forthcoming events and the former said the intent is to unify the Hindu community against the divisive politics of caste-based parties. 
 
  "There are elements trying to divide the Hindu society. But we are determined to counter such elements," said VHP's international general secretary Milind Parande. He said Baba Saheb had launched campaign against untouchability and caste hierarchy. "We highlighted how Ambedkar had fought against caste discrimination," the VHP office-bearer said. 
 
  Ever since the controversy over the SC order doing away with mandatory arrest for offences under the SC/ST Act, the saffron family has been on an overdrive to reassure the Dalit community that Sangh-related organisations are continuously striving to end discrimination in Hindu society.
