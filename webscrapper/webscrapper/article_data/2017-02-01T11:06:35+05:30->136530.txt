BHOPAL: A day after TOI published a report on ostracization of members of a reserved community in a village close to Bhopal, the   ( ) took its cognizance on Tuesday and directed district collector and deputy inspector general of police to submit a report in this regard within a fortnight.

 The MPHRC has asked the district administration why no action has been taken in this regard yet. The TOI report, ‘Lower caste on razor wire, govt sees no evil’, highlighted how more than 325 members of a reserved community in Naisamand village, barely 70km from the state capital, have been banned from getting a haircut at local barber shops or stepping into a hotel or even a tea stall for over a year. “We are told that we belong to a lower caste and are not ‘eligible’ to use the same razor and chair used by upper caste people,” said Lal Singh Ahirwar, a resident of the village in Berasia tehsil of Bhopal district. Lower caste people in around 12 nearby villages are kept out of hotels as well because upper caste villagers are reluctant to use the same chairs and cups.
 
 Naisamand has a population of around 1,800, comprising Brahmin, Baniya, Rajput, Yadav, Gurjar and Ahirwar communities. The victims of discrimination tried to lodge a complaint at Nazeerabad police station, but were turned down, they rued. Subsequently, they filed a complaint on the CM helpline in December 2015. It took almost a year to get a response. “It all began in November 2015 when a few Ahirwar boys were denied a haircut by a local barber because of their caste. Abuses were hurled at them and they were told to leave the shop, following which the boys filed complaint on the CM helpline,” said Jagannath Ahirwar, a local.
