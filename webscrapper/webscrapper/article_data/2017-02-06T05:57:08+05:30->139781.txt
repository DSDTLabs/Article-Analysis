THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The district collector is learnt to have submitted a report on the   land to principal secretary (revenue) P  , saying that the academy has so far utilized only 1.5 acres of the 11.49 acres granted to it in 1984. The report will be handed over to revenue minister   after verification. 

 The report -- prepared by the deputy collector (land reforms), Thiruvananthapuram tahasildar and taluk surveyor - is also learnt to have noted that the academy operates a restaurant on the campus while a portion of the same building has been rented out to a bank. It also notes that the academy has also residential quarters, which are being used as guest houses.
 
 Sources in revenue department said the revenue secretary -- who was out of station - would examine the report on Monday and was likely to visit the academy campus. They also said the findings in the report could be cited as violations of conditions in the order -- dated July 5, 1984 assigning the land -- and the government could take the land back.
