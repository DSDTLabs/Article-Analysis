PATNA: More than 24 hours have passed since a drone was spotted hovering over the   just before the arrival of CM Nitish Kumar, but the police are still groping in the dark. 

 The drone was spotted hovering over the gurdwara on Sunday, much to the surprise of many. The police, however, had no inkling about it. Sources said no FIR has been lodged in connection with the case despite severe breach of security.
 
 This was the second incident of a drone flying over the city sky without permission. On December 26, a drone was spotted hovering over Gandhi Maidan.
 
 Patna district magistrate Sanjay Kumar Agarwal had earlier said the administration had not given permission to anyone to fly drone.
 
 Patna SSP   on Monday said no one has so far been arrested yet by the police for the breach of security. “We are looking into it,” he added.
 
 Patna City DSP Hari Mohan Shukla said he has no information about the drone incident. Sources said the state police has no strategy to deal with drone.
 
 According to sources, three persons from Kankarbagh, Lohanipur and Gardanibagh supply drones fitted with camera for shooting events, but it is yet not clear if the organisers are using their own drones for the mega event.
