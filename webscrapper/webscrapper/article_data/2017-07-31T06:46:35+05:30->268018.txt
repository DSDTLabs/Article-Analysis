HYDERABAD: The   has stripped elected representatives, including ministers, of power to grant approval for   LPG connections to beneficiaries. 

 Now, officials don't need permission from sarpanches in villages, municipal councillors in towns and ministers at the district level to extend subsidised Deepam LPG connections to those still using kerosene stoves.
 
 The decision to keep public representatives out of the scheme was taken after chief minister   expressed unhappiness over the delay in making Telangana a   state, sources said.
 
 Civil supplies commissioner   confirmed to TOI that the existing system of conducting gram sabhas and obtaining signatures of sarpanches and councillors has been dispensed with. "This has been done to simplify the system of allocation, identification and grounding of Deepam connections. Even approvals from the minster in charge of the district or minister in charge of the district review committee have been dispensed with," he said. 
 
 Other amendments to the existing rules include giving powers to tahsildars to select beneficiaries to speed up the target of achieving 100% LPG connections, Anand said.
 
 With this, officials said, the target of making Telangana a kerosene free-state is expected to be achieved sooner than later. Enquiries revealed that the government needs to extend subsidised LPG connection to about 20 lakh families to reach saturation point. 
 
 The target is to first make Greater Hyderabad kerosene-free, followed by all the districts in the state. Delhi and Chandigarh have already been declared kerosene-free cities. 
 
 In Greater Hyderabad alone, there are about one lakh families who still use kerosene supplied to them on subsidy by the government. "A survey has been taken up to weed out beneficiaries who already have LPG connections but have not declared them and are still availing the subsidy kerosene," an official said.
