Vadodara: Those using public toilets in the city will soon be able to rate their quality through devices installed there. The civic body will be putting up public feedback devices at public as well as community toilets in the city, a decision that was taken under the Swachh Bharat Mission. 

 A public sector company ITI Ltd has been selected by the union urban development for procurement of the devices. VMC officials said that those using public toilets can use the devices on their way out and give the feedback. “The device is a simple one and has three buttons. The user can press one of the three button to give his feedback,” said VMC environment engineer Kashyap Shah.
 
 The device will have a red button to indicate that the experience was bad, yellow for average and green for good. The devices have been linked to the Swachh Bharat Mission website. All data generated by these machines will be integrated on the website from different locations across India.
 
 The civic body has come up with a proposal to install the device at all 70 public toilets and five community toilets in the city. The civic body will be spending Rs 945 per device every month. In all, Rs 8,50,500 will be spent on the system every year. The proposal has sought a nod for three years at a cost of Rs 25,51,500. The standing committee of the civic body will take up the proposal for discussion later this week.
