HYDERABAD:   Revanth Reddy on Monday said that the third front announced by KCR is a part of Modi-led BJP’s game plan to divide “anti-Modi and anti-BJP” vote bank in the country.

 “The proposed third front is aimed at checking TDP supremo and AP CM Chandrababu Naidu from forming a BJP-less third front and inflicting a political blow on Congress at the national level. KCR has become a tool in the hands of RSS and his entry into the national political arena is to ensure that Modi forms the government at the Centre after 2018-19 polls,” Revanth Reddy told reporters here.
 
 
 Revanth claimed that KCR had gone to Delhi on the pretext of an eye surgery but actually met the powers that be at the Centre and this third front plan worked out. “KCR also attended to the questioning by the CBI in cases pertaining to   and ESI Hospitals’ scams,” he claimed.
 
 
 Stating that Modi was informed by Intel agencies about Naidu being open to an alliance with Congress, Revanth said that Modi and RSS came out with a plan to check Naidu. Revanth also alleged that the second crucial angle to the entire drama was internal squabbling in the KCR family. “KTR wants to be the CM and is exerting pressure on KCR,” he said.
 
 
 Meanwhile, senior Congress leader   said there are three cases related to KCR into which CBI is looking into. These should be sorted out first, he said. “It is clearly an understanding with BJP so that the anti-BJP votes can be divided. It is not surprising that   was the first one to welcome this move.”
