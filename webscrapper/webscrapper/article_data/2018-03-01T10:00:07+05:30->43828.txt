When a lanky dhoticlad Sankaranarayanan walked into the Kanchi mutt at the age of 14, devotees jostled to get a glimpse of the boy.

 
 The next day, May 29, 1983, he was initiated into sanyas and given the title Sri Sankara   Saraswathi (in pic), the 70th pedathipathi of the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham. Now 48, Vijayendra Saraswathi will succeed Jayendra and preside over the affairs of the mutt. “Jayendraswami had told devotees at the janmastalam (birthplace) of   (the 68th pontiff) that a young boy would be anointed his successor. But his name and whereabouts were kept a secret,” said S  , a devotee who was at the event. With a stick in hand, the young boy posed self-consciously for pictures until late in the night.
 
 After the demise of the Kanchi seer  , he will take the reins of the 2,500-year-old religious institution. He’s had practice before — when his predecessor disappeared from the mutt for three days in August 1987, it was Vijayendra who took over the daily rituals and administration.
 
 One of these is the puja for the deities, Chandramouleshwara and Tirupurasundari, which is done by the pontiffs. “In the last 2,500 years, there hasn’t been a day when this ritual was missed,” said Valasai Jayaraman, a devotee. “It happened on Wednesday before   breathed his last. It will happen tomorrow after he is laid to rest.”
 
 Born to vedic scholar Krishnamurthy Sharma and homemaker Ambalakshmi on March 13, 1969 in Thandalam in Tiruvallur, Sanakaranarayan attended school and learned Sanskrit. After completing Class VI, he joined a vedic course in  . He soon impressed the senior pontiffs and became a ‘bala periyava’ (young pontiff).
 
 His test will come after Jayendra Saraswathi’s funeral. Vijayendra will not only have to take care of daily administration but also hold the mutt administrators together.
