CHENNAI: Sending out a veiled message to  , Tamil Nadu deputy chief minister and finance minister O  , while presenting his eighth budget in the assembly on Thursday, praised the successive Dravidian governments since 1967, including the DMK regimes, for contributing immensely to the development of the state.

 
 The contribution of   founder M G Ramachandran and former chief minister  , in taking the state forward in industrial development, came in for special mention. 
 
 The leader did not specifically mention DMK by name. Panneerselvamâ€™s praise is being seen as a rebuff aimed at BJP and its leaders, who have been claiming that the state will soon see the end of the Dravidian era.
 
 The deputy CM was careful to point out that AIADMK ruled the state for the maximum number of years since 1967 and it was only during the regimes of MGR and Jayalalithaa, the state saw maximum progress. The   reign ended in 1967 with DMK led by C N Annadurai winning the poll.
