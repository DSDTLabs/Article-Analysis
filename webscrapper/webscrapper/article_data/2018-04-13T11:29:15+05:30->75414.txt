CHARMINAR: In a heartwarming gesture, animal welfare organisation People for Animals ( ) teamed up with the fire department to rescue a Black Kite, a medium-sized bird of prey that had got entangled in Chinese manja, from a tree near   at Nampally on Wednesday.

 PFA representative   told TOI that their rescue team had received a complaint about a bird that was desperately fighting for its life as it hung from a tree by a sharp string used to fly kites.
 
 “When we rushed to the spot, we realized the bird was badly injured and was out of our reach. So, we immediately called up the fire department, whose staffers arrived in less than 15 minutes and rescued the bird,”   said.
 
 However, one of the bird’s wings, which got cut by the manja, will have to be amputated. “We rushed the bird to the PFA shelter at   for first aid and further treatment but the injury is so severe that we will have to amputate the wing,” Anirudh said.
 
 According to PFA officials, it becomes difficult to save most of the birds injured by manja as the injuries are serious. “We try our best to save lives but most animals and birds that get entangled in manja every year are maimed for life. The birds nursed back to life are forced to stay in cages for the rest of their lives,” Dattatreya Joshi, Executive Officer, PFA said.
