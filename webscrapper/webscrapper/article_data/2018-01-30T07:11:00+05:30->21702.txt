GURUGRAM: Pollution levels in the city shot up by around 52% as moisture content in the air rose and wind speed fell on Saturday but Met officials forecast a western disturbance that may clean up the air to some extent over the next couple of days.

 The highest level of PM2.5 was recorded at 137 microgram per cubic metre in the day when a thick blanket of   engulfed the city, up from 90 microgram per cubic metre on Friday. Similarly, the air quality index (AQI) rose to 265 (considered ‘poor’) from 212 on Friday.
 
 “The increase in moisture, especially during the morning hours owing to fog, is not allowing the particulate matters to disperse, resulting in the poor air. Also, due to low wind speed, pollutants remained in the lower level of atmosphere,” said an official at   ( ).
 
 HSPCB officials further claimed that the concentration of PM2.5 remained below 100 microgram per cubic metre through this week with Thursday recording the lowest level of particulate matter at 74 microgram per cubic metre. Despite Saturday’s rise, they claimed, Gurugram was still the least polluted in the entire National Capital Region.
 
 Met officials said the temperatures remained more or less the same through this week. On Saturday, the maximum temperature was 22 degrees Celsius while the minimum temperature was 8 degrees Celsius.
 
 They added though the average minimum temperature might hover around 8-degree mark, the average maximum temperature was expected to go up slightly to 23 degrees Celsius or above in the next two-three days.
 
 “Even if there is a slight rise in the temperature due to a western disturbance, it is expected to make the situation better. The rise in temperature will help reduce fog, which in turn, will allow pollutants to get dispersed,” said a Met official. “Also, the wind speed is likely to improve that will help reduce the pollution. But rain is not expected in the next few days,” he added.
