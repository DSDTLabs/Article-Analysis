BATHINDA: Reacting to the statement of chief minister  , employees of Guru Nanak Dev Thermal plant (GNDTP) pointed at the   manifesto released in the run up to the 2017 state assembly election. The manifesto had promised to keep the power plant running, they said.

 A few days back, finance minister   too had said that there was no plan to reverse the decision to shut down the plant.
 
 Upset over the CM's remark, the employees announced to further intensify the protest. They also met Union food processing industry minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Gobind singh  , seeking political and religious support against the Congress government's move.
 
  activist Gursewak singh said that the CM had shown its anti-Punjab and anti-employee face. "The Congress had made promise in poll manifesto to keep the thermal plant running but now has gone back on its word. We will not tolerate it and will further intensify the protest," he added.
 
 The employees on Sunday met Union minister Harsimrat Badal at Takhat Damdama Sahib, Talwandi Sabo, to seek support of Shiromani Akali Dal. "We also met SGPC president Longowal to get religious support as the thermal is named after Guru Nanak Dev. Both assured us complete support," he added.
 
 Meanwhile, the contractual employees continued their round-the-clock protest for 21st consecutive day. Contractual Employees Coordination Committee convener Rajinder Singh said, "Amarinder Singh should have also looked into the interests of the state and the employees while making claim about shutting down the plant."
 
 The state government though had held negotiations with the employees but on the other hand had announced not to review the decision which clearly showed its double face, he said.
