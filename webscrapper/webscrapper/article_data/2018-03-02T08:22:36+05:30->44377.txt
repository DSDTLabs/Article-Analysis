NEW DELHI: Today's colourful   marks the spring festival of   that is being celebrated across India and especially in northern India. 

 
 
 Google's doodle today depicts men and women beating drums, wearing bright-hued, colour-splashed clothes, and throwing coloured Holi powder.
 
 Holi, the ' ', also celebrates the victory of good over evil.
 
 On this day, the mythological 'Holika' is said to have died. She was the sister of a king named Hiranyakashipu who set out to kill his nephew Prahlad.   - said to be immune to fire - sat in a burning pyre with Prahlad, and such was the latter's devotion to the Lord Vishnu that he emerged unscathed and Holika died. Thus, the victory of good over evil.
 
 Holi is generally celebrated across two days. The first day is marked by 'Holika Dahan' where people light bonfires to "burn evil", and gather around to offer their prayers.
 
 On the second day, people throw colour at each other, to mark the end of the dreary, grey winter and the coming of a bright spring.
