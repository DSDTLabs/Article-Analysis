Aamir Khan's Christmas release 'Dangal,' which also stars Fatima Sana Sheikh, Sanya Malhotra and Sakshi Tanwar in lead roles, continued its miraculous run at the box-office in the second weekend. The sports drama, co-written and directed by Nitesh Tiwari, earned a whopping Rs 72.93 crore over the weekend to take the 10-day total to an astounding figure of Rs 270.47 crore. 

 
 
 'Dangal,' which tells the story of Indian wrestler and coach Mahavir Singh Phogat and how he trained his daughters Geeta and Babita Phogat to become world-class wrestlers, has maintained its stupendous performance in circuits like East Punjab, Mysore,   and Kerala. 'Dangal' is so far the second biggest hit of the year lagging behind Salman Khan-starrer 'Sultan,' which collected Rs 300.45 crore at the domestic box-office. But with performance like this, it's probable that 'Dangal' may soon dethrone 'Sultan' and emerge the biggest hit of the year.
