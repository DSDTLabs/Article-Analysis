NEW DELHI: Delhi BJP president Manoj   met lieutenant governor   on Friday to thank him for taking cognisance of the urgency of completing the   signal-free project and the Signature Bridge. 

 Tiwari, who started an indefinite hunger strike on Thursday demanding completion of the projects sanctioned by the Delhi government, ended the fast around the midnight after an assurance from Baijal. “The LG has removed the obstructions in the completion of development projects and the hindrances in completing the Shastri Park signal-free project and the Signature Bridge. Now there is no scope for the Delhi government to mislead the people,” Tiwari said.
 
 Slamming the Delhi government for obstructing the development works, Tiwari said that though the government was meant for solving problems, the Kejriwal government itself was a problem for Delhi. “The government had sufficient funds for completing these projects but there was lack of honest efforts. And the Kejriwal government continued to mislead the people on the excuse of lack of funds,” he said.
