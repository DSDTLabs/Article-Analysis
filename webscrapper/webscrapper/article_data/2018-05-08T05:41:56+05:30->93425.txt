NEW DELHI: An eight-member delegation led by I&B minister   will represent India at the   Film Festival starting on Tuesday.

 Showcasing the “best” of Indian cinema, the delegation will take four Indian films to what is known as the world’s largest film market, National Award-winning films ‘Village Rockstars’ from  , ‘Bhayanakam’ from Kerala, ‘Nagar Kirtan’ from   and Jeseri film ‘Sinjar’ from Lakshadweep.
 
 While the official delegation will take the National Award winning films, two other films — Nandita Das’ ‘Manto’ and Rohena Gera's ‘Sir’ — will participate in separate competition sections in Cannes.
 
 The delegation will be the first since 2002-2003 when Sushma Swaraj was I&B minister. It will look at expanding India’s footprint in the co-production treaty market.
 
 Speaking to TOI, CBFC member Vani Tripathi Tikoo, who is part of the delegation said, “India is at the cusp of change. We want young filmmakers from India to use this as a platform to showcase their creativity. We will also have a comprehensive halfday session to develop film commissions across the world.”
 
 Other members include joint secretary (films) Ashok Parmar, joint secretary in the MEA Vinod Jacob, censor board chairman  , filmmakers Shaji Karun, Jahnu Barua and Bharat Bala and actor Parvathy. Tikoo said, “It is very sad that Indian cinema earlier had to get a stamp of approval at film festivals for it to gain credibility and acceptance in India. We want to change that. So, we are taking brand new, never-seen-before films to the world’s largest film market.”
