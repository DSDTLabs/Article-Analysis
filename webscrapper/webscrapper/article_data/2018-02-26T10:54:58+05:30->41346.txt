MYSURU: Reacting to chief minister Siddaramaiah’s recent statements wherein he had said that it was   and not   who had promoted him in politics, JD(S) state president   said, “There is no need to attach so much importance to the CM’s remarks. Karnataka knows who promoted  . He changes his colour to suit the situation. I won’t be surprised if he calls Rahul Ganhi his political mentor.”

 Kumaraswamy said that he would tour 138 assembly segments in the state from March 17. “I am happy with the response I have been getting from the people while on the state tour. The party is gathering feedback from various stakeholders on fielding candidates. It will be collated and the party will release second list of candidates after Ugadi festival,” he said. He said the people are looking at the regional party as they feel cheated by the national parties.
 
 The former CM, who is associated with Kannada film industry, condoled the death of Bollywood actor Sridevi saying she has fans across India. She was a versatile actor who won the hearts of the film buffs with her acting, he stated.
