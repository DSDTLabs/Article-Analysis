HYDERABAD: Taking his grand idea of a   forward and envisioning a bigger role for himself in national politics,   chief minister and TRS president   is flying down to Tamil Nadu on April 29 to meet DMK leader MK   in Chennai. In another move towards firming up the nascent front,   chief and former CM of Uttar Pradesh Akhilesh Yadav will come down to Hyderabad on May 2 for a meeting with  .

 In the next three months, KCR will practically cover the entire country to talk to satraps of all regional parties to cobble up the Federal Front and project it as a strong alternative to BJP and Congress. At the 17th plenary of TRS at Kompally here on Friday, KCR announced that a huge public meeting will be organised in the last week of October or first week of November wherein leaders of regional parties will take part.
 
 In his speech, KCR subtly avoided the issue of Congress being part of the new front. West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress president Mamata Banerjee, whom KCR had met in Kolkata some time ago, said the Congress cannot be kept away.
 
 KCR said the Federal Front idea would be taken forward in right earnest. “The front is about self-respect of the country. This is my warning to both BJP and the Congress. They have ruled for several decades but could not ensure the country’s progress. We will not tolerate such negligence,” KCR thundered.
 
 The TRS president said if he could develop Telangana in the last four years, he has it in him to come up with a plan for the development of the country. “The plans are implementable and will yield result in six to seven years,” he said.
