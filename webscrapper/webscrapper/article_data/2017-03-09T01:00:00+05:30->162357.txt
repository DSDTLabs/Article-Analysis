Your local train has halted for what seems like the umpteenth time at a signal and you're already late to work. The maid has called last minute to say she won't come in to clean or cook. A text message to your boss has gone the wrong way and he's hung up before you can explain. If you've already experienced one or all the above on a daily basis, broke into a sweat and felt the world is coming to an end, you're not alone. Blame it on the daily grind or the increasing demand to meet expectations on various levels, but more people are succumbing to   disorder (PD) than ever before. And this affects more women than men, say studies.

 
 Panic is an intense fear that arises out of any reason, which results in strong physical reactions. Reveals psychotherapist Sonera Jhaveri, "This starts with a sensation in the body — an accelerated heart rate, shortness of breath, anxiety-provoking thoughts, palpitations, vertigo and more. If you have all these together more than once, it's classified as a syndrome. Panic attacks are on the rise for people now as there is an underlying level of trauma and fear on how to deal with life everyday, which makes them feel out of control. There could be a lot more complex reasons to it — such as an incident in the past, like an accident. Attachment issues are another huge reason for it. Panic thus becomes a symptom of this trauma." Such an attack can also be frightening. "Panic is not just about a normal fear. It can range from making someone feel he or she is falling down or is having a heart attack," she explains.
 
 
 A panic attack can happen unannounced. Says   and cognitive therapist,  , "This is a sudden and overwhelming feeling of fear. One of my clients, a young woman, told me she was in the middle of a wedding when it happened. A panic attack kind of grips you and gives a feeling of a sense of impending doom. Primarily, the first time most people have one, they really think it is a heart attack as the heart is pounding, there could be a tugging in the chest, you may even have a drop in blood pressure and everything is spinning around — you are convinced you will die. I spoke to a man who had an airplane phobia. He was to fly to the US for his best friend's bachelor party. But just the invitation to it and the thought that he might have to attend gave him a panic attack. So, whenever a person gets the feeling that he or she will be exposed to his to her fear and knows he or she can't escape it, a panic attack is triggered. You know you will have to face something you can't handle," she says.
 
 Often, the reasons for such attacks are unfounded. Affirms Dr Batra, "Little reasons can make people anxious — for those who fear spiders, the very mention of a holiday in a rainforest can cause a panic attack as it triggers fears of insects and being bitten. Deciding to take up a new job on a higher floor can also cause one if a person is afraid of heights or elevators."
 
 
 Unlike general belief, panic and stress are both different. Under an anxiety attack a person may feel worried, nervous and angry. But a panic attack is often unprovoked and has more severe reactions. In the latter, the person may be seized with terror and even feel he or she is dying.
 
 
 City-based psychiatrist   shares valuable tips...
 
 - Tell yourself that your brain is just playing games with your mind.
 - Go for a brisk walk. Exercise reduces symptoms of anxiety.
 - Distract yourself by talking to a friend or listening to music.
 - Take slow, deep breaths and do a few 'micropranayams' too (these are short exercises and yoga sequences).
 - Get under a shower if you are at home. This can calm the body and mind.
 
 
 Most often, a panic attack is swept aside and mistaken to be just stress. Says 27-year-old advertising executive Rashmi Jha, "A month ago I worked non-stop and had to deal with difficult clients. I had started to develop palpitations and thought it was just due to fatigue. I later found out that I was having a panic attack." Says therapist Deepa Shah, "A panic attack can go largely unnoticed and have no proper diagnosis. People may also feel embarrassed to tell others about the their attack and suffer it out. But it's perfectly okay to come forward and seek help and one should."

 The importance of being serene and composed is so huge now, that's is being marketed, sold and snapped up as never before...
 
 
 An increasing number of hotels and cafes are devoting whole sections to 'calming menus'. These offer special brews like cold pressed juices, relaxing teas — like the smooth tasting white leaf needle tea as well as other dishes that are meant to bring on calm. Hot in demand are also several relaxation spa massage techniques that aim to reduce facial and muscular tension.
 
 
 
 Yes, holidays are meant to be about unwinding, but people often bring work into it. Bleisure (that combines business and leisure), anyone? The 'luggage' thus also includes a barrage of work calls and emails. Enter tranquil breaks that make you do a digital detox and have a strictly 'no itinerary policy' where you don't have to spin around on some fast-paced sightseeing and shopping agenda. Our suggestion? Head to a silent resort that bans all kind of talk and stress and thus, reduces any chance of panic. You indulge in meditation workshops and simply let the quiet take over!
 
 
 
 You might have posted this on social media a few times yourself or smiled at that 'Keep Calm And...' message on your friend's networking page. Probably the most used meme, the 'Keep Calm and Carry On' catchphrase, first appeared on a World War II-era British poster to boost soldier morale. It conveys the idea of staying calm and doing what you're doing, instead of reacting to any situation. And the messages do more than just make you feel relaxed; they're every bit humorous, too.
