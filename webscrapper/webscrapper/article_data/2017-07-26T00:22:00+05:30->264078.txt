Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Tuesday directed the police and officials of the Road Transport Authority to ensure that no 3-seater autos plied with more than three passengers and to take action against such autos by suspending or cancelling their permits. 

 The division bench headed by chief justice Indira Banerjee gave this direction on a petition filed by Madurai-based advocate P Balamurugan last year. When the petition came up for hearing on Tuesday, the petitioner’s side said that the government vide its order dated March 22, 2001 had introduced share auto which could carry five passengers excluding driver. It also fixed the ceiling limit of 50 permits for share autos in each district. 
 
 Contrary to this, the transport department has been permitting share autos indiscriminately causing hindrance to the public and also causing accidents. In Madurai city alone, 5,354 three-seater autos plied as share autos. 
 
 The police and officials attached to the Road Transport Authority who were supposed to take action on such autos allow their illegal plying by receiving Rs, 100 fine. Seeking to stop such autos, the petitioner sent a representation to the state’s transport secretary, Madurai district collector and regional transport officers in Madurai on January 23 last year. But, there was no action, the petitioner side said and prayed to restrain the transport department from permitting to ply three-seater autos as share autos. 
 
 The government side said that the authorities had taken action against the three-seater autos which violated the legal norms and collected about Rs 1.5 lakh as fine in Madurai’s norths south and central regions till February 2016 from the year 2014. Following this, the bench directed the government side to produce a report as to action taken till June this year and to take action against the violators by suspending or cancelling the auto permits.
