SURAT: A probationary police sub-inspector ( ) posted in   district was suspended by N K Amin, superintendent of police (SP), on Tuesday as part of disciplinary action against him. The suspended cop had detained a truck and registered an offence in   police station despite being not posted in the area and is currently on leave reserve. The cop is an accused in Thangadh dalit firing case, police sources informed.

 B C Solanki, PSI, who has not been given any regular posting, went to   railway crossing and stopped a truck following information that it was stolen. Solanki brought the truck to Vyara police station and later lodged a complaint too on May 14. The truck was laden with wheat when detained. 
 
 Meanwhile, an inquiry revealed that the truck was already seized by Surat city police in 2013 and returned to its owner. Solanki had been given false information by someone based on which he detained the truck.
 
 After the issue came to light, Amin ordered an inquiry against the cop and preliminary findings revealed that Solanki was not wearing his uniform and did not consult any senior officer. “The PSI is on leave reserve and was not supposed to detain the truck. He could have consulted some senior officer. It is a case of gross negligence and misconduct by the officer,” Amin said.
 
 Senior officers felt the PSI could have waited for some time before taking action. The inquiry will continue against the PSI and based on the final report, further action will be taken.
 
 Solanki is one of the accused in Thangadh firing case of 2012 in which three persons, including two teenagers, from the dalit community were shot dead by the police.
