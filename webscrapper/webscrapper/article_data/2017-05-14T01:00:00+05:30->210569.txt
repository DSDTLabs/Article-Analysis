Sandit Tiwari, who has featured in   shows like ' ', 'Me Aajji Aur Sahib' and ' ', tied the knot with his girlfriend  , a software professional, on May 8. The duo got engaged in a private ceremony in January. The actor says, “I fell in love with her, while we were working together in a corporate firm. After a six-year-long courtship, we decided to take our relationship to the next level.”

 Ask him why he kept his relationship status under wraps and Sandit replies, “I am not the one who goes and paints the town red. Although I am romantic, I cannot shout from the rooftops and proclaim that I am in a relationship. I am shy and prefer to keep my personal life private.”
 
 Since Sandit belongs to Chhattisgarh and Priyankona is a Bengali, the wedding was conducted according to the traditions of the two communities in Priyankona’s hometown, Guwahati. 
 
 Sandit wore the conventional Bengali topor (conical headgear) and as per the tradition he gave shakha pola (traditional Bengali bangle) to Priyankona. “Till now I have got married 13 times on screen, so the D-day of my life felt surreal,” he laughs.
