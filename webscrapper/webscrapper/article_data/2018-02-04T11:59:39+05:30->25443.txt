Sitting on a high-end cruiser bike and dressed in casuals,   rocked the biker-girl avatar while shooting for her upcoming film, in the city. The bylanes of   were filled with fans eager to catch a glimpse of the pretty lady who was shooting for her first Marathi film, Bucket List.

 The Marathi industry is producing some great films that are content-driven. I thought this was the right time to enter the industry. Moreover, Tejas’ vision was clear and the story of Bucket List fascinated me. It’s an eventful journey of a woman.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Yes! I had shot for   in Loni, which is on the outskirts of the city, but never in the city per se. I have a lot of memories of this city because my cousins live here and I used to visit them often. Memories of eating karwanda and awla with them still make me nostalgic. Also, since I have started shooting here, my team members are spoiling me with some of the best home-cooked food. Besan laddoos, modaks, puran-poli; I am having almost everything!
 
 
 Well, I converse in Marathi at home, but getting the intonations right was something that I was worried about. However, all my co-actors are established and have done a lot of work on stage. So I was in good hands. Many a time we tend to think in English, but thankfully my thought process happens in Marathi and that helped too.
