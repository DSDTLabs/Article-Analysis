Vehemently protesting the proposed plan of constructing a flyover over the   ( ) National Park, scores of concerned Hyderabadis, both young and old, gathered at the park recently with placards, banners and posters. The denizes pointed out that if constructed, the flyover will have disastrous effect on the biodiversity of the park, which houses 600 species of plants, 120 species of birds, and many endangered animals as well. Opining that that the government shouldn’t take away Hyderabad’s precious lung space and put the park’s ecology at jeopardy, the citizens demanded that their plea be heard. The flyover is a part of the Rs 4051 crore   ( ) announced by the state government a year ago.
