KOCHI: With the state tourism department promising to provide timber for renovating the   with the help from forest department, their   is likely to be restored. Due to the lack of availability of timber for the fishing nets, many had started using metal poles instead of the traditional wooden ones leading to lose of charm.

 Tourism minister   had earlier promised measures to allot timber for rebuilding the Chinese nets here.
 
 “The plans sound promising as they would be providing timber and not money. If the material is provied people have no choice but to use it for the intended purpose. If it’s given in cash, there is a chance that they might put a share of the money to use for other things,” said  , a fisher who works at a Chinese fishing net.
 
 The tourism stakeholders in the area are pleased by the development as thet consider the metal frame work of fishing nets as a blot on the landscape.
 
 “Tourists, especially foreigners, with interest in history are keen to visit the Chinese nets, but are disappointed when they see metallic ones instead of the old-style wooden ones which they are familiar with from photographs,” said a tour guide in the city.
 
 The   government had allotted Rs. 1.5 crore for renovation of the Chinese nets, but it never materialized.
 
 “When we were told that we would get over Rs 1 lakh for the repair and restoration of the nets, we did the maintenance works on our own. The cost came to around Rs 2-3 lakh. However, the promised money never came and we had to bear the loss. The fish catch through Chinese fishing nets is not as profitable as the other fishing techniques,” said Kennedy, owner of a Chinese net.
 
 He added that timber is costlier when bought privately, unlike when allotted by the government. The metal rods are the only option left for him if timber is not provided by the government by the time of next maintanance scheduled within two to three years.
