PATNA: RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s elder son   is likely to face trouble as the newly-formed NDA government has decided to probe afresh the alleged   scam at   during his tenure as environment and forest minister.
 
  A senior forest department official said the principle chief conservator of forests (PCCF) has submitted fresh files related to the purchase of soil to the department. “The files would now be submitted to the chief secretary for further action,” he said.
  
  Former leader of opposition and now deputy CM,  , on April 4, had alleged that soil excavated for construction of two basement floors of an upcoming mall near Saguna Mor was purchased by Patna zoo for Rs90 lakh without floating any tender. Modi claimed the two acre land of the mall belonged to Delight Marketing Company Pvt Ltd (now Lara Projects LLP) and Lalu’s sons Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and Tej Pratap were in the company’s board of directors.
  
  Later, chief secretary  , on April 6, asked the forest department to furnish the documents related to soil purchase and the procedures followed.
  
  Based on preliminary investigations, Anjani said on April 21 that no evidence of a scam was found in the prima facie investigation of the soil purchased by Patna zoo.
  
  The chief secretary had said the firm which had supplied the soil claimed that it was supplied from five different places. He, however, had said that further documents had been sought from the forest department. Besides, the department was directed to inquire through its own sources where the soil had been brought from. Sources in the department said files with all required details have now been submitted by the PCCF. Singh could not be contacted for his comment.
