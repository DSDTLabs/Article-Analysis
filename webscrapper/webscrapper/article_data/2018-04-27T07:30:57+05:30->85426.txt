CHANDIGARH: Punjab labour minister Balbir Singh   on Thursday issued directions to the labour department to   working with the department on the basis of outsourcing so that financial aid and other benefits could be provided to construction and factory workers and labourers. 

 Chairing a meeting of the department, Sidhu also stressed upon providing quality health check-up facilities to workers. 
 
 He instructed officers of the building and other construction welfare board to procure mobile lab-cum-ambulance vans so that one such van each could be stationed in big cities. These vans will conduct on-the-spot health check up of workers at the construction sites and also of labourers standing at labour chowks.
 
 Reviewing existing housing schemes, Sidhu instructed officers to provide all benefits to the workers for the construction of houses. He also gave directions for providing financial aid under housing schemes to those labourers who owned a piece of land for this purpose. 
 
 The minister also expressed resentment that some municipal committees and corporations did not deposit the complete amount of cess they collected on construction work with the labour department. He asked the officers to expedite the process to get the dues from these MCs.
