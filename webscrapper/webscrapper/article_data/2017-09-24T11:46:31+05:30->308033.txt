BHOPAL: Vyapam has ignored the directives of chief minister   and refused to conduct re-examination of constable recruitment examination. Instead, the organization has issued admit cards to some candidates who missed in the initial exam schedule for re-test in one paper.

 Several candidates were not able to take the exams due to a technical glitch in the biometric machines as their records could not be identified or verified .
 
 A candidate Vikas Urmaliya alleged his exam was scheduled on September 16, but he could not take the exam as the biometric machine could not match his record. He was not allowed to appear by the invigilators. He has been issued the admit card to re-appear for examination on September 27 but for only one paper while he was denied from writing the other paper. 
 
 “When I contacted Vyapam they said there will be no re exam for the second paper. What purpose will re-issuing admit card for only one paper solve? Even if I score full marks in this paper, I will be marked absent in the second paper and cannot make it to the merit list,” he said.
 
 Another candidate   said, “Vyapam is playing with our future.”
 
 Ajay Kumar, a candidate Ajay Kumar who could not appear in the police constable recruitment exam on August 23, 2017 sent a mail to the chief minister in this connection. He requested the CM to allow him another chance to appear for the examination to be organized by the Professional Examination Board. Police recruitment test was organised at 85 centres of 13 cities from August 19 to September 18. 
 
 Taking note of the information received from various test centres and applications received from the applicants by the board, an opportunity has been provided to all such applicants whose Aadhaar were not bio-metrically certified or verified due to server problem for re-test.
 
 When contacted, Vyapam’s exam controller AKS Bhadoriya did not respond the calls and SMS sent to him.
