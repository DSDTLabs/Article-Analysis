JAIPUR:   norms and safety of other motorists seem to be of little value for city’s bus drivers as they are more than willing to run over anyone who comes between them and their revenue.

 Even on congested lanes like Tonk Pathak, Narayan Singh Circle and  , one can spot state roadways buses, private mini buses and Haryana roadways buses embarking on a deadly race with each other.
 
 “The bus which first arrives at a stand gets away with maximum passengers. Hence, the bus drivers try to outpace each other,” a traffic police official said, adding that regulating bus drivers is a perilous task due to political pressure.
 
 Near   and  , the chaos unleashed by the bus drivers is often life threatening. For instance, a mini-bus in order to outpace a low-floor bus ahead of it often ram into cars, bikes and auto-rickshaws.
 
 “When we try to stop them and issue challans, the bus drivers call their goons and create public nuisance by blocking roads and shouting slogans,” the traffic official said.
 
 Near SMS’s emergency ward gate, the private buses and state JCTSL buses wouldn't even let pass an ambulance. The situation is same near places like   where a driver would apply sudden brakes to stop the bus in the middle of road, right in the midst of heavy traffic.
 
 “Bus drivers as per rule should stop only near bus stops. But they pull over right in the middle of the road which brings heavy traffic to a halt,” the official said, adding that a few months ago an elderly woman died near Om Tower in Bhawani Nagar when a speeding bus hit a bike from the behind.
 
 The driver of the bus escaped from the place, leaving the injured profusely bleeding. Same is the scene across several areas of the city where bus drivers take ruthless overtakes, or jump red lights.
 
 “There is a race to reach the destination before another driver arrives. They are so blinded by the money that we have seen them slapping people who point out their mistakes,” the police official said.
