TUNDURRU: The small village of Tundurru turned into a battle zone on Wednesday with hundreds of fisherfolk, women and members of   staging protests, demanding that the government scrap the 1,000-crore  . 

 On the International Women's Day, hundreds of Tundurru women fought pitched battles with the cops. Not only were they roughed up by cops, some suffered injuries on their arms, shoulders, while others were dragged away and bundled into police vans. As soon as the word spread that the women were moving towards food park, the police blocked all the roads leading to the aqua park. Unconfirmed reports said the cops had lathicharged some women. Within minutes, chaos prevailed as the women ran for cover and the police were busy bundling the protesters into the waiting vans. They shouted slogans against the state government and police. "Why the police are disrupting our peaceful protest?" asked Satyavati, leader of  's wing. 
 
 Earlier, Satyavati had spent 45 days in jail for protesting against the food park. "We gave representations to the district collector. If the park is operated, groundwater will get polluted. This will extensively threaten public health. We will continue to protest till the government scraps the aqua park," said a 54-year-old Suramma. 
 
 It may be recalled that in 2012, the Union ministry of food processing industries had sanctioned two food processing units for generating employment and harnessing the export products' potential in the state. While one was to be set up in Nizamabad, the other at Tundurru. A Bhimavaram-based company,Anand Group, proposed to set up a 70-acre food park at Tundurru at a cost of 120 crore. As per the initial plans, 30 kinds of fishes and prawns were to be processed at the unit. Though the storage and processing units were expected to be operational by 2015, the villagers' resistance delayed the works from starting.
