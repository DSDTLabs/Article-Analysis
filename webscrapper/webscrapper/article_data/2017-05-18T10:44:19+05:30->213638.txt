NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet cleared on Wednesday the building of 10 new   to add 7000MW to India’s nuclear power generation capacity. These will be the indigenous 700 MW pressurised heavy water reactors (PHWRs).

 While India has been ramping up its nuclear power capacity, the significance of the decision lies in the scale of the project, which will make it easier for the domestic industry to raise supply capacities and lower costs.
 
 The government said, the new reactors would be in addition to the ones that are expected to come onstream by 2021-22, which will add 6700 MW in addition to the current capacity of 6780 MW from 22 reactors. The reactors under construction are  , Kakrapar and   (RAPP). The government said the new reactors would come up in “fleet mode as a fully homegrown initiative”.
 
 It would be one of the flagship ‘Make in India’ projects in this sector. “With likely manufacturing orders of close to 70,000 crore to the domestic industry, the project will help transform Indian nuclear industry by linking our goal of a strong nuclear power sector with our indigenous industrial capacities in highend technologies,” it said.
