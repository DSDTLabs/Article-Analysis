NEW DELHI: Claiming that PM   followed some "unknown people" on Twitter who tweeted "venomous, misogynist stuff" as well as issued "murderous threats",   leader Derek O'Brien asked the government in   on Wednesday whether it would issue an advisory to people occupying high offices to not follow such trolls. 

 Responding to this, while replying to a question about attacks on journalists, minister of state for home   said no curbs could be imposed on anyone in a free country like India where there was freedom of speech and expression. 
 
 O'Brien said, "There are certain trolls on digital media who broadcast venomous messages, misogynist stuff and murderous threats on social media. The PM is following certain unknown people on digital media who broadcast such stuff, though the PM himself is not writing anything wrong. Is the government sending an advisory to such high authorities not to follow such trolls who are speaking of rape and misogynist threats under the guise of anonymity?"
 
 He added that he was not satisfied with the minister's statement.
