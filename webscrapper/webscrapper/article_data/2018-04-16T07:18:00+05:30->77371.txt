GURUGRAM: The Special Task Force (STF) has   a proclaimed offender 10 years after he duped a doctor in Rewari. The accused, along with his father, managed to evade arrest for a decade. During this time, a reward of Rs 50,000 was announced for those who give any information about them. 

 The incident dates back to 2008, when Amit and his father Somdev, both residents of Jhajjar, duped a Rewari-based doctor. The   duo had conned the doctor into giving them over Rs 1 crore, but never returned it.
 
 Following this, the doctor filed a police complaint against them and an FIR was registered against them at City police station in Rewari. Both the accused managed to evade arrest by concealing their identities and fled. Later, they were declared proclaimed offenders.
 
 A month ago, Somdev was finally arrested from his hideout in Jhajjar by Gurugram STF. Based on the information given by him after questioning, Amit was nabbed from Rewari bus stand on Saturday. “The accused were sent to two days’ police remand. Cops will quiz them about how they duped the victim and managed to give police a slip,” said Ravinder Kumar, PRO, Gurugram police.
