KOCHI: Even though most   in the city have turned unsafe for pedestrians and motorists, authorities remain mute spectators. Excuses offered by them range from GST woes of contractors to rain.

 Travels through Vyttila-Tripunithura and Sahodaran Ayyappan roads have become a nightmare for motorists. Sahodaran Ayyappan road, which was relayed almost a year is now full of potholes. On Vyttila-Tripunithura road, accidents are reported on a daily basis. The tale of Palarivattom-Kakkanad road too is the same. “We have taken measures to start the repair work. But, we are unable to do so because of rain. Once the rain subsides, we will begin the work,” said Shaju, executive engineer,   (PWD).
 
 Though the PWD tried to fill the potholes using concrete mix, that didn’t work, the official said. There is no plan for relaying the road, the official said. “Now, we would do only repair,” he said.
 
 Kaloor-Kadavanthra road maintained by   (GCDA) is in a   condition as no relaying work has been undertaken. Though the agency awarded the work to a contractor, it didn’t progress much. Still, GCDA paid over 30% of the bills to the contractor. The work was awarded without inviting tenders and administrative sanction and this forced the GCDA to stop the work mid-way.
 
 The GCDA had awarded the work along Kumaranasan junction and Kadavanthra stretch at a cost of Rs 2.62 crore while the amount allotted for Kathrikkadavu-Kaloor stretch was Rs 3.22 crore. When the new chairman assumed office, he awarded the work on Kaloor-Kathrikkadavu stretch to KMRL at a cost of Rs 1.25 crore.
 
 Corporation authorities cite issues related to GST and the reluctance shown by contractors as a reason for delay. “Most of the contractors are not starting the work as they don’t have any clarity on how much tax they will have pay as per GST,” said P M Harris, chairperson, works standing committee,  . “Still, we would be making fresh attempt to force them to do at least the repair works,” Harris said.
