GURUGRAM: As many as 38   of four   were inspected on Thursday as part of a safety audit that kicked off   on Thursday. 

 A team comprising a dozen officials from the regional transport authority ( ),   and road safety officers (RSO) examined the school buses and took note of discrepancies. 
 
 Coming in the wake of the latest high court order seeking a report from the state authorities on compliance of the safety measures, the drive is aimed at cracking down on violators ahead of the March 31 deadline. Moreover, as private vans will be barred from transporting schoolchildren from April 1, the officials also seek to zero in on schools using small vehicles to ferry students, said an RTA official.
