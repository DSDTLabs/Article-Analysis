CHANDIGARH: In an attempt to give a push to cashless transactions in Chandigarh, the Union Territory administration is all set to launch a prepaid cash card. 

 Called the City Card, it will enable residents to make payments at all government departments and   (CTU) buses, which ferry around two lakh passengers daily. The card will also be accepted at all government educational institutes, hospitals and e-sampark centres.
 
 The administration offers 78 government-to-citizen (G2C), government-to business (G2B), and business-to-consumer (B2C) services through its network of 18 e-Sampark centers, 11 eSampark kiosks, and 14 Gram   centres. The administration is also making efforts include restaurants and eateries.
 
 Banks have been roped in which will issue cards with security features. The residents will be able to get the card recharged from designated merchants. An app installed on the phone of the merchants will read the cards to make payments.
 
 Different departments of the administration have started accepting digital payments in recent months. This includes net banking, debit and credit card payments and Paytm.
 
 Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) was the first department to go cashless by accepting different charges and fees paid by owners through cashless mode. CHB has developed house schemes in different sectors 29, 41, 40, 44, 43, 45, 47, Sector 38 (West) and Modern Housing Complex -having around 64000 dwelling units. The board has also developed rehabilitation housing schemes.
 
 The administration is also encouraging traders and industrialists to adopt cashless modes of transactions. The authorities are also trying to make Sector 26 grain market cashless, but so far have succeeded only in making   office cashless.
 
 The idea of the prepaid card was mooted by UT adviser Parimal Rai. UT deputy commissioner   is working on the project and has worked out the modalities.
