NAVI MUMBAI: The administration will soon be developing its first daycare centres after repeated demands by residents. 

  corporator Vishal Dolas has also consistently voiced the need at the general body. “This is one facility required by the residents that administration has failed to look into.   have become a necessity as both parents are working,” said the corporator, who also highlighted the steep fees charged by privately-run day care centres.
 
 A plot admeasuring 200 sq m in sector 48, Nerul and another similar-sized plot in sector 19   were transferred by   early this week. Dolas said that theses plots should now be developed and used for purpose they have been allotted for.
 
 The administration said that it has already finished planning the project. Two floors of the multi-storey buildings, to be constructed on these plots, will be dedicated for creches. “The plan for the building was decided after consulting with the schemes department. The buildings will be used for baby sitting and there are plans to outsource the operation to some NGOs,” said an official. 
 
  should ease the financial burden by setting up more day care centres in every ward at nominal rates, added Dolas.
