NAGPUR: Three law students from Pune sustained serious injuries after they were allegedly stabbed by one Yash  , who reportedly has political connections, following a drunken brawl near Maruti showroom on Amravati Road shortly after midnight on Sunday.

 Akshay Monglewar, Ruchir Batra and   suffered the injuries and are currently recuperating at a private hospital. It is learnt that the injured persons had gone to an eatery to celebrate the birthday party of advocate  , under whom the victimsâ€™ friend Omkar Umate is engaged as an attorney. Apart from others, Kalpesh   and Sandip Mishra too were part of the revelry.
 
 Gawande and his friend Anshuman   were attending another party at the same venue. Umate was friendly with Gawande. It is learnt that Gawande went to the place where Umate and his friends were seated for an informal introduction. During exchange of pleasantries, Gawande felt that Moglewar and Borse passed a comment targeting him. After a brief altercation, the friends appeared to have settled the issue without it snowballing inside the eatery.
 
 After Umate and his friends stepped out of the eatery, Gawande and his friends once again intercepted the group of law students. Gawande and Borse got locked in a scuffle even as the rest of the friends rushed to separate them. Batra and Dukikar were injured as Gawande stabbed both for intervening in the fight. Moglewar was held back by Wanjari while Gawande stabbed him too. Leaving the victims, Gawande and Wanjari fled the place.
 
 Wadi police have registered an offence of attempt to murder against Gawande and Wanjari.
