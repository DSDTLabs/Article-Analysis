 aka   of ' ' will again warm up people’s hearts, as he is all set to get into action in the reality show 'Khatron Ke Khiladi'. This will be Zain’s first outing with a non-fiction show. He said, “I am in talks over it. Let’s see how it works out.”

 Ask the actor if he is an adventure sports junkie and he said, “I have done river rafting so far and wanted to skydive once in life. But if you ask me honestly, after working for three and a half years, I was looking for a break and just relax for a month. But if this works out, it will be a set of adrenaline rush for another few months abroad. I am looking forward to that.”
 
 Earlier the actor also told in an interview about why his show 'Naamkarann' is going off air. "I am not sure about the exact reason but we, too, have been hearing that a lot of shows will be axed. The channel is planning to revamp. Since it was not leading the slot, they've decided to take the show off air. However, I am happy that the audience liked the show and the feedback, especially for my character, has been encouraging. Besides, I also feel that its better to end a show when its still doing well. I want to thank my fans for their immense support and love."
