 The  , in an order on May 4, 2016, increased the   in Bengaluru from 30 to 75 metres.The order has ruled out new constructions in the 75-metre distance from lakes. Now, the   has clarified that projects which got construction licence before the NGT order came can go ahead with their plans.
 
 In a circular issued on March 30, 2017, BBMP commissioner N Manjunath Prasad said that the NGT directive will not apply for sites and properties in layouts which secured plan approval before the   issued its order. The circular sent to all the eight BBMP zonal heads for im plementation has come as relief to the real estate sector.
 
 A manager of a major realty company said the BBMP circular has cleared confusion among the public in general, and builders and developers in particular.“Many were of the belief that all constructions in the 75-metre periphery of lakes were banned.
 
 Similar was the belief about the NGT order which declared buffer zones for drains: 50 metres from the primary rajakaluve, 35 metres from the secondary rajakaluve and 25 metres from the tertiary rajakaluve.Thanks to the BBMP circular, confusion has been laid to rest,“ he said.
 
 Some builders mulling lake housing projects had approached the Supreme Court, seeking a review of the NGT order. They had contended that many projects which secured environment clearances were in the last stage of getting plans sanctioned. They had argued that these projects were stuck for no fault of theirs.
 
 Recently, the Karnataka government joined the builders' groups to challenge the NGT order. Sources said at least 180 layouts and development plans awaiting building plan approval were stuck due to confusion over the NGT order.
