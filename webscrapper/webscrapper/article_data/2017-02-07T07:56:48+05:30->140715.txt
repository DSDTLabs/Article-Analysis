BHOPAL: Following a low-key ‘Bhumi Pujan’ of   plant at Babai in   district on January 11, the construction of Rs 750-crore food processing unit and bottling plant is yet to begin.

 The first brick of the plant is likely to be laid in two months after completing all formalities of building permission. Though   is tight-lipped over its plan,   (AKVN) managing director JN Vyas said the construction work at the plant site is likely to start in a couple of months. He said formalities before the actual construction work begins are yet to be completed. These include the clearance of drawing and design of the factory by the local panchayat.
 
 Though the first phase of the project is likely to be over in 12 months, initial production may start by December 2018, he said. The international beverage giant will set up its food processing unit, including a bottling plant, at a newly developed industrial estate in Hoshangabad district, 8 km from river Narmada. The government is also setting up 5 MGD (million gallon per day) water treatment plant (WTP) for uninterrupted water supply to the company.
 
 “Work of road, power connection and availability of water from our side is done, only after which we have handed over the project site to the soft drink company,” Vyas said. On January 11, top brass of the beverage giant attended the ‘Bhumi Pujan’ at the project site in Babai. Despite the project being a huge investment, the government did not publicise it. Even chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan was conspicuous by his absence at the ‘Bhumi Pujan’. However, industry minister Rajendra Shukla attended the function.
