 Balloon, which has Jai, Anjali and   playing the main roles was released on December 29, 2017. The producers are absolutely displeased with the delayed release. In a press release they shared online, they have pointed out that film’s delay is solely because of Jai. They have shared saying the actor’s unprofessional work ethics and not attending the shoots on time have caused the delay which in turn has allegedly increased the production cost by Rs 1.5 crore.
 
 The release also requests the Producers’ Council to take immediate action against Jai and stop him from signing any new projects until he settles for the loss.
