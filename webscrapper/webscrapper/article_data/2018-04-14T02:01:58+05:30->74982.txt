Mumbai: A special Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA)   on Friday rejected the discharge   of   manufacturer J M Joshi, accused of being associated with an organised crime syndicate that was setting up gutka manufacturing units in Karachi. 

 Joshi has been booked in the case along with Manikchand Gutka owner Rasiklal Dhariwal after their names allegedly came up in the confessional statement of a man allegedly working for Dawoodâ€™s brother Anees Ibrahim.
 
 The court allowed the   plea of another accused, Rajesh Pancharia. 
 
 Pancharia was among those accused of supplying gutka-making machinery to Dubai and from there to Pakistan. The court directed Pancharia to furnish a PR bond of Rs 30,000.
 
 In August 2016, the CBI had filed a chargesheet against the gutka manufacturers.
