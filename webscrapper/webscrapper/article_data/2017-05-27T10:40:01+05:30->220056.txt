PUNE: Unidentified cyber cheats created a fake website of a US-based company and opened an account in its name in a bank in the US to secure $22,250 (Rs 15.59 lakh) bill payment through online transfer from a city-based electrical raw material importer. 

 The businessman would regularly import material from the company by placing orders and making online payments after receiving bills from the company. 
 
 Sahakarnagar police inspector (crime) A T Waghmale told TOI, “The suspects hacked into the US firm’s website to secure vital details and later created an identical website barring a small change in the URL that ended with .yahoo.com instead of .com. They opened an account in the name of the firm in a US bank that the businessman was regularly transacting with, but in a different branch, using fake documents.” 
 
 On December 6 last year, the unsuspecting businessman made an online money transfer from the Bank of Maharashtra’s overseas branch to the bogus account in the US bank after receiving a mail for payment of bill against an order placed by him, said Waghmale. “The businessman did not notice the change in the URL and assumed that the company had changed its bank account number. After effecting the online money transfer, the businessman waited for the raw material to arrive, but the same did not. When he inquired with the company, he was told that the latter had not received his payment,” Waghmale added.
