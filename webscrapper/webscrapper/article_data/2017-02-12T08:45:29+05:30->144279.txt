 * The   Defence programme aims to provide an effective missile shield against incoming enemy ballistic and nuclear missiles. 
 
 * A hostile missile needs to be intercepted at boost (launch) point, mid-course (flight through space), or terminal phase (during atmospheric descent).
 
 
 
 
 The BMD is a two-tier fully automated system which comprises of:
 
 * Overlapping network of early warning and tracking radars
 
 * Reliable command and control posts
 
 * Land and sea-based batteries of advanced interceptor missiles
 
 
 
 
 * Only a handful of countries like the US,  , China and Israel have effective BMD systems. 
 
 * But no system is 100% full-proof.
 
 
 
 
 * The Defence Research and Development Organisation ( )began developing a two-tier BMD system in late-1990s.
 
 * An interceptor missile was first tested in 2006.
 
 * Since then, interceptor missiles have been tested around 10 times. At least three such tests are known to have failed.
 
 * The BMD system is designed to track and destroy hostile missiles both inside (endo) and outside (exo) the earthâ€™s atmosphere.
 
 * However, it has not yet been tested in integrated mode, with both exo and endo interceptor missiles together.
 
 * Phase-I of BMD system is geared towards tackling enemy missiles with a 2,000-km range. Phase-II will enable interception of missiles in 5,000-km range
 
 * But there has been a long delay in becoming operational. The DRDO had earlier promised the two-tier missile shield would be deployed in Delhi by 2014.
