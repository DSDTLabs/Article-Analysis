MUMBAI: The controversy over   serving a notice to radio jockey (RJ) Malishka following her   and making fun of the condition of city’s   and traffic jams doesn’t seem to end. On Thursday social media and messengers went viral with several  .

 Following the controversy, another video by the private radio channel, once again poking fun on the condition of civic roads and nullahs was seen on social media platforms. The song sequence is titled “Sonu tula RJ var barosa Nahi ka” meaning you don’t trust the RJ.
 
 Malishka, who is currently in New York, tweeted, “Six songs composed and ready in my head and they are NOT about New York. I’m a rapper now. Also a breeder apparently and back soon #Mumbai.” She also uploaded a video thanking people. 
 
 An RTI activist and former central information commissioner (CIC) Shailesh Gandhi tweeted in favour of the RJ asking others to come out and upload videos on the similar lines. “The civic body has attempted to victimize the RJ by serving her a notice. However if people come out and upload similar videos, may be then the BMC would realize that what she said was true. The video was purely satirical and did not make any harsh comments on the corruption in the civic body despite. This shows the growing sense of intolerance,” said Gandhi.
 
  
  
 
 Activist Dolphy Dsouza also said in a tweet, “Instead of implementing corrective measures, BMC is indulging in ‘shooting the messenger’. We demand no punitive action against Malishka.” Dsouza said that the BMC should not have taken the song as a criticism. “If the situation was fine on ground then nobody would have spoken about it at all. Why are the authorities trying to potray that everything is fine,” asked Dsouza.
 
 The BMC however had made it clear that they did not intent to target anyone and the notice sent to the RJ’s Bandra home was a part of their routine inspection process.
