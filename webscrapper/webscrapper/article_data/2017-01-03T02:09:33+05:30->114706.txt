NEW DELHI: Confusion prevailed days after the   told   on   to await new guidelines before starting  .   failed to figure out the schools supposed to follow this order as the DoE uploaded on its website a single list of all private, unaided schools, without distinguishing the ones built on public land. 

 Hassled parents have had to consult multiple lists before making a decision. “The list keeps changing. I noticed that they increased the number to 298. They need to release the revised list soon,” said Sachin, a parent. 
 
 Sources said the number of schools on public land that have lease obligations is expected to increase because authorities are making a fresh list. This explains the increase in the number of schools on public land from 285 to 298. The revised list may name over 350 schools in the city, sources said.
 
 Banking on this loophole, some schools have started the admission process based on last year’s guidelines. “I wasn’t sure the category in which a school that I am interested in falls into, so I went to inquire. School authorities said they will admit students based on last year’s guidelines. It was only later that I got to know that the school was built on DDA land and had started admissions prematurely,” said a parent. 
 
 Those who stay in and around Dwarka complained that as most schools in their area are built on DDA land, they are left with no other option but to wait. “There are no schools in my area that have started admissions yet. They tell me they’re waiting for the new guidelines. I took three days off for this purpose but now it seems a waste,” said another parent, who stays in Dwarka.
