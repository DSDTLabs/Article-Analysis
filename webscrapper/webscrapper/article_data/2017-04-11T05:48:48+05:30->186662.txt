UDAIPUR: A couple have been reportedly been ostracized by their community in   block of Rajsamand because they remarried. 

 The   panchayat called by the 24-shreni Paliwal Samaj not only passed a diktat to ostracize them but also imposed a penalty of Rs 31,000 on the couple. The incident took place more than a month ago, however, it came to light recently when an audio clip of the panchayat meeting went viral on the social media. Reeling under severe pressure from family and the community, the couple is tight-lipped and has refrained from taking any action. 
 
 "The man, Bhanwarlal Paliwal, works as a daily wager in Maharda near Amet block while the woman, Anju, is a housewife. Bhanwarlal was a widower while Anju was married off at an early age and was later divorced,"  , an RTI activist told TOI. The duo got married a year ago and have been facing the wrath of the community leaders since then, Sharma said. 
 
 In last week of February, a meeting was called where the community leaders sentenced a penalty on the couple and have been forcing them to pay the amount which is a big sum for the daily wager. Earlier too, there had been similar incidents of the   undue fines and ostracizing couples for entering into intercaste or love marriages. The administration and police have failed to intervene and take stringent actions in such matters, sources said.
