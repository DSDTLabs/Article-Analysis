PUNE: Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) has announced its second bird count for winter season on January 15.

 The pan-India count is conducted seasonally under BNHS’s   initiative. The first count for monsoon was held on September 11, 2016.
 
 BNHS has invited birdwatchers, NGOs, ornithologists, and nature lovers for a large-scale participation. This programme is based on scientific data collection methodology applied to foster conservation of neighbourhood species, a statement issued by the BNHS on Wednesday said.
 
 Common Bird Monitoring Programme (CBMP) is a   with an objective of involving people in large numbers to observe birds in their backyard or places they visit regularly. There is a need to accurately monitor trends in common bird populations.
 
 Raju Kasambe, programme Manager-IBA, BNHS said, “Varying population of common birds often goes unnoticed. Monitoring them will help us establish a baseline data about species distribution and abundance. This data and long-term monitoring will help understand population changes of these birds over a period of time.”
