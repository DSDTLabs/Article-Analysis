Poinguinim: An eight-day training programme for women   pluckers (‘padelis’) was held at Gulem, Canacona. The training programme was conducted by the agriculture technology management agency, south, zonal agriculture office, Canacona, and the district rural development agency, South Goa.

 The main purpose is to build confidence among women in order to harvest coconuts in their own and neighbouring gardens. 
 
 Coconut plucking had become a difficult job for coconut farmers due to non -availability and high charges by coconut pluckers.
 
 Of 17 women who participated, six who acquired special skills were Suvidha Velip and Amisha Velip of Popaidanda, Yogita Sudhir of Loliem, Vinanti Velip of Agonda, Vibha Mahale and Bindiya Velip of Khola. They were trained by Ursella Kullu and Rufina Indwar of Jharkhand.
