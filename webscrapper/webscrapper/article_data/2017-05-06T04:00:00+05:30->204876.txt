Vadodara: An opposition Congress councillor in the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has sought action against a contractor who allegedly used old pipes for a water supply project by colouring them again. Councillor Jaha Desai stated in a letter that it had come to his notice that the contractor was given the work of replacing pipelines in the Chhani village. He said that the scandal had come to light earlier and the VMC was even contemplating to file an offence against the contractor. Jaha, however, said that the offence was not registered so far by the VMC and sought a vigilance inquiry in the matter.TNN
