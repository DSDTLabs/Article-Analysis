 The customs officers at the airport check the valuables and after inspection they decide the customs duty or fees to be levied on travellers bringing in valuables. The custom duty is required to be deposited at the extended counter of the bank at the airport.
 
 The bank, according to police, appointed a retired cashier to run the extended counter at night. Assistant inspector P. B. Kolte, who is investigating the case, told TOI that the bank issues three chalans – one for traveller, one for the customs’ department and one for the bank. “We are going to tally these challans to ascertain from where the crime originated. At present, it can be said that the money has not been deposited in the bank in favour of the Central Customs Department. We have asked for the challans from the Customs and the bank to conduct the tally,” he said.
 
 Kolte saidchallans were issued to about 16 passengers who paid the customs’ duty amounting to Rs 14.60 lakh. 
 
 The customs officials refused to comment on the issue.
