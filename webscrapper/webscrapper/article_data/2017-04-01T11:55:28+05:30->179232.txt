Even as the population is increasing in the city, Vizagites believe that there is a need to focus on developing more parks and green space for the health benefits of residents. Here’s what our readers have to say:

 Need parks for amusement
 
 Visakhapatnam is a fast growing city and needs more parks to reduce pollution levels. Amusement parks attracts more crowd especially children during summer vacation. The existing park facilities are better, but still needs to be improved. Amusement parks staff should follow guidelines for inspection and safety. As part of safety, amusement parks can set up maintenance procedures and preventive maintenance schedules for the equipment and to ensure safety of the public. Adequate number of colony parks should be created. Presently, a few parks are well maintained by GVMC and other public enterprises. Maintenance of small parks would certainly attract public to spend leisure time with their family and friends. Parks should have amenities like jogging track, cycling track, gardens, eco-friendly toilets and food courts. In addition to these facilities, proper maintenance of parks is important especially garbage disposal and sufficient water.

 Parks reduce pollution
 
 We need more parks as there is so much pollution from ports and other industries. Parks can provide greenery and lung space as well as serve as walking, resting, and meeting places. The administration as well as the residents should come together and construct parks in select residential colonies Parks also lead to economic benefits. They enhance property value and municipal revenue. Parks also encourage recreation for kids and adds to the scenic beauty.

 Develop more parks
 
 It is unfortunate that despite the administration planning to develop Vizag as a smart city, there are very few parks in the city too only in and around Beach Road. Parks catering to morning walkers and children amusements are very limited. The GVMC and Vuda should take a cue from Chennai that has developed beautiful parks in the main city areas with lush greenery, sound system, wifi connectivity and also separate areas for senior citizens.

 Maintain the existing parks
 
 A park is a large public garden where children play and elderly people relax. In Vizag, there are many parks. There are many colony parks in GVMC limits, but except Saraswati Park and Diamond Park and parks in Muralinagar, Madhavadhara,and Marripalem Vuda Layout, rest are not maintained properly. It is not the aim to point out lapses in maintaining parks but to see that all parks in and around GVMC limits are taken care of and well-maintained.

 Construct parks in PPP mode
 
 With increasing population and rapid development of the city, GVMC should ensure that more parks are constructed in residential areas. Every park should have a jogging track,   surveillance to prevent crimes and a small fitness centre to create awareness regarding health among youngsters. The colony parks should run under PPP mode with contributions from residents’ welfare associations, so that there is ownership of the people.

 Improve health
 
 I strongly feel there is a need for more parks in colonies and various localities as it will not only improve public health but also encourage children to play outdoors. Kids nowadays don't go out, instead sit at home with smart phones and gadgets. Another reason why I feel it's important to have more parks is that it would enable community engagement thereby contributing to safer and more friendly neighbourhood.
