Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday granted permission to Ryan Augustine Pinto, the CEO of a group of institutions that owns a city school where a 7-year-old boy was allegedly murdered by a senior student in the washroom. A resident of Borivali (East) in Mumbai, Pinto would now be able to visit the US and Dubai from January 19 to February 9 to attend a conference on ‘The impact of technology in education’.

 Justice Rajan Gupta passed these orders after the CBI had expressed that it had no objection on Pinto visiting abroad. Pinto had to approach the HC for permission as the court had granted him bail in relation to the student’s murder case on the condition that he could not leave country without its permission.
 
 On November 21, 2017, the high court had granted interim bail to Pinto, his father and the owner of the group of Institutions Augustine Pinto and his mother and managing director Grace Pinto. The HC, however, asked them to join the investigations and not to leave the country without its permission.
 
 The deceased boy’s father had approached the Supreme Court against the relief granted to the Pintos and seeking action against them. He alleged that they were part of the conspiracy in the murder of their son.
 
 However, the apex court had dismissed his plea and upheld the HC orders. On September 8, 2017, the body of seven-year-old boy was found inside the toilet of the school at Bhondsi, with his throat slit.
