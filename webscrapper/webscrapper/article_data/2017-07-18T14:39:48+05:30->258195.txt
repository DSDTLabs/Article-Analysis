PUNE: Experts from the Geological Survey of India’s (GSI) Pune unit have started a survey to identify areas susceptible to landslides in the five western Maharashtra districts of Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara, Ratnagiri and  . 

 “The need for such a survey was felt considering the topography of these districts. Our geologists will identify the landslide-prone areas and will suggest corrective measures,”  , deputy director general of the GSI’s state unit here, said. 
 
 “We have formed five teams, each comprising two geologists, for the survey in each district. These teams will study the topography, types of rocks, soil nature, water capacity and rainfall and will compile district-wise reports. These reports will be re-examined by senior geologists before a final report is submitted to the state government,” he told TOI.
 
 The survey is expected to be completed by April 2018. 
 
 Geologists are of the view that since preventing landslides is practically impossible, the identification of the hazard-prone areas is necessary to ensure that the agencies concerned can take preventive measures to avert disaster.
 
 Powar said, “After the survey in the five western Maharashtra districts, the focus will turn on a similar exercise in Pune and other districts of the state. We will complete survey across the state by 2020.”
 
 A senior geologist, who has studied these areas in the past, said, “The area falls under the Deccan plateau and is covered by a variety of basalt rocks. But we need to understand and study which type of basalt is in a particular area as every rock type has a different nature. Based on that we can predict its future behaviour in different conditions.” Sources in the GSI said the state needed to make a conscious effort towards dealing with areas prone to landslide. After the landslide in Malin, the GSI unit has been receiving landslide-related complaints from various districts, particularly from Thane, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts.
