KOCHI: At a time when the industry is looking dull, thanks to American government's new policies restricting businesses leading to fall in IT projects, techies working in different IT companies at   have formed a community to alert people on job vacancies. 

 After a year of networking in  , they decided to start a website that will alert people on vacancies in the IT world. The site went live a couple of weeks ago and keeps getting posts from across India and the Gulf region.
 
 "We started off as one WhatsApp group in which we had human resource managers of companies working in Infopark. That has now expanded to beyond Infopark and become a pan-India affair. At present, we have about 15 groups in IT-India sector, five in   area and three in non-IT sector, each having about 200 members," said  , a HR manager and coordinator of cjobz.org
 
 He said that they have standardized the format of how HR managers can make their availability brief and clear so that it could be passed on to WhatsApp group. "Since we are unable to handle the WhatsApp groups, we activated the website in which HR of 26 companies have got login rights to post vacancies."
 
 The purpose of the website is to do a service for the community say the group of youngsters who had first started a car-pooling group which is a great success. "It was the Convoy car-pooling that led to the realization of the jobs @ Infopark project. Since we started connecting, the idea of activating a WhatsApp group for vacancies originated. Many job alerts come due to referrals from members which is convenient for the HR teams too," said  , a techie who moved to Bengaluru and manages the site along with Safuvan Paravakkal, a techie at Infopark.
