NEW DELHI: Despite being notified by the Centre in June 2017, the   cannot be notified in Delhi immediately. This is because Delhi does not fall into the category of ‘state’ as mentioned in the rules and the government has to take permission from the lieutenant governor to approach the ministry of home affairs which will then authorise the   to “discharge the functions of the state government”. Once this process is completed, the government will invite suggestions and objections to the rules and only then notify them.

 The complication was brought to light on Thursday when the law department returned the file to the social welfare department, highlighting that “section 101 of the Rights of Persons with Disability Act, 2016, confers power upon the state government to make such rules under the said Act. However, the term ‘state government’ has not been defined in the RPwD Act 2016. The NCT of Delhi being a union territory, a specific delegation of the powers is required for exercise of such powers”.
 
 “A day after we received the comments from the law department, we have sent the file to the LG. Till the Supreme Court does not give its verdict on sharing of responsibilities in Delhi, we will take clearance from the LG for issues like these. The matter was also raised by BJP MLA   some days back who accused the government of not acting on the rules. However, he is only misleading people. Once the Centre notified its rules in June this year, we finished drafting our rules by July 26 and circulated them for comments by August 1. Once these were received, the draft was then submitted to the law department for vetting on September 5. Now we will have to wait till the laid down procedure is followed before we can act,” said social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam.
