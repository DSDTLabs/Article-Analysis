JAIPUR: Rajput women on Thursday threatened to repeat history by committing   (self-immolation) on January 24, a day before ‘Padmaavat’s scheduled release, even as another organisation of the community said it would file a review petition in the   against its order striking down the ban imposed on the film by four state governments.

 Shatrani Manch, an organisation of Rajput women in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, said its members would end their lives at the Jauhar Sthal — the place in Chittorgarh fort where Rani Padmini is believed to have performed ‘jauhar’ according to Rajput folklore.
 
 “Our demand for complete ban on the film will remain irrespective of any order from anywhere. The ‘shatranis’ (Rajput women) will not hesitate in repeating the act of Rani Padmini for maintaining the honour of our community,” Manch coordinator Nirmala Rathore said.
 
 Soon after the SC order, the Manch gave a call for ‘swabhiman march’ on January 21 when women, including members of the erstwhile royal families, would walk up to the Jauhar Sthal. Rathore said the princesses of the Chomu and Udaipur royal families have already given their consent for the march. She said the women will pick up sand from the ‘jauhar’ site and take a pledge to fight “all attempts of disrespecting Rajput women who had committed ‘jauhar’.”
