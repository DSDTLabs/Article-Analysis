Mumbai: A 24-year-old woman had a nightmare registering a   and assault complaint at   on Monday. She claimed she was molested and then beaten up by the man’s five kin in broad daylight but the   were unwilling to record her complaint until it was brought to the notice of senior officials.

 Though the incident occurred around 4pm, the   were not willing to take down her complaint, nor was she given a memo for a medical check-up till 7pm. 
 
 She told TOI that she, attached to an NGO, was doing a study on woman empowerment and hence had gone to Shivaji Nagar. “As I was returning from Road 13, the man followed me, held my hand and molested me in the middle of the road. When I slapped him, he ran and called five female relatives, who, without asking me anything, started hitting and assaulted me,” she said. 
 
 She said an autorickshaw driver helped her get to   police station. Learning that she had gone to file a complaint, the accused and his family members barged inside, and alleged that she had beaten them. “Initially, police refused to take my complaint. Despite me repeatedly telling them that the accused molested me, they said they will also register a cross-complaint against her for assaulting him,” she said. 
 
 When additional commissioner of police (eastern region) Manoj Lohiya learnt about the woman’s plight, he immediately pulled up the senior inspector, and the victim’s complaint was registered.
