AURANGABAD: The drivers of two sand-laden trucks on Wednesday gave the Satara revenue officials the slip after they intercepted the vehicles and told them to come to the tehsil office.

 The Satara police have registered an illegal sand mining case against the drivers and launched a hunt for them, following a complaint by a revenue official. 
 
 Police said the revenue officials, led by mandal officer  , reached a closed cement factory following a tip-off on Wednesday evening. The trucks carrying illegally-mined sand were parked in the premises of a cement factory near the   railway station. 
 
 “The revenue officials questioned the two drivers, who identified themselves as Sunny Rathod and  , and told them to bring their vehicles to the tehsil office. However, the duo fled with the vehicles by pretending to follow instructions,” police said.
 
 Devkate provided the registration numbers of the truck to the police.
