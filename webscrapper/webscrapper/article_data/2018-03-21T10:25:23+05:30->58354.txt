ZIRAKPUR: Donâ€™t forget to make your own arrangements of drinking water, washroom and electricity, if you want to organise any family function at the community centre in Dhakoli,  , as it lacks all these basic facilities required to hold an event.

 During a visit to the community centre, it was found that it only has a shed, a stage and a gate. Residents of the nearby residential society said they have been managing this community centre on their own by deploying staff for cleaning and watering the site at their own expense before holding an event there. They said they spent from their own pockets to plant trees and install few benches for the residents as the stage, which was constructed by the municipal council had no sitting arrangements.
 
 President of unified resident welfare association (URWA)   said they have recently requested the council to allow the association to charge nominal fees from the residents, who would like to hold functions in this centre. However, the authorities denied saying they do not have a policy for it. He said the residents like to hold functions in this community centre, but the problem is that after any function, nobody cleans the litter created. The   then has to spend from its fund to get it done.
 
 General secretary   said the eight of the societies, which constitute the association, are managing the community centre. But the basic facilities have to be provided by the municipal council and not by the residents. There is no proper parking space at the community centre due to which the residents of the adjoining societies face problems whenever there is a function at the venue. It is a pain for them even to enter through their society gate, which is near the community centre. 
 
 Executive member of the association   said to facilitate the residents, the council should provide the facilities of washroom, water and electricity, so that the residents can use it whenever they require. Also, the council can earn some funds from it, which can then be utilised for the betterment of the community centre. In fact, the room should also be constructed, so that marriages, small functions can also be organised there.
 
 In the dock:
 
 There was a plan to construct two rooms and a washroom in this community centre. As soon as the funds are allocated, thefacility will be provided to the residents
