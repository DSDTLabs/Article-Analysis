Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) had issued a tender in 2011 to Unity Infra Projects Limited (UIPL) which promised construction of cement roads in the city within two years. It has been five years now and the private firm has failed to construct a 850m cement road from Jaripatka shopping mall to Singhu Nagar as promised.

 The contract of construction of the roads was allotted to Unity Infra Project Limited and they received over 101 crores and 20 lakhs for the said purpose. It has been five years now since the issued tender and there has been no commencement of construction of the roads.
 
 Vedprakash Arya, former corporator, met Shravan Hardikar, municipal commissioner and demanded black listing of the construction company and re-issuance of a new tender and allotting them to a new agency. Arya has also stated that if the demands are not met they will have no choice but to stage a protest for which the government will be held responsible.
