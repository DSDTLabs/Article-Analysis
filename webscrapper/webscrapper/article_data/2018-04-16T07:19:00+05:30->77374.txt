GURUGRAM:   will develop a   (stepwell) as part of its art and culture centre coming up in Sector 58. According to MCG officials, the Multi Arts Culture Centre will have a sewage treatment plant, which will treat the water being used by the centre. This water will then be released into a water body, which will look like a baoli.

 “We will create a replica of a baoli, with steps leading to a water reservoir. There will be a performing area for artistes around the water body. We could also use this as an amphitheatre,” said  , senior town planner, MCG.
 
 He said the main water body will be supported by two smaller water bodies within the complex. The objective is to conserve water through the treatment plant and improve aesthetics of the complex, Chouhan said. The centre will come up on an area of 5 acres with two different buildings, and will have a seating capacity of 1,600 people. It will have studios, exhibition spaces, galleries, workshop spaces, seminar rooms, library and cafeterias.
 
 MCG is trying to work on water conservation through water bodies. A proposal to revive Sikanderpur pond was approved by CM   this week. The pond is spread across 5 acres, and until recently, sewage from neighbouring areas was being released into it. 
 
 The pond revival project will be divided into two phases. In the first phase, the stormwater drain leading to the water body will be repaired and the pond will be cleaned up. A water shed will also be developed. In the second phase, the area around the pond will be developed into a public space funded by corporates. At the macro level, MCG has a plan to revive 16 water bodies in Gurgaon.
