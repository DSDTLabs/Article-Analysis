 might have been in the news for all the wrong reasons in the past few weeks, with rumours about her involvement in the actress abduction case. However, in the midst of all that, she has sung a song for a movie, again proving wrong all those who thought that she would bid goodbye to showbiz after marriage. The actress sung the song for director Unni Pranavam’s upcoming movie  , after returning from Texas where she showcased a power-packed performance in a stage show.

  The song, composed by musician Sharreth, begins with the words He Mathaveriyare… and is unique in its composition and rendition. While recording the song, Kavya had said, “I am a fan of Sharathettan and have often told him that I would like to sing a song composed by him. And finally this happened. It is a beautiful song written by Murugan Kattakada, and I am sure everybody will like it.”
 
 A rebellious song which questions religious conventions and politics, the song couldn’t have had a better voice than Kavya’s to bring the emotions hidden in the lyrics, said Sharreth. “I wanted a voice which doesn’t sound too feminine. Also, I had seen Kavya’s poetry performances and found the right voice in her, just like I chose Remya Nambeesan to sing Andelonde.”
 
 Kavya apparently took just two hours to sing the two-minute-long song. “It has a different thalam which we call sangeernam in Malayalam and 9-8 in western music. All the other songs in the movie are sung by composers-musicians such as Hariharan, Bijibal, Gopi Sunder and M M Srilekha,” Sharreth added. 
  Happy about the attention the song has been receiving, director Unni Pranavam said Kavya’s voice has brought out the right feel for the situation in the film. “The film is about love, life and religion and the family drama has got a double bounty by getting Kavya to sing one of its songs,” he signs off.
