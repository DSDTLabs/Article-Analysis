Be it his own films, like   or  , or films that he has backed, such as Ondu Motteya Kathe, audiences expect to watch an engaging film when Pawan Kumar’s name is associated with it. And Pawan hopes that his role as techie   Nandimath, and the film,  , will meet people’s expectations.
Director   tells us that he had initially approached Achyuth Kumar for the role, but after hearing the story, Achyuth himself suggested that they approach Pawan. And it was certainly meant to be, for when Pawan had watched the pitch trailer of Gultoo around two years ago, he wanted to be associated with the film in some manner. Back then, he offered Janardhan production assistance. When the director approached him to act in the film a few months later, Pawan was onboard, since he not only liked the energy of the team, but also wanted to be a part of a film that is exploring a new topic.
 “This film is releasing at the right time. It’s based on cybercrime, which is a topic that is being currently spoken about a lot, in light of the recent Facebook data privacy scandal,” says Pawan, adding, “While playing Phaneesh, it was interesting to mouth lines that were heavy with terms that I had till then only read in newspapers. The highlight for me was that the cyber security set in Gultoo is the same one that I had put up for U Turn a couple of years ago. It was a nice experience to be on the same set as an actor this time.”
 When we ask Pawan if the filmmaker in him ever emerges and, in the process, guides debutant Janardhan, he says, “Not too much. Being his first feature film, Janardhan would sometimes take many retakes of the same shots, which I said he doesn’t need to do. Apart from that, I suggested some changes in the trailer. There is a montage song picturised on my character, and I asked Janardhan if anyone would really want to watch a song on me (laughs).”
