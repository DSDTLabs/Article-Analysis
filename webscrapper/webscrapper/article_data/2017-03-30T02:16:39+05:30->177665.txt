MUMBAI:   parties, led by the Congress and the NCP, launched a Sangharsh Yatra in Chandrapur on Wednesday to press for a   loan  . They also continued to boycott the proceedings of the assembly for the second week. The   Yatra will proceed from Vidarbha to western Maharashtra and Marathwada and conclude in Panvel on April 4.

 The Congress and NCP have stayed away from the state assembly after the government suspended 19 of their MLAs on March 22.
 
 Education minister Vinod Tawde asked, “The opposition leaders are going for a yatra for farmers in an AC bus. How will this benefit farmers?” 
 
 Dissatisfied with the government’s reply on helping onion farmers, the opposition in the legislative council too staged a walkout on Wednesday. A discussion on the plight of onion farmers was initiated by NCP legislator Jayant Jadhav. 
 
 Minister for agriculture Subhash Khot said the government would improve the infrastructure in Nashik district which is the centre for the onion crop and facilitate the sale of onions.
