NAVI MUMBAI: Even as the currently on mango season as led to the arrival of the golden fruit to   from various parts of the country, there is no proper disposal of the empty mango boxes and crates. 

 Hundreds of empty mango boxes have been simply dumped on the footpath outside the   fruit market, near Turbhe, making it impossible for people to walk past.
 
 The boxes have been thrown outside by various fruit traders, after first sorting out the mangos and selling them inside the market.
 
 “It is shocking how the entire pavement outside the fruit market has been filled with heaps of empty boxes. This puts additional strain on the   to clear the mess. I feel that there should be a better garbage disposal system during the peak mango season,” said activist Anarjit Chauhan.
 
 A Turbhe local said, “It happened last year too when the full pavement stretch was covered with empty mango cartons. The local residents have no option but to walk on the main road due to this problem.''
 
  NMMC Turbhe ward officer, Angai Salunkhe said, “Last week itself we had cleared the footpath of the boxes. Now more crates have been thrown there. We will talk to the APMC traders in order to resolve this issue. Since we don’t know exactly which traders have thrown this trash on the footpath outside the APMC, it becomes difficult to penalize the offenders individually.”
