Margao: An annual budget of approximately Rs 21 lakh was approved during the   gram sabha held on Sunday.

 Macazana panchayat sarpanch Agnelo D’Costa told TOI that, “The annual budget of approximately Rs 21 lakh along with the audit report was approved by the gram sabha members. The villagers questioned the lack of development undertaken by the government since the past one year in power. I reminded the villagers that our MLA Clafasio Dias is an opposition legislator and that he should pursue the development works with the authorities since ours is a small panchayat with an annual income of less than Rs 3 lakh.”
 
 Various development works like construction of nullahs,gutters or drains, hot-mixing of internal village roads were also discussed, he added.
 
 Panchayat secretary Prakash Gaonkar said, “It was also decided to write to the irrigation department regarding inadequate water being supplied to the residents of Ola, Cumpador and Malkizor.”
