GURUGRAM: It’s the time to party in the open air. 

 From April 1, city bars and pubs can serve liquor in open areas, courtesy the new excise policy (2017-18) announced on Sunday. Though it is set to make drinks dearer by 20%, the move has drawn cheers from those who like to chill out under the open sky after a hard day’s work. 
 
 Industry insiders claim that the development, which has done away with the restrict imposed last March on serving liquor outdoors, will benefit around 280 bars and pubs in Gurugram, including around 50 in  .
 
 Bar owners have welcomed the decision, which, they believe, is likely to please customers and boost sales. “Most customers want to sit in an open area, be it a balcony, a terrace or a lawn. Hence, it is a good move,” said Sahil Joshi, general manager, Warehouse Café, Sector 29.
 
 “We are happy that the government has taken a step in favour of the F&B industry. Businesses will definitely benefit as a lot of people want to sit outdoor and enjoy the fresh air over a couple of drinks and food.” Abhimanyu Boken, owner of After Stories, Sector 29.
 
 The relaxation, however, comes with some riders. First: serving alcohol on poolside is not allowed. Second: the open booze zone must not be visible to passersby or people living in neighbouring high rises. Thus, the open bar should be surrounded by walls with regulated entry and exit points, said an excise department official. In case it is a terrace or a balcony, it must have a wall or an immovable fencing with a minimum height of six feet too. And music is not allowed during open-air parties.
 
 Arvind Kumar, general manager, The Wine Company, said some of the norms prescribed in the new policy were easily doable and some were not. But they would have to abide by the law, he added.
 
 The city was robbed of much of its fun quotient after the government banned serving liquor in the open across the state in March last year, causing losses to restauranteurs and pubs.
