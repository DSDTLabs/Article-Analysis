CHENNAI: Advising a drunk man can on occasion be hazardous, but   resident   decided to offer it anyway. The 45-year-old lorry owner died on Saturday of injuries suffered on Thursday when five men, one of who he cautioned against drinking, attacked him. 

 The police have charged Azhar Ali, Jotheeswaran and   with Balu's murder and are looking for two others, including prime accused  . A court has sent the arrested trio to jail.
 
 On May 17, a police officer said, Balu was at a fuel outlet chatting with his friend Siva, who owned the outlet, when Surendran, 30, rode up with his wife. Finding Surendran drunk, Balu and Siva advised him against continuing the habit.
 
 Furious with their unsolicited advice, Surendran left. He returned with four friends and the gang fell upon Balu and Siva with sticks and iron rods. As the duo collapsed beeding profusely, the assailants left the spot.
 
 A few people at the spot informed the police while some others took the injured duo to hospital where Balu died early on Saturday. Siva was discharged earlier.
