KOCHI: The   has been recurring in all three editions of the  , with its representative idea being a wide spectrum ranging from contemporary to historical. 

 When Raul Zurita's 'In the Sea of Pain' represents the anguish of the refugees who were drowned in thousands in the Mediterranean Sea, Anamika Haksar's 'Composition in Water' uses the motif to explore the hardheartedness by which the right to fresh water is denied the dalits. 
 
 The performance which features two water sources - a fresh cascading wall of water placed in glaring contrast to a rusted drain pipe spewing dirty water - structures water as a metaphor of class, hygiene, and purity.
 
 'Kaalapani' (Blackwater), an artwork by Andrew Ananda Voogel in KMB 2014 used the seawater to illustrate the trauma of the Jahajis of Guyana, a community whose ancestors were Indian indentured workers who were employed in the Carribean sugarcane plantations. Anish Kapoor's 'Descension', a whirling black pool of water in the same edition was an attempt to destabilize the experience of the strength of the ground we stand on, pointing to the transience of human existence.
 
 In Alfredo Jaar's 'Cloud for Kochi' in KMB 2012, an effective use of neon and water which are symbolic of modernity and history respectively, was employed to place the idea of Kochi and Muziris - the former that came into being with the submergence of the latter underwater - inside an eerie room lit by neon script on the walls made legible only by its reflection on the water.
 
 Water or sea, man's first means of escape to outside world, and the element which carried the outside world to Indian shores is a significant part of Kochi's present and of Muziris's past, and thus a persistent motif in the Kochi Muziris Biennale.
