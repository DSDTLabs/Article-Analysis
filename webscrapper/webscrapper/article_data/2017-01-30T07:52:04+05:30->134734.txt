LAMBI/BARNALA:   Capt Amarinder Singh on Sunday campaigned in the   for the first time after filing his nomination papers on January 18. Amarinder is facing chief minister   and shoe thrower Delhi MLA Jarnail Singh from Lambi, Badal’s bastion.

 Addressing election meetings at Panjawa and Sarawa Bodla villages in Lambi, Amarinder made an all-out attack on the Badals and promised to throw the CM, his ministers and officers on special duty in jail for destroying lives of people. He lambasted Badal for the growing incidents of sacrilege in the state, which he said was an attempt by the Akalis to divide Punjab on communal lines.
 
 He came down heavily on Badal for the misdeeds of his ministers. He also lashed out at AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal and said, “He is a rank outsider and a liar of the first order, with no interest in the welfare of Punjab or its people. Kejriwal will never protect the interests of the state.” Amarinder dubbed both Kejriwal and Badal as “maha gappus” (liars), saying that they could not be trusted. “While the Badals had been busy minting money at the cost of the interests of the people of Punjab, Kejriwal was now trying to grab whatever was left of the state to further his own interests,” he added.
 
 Later, at Barnala while campaigning for party candidate and two-time MLA Kewal Singh Dhillon, Amarinder said AAP’s dangerous combination of the extreme left and extreme right ideologies could once again plunge Punjab into the dark days of terrorism. Dhillon also came down heavily on the Badals and blamed them for ignoring development of the region.
