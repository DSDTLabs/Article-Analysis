PATIALA: Hours after   took oath as the 26th Chief Minister of Punjab, president of the   ( ) Kirpal Singh Badungar said they would honour Amarinder by presenting him with a 'siropa' (robe of honour) at the Golden Temple. 

 The SGPC chief said it was a step forward to end the 'politics of confrontation in the state. “There is a need for joint efforts to resolve issues concerning the state and SGPC would be contributing in this regard. Whenever Captain and his team would visit the Golden Temple the Singh Sahibans and the SGPC would accord full honour to them.” 
 
 Interestingly, during his earlier stint as Chief Minister, Amarinder Singh had been denied a Siropa when he had visited Golden Temple in 2002.
 
 At that time also Kirpal Singh Badungar, who is also from   like Captain, was the SGPC chief. Reciting a 'shalok' from the Gurbani, Badungar said one should never harp on the past and instead work for a better future.

This time also Badungar returned to the affairs of the mini Sikh parliament in November, 2016 and Amarinder Singh took oath of office in March 2017 making Patiala the hub of both political and religious powers of the state.
