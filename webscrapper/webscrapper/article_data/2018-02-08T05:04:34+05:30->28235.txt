MUMBAI: In the first such stringent action against  , the   is seeking to blacklist two for cheating. They were found mixing debris with garbage in a probable bid to extract more money from the civic body.

 The BMC started the process earlier this week after it was found that the two contractors had indulged in the malpractice while transporting solid waste from several pockets to the dumps more than four times a month, the limit stipulated in the contracts.
 
 "We have issued the two companies blacklisting notices. They would be barred from participating in any BMC contract," said a civic official.
 
 The two companies - "RSJ" and "Dcon Do it" - were not the only ones found cheating the BMC; there were five more. Last September, the BMC had issued showcause notices to the seven contractors. A police complaint was also registered, but no FIR has yet been filed. "The police said they are investigating our claims after which an FIR would be filed," said the official.
 
 BMC additional municipal commissioner Vijay Singhal said taking serious cognizance of the matter they have decided to blacklist the two companies. "While there were other contractors too, we levied a penalty on them. But in the case of these two, we found they had indulged in the malpractice more than four times and, therefore, stringent action was taken," said Singhal.
 
 He added that the crackdown on contractors was one of the reasons why the quantum of solid waste collected in the city was witnessing a drop. Till last August, around 7,700 metric tonnes of trash was reaching the three dumping grounds daily. It is now down to about 7,311 metric tonnes.
 
 Opposition leader in the BMC Ravi Raja said if municipal officials were more vigilant, such incidents could have been avoided.   corporator Makrand Narvekar said this was a good move as it would deter contractors in future from indulging in such corrupt practices.
