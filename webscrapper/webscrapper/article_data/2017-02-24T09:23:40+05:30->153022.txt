KOLKATA: On Thursday morning, when the lights in her   coach flickered and gave way to the emergency ones and the train slowed, Nandita Mitra feared it would be a repeat of what she went through three years ago, when the marketing executive was among 600-odd passengers trapped inside a train for more than an hour between Maidan and Park Street. Fortunately this time, though the train slowed, it didn’t stop.

 “I suffer from mild claustrophobia, but have to take the Metro. My job requires extensive travelling. Being a single parent, I can’t afford cabs all the time and buses are out of the question. In 2014, I had nearly collapsed. Fortunately, nothing of that sort happened today,” she said.
 
 Thursday’s incident, which happened during peak office hours, was the first in Metro’s recent history. The power supply from   collapsed at 9.53am, when trains were chock-a-block. “Winter’s gone and it gets uncomfortable in the crowded non-AC coaches. There was also the tension everybody felt after lights went out,” said Arkaprabha Roy, who commutes daily from Garia to Bhowanipore.
 
 Metro Railway has four receiving sub-stations at Noapara, Shyambazar, Jatin Das Park and Central stations. Each of these has two feeds. According to Metro CPRO Indrani Banerjee, even if three sub-stations fail, operations can continue. “Never have all four failed simultaneously. Even after the Eastern Grid failed in 2012, our services continued. Fortunately, the approaches to all our stations, except Dum Dum and Mahanayak Uttam Kumar, have slopes or are horizontal and the trains rolled in due to inertia. Pneumatic brakes were applied to stop them at the platforms. Power supply was restored at 10.08am,” she said.
