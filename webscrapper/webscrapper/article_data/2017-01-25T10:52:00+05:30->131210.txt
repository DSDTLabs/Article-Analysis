CHENNAI: The   has issued stop work notice to the authorities of the   after a news report in TOI on January 22 on the matter. 

 The notice from executive officer   said, "It is brought to the notice of the undersigned that (work on extending the temple was started) without obtaining valid permission from the undersigned as required under section 48 of the Tamil Nadu Town and   You have been asked to stop work failing which penal action will be taken as per the provisions of the act."
 
 The report "Temple being extended on  : Residents" had mentioned the allegation that a former officer of the panchayat was part of an effort to extend the temple, by encroaching upon the bund and walkway of the lake. A group of residents led by Sunil Jayaram, an activist, on Saturday submitted a petition to Shenbagarajan, it said.
 
 The Chitlapakkam lake used be the main source of irrigation to agricultural land in the area until two decades ago, residents said.
 
 Over the years, thanks to systematic encroachment by builders and others, the lake which originally sprawled over 80 acres had shrunk to a meagre 30 acres, they said.
 
 In July 2016, the water resources wing of the public works department had written to the Kancheepuram revenue officials to demarcate the boundaries of the water body. Subsequently, officials found that the lake had been encroached upon near Kannagi Street and Periyar Street, but little was done after that to remove the encroachements, they alleged.
 
 Several other water bodies in the suburbs had suffered the same fate, they said.
