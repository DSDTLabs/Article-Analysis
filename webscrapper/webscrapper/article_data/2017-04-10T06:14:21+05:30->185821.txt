GURUGRAM: Delhi, Mumbai, Baroda and Chandigarh are all set to replicate  , which has helped relocate 1,100 street vendors to 11 different locations across the city. A 11-member team from Baroda and two-member teams from Chandigarh, Delhi and Mumbai municipal corporations visited the city to study the civic body’s new street vending model.

 MCG has designed colourful carts (rehris) at specially earmarked zones, including sectors 56, 38 and 39.
 
 MCG’s city project officer   told TOI, “We carried out a survey, identified street vendors and submitted a report on how and where these vends can be placed. This project is aimed at cutting down snarls owing to encroachment on roads by vendors, and at the same time, providing quality street food to people. With this project, we also aim to make the city the hub of high standard street food.”
 
 At present, vendors are paying Rs 1,500 per month to the corporation for maintenance of the area, which includes installation of street lights, grass carpeting of the area, etc. 
 
 The project will also make arrangements for seating for customers and visitors, restrooms and drinking water facility. According to officials, special training sessions have also been held by the corporation to provide high standard street food to people.
