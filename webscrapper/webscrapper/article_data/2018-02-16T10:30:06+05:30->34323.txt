BHOPAL:   wore a deserted look on Thursday after traders went on strike in protest against the auction of parking lots on its premises.

 The mandi was bereft of regular hustle and bustle of tractor trollies or din created by the traders and farmers during the auction of vegetables and fruits. The immediate fallout of the strike was felt in the retail vegetable markets of the capital where veggie prices witnessed a rising trend. Moreover, the mandi board has incurred a loss of about Rs 2.5 lakh.
 
  
  
 
 Secretary of the traders association of fruits and vegetables Rajendra   termed the auction of parking lots as illegal and said nowhere in Madhya Pradesh farmers and traders pay for parking. “The strike will continue till the mandi administration withdraws its orders,” he said. He alleged that ‘henchmen’ of contractors also extort money in the name of parking fees.
 
 As no farmer turned up in the mandi with his produce, the vegetable rates have started climbing in the retail markets. Besides, rates of fruits have also gone up. Saini said, “Tomato, which was priced at Rs 10 a kg in retail before the strike is now being sold at many markets at Rs 20 per kg. Green chillies prices have gone up to Rs 50 to Rs 60 a kg. As far as fruits are concerned, papaya is being sold for Rs 30 a kg, almost Rs 10 up from yesterday’s price.”
 
 Achche Miyan, a retailer in New Market, said: “Rates of fruits and vegetables in the city are likely to go up further if the mandi strike continues. There was already a shortage of commodities on Thursday”.
 
 Joint director of mandi   urged the traders to end their agitation. She said she has directed mandi secretary   to resolve the issue. However, the traders’ meeting with   on Thursday afternoon did not yield any result and the strike is likely to continue on Friday as well.
