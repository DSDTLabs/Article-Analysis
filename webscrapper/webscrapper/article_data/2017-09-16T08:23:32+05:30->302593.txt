KOLKATA: Hopefully , migratory birds like moorhens and lesser whistling ducks that fly thousands of miles to spend the winter at Santragachhi Jheel, will get a serene place to rest from this year onward.

 The state government submitted before the   ( ), Eastern Zone Bench, that nearly 31.57 acre waterbody has been declared a `silence zone' through a notification. The notification states that it is now the responsibility of the   (HMC),   (HPC) and South Eastern Railway (SER) to enforce noise pollution norms in the area.
 
 While SER, who are the owners of the lake, have already come up with a programme to restrict noise from train operations at the nearby Santragachi station, the NGT expressed displeasure as HMC and HPC are yet to finalise plans. The bench of Justice S P Wangdi and Prof P C Mishra also directed the respondents to finalise details for land that is to be used for a sewage treatment plant (STP) beside the lake within three weeks.
 
 It was the NGT that directed the state government to declare Santragachi Jheel a `silence zone' while hearing an application by environment activist Subhas Datta. It has been nearly six months since the bench passed directions on reducing pollution ­ both noise and otherwise ­ near the lake but the HMC has been dragging its feet on the matter. While the issue of land for the STP hasn't been sorted out with SER as yet, directions to evict squatters from the area haven't been abided by as yet.
 
 While HMC will earmark the land for the STP , it will be paid for by SER (since the rest of it is owned by the railways).
