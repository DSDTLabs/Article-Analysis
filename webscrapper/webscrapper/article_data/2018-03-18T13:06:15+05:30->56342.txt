If you turn heads even with those small monsters called pimples, so can they. If you are entitled to a bad hair day, so are they. If cinema is a true reflection of life and the janta’s verdict is any pointer, then ‘normal’ is in. Ever since   forayed into south cinema with   film Premam in 2015 — and followed it up with back-to-back successes like Kali, Fidaa and Middle Class Abbayi — the movie-going audience has come to believe that there’s nothing bad about a pimply face and nothing worse than hiding it. In Kolkata to shoot her next, Sai looked every bit the middle-class girl in Telugu film Padi Padi Leche Manasu, said my friends who saw her from a distance. Wading through a sea of people on an outdoor shoot, she still managed to hold her own, as her unkempt hair flirted with the afternoon breeze and twinkling eyes sans makeup added character to her face. 
Sadly, Tollywood, the poorer cousin of the other   down south, is richer in the greasepaint game. I know heroines who flaunt red lips in the morning and go to bed with painted, arched eyebrows. Taking the game up several notches, a few are secretly opting for cosmetic surgeries, or so I hear. A makeup artist said Bangkok is now the go-to place for many of our Tolly girls, where they go under the knife. I was shocked to see a heroine’s pics on   recently, where the unrealistic outline of her lips caught my eyes more than the perfect-10 shape she’s in. All this when larger-than-life cinema is losing its charm! Makeup, they say, is art, but beauty is spirit.
