PUNE: The   on Tuesday confirmed   to four developers-cum-partners and   of the   housing project in   in connection with the slab collapse tragedy.

 On July 29 last year, nine labourers were killed and three others were injured when a 13th floor slab of the housing project caved in while the construction work was on. 
 
 In January, the SC had granted an interim anticipatory bail to the   — Kailash Babulal Wani, Arvind P Jain, Shamkant Jagannath Wani (Shende) and Shravan D Agarwal — and architect Pradeep J Kosumbkar, pending final orders on their special leave petitions (SLPs) for the bail. 
 
 The state government’s standing counsel Nishant R Katneshwarkar told TOI, “The bench passed an order confirming the anticipatory bail following a brief proceeding today (Tuesday). The court observed that the custody of the (bail) applicants was not required as they can be summoned as and when needed by the police for furthering the investigation.” 
 
 Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and Rohintan Fali Nariman, comprising the SC bench, presided over the hearing of the SLPs. On April 5, the apex court had directed the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to furnish up-to-date records in respect of the construction on 13th and 14th floors of the project. Also, the civic body was to place on record the sanctioned plan granted by it. The developers had allegedly gone ahead with the construction of these two additional floors as against the sanctioned plan for a 12-floor building. 
 
 “Consequent to the apex court’s order on Tuesday, the four developers and the architect will remain on bail till the conclusion of the trial,” said a lawyer, who represented them in an earlier proceeding before the sessions court in Pune.
