BARCELONA: The government is looking at a fresh round of spectrum auction between July and December and will send a recommendation to the telecom regulator soon, a top official said on Tuesday. 

 “We are looking to do a spectrum auction every year so that telcos can plan their needs, whether they need to trade it, buy it from someone else or come to the auction. This ensures complete certainty and policy stability,   told reporters on the sidelines of the  . 
 
 “And we are soon going to send a request to TRAI for recommendations for the next auction, which I believe would be held between July and December. It will be annual auction done every year. How much of spectrum to be sold, the price, newer spectrum bands — all issues will be considered,” he said. 
 
 Deepak said the government is not worried about unsold spectrum. Bharti chairman Sunil Mittal had said on Monday that he does not see any   in 2017-18 as operators had tanked up on spectrum. Deepak said, “We are not worried if there is no demand for spectrum. We don’t get hassled if spectrum remains unsold. But we would like to give opportunity to the industry to buy spectrum as and when they need.” 
 
 Deepak reiterated his views on consolidation backing five operators in the space. “If you look at the competition index for India, what it shows broadly competition goes up as the operators increase till it reaches five after that it plateaus out,” he said. The telecom secretary said the government was working to ensure that it takes a leap on 5G and is issuing guidelines on use of high frequency spectrum bands. 
 
 “We are very keen to be with the world. We have done a lot of preparation. We came out M2M guideline (machine-to-machine) in 2015. We have issued a draft service providers guidelines on which we have got comments. We were late in 3G and 4G and we were very keen that should not be deprived of 5G,” he said.
