THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The   ( ) has decided to speed up the procedures for introducing  .

 The department has approached the architects of the e-governance application (Vahan) under National Transport Project of Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and PSUs MSTC Ltd and Keltron for developing the   software.
 
  “The MSTC software is a good system, but not as per the rules of MVD. Vahan is a different system and is applicable to motor vehicle services at national level. So we have asked them to develop a customised software as per the norms of the state. Keltron was also informed about the requirements,” said an official with MVD.
 
 TOI had reported about the malpractice in the auction of previous series KL 01 CA, in which a billionaire had won the ‘KL 01 CA 1’ registration number at Rs 1.02 lakh. While the reservation amount of the serial number 1 was Rs one lakh, it was won in a bid of Rs 2,000. Following the incident, MVD had issued a strict directive to regional transport officers to video record the procedures and instructed not to allow those who had reserved numbers but did not turn up for the auctions earlier to participate in future auctions. In the latest auction, held after the directive was implemented, the number ‘KL 01 CB 1’ was auctioned at Rs 19 lakh, implying that the strict enforcement was effective.
 
 “After we zero in on a model software, we have to modify it as per our system,” said transport commissioner  , adding that the software would not be ready for the next auction.
