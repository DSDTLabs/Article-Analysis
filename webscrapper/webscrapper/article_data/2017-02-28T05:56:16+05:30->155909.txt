PATNA: In a bid to keep antisocial elements and rumour-mongers at bay,   (BSEB) chairman   on Monday announced that video recording will be done outside the   examination centres as well from March 1.

 According to sources, the step was taken in view of the February 16 rumour that the biology paper of the Intermediate exams that ended on Saturday had gone viral on WhatsApp.
 
 Chief secretary   also held a video conference with Kishor, DGP P K Thakur, ADG (headquarters)  , district magistrates and senior cops of different districts in this connection. He instructed the officials concerned to conduct the exams in a fair manner by visiting the centres and ensuring there was no crowd outside.
 
 A control room was also made functional from Sunday which will remain active 24X7 till the exams end. Students can get their queries solved or complaint lodged (if any) by calling up on 0612-2232092. They can also send an e-mail or a fax on coe.matricboard@gmail.com and 0612-2222575/2222576 respectively.
 
 Sources said the district administration was trying its best to shed Bihar’s “dented” image because of last year’s topper scam and largescale copying in the Matric exams at a centre in Vaishali in 2015
