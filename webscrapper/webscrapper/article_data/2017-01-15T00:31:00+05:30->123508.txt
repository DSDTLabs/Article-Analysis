 Jaipur: Rajasthan University (RU) has introduced series of lectures by IAS officers for students aspiring for civil service exams in the university and its constituent colleges. These officers will share the tricks on ways to prepare for the examination along with sessions on clearing the interviews.
 
 The move is intended to regain the old glory of RU by having good number of selections in civil service examination every year. Until few decades ago, RU was among the leading university in the country in terms of highest number of selections in civil service.
 
 The idea is a brainchild of newly appointed vice-chancellor Rajeshwar Singh who has served as the V-C of MLS University in Udaipur. Singh on Friday directed the dean of students’ welfare to initiate a process in this regard. The university is identifying officers for delivering lectures in the campus. Bhupendra Singh Shekawat, chief public relations officer, told TOI, “In first phase, these sessions will be held for hostel students. Later, it will be organised for other students of the university and its constituent colleges.”
 
 Dean of students’ welfare has given the responsibility of completing all formalities required for the scheme. The university is hoping to rope in senior IAS officers who are posted in Jaipur for the sessions. “Students’ union office has also been asked to identify students who have recently cleared RAS examination and to felicitate them in order to build a relationship with them,” said Shekawat.
