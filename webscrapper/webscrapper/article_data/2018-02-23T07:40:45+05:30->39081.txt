New Delhi: Armed with the statement of the advisor to the chief minister, V K Jain, Delhi Police is making a watertight case against the AAP MLAs who allegedly assaulted chief secretary   on Monday night. The police had on Wednesday recorded Jain’s statement before a magistrate in which he is learnt to have said that he was witness to the attack on Prakash. 

 “We have invoked sections of criminal conspiracy after it was found that the chief secretary was called and made to sit between the two accused MLAs during the meeting. He was usually offered a separate seat during the meeting or near the chief minister,” claimed additional DCP (north) Harendra Singh.
 
  
  
 
 Inquiries have revealed that the chief secretary was unaware of the agenda for the meeting till he reached the chief minister’s residence. The attack took place in a span of eight minutes, seven seconds, claimed Singh. “The complainant had even requested that there was no need to call a meeting at midnight over the issue and it could have convened the next morning. However, as soon as it started, the MLAs got into a confrontation with him.”
 
 The police claim that during the discussion over releasing funds for advertisements, the chief secretary had argued that he did not approve funds for television advertisements since he had found the price to be too high and that this had angered the AAP MLAs. The chief secretary was not allowed to speak after this. One of the MLAs in the room had shouted back at him saying that he could have diverted the funds from the ministry of tourism, the police claimed.
 
 During this confronation, according to the police, AAP MLAs   and   pushed the chief secretary’s cheeks with their fingers, holding his jaws in their palm. 
 
 Delhi Police are planning to question others, including the 11 MLAs who were present in the room. 
 
 Jain might also be called for questioning again.
