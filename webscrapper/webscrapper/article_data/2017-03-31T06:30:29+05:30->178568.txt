LUCKNOW: As   presents its budget for FY 2017-18, TOI brings to you three key public interest decisions taken on the sidelines of executive committee meeting held on March 30. The decisions will deal with most pertinent problems of city like cleanliness and damaged roads. 

 
  Corporators who have shortfall of sanitary workers can spend Rs1 lakh per month from April to June, 2017 to hire private sweepers to broom streets and clean garbage from their wards. The aim is to keep all 110 wards clean to support LMC’s   for next 3 months. Hence corporators can allocate a maximum of Rs1 lakh every month from their ward development fund to hire extra workforce. Every corporator would get Rs 85 lakh per year for his ward’s development. If he faces shortage of workers, he can use funds for hiring new workers. 
 
 
  Following CM Yogi’s orders to repair potholes on all roads by June 15, LMC has asked executive engineers of all its 8 zones to identify major potholes and craters on all roads of their area by April 15 and repair all of them by May 15. With this schedule, they will be left over with 30 days’ grace period which they can use for reassessing the situation and repairing the leftover craters, if any.   said that the new government has set cleanliness as the biggest priority, for which all municipal bodies have to ensure regular cleaning of city. 
 
 Covering of all manholes by May 10- LMC has assigned Jal Kal with the responsibility to cover all open manholes and do desilting of all sewer lines by May 10. Jal Kal will begin a rigorous drive from April 10 to identify open manholes and choked sewer lines across all localities and then repair them in next one month. Jal Kal claims that on an average, about 30% manholes are open in city even if they cover about 20-30 manholes every day. Under this special drive, Jal Kal will aim to repair and fix all problems related to sewer lines by early May.
