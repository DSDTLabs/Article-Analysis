NAVI MUMBAI: The anti-extortion cell of the crime branch has arrested the two robbers, that include a jewellery store owner in Trombay, who had looted Rs 65 lakh worth gold ornaments from a jewellery store in   after injuring the jeweller with a chopper. 

 The cops have detected the case within one week of the incident that had occurred on May 17 evening at   in   in sector 36 of Kamothe.
 
 The arrested duo includes Madan Singh Kharwad (27), who owns a jewellery store in Trombay and Shahnawaz Abdul Jabbar Mansuri (22), who worked at a carpentry warehouse near the jeweller’s store.
 
 Joint commissioner of police Prashant Burde said, “Kharwad had planned the robbery with his aide Mansuri as the former was under huge debt. Kharwad had purchased gold on credit from wholesale jewellers at Zaveri bazar and could not repay as he suffered huge losses in business at his jewellery store.

 The case was detected with the help of the CCTV camera footage of the building and the mobile tower data of the robbers. 
 
 “The duo robbers were traced to Cheetah Camp in Trombay on Thursday and out of the total booty of 2 kg gold, as claimed by the complainant jeweller  , we have recovered around 596 gm of gold ornaments looted from Jain’s store, whose value is worth Rs 18.85 lakh,” said Burde.
 
 The police have obtained police custody of the two arrested robbers till June 1 in order seek time to interrogate them and recover the remaining gold ornaments. 
 
  Rs 1 lakh cash that was stolen along with the gold ornaments have not been recovered from them.
 
 A police source said, “It is also being ascertained whether the quantity of gold robbed was actually 2 kg or less, as the jeweller will be claiming insurance for the loss.”
