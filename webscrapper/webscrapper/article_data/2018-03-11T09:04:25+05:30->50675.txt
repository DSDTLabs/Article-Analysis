TRICHY: Even as the better road stretches in the city were given a fresh lease of life with a new layer of roads,   and approach roads of   flyover that deserve immediate attention by the civic body, continue to remain in a pathetic state. 

 In 2017, Rs 11 crore was sanctioned by the civic body to take up 38 road projects, in which a majority of works were completed except for laying of road markings in the completed stretch. However, the roadworks did not consider taking up the most damaged stretches in the city particularly the Pattabiraman salai road and approach roads of Thennur flyover.
 
 “Whenever there is a public meeting at Thennur Uzhavar Sandhai grounds, most of the vehicles from   and Thennur would reach Cantonment via Pattabiraman Salai. Considering the importance of the road, the corporation should have refurbished the road at first place,” S Dharmaraj, a resident of Thennur said.
 
 The km-long Pattabirarman salai is infamous for its back-breaking journeys. A little far away, the two approach roads of Thennur flyover crucial for vehicles from   to commute over the Thennur flyover and Thennur High road has been in a bad shape of almost three years now, lamented the locals. When contacted, a senior official said, “We have planned to take up patch work in Pattabiraman salai. New roads will be laid for approach roads of Thennur flyover, based on the ensuing budget.”
