Madurai: As many as 100 survivors of retinoblastoma, a form of eye cancer that mostly affects young children, attended the retinoblastoma week celebrations at the Aravind Eye Hospitals here on Saturday. The event aims at creating awareness about this disease that affects children and has been increasingly reported.

 During the event, the children and their parents recalled the experience from the time of detection of the cancer to recovery. Dr Usha Kim, chief medical officer, said that retinoblastoma was a form of cancer, which usually affected children in the age group of 18 months to five years. “If detected early, the eye and vision of the child could be saved; otherwise it could spread to other parts of the body and lead to enucleation (removal of eye) or cause loss of life.”
 
 The hospital had managed to cure as many as 582 children since the year 2004, with the help of the Ring of Hope Fund, which helped in providing free treatment to the patients, including their medical treatment, hospital stay and also accommodation for their two attenders as the patients were predominantly children. Aravind hospital’s ocular cancer genetic centre, a detection lab has helped many siblings affected by retinoblastoma from losing their eyes and also prevent the disease through early intervention. Citing an example of one of the survivors who will be writing her Class XII exams next year, Dr Kim said, “There is nothing gratifying to see these survivors performing well in their studies and achieving greater heights.’’
