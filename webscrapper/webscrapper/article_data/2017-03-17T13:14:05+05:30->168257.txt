SURAT: Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) convener Hardik Patel on Thursday said he would like ballot papers to be used instead of electronic voting machines ( ) during the ensuing assembly elections in Gujarat. 

 Hardik, who came to the city to mark his attendance at the office of crime branch of Surat police to fulfill his bail condition in the sedition case, said, EVM should not be used in Gujarat. The PAAS convener said he supported Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader Mayawati in her demand for probe into alleged tampering of EVMs during the recently held assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. “I support her view on EVMs and want assembly elections in Gujarat to be held with ballot papers only,” he said.
 
 Hardik also attended the hearing in the sedition case in a local court which is expected to frame charges on March 23. PAAS has come up with posters saying Hardik would be addressing a public meeting in the city on March 19. The posters also have pictures of   and Sardar Patel along with that of Hardik. Recently, some posters surfaced in parts of the state, which were critical of Hardik. PAAS is organizing a public meeting of Hardik in the city to counter that. 
 
 PAAS co-convener Dharmik Malaviya said, “These posters seek to create public awareness about the public meeting. There is no opposition to us. We expect more than 50,000 people at the meeting.”
