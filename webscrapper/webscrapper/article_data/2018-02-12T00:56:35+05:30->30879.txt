MUMBAI: Nearly 56% accident-prone spots in the suburbs are on  , and speeding is the main cause for fatalities, the   department, which released a list of 32 black spots, has revealed.

 The eastern suburbs had 17 black spots, from Chembur to Mankhurd/Mulund. The western had 15 spots between Bandra and Dahisar. The list serves as an eye-opener for enforcement agencies and citizens to curb fatalities on city roads.
 
 Incidentally, most black spots were on Eastern and Western Express Highways: 10 on eastern and 8 on western, the report indicated.
 
 “The list has been released to emphasize on these black spots, take corrective action and prevent mishaps,” said a senior transport official. TOI had recently highlighted seven black spots in the island city, released by Tardeo RTO. With the 32 new locations, the city has 39 accident-prone areas where mishaps were maximum for the past few years.
 
 The list will be shared with traffic police, which will conduct special drives at these locations, ensure there are speed checks, vehicles observe lane discipline and those jumping signals or speeding are fined. Most spots were close to flyovers/bridges and traffic signals, where cars and heavy vehicles cross each other. Any wrong turn, signal-jumping, rash and negligent driving or driving/riding in wrong direction can lead to mishaps, said an official.
