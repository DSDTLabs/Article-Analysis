LUCKNOW: Over five lakh   cases in Uttar Pradesh go unreported, according to an estimate from the state health department. This poses a serious threat to public health besides creating a huge road block in India’s goal o become   free by 2025.

 Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Arun Sinha said this happens because the private   in UP do not report TB cases. Earlier, Sinha apprised Niti Aayog delegation about the problems faced in this regard.
 
  According to Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 2.6 lakh TB cases were reported in UP in 2016. A previous report by World Health Organisation and assessment of various reports published in medical journal Lancet (August 2016 edition), India’s TB burden doesn’t include cases from the private sector which is about two times more than the official public sector data. This formula translates into 7.8 lakh TB cases in UP, of which 5.2 lakh could be existing in the private sector.
 
  Only 37,000 of the possible five lakh TB cases from the private sector were notified.
 
 “This means that only one in 10 TB cases in private sector is reported in UP. Notifying TB is a social responsibility   and health professional cannot deny,” said state TB officer Dr Alok Ranjan.
 
 The role of private sector is crucial as it is contributing to high rate of TB deaths in India which saw 4.8 lakh deaths in 2015 – twice the loss in 2014. Of these, 12 % or 57,600 deaths were reported in UP. The numbers (for UP) translate into loss of six lives every hour.
 
 Mission director, National Health Mission, Alok Kumar said a policy of persuasion is being framed to rope in private practitioners. “The plan includes making DMs and CMOs accountable for the job. They will have to make private doctors and registered clinics report TB cases on priority,” he said.
