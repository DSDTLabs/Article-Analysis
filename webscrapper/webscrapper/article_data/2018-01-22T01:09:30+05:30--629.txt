Tiruvannamalai: Accusing the   of not coming to school regularly and also not taking classes, the students of a panchayat union middle school at Mutnattur in Nammiyampattu panchayat in Jawadhu Hills have stopped going to school. They have kept themselves off the campus since Thursday demanding that the education department transfer the headmaster from the school. 

 Sources in the education department said that the students and members of the school management committee had staged a demonstration in front of the school on Friday in protest against the headmaster, S Ravi. Nearly 90 students took part in it. 
 
 A total of 110 students are studying in the school from class I to VIII. 
 
 “The HM comes to school by 11am, but he never takes classes. He leaves by 3pm. When we ask him for any doubts, he will scold us,” a student alleged. A group of 50 other students chimed the same and demanded that the authorities transfer him from the school. 
 
 The parents and members of the school management committee have also decided not to send their children to school until the education department replaces Ravi. 
 
 Upon information, officials from the education department visited the school and conducted an inquiry with the students and their parents. Assuring suitable action, the officials requested the parents to send their wards to the school.
