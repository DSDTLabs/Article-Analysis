 fans in Tamil Nadu have a reason to celebrate. The ‘Prince’ is all set to march into the industry with the action-entertainer and spy thriller. Here are 5 reasons movie buffs would like to watch the film:

 
 
 It’s not often one gets to see one of the biggest stars in the Telugu film industry making inroads in Kollywood. So, when he does it’s a reason to celebrate. Mahesh Babu looks as dashing as ever and the icing on the cake is that he has delivered his lines on his own. People are sure to line up to theatres to hear their favourite star speak in Tamil.
 
 
 
 
 
 This is the first time that we are going to see this duo on screen.Rakul Preet Singh made her debut with Arun Vijay’s Thadaiyara Thaaka. She appeared in a small role.This was followed by Puthagam. However, in this film, Rakul is said to have a solid character. It would be interesting to see the actress paired up with Mahesh Babu before her film with Suriya and Karthi hits screens. Rakul plays a girl-next-door in the film and the chemistry in the trailer was sure a sizzling one.
 
 
 
 This is the first time that   and Mahesh Babu are teaming up for a film. It would be interesting too if the film turns out to be like the former’s Thuppakki. But considering the film is a spy thriller, its sure going to be action-packed entertainer. 
 
 
 Music composer Harris Jayaraj has composed for Telugu film after a long gap of seven years.This is the fourth collaboration with AR Murugadoss after the chartbusters in Ghajini, 7aum Arivu and Thuppakki. This is the second time he has scored music for a Mahesh Babu film. The last time he composed for Prince was eleven years ago, in Sainikudu. The film also marks the debut of Madhan Karky as a lyricist in Telugu.
 
 
 We hear that Mahesh Babu has performed the stunts himself without a body double. With Bharath playing the negative lead, it would be interesting to see the two actors at loggerheads.
