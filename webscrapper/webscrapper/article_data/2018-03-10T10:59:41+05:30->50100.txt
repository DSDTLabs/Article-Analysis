 Judge Chandani Sharma, who granted Solanki’s custody to the police till March 11, also directed that she need not be produced in court after her remand is over.

However, Solanki was released on bail by the court with condition that she would remain present at each hearing of the case.

 Rabari’s family members accused Solanki of mental torture as they suspected her to be his girlfriend.
 
 While seeking remand, police argued that they would like to interrogate Solanki about her relationship with Rabari and what conversation she had with him in his last phone call on the night he shot himself. They also wanted to know the truth about her relationship with Rabari.
