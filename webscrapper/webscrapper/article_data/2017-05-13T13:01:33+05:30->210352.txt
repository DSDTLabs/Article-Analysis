PANAJI: The Congress on Friday poked fun at chief minister Manohar Parrikar saying his decision to impose curbs on the press is an “excuse to hide his insecurity”.

  Addressing a press conference, AICC secretary and Congress spokesperson   said that the Congress party would write to Prime Minister   complaining that Parrikar was trying to clamp down on accountability and transparency.
 
 Congress also alleged that the   was using state machinery, especially the police, to target opposition MLAs, especially   MLA Digambar Kamat.   demanded that notices issued by Goa police to some media houses for reporting on the anticipatory bail application and magisterial statement be withdrawn.
 
 Parrikar has expressed an interest in restricting the movement of journalists at the ministerial block at the assembly and secretariat complex at Porvorim.
 
 “There has to be transparency. Parrikar’s mentality is that whatever he does he is always right and nobody has the right to question him. To prevent the entry of the media into government offices is a bad precedence,” Chodankar said.
 
  “Is it out of insecurity that he is keeping the media out or preventing them from meeting ministers? Unless there is something to hide, why prevent the entry of journalists into the secretariat?” Chodankar asked.
