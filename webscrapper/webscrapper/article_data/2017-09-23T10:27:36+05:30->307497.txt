CHANDRAPUR: Corporator Pradeep   has charged that over 2,100 students studying in 36   in the city are deprived of their rightful free uniforms even after almost four months of the current academic session.

 “Many private schools are luring the students away from municipal schools with the promise of free uniforms,” he said.
 
 Deshmukh said the municipal corporation provides two   to each student studying in its primary school every year through   grants. “For the first time in the civic body’s history, many students in municipal schools attended the Independence Day programme without uniforms,” he added.
