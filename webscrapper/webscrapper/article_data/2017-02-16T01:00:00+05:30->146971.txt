Dheeraj Dhoopar has completed one of his resolutions for 2017, and he credits wife   for helping him tick it off the list. The actor, who tied the knot with Vinny a few months ago, went scuba diving in   with her to get over his fear of water. Dheeraj says, “I’m aquaphobic and I somehow wanted to overcome it. So, when we honeymooned in Maldives, Vinny and I took a three-day course in scuba diving. She is an excellent swimmer, and the fact that she was by my side boosted my confidence. I told her, ‘Whatever happens, keep looking at me’. After indulging in the sport, I’ve overcome my fear.”

  
  
 Vinny adds, “Dheeraj has never entered a water body before, not even a swimming pool. So, to do scuba diving in an ocean was a huge achievement. He was confident and positive about the whole experience.”
 
 Now, Dheeraj is planning to help Vinny overcome her fear of heights by taking her sky diving and paragliding. Talk about being an ideal couple!
