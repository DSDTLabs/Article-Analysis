MALAPPURAM: National Democratic Alliance (NDA) will launch a series of protests to put pressure on the state government to kick off the final location survey (FLS) for the proposed   rail line connecting Kerala and Karnataka. 

 BJP had organized a protest meet in Nilambur in January against the indefinite delay in conducting the FLS. The series of protests planned under the NDA banner are a continuation of the protest meet held in Nilambur.
 
 BJP district president   said NDA will go ahead with the protest as the state government has been trying sabotage the project for political reasons. "The first protest meet would be held in Angadipuram in the coming week and the programmes to follow would be announced soon," he said.
 
 PC Thomas, leader of the Kerala Congress faction, which has allied with NDA, said here on Tuesday that the state government's lackadaisical approach towards the project will hit its prospects. "Apart from organizing a joint protest, Kerala Congress will also move legally against the government, which has not yet released the funds for FLS," he said.
 
 It was on June 24, 2016 that the state government announced the fund allocation for FLS and the preparation of a detailed project report (DPR) for the rail line by DMRC ( ). The agency had planned to complete the survey within eight months. 
 
 On November 24, last year, the state government allotted Rs 2 crore as initial fund for the survey and preparation of DPR. But it has not yet released funds though DMRC approached government several times with requests.
 
 It has been alleged that after LDF government assumed power,   (KRDC) gave priority to Thalassery-Mysuru rail line, neglecting the decade-old proposal for the Nilambur-Nanjangud rail line.
