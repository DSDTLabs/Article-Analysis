INDORE: For the first time in 200 years, the mess at   will get only   The practice of  , lamb and chicken to feed the troops stopped in the cantonment on March 31, as in other   in the country. 

  Sources confirmed to TOI that the supply of frozen, packaged meat began on April 1 and added that the meat will be stored at a centralised unit, fulfilling all health and hygiene norms. "The biggest advantage of frozen meat is that it will be far more hygienic and more nutritious," a officer said. 
 
  Not all agree. Col (retd) D K Ghosh said: "As a former Army Service Corps officer, I don't agree with the new initiative as there are very clearly laid down directives for slaughtering of animals - from selection, to marking, slaughtering and dispatch to destination. The whole process doesn't involve more than six hours but in the new system, preservatives will be used which are generally bad for health." 
 
  But another veteran, Col (retd) V K Saini, welcomed the change. "It is a good decision because except for a few big cantonments, the hygiene of station butcheries is not up to the mark," he said. 
 
  The butchery in Mhow had been operating near the railway yard ever since the cantonment was set up in 1818. The drill was managed by an ASC detachment. The drill was unchanged for two centuries. 
 
 The contract of the butchery in charge was renewed every year until March 2017. Pandurang Sirpurkar, a cook in one of the messes of Military College of Telecommunication Engineering, said: "Cooks and chefs in the army are habituated to cooking with fresh meat but now they are trying to adapt to the new system of frozen meat."
