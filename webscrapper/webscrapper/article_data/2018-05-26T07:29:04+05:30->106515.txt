Panaji: Managing plastic waste has for long been one of the biggest challenges of the state’s waste management programme. But now there’s a ray of hope. An initiative that will use recycled plastic waste to build items such as chairs, benches and even doors was launched in   on Friday. A similar project has already been undertaken in Indore and Bhopal 

 A joint initiative by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) India and Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages (HCCB), the programme aims at supporting sustainable plastic waste management practices across 50 Indian cities and through this, improving the socio-economic conditions of waste-pickers, especially women.
 
 “The basic step in tackling the plastic menace is segregation and reuse, right at one’s house,” said urban development minister Francis D’Souza.
 
 UNDP India and HCCB will partner with the   (GWMC). Waste pickers in the state will be formalized by GWMC and will be given a registration number and unique QR code on their ID card. 
 
 “We want to follow the module of reusing plastic waste at Mopa. For this, we have a detailed framework for plastic waste collection, segregation and recycling,” said HCCB’s head of public affairs and communication Umesh Malik. Plastic will be segregated at the   and sent to recycling station to be converted into products such as T-shirts, fabric, backpacks, etc. Low-end plastics like carry bags and laminates will be used to manufacture compressed boards or for co-incineration in cement kilns, road laying and pyrolysis.
