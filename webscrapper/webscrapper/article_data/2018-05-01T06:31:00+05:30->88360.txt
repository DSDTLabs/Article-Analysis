Ranchi: A 30-year-old pregnant woman who was in labour pain died in   hospital on Monday morning when she could not be taken to the gynaecology department on time as the   was being used to carry food for patients. The Rims management, which said the incident was “inhuman”, has initiated a probe into the matter.

 The deceased, Sunita Devi, a resident of Kathitand in Ratu area of Ranchi district, arrived at Rims at 7:30am in a critical condition. She was being taken on a strecher to the gynaecology department, but was stopped midway as the lift was packed with people carrying food for patients in different floors of the hospitals. 
 
 Even though the helper pushing the stecher pleaded with the people carrying food that the patient was in need of urgent care and she should be taken to the department as soon as possible, the food vendors did not relent. The woman died on the strecher before she could reach the gynaecology department.
 
 However, Rims management has not taken any action against the vendors in this connection so far. “The job of delivering food to patients has been outsourced to a private agency,” sources said, said adding that the hospital is still mulling whether to blacklist the vendors. 
 
 Rims director Dr R K Srivastava said, “The entire incident is being investigated. The food was to be taken on different floors through a ramp. I have reprimanded the persons concerned and it was wrong on part of the vendors to use the elevator meant only for the patients and the doctors. Patients must always be given top priority,” he said.
 
 Srivastav said only two of the six elevators in Rims are operational and this leads to a huge rush. He said a government agency id carrying out renovation work on the four defunct lifts. “The work has been in progress for four months. I will soon call a meeting and ask the agency to complete the work as soon as possible,” he said.
