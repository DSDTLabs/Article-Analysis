PANAJI: Chief minister Manohar   has hinted at a ban on plastic at popular tourist spot   waterfalls.

 Parrikar, who was speaking at the inaugural session of International Biological Diversity Day, requested principal secretary, department of environment and forests, Ranbir Singh, to put a cap on the number of tourists visiting the waterfalls and ensure that it becomes a plastic-free zone.
 
 “I have already issued orders to keep the area spotless. In fact, we should impose a ban on plastic,” he said. Pointing out that a lot of plastic-made stuff has accumulated at the pristine site, the chief minister suggested that tourists be stopped and asked to deposit all their plastic bags, cups, glasses and other packing materials before they reach the site and collect their belongings while returning. Strict rules need to be imposed, he said. 
 
 More than two lakh tourists visit the waterfalls, he said, and advised the department to limit the number of tourists. Stating that very high footfall is likely to cause damage to pristine and popular tourist spots, Parrikar said the sustainability of all such places is a very important factor.
