MUMBAI: Special   trial court judge J C Jagdale, hearing the   murder case on Saturday, questioned the absence of a cellular firm’s nodal officer despite being told to be present after defence lawyers made serious allegations of tampered call data records.

 The court noted that the officer “remained absent without any lawful excuse”. It directed that the officer, Manoj Patil of Airtel, be present at 11am on Tuesday, failing which “coercive action will be taken”.
 
 “It has to be remembered that serious allegations were levelled against the nodal officer,” said the special judge. “If he doesn’t remain present again, court will pass necessary orders.”
 
 Lawyers of   and  , accused in the murder case, had alleged before the court that the nodal officer of Airtel had, on instructions, produced a manipulated call data record of Shyamvar Rai, Indrani’s former driver, and Peter in court.
