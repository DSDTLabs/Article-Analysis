TRICHY: Sudden downpour on Sunday afternoon brought cheer to   and residents of Kumbakonam in   district. Though the day started off on a sultry note, by afternoon there were dark clouds and the subsequent heavy rain brought much relief to Kumbakonam, Papanasam and   in the district.

 Farmers across delta districts had been longing for the shower. They have raised summer paddy crop in 3,000 acres in Kumbakonam alone. â€œThe rain will immensely benefit us, as it sustains soil moisture for at least two- to three days, said  , a farmer from Thiruvidaimaruthur.
 
 All main roads and main streets in Kumbakonam and Papanasam were inundated and traffic was affected to some extent. People were caught off-guard and were stranded at bus stops and railway stations. Residents however hoped that the sudden downpour would replenish groundwater level.
