KOLKATA: A 27-year-old   from the Port area was found with his throat slit in an abandoned godown on   in the West Port area on Tuesday morning.

 The deceased,   (35), was a resident of the local   quarters near Garden Reach. The godown belongs to an automobile manufacturing major.
 
 Forensic experts who visited the spot said Khan was murdered inside the godown and then his body was dragged to a different spot to conceal it. However, the large amount of blood alerted passers by who informed police.
 
 “It seems his throat was slit with a sharp object. We are conducting laboratory checks on the collected evidence,” a forensic expert said.
 
 Locals believe Khan was the casualty of a gang war that has been threatening to erupt in immense proportions in the Port area. It started after several small-time players began supplying and stocking illegal arms. The police, however, suspect someone from Khan’s own gang to be behind the murder.
 
 “We have recovered four phone numbers from his pocket. We also found his jacket, shoes, alcohol bottles and glasses. This suggests he was sitting with someone close and drinking when he was murdered,” an investigating officer said.
 
 After old criminals like   and   lost their importance, Khan started hobnobbing with local politicians. He had strengthened his hold in the Sonai Road area. Most importantly, he was murdered in his own turf. This suggests there was some trouble on sharing of profits,” an officer said.
