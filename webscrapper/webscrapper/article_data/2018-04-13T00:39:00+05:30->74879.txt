Trichy: With extreme summer closing in, the decorative plants and tree saplings planted by National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the State Highways department respectively in city limits have been withering away thanks to inadequate watering. 

 While pointing out that such tree saplings and decorative plants constitute a big chunk of the existing green cover of the city, a collective demand was made by the members of the public to the district administration to ensure proper maintenance of the greenery.
 
 TVS tollgate locality being a junction and serving as gateway to the city for people arriving from Trichy International Airport as well as Chennai bypass, the tollgate locality as well as the underpass of the flyover connecting Trichy-Chennai NH were covered with beautification plants. However, as the temperature in the city has been rising beyond 36 degree Celsius, the decorative plants have been withering away. Similarly, the tree saplings planted by the State Highways department on Dindigul highway near Karumandapam have also been dying despite the green mesh provided around it. 
 
 “NHAI and State Highways department can try entering into an agreement with the city corporation to water the plants or saplings. A city like Trichy known for its sultry weather badly needs to improve the existing green cover,” V B Jaganath, a resident of Karumandapam said. When contacted, official sources with NHAI said that the city police had taken up the beautification drive covering Palpannai, TVS tollgate and Mannarpuram localities through which the existing lawns would be developed and maintained by sponsors under corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds. 
 
 “The city police through sponsors have already started beautifying a portion of pillars at TVS tollgate. Similar measures may be taken up till the Mannarpuram roundabout alongside which the existing lawns will see an overhaul,” an officer of NHAI said.
