BHAWANIPATNA: The world has come crashing down for Rajeswari Pradhan, 37, of Kalahandi's Karlapada village. Her husband, Tofan Kumar Pradhan, 43, and brother in-law Ashok Biswal, 40, have died in the   accident. She now has three daughters to look after and is six months pregnant with her fourth child. 

 They had gone for Tofan's health check-up in Bhubaneswar. Tofan is a cardiac patient. "My husband was the only earning member of our family. There is no male in our house as my father is also no more. I am at a loss on how I will survive with these three daughters and another to be born," Rajeswari told the media. Tofan was working in a private agency, while Ashok was a tailor.
 
 While Ashok died on the spot in the general coach, Tofan succumbed to severe head injuries three hours of being admitted to Parvatipuram hospital. The bodies of Tofan and Ashok were cremated in their villages on Monday. When Tofan's lives in Karlapada, 21 km from Bhawanipatna, Ashok's family stays at Dongergarh, about 7 km from Bhawanipatna. 
 
 Ashok is the owner of a tailor shop in Bhawanipatna and had employed six girls. Ashok is survived by his wife, a six-year-old daughter and a 12-year-old son. His younger brother, Saranga Biswal, said it is difficult to manage the business without Ashok.
 
 Saranga said the railways should keep a records of general coaches which would be helpful for family members in case of train accident.
 
  "After we came to know about the accident, we went to Rayagada and searched for our relatives. We had a tough time in finding out about them," said Saranga. Six persons from Kalahandi district died in the train derailment. One each are from Golamunda, Karlapada, Dongergadh, Perumanji and two from Bhawanipatana.
