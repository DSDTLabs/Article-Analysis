HYDERABAD: To ensure better quality of prasadams, the   (TTD) has decided to procure materials required through   process. This will help it acquire the  .

 The TTD currently spends about Rs 300 crore to buy ghee, cardamom and red gram. In the regular tender method, the quotation made by all the participants are kept secret and the one who quotes the lowest rates (L1) is awarded the contract. In case the materials fall short, the tender for the rest is divided between L1 and L2 in the ratio of 65:35.
 
 Earlier, the materials used to be procured for the entire year, which led to a deterioration of quality after a few months. But the current board procures the items every three months. It even adopted the e-tendering method, under which the contractors are asked to file their bids by 3pm of a given date. The bids are again kept secret.
 
 In the reverse tender process, the bidders will be given three additional hours after the initial bids close. “The prices quited by all the bidders will be kept open. The details can be submitted online. Whoever quotes the lowest price 6pm on the last day of submission of bids will be given the contract. This will ensure more transparency,” an official said. “The bidder will have a chance to improve their quote after their initial bid to bag the contract,” he added.
 
 This process is similar to the   method of awarding contracts, currently being used by the Andhra Pradesh government in the construction of its capital city Amaravati. The difference between the two types of tendering processes is that in the Swiss Challenge, the conditions of the tender are set by the original project proponent, which is one of the successful bidders. In the reverse tender process, the government or agency awarding the contract prepares the tender conditions.
 
 The TTD is hoping to implement this method not just to procure  , but also to auction human hair collected from devotees who tonsure their heads.
