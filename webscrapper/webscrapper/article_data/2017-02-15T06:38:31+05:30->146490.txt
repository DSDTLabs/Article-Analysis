MYSURU: The third generation of noted painter S L Haldankar will soon travel to Mysuru from Maharashtra's Kolhapur for a date with the artist's iconic work, Woman with the Lamp, popularly called Glow of Hope.

 Gita Uplekar, the face that inspired the painting, is the third daughter of Haldankar.She turned 100 this month.
 
 Many from the Haldankar family have not seen the painting, a prized possession of Mysuru. It adorns the wall of  , where the painting is curated in a room specially designed to enhance its appeal.
 
 Haldankar's great-granddaughter Pooja Tarun Chopra told TOI: “I will visit Mysuru with my husband Tarun Chopra and father   (Gita Uplekar's only son).“ Gita took the Uplekar surname after her marriage to Krishnakant.
 
 Glow of Hope is a major attraction after the girl, who is holding the lamp in the painting, turned 100 on February 2.
 
 Jaganmohan Palace, constructed in 1861, was the main residential palace of the Mysuru royal family for some years. Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV turned it into a museum in 1915.
 
 Glow of Hope is the only Haldankar painting displayed in the first floor of the art gallery , which houses a collection of paintings by Raja Ravi Varma, Roerich, Nan dalal Bose and K Venkatappa, among others.
 Pooja, in a message to TOI, said Gita was 13 when Haldankar painted Glow of Hope. “During Diwali, my great-grandfather saw her carrying a lamp. Amazed by the sight, he recreated it in painting. Later, the Mysuru maharaja bought it for Rs 300,“ she said.
 
 Hema Joshi, a noted artist and granddaughter of Haldankar, released a book on his paintings three years ago. Sri   superintendent MG Narashima said Hema had contacted him for a photograph of the Glow of Hope. “We emailed her a photograph, which she used as the book cover,“ he said.
 
 Pooja Chopra is likely to meet Mysuru royal family members Pramodadevi Wadiyar, Yaduveer and Trishika.
