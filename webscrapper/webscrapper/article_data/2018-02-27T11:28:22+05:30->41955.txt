CHENNAI: A DGP-rank   in the state, using   and recourse to the   (TNSIC), has obtained copies of inquiry reports submitted to the director general of police (DGP) against him over allegations of human rights violations and abuse of official capacity .

 S R Jangid, a President’s police medal winner now chief vigilance officer in the state transport corporation, approached the TNSIC demanding the reports after his RTI plea to the   in August 2015 were refused.
 
 The TNSIC last month directed CB-CID to give Jangid a copy of the reports.
 
 The case pertains to complaints filed by a woman named Vidya, accused in some criminal cases. In his petition to TNSIC, Jangid said he had attended two inquiries and filed RTIs to obtain copies of the reports. 
 
 CB-CID in 2015 declined the request, stating that as per a 2005 GO, it was exempt from providing information under RTI.
 
 Jangid filed a first appeal in April 2017, which was again rejected by CB-CID. He later approached TNSIC.
 
 Information commissioner   in his order said Jangid was entitled to the information as it pertained to allegations of human rights violations and corrupt practice. 
 
 He relied on an order he passed on April 26, 2017, where B Gajapathy of Madhavaram was allowed to get the information in a similar case.
 
 Curiously, Dakshinamurthy had declined to give a copy of the same reports to Vidya in August 2016, saying “there was no sufficient material to establish any violation of human rights by the said police officials or that they indulged in corrupt practices.”
