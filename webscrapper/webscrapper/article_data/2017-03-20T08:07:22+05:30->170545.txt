HYDERABAD: The recent incident involving a semi-paralysed patient, Raju, clearly isn't an isolated case. Dozens of patients visiting the staterun facility, similarly, await basic amenities such as stretchers, wheelchairs and beds every day. What's worse, patients claim that ward boys charge money to even let them sleep on the footpath outside the hospital.

 A visit to   on Sunday, further confirmed the plight of patients. Scores of them were found waiting endlessly outside its premises -each with a story of despair to share. A 30-year-old man, who suffered a fracture on his right hand, was one among those who was compelled to take shelter on the footpath after the hospital could not provide him with a bed. “But even to let me sleep on the footpath, I have to pay Rs 50 bribe to the ward boys. If I refuse to pay, they don't allow me to sleep on the footpath,“ said the patient who had come all the way from   for his treatment and had been living on the footpath for the past few days in a hope of getting a bed soon.
 
 Another man who had visited the hospital for his mother's treatment could not get a stretcher. “I asked for a stretcher but the ward boys told him that it wasn't available. I had to finally carry my mother to the  ,“ he said. While authorities, following Friday's incident, are gearing up to sensitise ward boys and class 4 employees from Monday, not many are hopeful of the move yielding any result. “These are only gimmicks. Because the hospital is currently in the spotlight, authorities are rolling out this programme. They'll soon forget about and things will be back to how they are now,“ said one of patients certain of things never changing at state-run facilities.
