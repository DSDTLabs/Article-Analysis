CUTTACK: The   at   here is ready for an overhaul. The museum trust has decided to renovate all the galleries to make them more attractive. A budget of Rs 40 lakh has been set aside for the project. 

 "The galleries will be rearranged in a more systematic manner and the artefacts displayed will be decorated properly to make the museum more striking," said  , secretary of the museum trust.
 
 "The letters and photographs displayed in the galleries will be re-framed. Besides, as the structure is quite old, some necessary maintenance and repair work will be carried out," she added. 
 
 Officials said the renovation work would be started soon and authorities have plans to complete it within six months.
 
 The museum authorities are hopeful that the renovation and beautification project would help increase footfall. 
 
 On any given day, the museum attracts around 200 visitors. Though the authorities hiked the ticket prices recently - from Rs 5 to Rs 10 - footfall remains healthy. The museum is one of the top attractions of the city.
