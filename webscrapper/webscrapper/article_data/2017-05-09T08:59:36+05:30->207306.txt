VARANASI:   president   said on Monday that the  , Muslim Personal Law Board and   should be given sufficient time to arrive at a consensus on the issue of  . 

 Speaking to the press at Nadesar, Madani also condemned a section of media for giving hype to the issue and also "the people debating the issue on TV channels by posing as Muslim scholars".
 
 He said Islam does not sanction triple talaq in one sitting. By meeting Muslim families, one can find that triple talaq is not such a big issue as it is being projected, especially on some news channels. More shocking is to see that anyone sporting a long beard and a skull cap is being presented on TV channels as a Muslim scholar. In reality, they do not have sufficient knowledge of Islam. This section of media paints a picture that all women are suffering due to triple talaq.
 
 Instead, he said, people should be patient and allow the SC, Muslim Personal Law Board and clerics to find out an amicable solution. Madani termed the action of chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi and his government on illegally operating slaughterhouses as correct. Shariat also not allow illegal practices, he said. "If your work hurts anyone or any section of society it should be stopped," said the cleric adding, "people associated with this work should opt for some other work to earn livelihood if they are in crisis." He said that the Yogi government should be given four-five months more before assessing its performance. He said the government's slogan of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' would prove correct only when the motive of communal elements to spread disharmony failed.
