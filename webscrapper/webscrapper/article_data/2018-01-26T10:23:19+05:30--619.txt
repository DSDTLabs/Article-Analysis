AURANGABAD: The divisional employees of   (MSRTC) have expressed discontent over the report for recommendation of salary hike.

 The members of   (INTUC) and pay commission action committee on Thursday burnt a copy of the report in front of the transport corporation’s divisional office to mark their protest.
 
 The Bombay high court had directed the state government to form a high-level committee to decide the pay hike of MSRTC employees after they kept off work for four days in October last year. 
 
 The workers claim that instead of focussing on the poor pay scale of the workers, the report stresses on the financial recovery of the corporation. “The report recommends a hike of Rs 800 against our proposed hike of Rs 10,000 as per the Seventh Pay Commission,” said  , organising secretary of INTUC.
 
 In October last year, during the peak four days of  , the state transport (ST) had shut down owing to the strike of the ST workers demanding pay hike. When the logjam between the government and the workers did not end, the high court intervened and directed the workers to return to work. Work resumed but the high court asked the government to form a committee to take a decision on the pay hike.
 
 After the committee concerned released its report, workers are gravely disappointed with its recommendations. Unions say that instead of increasing the allowances, the report recommends decreasing them. The annual pay hike has been reduced from 3% to 2%, the house rent allowance has been slashed from 10% to 7% and from 30% to 14%.
 
 The workers are also dissatisfied with the fact that the committee has recommended the implementation of pay hike from April 2016 to January 2018.
