LUDHIANA: People running shops near city’s oldest and busiest   bridge are facing   ever since the police have blocked the way near this 127-year-old bridge two days ago. The shopkeepers have complained that since one portion of the bridge is blocked, they had to walk a long way back to reach their shops after parking their vehicles. 

 Talking to TOI, Harkirat Singh, a shopkeeper of the nearby area, said, “We are facing parking problem. Also, we have to walk a long distance to park our vehicles. In fact, we have to go to the other side to park our vehicles. This is affecting our business too.”
 
 Another shopkeeper,  , said, “The parking area is very far from our shops. We are facing a lot of problem due to this. The customers are also not ready to wait for such a long time. My father, who comes to the shop almost on a daily basis, is not able to walk so much. We need a solution soon.”
 
 Talking to TOI, IPS   ( ) said, “We had to close the way to control the traffic of the city. Each person should park their vehicle in the parking area and not in front of their shops. Instead of complaining, people should come out of their comfort zone and take steps to manage city traffic.”
