PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa has directed the state government to place on record whether the   panchayat has committed any violation of the provisions in carrying out the hillcutting for road widening in the village.

 The division bench comprising   and Justice   issued the order on Wednesday in connection with a writ petition filed by  .
 
 The order comes in the wake of the earlier stand adopted by the government to the allegations of hill-cutting. The panchayat had stated that it had asked the public works department (PWD) to carry out the road widening work.
 
 But advocate general   had informed the court at the first hearing that PWD had not been involved in the work. It may have been carried out by the panchayat, as it had issued a communication on January 31, 2018 to the town and country planning department to this effect, he stated.
 
 The judges expressed surprise as to how the panchayat could carry out work of hillcutting and tree-felling without PWDâ€™s permission. The next hearing is on June 6.
