Tirupur:  ,  , have to walk 13km extra to sell their produce or buy goods as the Kerala forest department has closed a footpath to the market in that state. 

 About 330 tribal families live in three settlements - Thalinchi, Thalinchivayal and Manjampatti - under Amaravathi forest range of Tamil Nadu. Besides practising agriculture, they rear silkworm and perform other forest-related activities for livelihood.
 
 To sell their produce and buy items, they walk to Chinnaru in Kerala for 7km through Sambakadu footpath that comes under the forest department of Kerala.
 
 “As the department had closed the path by erecting metal railing, we have to walk or travel 20km along Koottaru River to reach Chinnaru now,” said Rajan, a tribal leader of Thalinchi settlement. “In time of medical emergency, we have to travel 13km extra,” said tribals.
 
 Even two teachers of Thalinchi Panchayat union primary school, who used to ply by two-wheelers on the Sambakadu path, were taking the longer route now, said Rajan.
 
 When contacted, sources in Chinnaru forest range told TOI, “The Kerala forest department closed the Sambakadu path to avoid anti-social elements using it for illegal activities. Moreover, in times of human-animal conflicts, the Kerala department becomes responsible for any mishaps.”
 
 A senior official associated with Anamalai Tiger Reserve from Tamil Nadu said, “It would be difficult to solve the issue since the path was coming under the jurisdiction of Kerala.”
