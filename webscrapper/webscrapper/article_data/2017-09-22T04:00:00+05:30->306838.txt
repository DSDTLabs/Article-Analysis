 Few big commercial organizers like always, this year too, hope to make some money. But Rajwadi group claims it is an exception and that it organizes garba in Amroli only for local people. 
 
 A satire on BJP government’s claims of development will be sung and performed as a garba at this venue. This 2.5 minute garba ‘Vikas gando thayo che’ will be played by Bagda Melody Orchestra. The composition has already become a rage on social media. 
 
 The lines say number of poor as well as the prices of essential commodities have gone up all because of this mad Vikas. 
 
 Yogesh Bakrola, organizer of Rajwadi group, said, “We heard this some 15 days ago. We asked our orchestra group to include this garba in our playlist. We think people will enjoy the satire on the government.”
