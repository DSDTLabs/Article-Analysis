VIJAYAWADA: At least   after feeding on   and pesticides dumped at a field at   in   late on Sunday night. It was a horrific sight at dawn when farmers woke up to carcasses lying sprawled on the field at Gurazala mandal of Guntur district.

 Gundala Lakshmaiah of Neredcherla village, Nalgonda district, had been herding cows from his village to Gurazala for 15 years. Tragedy struck when cows were let loose for grazing at night. While 56 cows died, another 44 in the herd ran amok, unable to bear the pain after consuming poison. At least 24 cows are yet to be traced.
 
 
 Speaking to TOI, Dr Sheikh Bashir, assistant veterinary surgeon said, “Autopsy report shows cyanide content in the cows’ viscera. Normally, cattle have resistance to poison, but if they consume more than 20mg, they can’t survive.”
 
 The farmer, who was in deep debt, is now sinking financially after the loss of cattle. Most cows which ventured into the field consumed poisonous pesticide.   managed to rescue 20 cows from the brink of death.
 
 
 
 
 Lakshmani said, “From childhood, I have been fond of cows and took care of them even when our family went hungry. I am in shock. My livelihood has been snatched. I have lost more than ?25 lakh after the tragedy,”
 
 Lakshmaiah’s 18-yearold daughter Pramila, a college student, demanded compensation from the state government on humanitarian ground.
 
 “My father is shellshocked. My father depended on his herd to meet expenses of the household and marry my sister. The government should help us come out of the debt-trap,” said Pramila.
