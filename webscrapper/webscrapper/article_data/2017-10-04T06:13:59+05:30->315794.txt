The idea of a nation state in India has three components -common home, people and na tionalist mind. There are differences in language, customs. But   is the thread for unity in this diversity . Bharat ka bhan (consciousness) hona chahiye,“ the RSS chief said.
 
 Bhagwat has no problems if Muslims in the country abide by what he calls the “Bharatiya consciousness“.
 
 Elaborating on it, the RSS chief referred to a conversation he had with a Muslim friend.
 
 Amit Moulick “A Muslim friend of mine once told me that they were original ly Hindus who lat er embraced Islam.
 
 He told me that his habits had remained the same despite the conver sion. They sing qawwali because the habit of sing ing bhajans is in herent to them. I told him that he needed to educate his fellow men, and they need to realise it. We are all children of Bharat Mata,“ Bhagwat said.
 
 The RSS chief pointed out that the concept of Bharat was different from how West looks at India.
 
 “We have to learn from the ideas of nation state espoused by Sister Nivedita,“ Bhagwat said.Quoting Nivedita, he added that “National unity is built on the common home, the common interest and common love“ driven by the strength that flows from the Vedas and the Upanishads.
