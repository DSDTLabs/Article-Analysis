MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Monday ordered the government to file counter to a public interest litigation plea seeking to stop   from the Tamirabarani river to 25  , including   and Coca-cola, functioning at   in   village in Tirunelveli district. 

 The division bench ordered the notice to a petition filed by C M Ragavan of Tirunelveli. 
 
 The petitioner stated that there is water scarcity currently in Tirunelveli, Tuticorin, Virudunagar and Ramanathapuram districts. Tamirabarani river caters to the water requirements of people in the four districts. Besides, the   and Manimuthar reservoirs in Tirunelveli district have been closed, which has resulted in farmers facing difficulty in saving their crops. 
 
 Currently, 12.5 crore litres of water is taken daily to meet Tirunelveli's drinking water purposes, 10 crore litres for Tuticorin and Ramanathapuram and 50 lakh litres of water for Virudhunagar district. 
 
 "The supply of water to 25 companies situated in SIPCOT is affecting water requirements of the people, which would amount to violation of right to life of the people guaranteed under the Indian Constitution," the petition said.
 
 Earlier, when a case came up before the court calling for a stop on water supply to the industries, the court had dismissed the case. "Actually, the court said that the petitioner had approached the court with malafide intentions and thus the case was dismissed," the petitioner pointed out.
