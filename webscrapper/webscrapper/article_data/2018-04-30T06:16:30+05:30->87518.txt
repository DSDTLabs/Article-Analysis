CHANDIGARH: Warning of the farm experts to reduce the area under paddy and make judicious use of groundwater in   and Haryana can be substantiated from the monsoon rainfall data of both states from 1901 till 2017. As per the data compiled by the   ( ), in the given period, Punjab has had 35 deficient monsoon (more than 20% to 59% below the normal precipitation in the June-September period) rainfall years while Haryana witnessed 36 deficient monsoon rainfall years.

 
 
  
 
 The situation is grimmer if the data of the last 10 years (2008-2017) is taken into account as both states recorded deficient monsoon rainfall for six years or more. In the past 10 years, Punjab had deficient monsoon rainfall six times in 2009, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. During the same period, monsoon failed seven times (2007, 2009, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017) in neighbouring Haryana.
 
 Despite poor monsoon rainfall, area under water-guzzling paddy has not reduced in both Punjab and Haryana, known as the grain bowl states of India, which are biggest contributors of food grain to the national buffer stock. In 2017, Punjab had an estimated 29.42 lakh hectares area under paddy including basmati while in Haryana the estimated acreage under rice cultivation was 14.22 lakh hectares.
 
 Area under other  ,  ,   and pulses has gone down in both states with more farmers opting to   due to assured marketing as the grain is purchased by the government agencies at the minimum support price (MSP).
 
 Weaker monsoons have resulted in putting more strain on the groundwater in both Punjab and Haryana. With less availability of canal water, farmers in both states rely on tubewells to irrigate their crops, hoping for the normal rainfall to eventually recharge the groundwater. With truant monsoons, groundwater recharge has not been to the optimal levels, leading to lowering of water table in both states.
 
 In 2017, Punjab received 384.9mm rainfall, which is 22% below the normal precipitation of 491.9mm while Haryana recorded a deficit of 26% at 341.9mm against the normal of 459.8mm. On the other hand, the average rainfall in the country was recorded at 841.3mm, 5% below the normal of 887.3mm. According to IMD, deficit up to 20% of t h e normal monsoon rainfall (June to September) is taken as normal precipitation.
 
 In the given scenario, there have been appeals from leading farm scientists to reduce the area under paddy cultivation in both states, especially Punjab, to prevent further depletion of precious groundwater. Leading geneticist and rice breeder Gurdev Singh Khush, who retired as the head of the division of plant breeding genetics and biochemistry at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Manila, has advised crop diversification to reduce the area under paddy. “This issue has been talked about for last 30 years but nobody has proposed an alternative crop. I have suggested soybean as possibility but nobody has paid any attention,” Khush stated in an email exchange with TOI.
