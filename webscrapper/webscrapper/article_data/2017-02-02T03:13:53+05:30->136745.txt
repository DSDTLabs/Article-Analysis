Government bond market witnessed high volatility on the   day but at close the benchmark yield on the 10-year was marginally higher at 6.42%. 

  In the forex market, the rupee rallied strongly and closed at 67.47 to a dollar, stronger by 39 paise as there were no negative surprises for the market. The benchmark gilt opened flat at 6.40%, softened to a low of 6.37% and hardened to a high of 6.45% as bond market players tried to decipher the government's fiscal maths. 
 
  "The (bond) market witnessed substantial volatility owing to confusion about the net and gross borrowing figures given in the budget. However, the government's clarification relating to further buyback of securities rather than switching of gilts, and expectations of continuing easing of rates by the RBI led to value buying at lower level led to the recovery," said Ram Kamal Samanta, VP (treasury), SBI DFHI, one of the leading bond houses.
