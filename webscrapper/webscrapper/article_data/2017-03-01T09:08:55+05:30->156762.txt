BENGALURU: “We honoured his   yesterday by presenting him a bouquet of flowers. Today, we are paying our last tributes with a  ,“ said a distraught G Kamala, classteacher of N  , at the boy's   residence on Tuesday.

 With Harsha's Government Boys High School closed on Tuesday and Wednesday as a mark of respect to its murdered Class X student, Kamala and her colleagues, Susheela and Sudhakar, turned up at Harsha's residence as the family readied to take the body on its final journey. Kamala broke down as she placed a wreath on her student's body.
 
 Kamala and Susheela told TOI that they knew Harsha well and he was a decent boy who would never be drawn into skirmishes. “He was an average student and never indulged in anti-social ac tivities. It is really shocking to see boys roaming with knives,“ they said.
 
 Kamala recalled that recently she had found Harsha had been skipping classes.“Last month, Harsha was irregular. This made me worry and I sent word to his mother Annapur na. She came to school and said that Harsha was helping her maintain the cows. I objected to it and forced her to send him to school. Keeping in mind the upcoming exams, we ran classes till late in the evening last week and Harsha promptly attended them,“ she said.
 
 Several teaching and nonteaching members of the school visited Harsha's house.
