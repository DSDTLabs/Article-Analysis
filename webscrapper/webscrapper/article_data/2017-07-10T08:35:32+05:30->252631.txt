KHARGUPUR (Gonda): Over 10 lakh   from central UP, Madhya Pradesh and Nepal will be thronging   seeking   during the   which begins on Monday. But the presiding deity, looks forward to chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi for fulfillment of a desire being expressed by the locals. 

 “This is the tallest Shivaling in UP (five-and-a-half feet) but the place is nowhere on UP’s tourist map and it is high time the shrine got its due,” said Jagdamba Prasad Tewari, chief priest of the temple, adding, “Proof of how much the legacy has been neglected is the pot-holed approach road.” 
 
 The name of the temple comes from another story which says that Bhim’s temple was lost in the course of time and was discovered in times of Raja Gumaan Singh who ruled the region about 400 years ago. A man called Prithivinath sought permission from the king to get his house constructed but work stopped when during digging of earth a huge fountain burst out scaring locals. Prithivinath saw in a dream a seven layered Shivalinga beneath the earth. 
 
 On hearing that, the king ordered digging and when the Shivalinga was found it was installed again with rituals. The temple came to be known after the villager who saw it in his dream.
