SURAT: Individuals from specific groups, who instigated people to indulge in violence on Monday after recovery of a   area of the city, have been identified by the police, but yet to be arrested. 

 Shailesh Sahu, Santosh Sahu and   alias Devji have been booked by the police for provoking the crowd and a search started for them. They took help of a large number of individuals present at the spot to pressurize the police to allow them to take the calf’s head to the   to demand a detailed investigation into the incident. 
 
 Photos and videos of the incident were in circulation after the violence in which some of them could be seen and heard delivering provocative speeches. Police have so far arrested 41 people, including four individuals who had taken a lead role in creating disturbances in the locality. 
 
 “We are yet to arrest the three accused named in the complaint. They are responsible for provoking the rioters and will be nabbed soon,” the police said.
 
 The police investigation revealed that the calf had died a natural death. The police traced a cattle breeder who claimed that the calf had died recently and that he had dumped its carcass in the bushes. He told the police that some dogs were seen eating the calf a couple of days ago. 
 
 Postmortem and   (FSL) preliminary reports too said that the calf could have died a natural death since there were no marks of cut on its neck. Postmortem was done by a veterinary doctor on Monday. A FSL team had also examined the carcass later in the day.
