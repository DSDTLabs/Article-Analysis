LUCKNOW: With SP national general secretary   and son   suddenly joining the saffron bandwagon, the battle for upper house got curiouser. Although he openly announced that his son, an MLA , will vote for BJP, his influence on some other SP legislators can’t be ruled out.

 Agarwal said that he would continue to respect SP patriarch   and his brother Shivpal Singh Yadav, who were, however, neglected by the present day SP dispensation by  . Political experts were quick to read Agarwal's statement as an attempt to find cracks within the SP for the benefit of the BJP.
 
 Sources in the SP confirmed that Agarwal did contacted quite a few party MLAs after he defected to the BJP camp on Monday afternoon.
 
 While there was no reaction from Akhilesh, SP leaders maintained that Agarwal's exit would not affect the party. ``He himself has been attacking Shivpal after SP lost to BJP in the UP assembly elections,'' said a SP legislator in the UP assembly. During SP convention in September last year, Agarwal had reportedly launched an indirect attack on   saying, the party should no longer tolerate traitors who joined hands with the BJP during the recent assembly poll to inflict huge damage to the party. Agarwal had also accused the Shivpal of being against Akhilesh after he became CM of UP.
 
 Party sources said that Akhilesh was assessing the situation post Agarwal's exit from the party. “He is expected to draw a fresh strategy after consulting all party MLAs,” said a SP leader.
