LUCKNOW: Bike-borne miscreants posing as policemen duped an   outside her apartment on   on Sunday.

 The woman, identified as Kalawati, was looking for public transport when men on a motorcycle stopped near her and introduced themselves as policemen patrolling in plainclothes to nab chain snatchers. They advised her to take off her jewellery and offered her their handkerchief to keep it in. When the unsuspecting Kalawati obliged, they wrapped it and gave it to her and left. However on opening the handkerchief, Kalawati realized that the miscreants had replaced original jewellery with artificial one. Her son informed the police control room and later lodged an FIR at Hussainganj police station.
