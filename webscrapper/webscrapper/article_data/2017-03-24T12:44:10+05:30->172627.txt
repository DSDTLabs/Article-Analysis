SURAT: City police will ensure strict implementation of rules for auto-rickshaws and those not following them will face action. Police plan to start a drive against errant auto- rickshaw drivers from April 5 in the aftermath of involvement of drivers in two major crimes in the city. 

 An auto-rickshaw driver should possess a valid licence under Motor Vehicles Act. The driver needs to wear a badge always but no auto-rickshaw driver follows this rule in the city. The auto-rickshaw driver should not carry more passengers than the permissible limit in his vehicle. 
 
 Police have asked the owners of auto-rickshaws to ensure that registration of their vehicle is complete. The drivers can use the auto-rickshaw only with the permission letter of the owner and while carrying other documents. The auto-rickshaws without papers would be detained. 
 
 “Involvement of auto-rickshaw drivers in crimes has come to notice in a few recent cases. We are starting the drive to prevent such incidents. The auto-rickshaw drivers are being given time till April 5 to prepare their documents,” city police commissioner   said.
 
 Certain spots will be earmarked as stand for auto-rickshaws. At present, the city has no dedicated auto-rickshaw stand. 
 
 Recently, an auto-rickshaw driver murdered a man in   area over a dispute for fare of Rs10. In another incident, a   chain worth Rs60,000 of a   councillor was snatched by some unidentified persons when she was commuting in an auto-rickshaw in the city.
