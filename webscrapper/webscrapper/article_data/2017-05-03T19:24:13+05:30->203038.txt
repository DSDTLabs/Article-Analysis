Sonam Kapoor’s ‘Neerja’ was touted as one of her best performances, since she started her   career. Her portrayal as the fearless air hostess   Bhanot was not just spot on but moved us to tears. 

 The National Awards 2016 honoured her with a special mention for her role in the movie and she stated that it was truly “sweet and encouraging”.
 
 
 ," Sonam told a leading newswire.
 
 Sonam will be attending the ceremony along with her parents in Delhi today. Talking about her first major milestone, she said "I don't think I did 'Neerja' for rewards. The whole film signifies the idea of human compassion, kindness and strength especially in this day and age when there is so much competition around and it is about survival of the fittest. It is so important that a film like 'Neerja' gets an honour like this. It is really great."
 
 It will be a role reversal for Sonam and Anil, as she has already appeared on the National awards’ stage to receive an award for her dad in the year 2007, and this time Anil will accompany her to receive her very first ‘special mention award’.
