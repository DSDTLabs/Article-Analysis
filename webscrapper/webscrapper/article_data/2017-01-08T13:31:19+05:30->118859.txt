Veteran singer and " " UK coach   is being slammed for comments he allegedly made about former winner  's weight. 

 The 76-year-old singer said he had asked Mitchell to lose weight and has come under fire for the comments, reported  .
 
 "When she first came on, I thought about her trimming down a bit. Leanne had gotten comfortable singing in this holiday camp and she'd put on some weight," Jones said at the press launch of the new series of the singing competition. 
 
 
 
 "Rather than take the opportunity of winning The Voice and a having chance of getting a record deal, which she did, she put on more weight. She didn't have the drive. It didn't seem like she grabbed hold of it with both hands and say 'This is my chance'," he added. 
 
 Jones mentored Mitchell on "The Voice" back in 2012.
