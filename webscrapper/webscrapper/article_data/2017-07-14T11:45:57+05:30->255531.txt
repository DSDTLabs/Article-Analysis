CHANDIGARH: If   is bad, taking the wheel after a cocktail of drugs is worse. The recent ban on liquor vends may help tackle the menace of tipplers on highways, but driving under influence of psychoactive drugs still remains an unaddressed issue.

 A study by the   of   and Research (PGIMER) Chandigarh’s Departments of Forensic Medicine and Pharmacology on patients brought to its trauma centre found substance consumption in 54.5% drivers. Alcohol was the most prevalent substance consumed in 40.5%. At the same time, there were others who were high on opiates (13%), cannabis (7%) and benzodiazepines (7%).
 
 PGI receives accident victims from across the north-western region. Overall, more than one substance was shown in urine of 11.5% of drivers. The study was conducted by a team of four faculty members.
 
 It was observed that more drivers were found to be positive for opioids when compared with other western countries. The prevalence of cannabis and benzodiazepines in this region is similar to studies in   (7.6%, 7.3%) and higher than the injured drivers in the Netherlands (0.5%, 0%). Data for the study was collected in 2014 based on consent of 200 injured drivers.
 
 Professor Yogendra Singh Bansal of PGI’s department of forensic medicine told TOI, “A driver who has consumed a cocktail of drugs may have his alcohol within permissible limits (he may easily evade the alcometer). The police must conduct tests for all substances during their campaigns.”
