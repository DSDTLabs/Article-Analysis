Porvorim: Three days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the Centre has sent a strong advisory to all states to ensure strict action against communal violence in the name of cow protection, chief minister Manohar   on Wednesday issued a stern warning to all those attempting to incite violence, especially  , and said his government would come down heavily on all those who took law into their hands.

 “Nobody will get a chance to take the law into their own hands. He may be a gau rakshak or somebody else. The law cannot be taken into ones hands. If someone attempts to incite people to violence, there will be strict action,” Parrikar said from the floor of the House, while replying to the discussion on the motion of thanks to the governor’s address.
 
 Clearly indicating his focus, Parrikar said communal harmony, safety of women and children and road safety would be the government’s priority.
 
 Several legislators, including some from the ruling  , raised concerns over the statements made recently by Madhya Pradesh-based Sadhvi Saraswati, who was in Goa to attend a four-day All-India Hindu convention. The right-wing leader had said that those who eat beef should be hanged in public.
 
 “If the government starts taking action or comes into between whenever somebody speaks, then where is the freedom of speech? Every person has the right to demand something. Any statement that does not break the barriers of law or incite violence… then there is no restriction, unless you incite people,” Parrikar said.
 
 The chief minister also said the state’s crime graph was inching lower while the crime detection rate was on the rise. 
 
 “I will not tolerate any crime against women and children and indiscipline in traffic, whoever the person may be. We managed to nab the person responsible for damaging the crosses because the government was serious about detecting crimes. The government appreciates people’s calm and peaceful tendency,” he said.
