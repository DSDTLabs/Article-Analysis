NEW DELHI: It was not the first time that someone had fallen inside the   at the   in which 57-year-old businessman   died. Locals said that a child and even a cow had fallen in it a few weeks ago, but they were rescued.

 Residents said that though construction work had started before monsoon, it was left incomplete by the civic bodies. RWAs and social workers said that several reminders to PWD to complete the works or cover up the pits went unheard.
 
 Activist Girish Chand Verma said that the road remains flooded throughout monsoon as the drain remains choked. It is a common sight for visitors to the DDA Park to climb onto the footpath. “Gupta may have tried to do the same, but fallen face down in the drain due to the slippery edge and asphyxiated,” he said.
 
 Another pit was found dug up outside Pocket-V in Mayur Vihar-III where Gupta stayed with his family. “This was dug up and left open by DJB. Anyone walking at night is bound to meet with an accident here as well,” said Gupta’s nephew, Deepak.
 
 PWD and DDA officials who visited the spot said that covers on the pits get stolen or removed. The slab on the drain where Gupta fell was allegedly removed by locals to allow rainwater to drain out. “We have initiated an inquiry and will submit a report soon,” said a PWD official.
