MUMBAI: A small tip-off helped   police crack an 11-year-old murder of a senior citizen. It also led to the arrest of two absconding accused wanted in a separate murder case in Delhi.

 MRA Marg police on Thursday arrested siblings Firasat Ali Shah (48) and Irshad Ali Shah (43) along with   Kharwa (60), the wife of the deceased, who had allegedly hired the contract killers to eliminate her drunkard husband in 2006.
 
 All of them belong to a community that goes from house to house selling utensils in exchange for old garments.
 
 “In 2006, police had found the torso of an unidentified man under the JJ Marg flyover. As the limbs and head were missing, the case remained undetected,” said deputy commissioner of police (zone1)  .
 
 A couple of months ago, police got a tip off that   had been missing for a few years. When subtle attempts to know his whereabouts didn’t work, police picked up Bansiben for questioning. “During interrogation, she broke down and spilled the beans on the two brothers,” said Sukhlal Varpe, senior inspector of MRA Marg police.
 
 Police immediately picked up the Shah brothers who admitted to the crime. “They said the deceased was a heavy drinker who used to beat up Bansiben. Hence, she gave a contract of Rs 2 lakh to kill him,” added Mangesh Pote, assistant commissioner of police.
 
 The accused said the victim had tattoos on his limbs and head that could give away his identity hence they had chopped off his body parts. While quizzing the duo, it emerged they were convicted to life for a murder in   area of Delhi, but had gone absconding in 2016.
