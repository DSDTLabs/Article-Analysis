MAPUSA/MARGAO:   and   gram sabhas on Sunday took up garbage issues affecting their villages.

 Sarzora panchayat has decided to begin door-to-door collection of waste from March 1, sarpanch Sabita Mascarenhas told the gram sabha. Mascarenhas said that while the panchayat would collect segregated dry waste, awareness and training sessions will be conducted for the villages on vermi-composting to dispose wet waste. 
 
 Heated discussions were held over the issue of erection of two mobile towers in the village, with villagers maintaining that only one tower be allowed to be erected. Mascarenhas said that the panchayat was still in the process of identifying land for erecting the tower. Villagers demanded that technical experts be invited to educate the villagers about issues concerning mobile towers. 
 
 The gram sabha of the Anjuna village panchayat also witnessed a discussion on garbage management in the village besides other issues. Sources said that the meeting was attended by less than 20 members. Anjuna local Ramesh Naik called for the postponement of the gram sabha citing that there was lack of quorum.
 
 Some villagers raised questions over the irregular collection of garbage while some questioned to whom was the tender to collect garbage awarded. Anjuna sarpanch   said that presently, the panchayat is managing garbage collection by engaging the daily wages workers and that the panchayat is in the process of issuing the tender.
 
 Questions were also raised about the lack of developmental in the village.
