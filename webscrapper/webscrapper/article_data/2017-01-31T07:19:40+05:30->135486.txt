It started off like any other day for us. We left the hostel early morning, after our professors called out the daily roster of duties. As planned, we reached the designated point at   around 8.45am. From there we were supposed to travel into the slums in DMHO-designated autos to identify the homes where children hadn't been administered the polio drops on Sunday, the first day of the Intensive Pulse Polio Immunization Programme. 

 It was close to 9.30am and most of our other batch-mates had left for their site visits. It was just 13 or 15 of us waiting. We were engrossed in conversation about how we would go about our job for the day and also were discussing how finishing our apprenticeship in the polio camp would be such a huge relief. After all, it's a very tiring job.
 
 Suddenly out of nowhere we saw a car racing towards us. Initially we thought that the driver would either slow down or jam his brakes. But before we could realise that he had lost control of his vehicle, and could move out of his way, the driver crashed into the two-wheelers parked along the side of the road. We heard a loud sound and then blanked out.
 
 The next thing I remember were shrieks of my friends crying out for help. I think I also saw a lot of people drag the cab driver out of his vehicle and yell at him. After that I don't remember seeing him again. I was more focused on getting my friends to safety, especially  , from Chhattisgarh, who is now in the   Unit. Someone among us had dialled 108. 
 
 The horror of those few moments is going to haunt me.
