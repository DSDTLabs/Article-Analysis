LUDHAINA: The   (MC) has served a sealing notice on Amar Shaheed Sukhdev Interstate   for its failure to pay   since 2009. 

 The notice states that if the authorities fail to pay the tax of Rs 5.5 crore, including interest, (calculated till December 31, 2016), then the bus stand will be sealed on February 28.
 
 Sources in the MC say, "The bus stand operations were handed over to a private company on build, operate and transfer (BOT) basis in 2009. But in the contract, the authorities did not specify who will pay the property tax -- the state transport department or the firm." 
 
 MC superintendent (property tax) Vivek Verma says, "After the first notice was served on the firm about seven years ago, it moved the Punjab and   high court, saying it was not mentioned in the contract that who would pay the tax. The company moved the Supreme Court about two years later which directed it to pay 25% of the property tax annually till the case was disposed. The company had paid Rs 69 lakh to the MC till November, when the Apex Court ruled in its favour and asked the transport department to pay the tax."
 
 The civic body then served a tax recovery notice on the bus stand authorities in the last week of December, 2016. 
 
 With they failing to reply, the MC has now issued the sealing notice. 
 
 "The MC will refund to the company the tax money it paid. If the transport department fails to pay up, then we will go ahead with the attachment and sale proceedings," Verma adds.
 
 Soon, the MC will tighten the noose around other government departments, too, who defaulted on the payment, he says. 
 
 The bus stand general manager, Gursewak Singh Rajpal, says, "We are awaiting directions from the state transport authorities."
