As part of community policing,   also constructed a bus shelter and waiting hall at Lothugedda Junction in Annavaram police station limits. 
 
 CRPF jawans distributed materials in Nurmati, Ganhundibaily and Cheruvidhi in G Madugula mandal, Manthalpadu, Krishnapuram, Santabayalu and Kammara Veedhi near Rudakota of Pedabayalu mandal. The materials were distributed to poor people mostly belonging to the primitive tribal groups (PTGs), who are considered to be Maoist symphathisers in the Andhra Odisha Border (AOB).
