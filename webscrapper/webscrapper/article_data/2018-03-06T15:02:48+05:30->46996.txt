PUNE: Rahul Anantrao   (38), a resident of Pradhikaran in Nigdi, was found dead in his car at Nigdi on Monday morning. While the Nigdi police, who are investigating the case, have not found any external injury marks on Khule’s body, medical experts, in a prima facie report, have said that Khule may have been died due to suffocation as he was found locked inside the car.

 Police inspector Shankar Awatade said that Khule had been missing since Saturday. “His wife had lodged a missing person’s complaint with the police on Saturday itself,” he added.
 
 Awatade said that some person called up the police control room on Monday morning and alerted them about the car parked on the road in Pradhikaran area. When the police reached the spot, they found a body in decomposed condition in the car. “We took the deceased to the   in   for a post mortem. The doctors have preserved the viscera,” he added.
 
 Awatade said “The deceased person was an alcoholic and used to consume liquor in his car. It is suspected that on Saturday, too, he must have consumed liquor while sitting in the car with its window glasses rolled up and doors tightly shut. Thus, resulting in his death due to suffocation.”
 
 Awatade said Khule used to work in a private company and that it was his weekend. “Khule’s wife and other family members had been looking for him for the last two days,” he added.
 
 “Initially, we thought it was a case of murder, but preliminary medical reports state that Khule died due to suffocation,” Awatade said.
