NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has identified 100 most congested stretches across the city out of which 44 were shortlisted by the civic bodies and the ministry of urban development for immediate action. Police officers said that they have sent a list of design changes on 15 such stretches that can immediately be decongested. 

  Police have suggested IIT flyover chowk, Ashram, Rao Tula Ram Marg flyover, RR hospital to Dhaula Kuan,   on the Najafgarh Road, Mayur Vihar Chowk, Mukarba Chowk, Shashtri Park, Noida Link Road near Akshardham, Press Enclave Road, Peeragarhi Chowk, ISBT Kashmere Gate, Kamal T-point and   to begin with. Sources said that the suggested modifications can be rectified within a few months. 
 
  A PWD official said that a task force is working on road engineering solutions to decongest some of the critical stretches for which the urban development ministry has announced allocation of Rs 1,500 crore. Reports are being prepared, primarily focusing on low cost engineering interventions to prevent accidents at the identified locations. 
 
 "While the blame of road accidents usually comes on the drivers, lately the government has started accepting how bad road engineering and design are equally responsible for accidents," said a senior traffic police officer.
