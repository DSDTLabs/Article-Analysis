AHMEDABAD: Five more persons including two women were picked up by the   from Mumbai in connection with the conspiracy to bump off Jamnagarbased businessman Ashfaq Khatri.

 The   named Rizwana is connected to Ramdas, one of the four sharpshooters who were nabbed by the Rajkot police on February 25, and had accompanied him on one of the recce missions to Jamnagar earlier.
 
 “Rizwana was carrying a pistol when she had come to conduct a recce in Jamnagar. Ramdas had taken her along so as to avoid any suspicion,” said a senior police official involved in the probe. 
 
 Three others caught with Rizwana are allegedly connected to the D-gang and had been on such reccee missions and other incidents of contract killing with Ramdas outside Gujarat. The four are expected to be brought to Rajkot soon and their arrests are likely, he said.
 
 The Rajkot police had arrested four persons allegedly hired by underworld don Dawood Ibrahim’s brother Anees on February 25 before they could execute their murder plan. Besides Ramdas, the police had arrested Vinit Kundlik, Sandip Dayanand and Anil Dhilod near Kuvadva and seized arms also from them.
 
 Investigations so far have revealed that Khatri was on Anees’s target over the former’s burgeoning khaini (chewing tobacco) business in Dubai. Khatri’s nephew Safdar was handling the khaini business there and had had made deep inroads into the sales of the brand sold by Anees. Anees had then asked him to join hands in the business, an offer which Safdar and Khatri had decline. Irked by this, Anees had given Rs 20 lakh to Ramdas, a notorious paid assassin in Nasik to eliminate Khatri.
