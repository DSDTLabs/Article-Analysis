Thane: Two persons suffered grievous injuries after they were assaulted in separate incidents at Rabodi and Waghbil on Saturday night. 

 In the first incident, Harish Natkar, a resident of Bhiwandi, had gone to his aunt’s place at Waghbil, who complained of her neighbour Rohit Jadhav trying to get close to her daughter. 
 
 “Natkar approached Jadhav and asked him to refrain from talking with his cousin. Annoyed, Jadhav started assaulting him while his friends, who were around, also started hitting Natkar. One of them even hit Natkar with an iron   injuring his head. Natkar was immediately rushed to a private hospital at Manpada by relatives where he is being treated,” said an officer from   police station.
 
 The police have booked Jadhav and his aides for voluntarily causing hurt. 
 
 In the second incident, around eight men attacked a 34-year-old man with an   rod and a sword for reportedly solving a fight which involved his friends around four months ago. 
 
 “The victim, Nitin Madhav, a resident of Rabodi, was assaulted by eight men as he had solved a fight between two gangs involving his friends. The men were angry at Madhav and stabbed him with a sword and an iron rod. He was rushed to Thane civil hospital by a friend, who found him lying in a pool of blood,” said an officer from Rabodi police station.
