AMRITSAR: A day after the Supreme Court directed Punjab and   to amicably resolve the dispute over the construction of the Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal, Sikh seminary Damdami Taksal has demanded scrapping of sections 78-80 of the Punjab Reorganization Act 1966. During the days of militancy in Punjab, Jarnail Singh Bhinderanwale was the 14th chief of Damdami Taksal.

 Talking to TOI on Wednesday, Damdami Taksal chief   said, “Punjabis will never tolerate plundering of their waters. The Union government has to scrap sections 78-80 of Punjab Reorganization Act 1966 and Punjabis are now waiting for justice.”
 
 Dhumma, who has the backing of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), alleged that since the Partition, Punjab had faced discrimination at the hands of successive Congress governments both in the state and at the Centre.
 
 Without referring to Operation Bluestar, he alleged, “Punjab need justice especially in the wake of unconstitutional decisions taken by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s regime, the beginning of which can be made by scrapping sections 78, 79 and 80 of the Punjab Reorganization Act 1966.”
 
 Till 1966, Punjab controlled the rivers falling within its territory. However, under sections 78, 79 and 80 of the Act, the control of rivers was transferred to Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB), which is controlled by the Indian government. In 1976,   issued a notification for the construction of the SYL canal to transfer and divert waters from Punjab rivers to Haryana and Delhi.
 
 Stating that it was SYL canal issue due to which Punjab passed through the dark days of militancy in the past, Dhumma cautioned that the ruling government shouldn’t commit any mistake for which the nation may have to pay price in the future.
