 One of the visionaries behind UNESCO’s Learning Without Frontiers, Jain gave suggestion about introducing diverse education models because “each mind functions and develops differently”. “Intellectual freedom and self-design learning should be promoted,” he said.
 
 A graduate from Harvard University, Jain believes that ‘dropouts’ who want to follow their heart and do something productive are actually ‘walkouts’. He said, “If you are not controlled by the fear of earning money and comments of people, you can explore and evolve tremendously.”
 
 According to Jain, “Progress is being measured fallaciously. Ecological balance should be prioritized over GDP. The political and economic system are tied to environment.”
 
 He shared his theory about the modern system which is based on concealing the problem rather than finding a solution. He said, “We throw waste in the dustbin assuming that we have contributed towards cleanliness. Whereas this junk is collected and dumped in rural areas. We don’t have a real solution for garbage disposal.”
 
 Jain added that every sector has a wide range of opportunities for start-ups. “However, it should be taken up in such a way that it benefits the entire system,” he said.
 
 Nitin Gujrathi of Chair Technology said that the interaction was not only inspiring but deeply effective and thought provoking. “It widened our horizons,” he said. 
 
 Trainee Maitri Borundi, who quit her job as an engineer to start her own firm said, “I can relate to Jain sir’s ideologies of bringing in reforms in the education sector. His words made us wonder if we are even remotely solving the socio-economic issues through entrepreneurship.”
