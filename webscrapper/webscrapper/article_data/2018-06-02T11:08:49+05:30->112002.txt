HYDERABAD: The   government has deferred the announcement of   (IR) to state government   and teachers. The interim relief was supposed to be announced on Telangana Formation Day on Saturday. 

 Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, who held a meeting with employees unions' 10 days ago, constituted a Pay Revision Commission headed by a retired IAS officer CR Biswal and two other members.
 
 KCR on Thursday held a meeting with PRC chairman Biswal, another member Mohd Ali Rafat, chief secretary SK Joshi, chief advisor Rajiv Sharma and officials from the finance department on interim relief issue. The employees unions were expecting about 20-25% IR on their existing scale. 
 
 During the meeting, officials said that IR would be a financial burden on the state government and advised the CM to wait till the PRC gives its interim report. The state government earlier asked the PRC to submit the report by August 15.
 
 Official told the CM said if 1% IR is given, the burden would be 300 crore a year, 10% 3,000 crore and 20% would amount to a 6,000 crore burden. 
 
 According to CMO, the officers said the government had been maintaining financial discipline for four years and the IR would derail that now.
 
 Some members said even Comptroller and Auditor General may raise objections if the IR is given without getting interim report. However, full-fledged PRC has not met so far as another member of PRC Uma Maheshwara Rao is yet to take charge. The CM asked the PRC chairman and members to give its report at the earliest.
