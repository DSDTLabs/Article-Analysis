BELAGAVI: Although villagers, who are benefiting from the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS), are entitled to Rs 224 as daily wages, the expenses that villagers of Kadoli are incurring due to the 70-km travel every day is effectively reducing their earnings to Rs 180. Women workers of Kadoli are being paid an additional sum of Rs 24 to cover their travel expenses, taking the daily wage to Rs 248. However, the women have to travel to Badal Ankalagi village, which is 35km from Kadoli, and the commute is costing them Rs 68. Also, they complain of losing precious hours on the road. Belagavi zilla panchayat has assigned them desilting work at Shri Ramlingeshwar Lake in Badal Ankalagi village.  Kadoli panchayat development officer Ashwini Kundar said, “MNREGS work within the Kadoli gram panchayat limits and the neighbouring Banbaraga and Kednur villages have already been completed. Also, there are no provisions to provide transportation to the workers. We are trying to provide them work close to the village.” However, Anita Belagavkar, an MNREGS worker, claimed that the gram panchayat had deliberately assigned them work at a faraway place.  “This is being done so that we stop going to work. Not only are we spending a lot of money to reach our workplace, time is also being wasted,” she added. Another MNREGS worker Kallavva Kaganikar said, “We have decided to stop going to work. We are thinking of going to Goa or Maharashtra in search of work.”
