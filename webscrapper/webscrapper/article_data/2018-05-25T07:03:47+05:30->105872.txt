PANAJI: The   ( ), Goa, which is in the process of tweaking its curriculum, will set up a fully automated assembly line on campus. The assembly line, which will use robotics, is aimed at making its BTech programme more hands-on, institute director Barad Kant Mishra told TOI. 

 Although it was established just two years ago, IIT Goa is already looking at keeping its curriculum up to speed with industry needs.
 
 “We are also in talks with our sister IITs and will work with them on long-term projects. We will set up a small workshop on campus. Our students are already getting exposure to the industries at Verna industrial estate. Assembly lines are fully automated today and we want to prepare our students for the constantly changing technologies in the industry,” Mishra said.
 
 IIT-Goa began operations in July 2016, offering BTech courses in the streams of mechanical engineering, computer science, and electrical engineering, each with an intake of 30 students. It will introduce a fourth BTech degree in mathematics and computing from the 2018-19 academic year, and has already invited applications from aspiring PhD candidates for around 20 research scholar positions.
 
 The IIT is currently operating from its temporary campus within the complex of the   at Farmagudi, and is set to get land for a permanent campus in Cotarlim, Sanguem.
