VADODARA: The   (BBA) has stayed away from proceedings of the court since February 21 to protest against the alleged insult of lawyers by a police constable. But, several lawyers have been disappointed by the association’s decision and have come forward with an alternative.

 BBA had decided on February 20 to stay away from proceedings for a day but, the next day the association decided to stay away from work for two more days. On Thursday, some lawyers even burnt the effigy of the constable. However, a difference of opinion has cropped up over the method of protest.
 
 “It is a disappointing situation when hundreds of litigants come to the court and then waste their time and money when court proceedings do not take place. The job of lawyers is to help them, instead by staying away from work we are making them suffer,” said  , a city-based lawyer. “It is better that a legal action be taken against the person against whom the protest is being held,” added Chhajed.
 
 Another senior lawyer Jagdish Ramani told TOI: “I have always stood by the lawyers’ fraternity and whatever has happened is wrong. But, the better option is to send legal notices to the policeman.” Another senior advocate   had suggested the association to file a writ in the High Court against the constable. “The Supreme Court has given judgement about the behaviour of cops and if there is indiscipline like in this case, it should not be left unattended,” he said. 
 
 On the other hand the BBA is waiting for the city police to take action against the constable for the alleged insult. Ironically, the association has not yet made any representation to the police. “Even when an application is not done in an incident, the police registers case. We are going to wait for few days if no action is taken by the police then we will deliberate to go for legal action,” said BBA secretary Nehal Sutariya.
