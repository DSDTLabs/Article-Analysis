In a world where communicating with each other is just a click away, staying connected is ironically becoming an elusive task. Crafted along those lines, filmmaker Prataya Saha’s latest   delves into the importance of interpersonal communication, which, according to Prataya, is steadily being lost in the age of digitalization and timelessness. Titled Talk Me Not, the short was recently screened at multiple locations in Bengaluru. 
The film forms part of an initiative, called The Language Project, which is built around the idea that like music, language also has universal appeal and can transcend barriers to foster a connection with the unknown and unseen.
 Speaking more about the ‘human language’, Kolkata-born Prataya says, “This film is an endeavour to explore the potential of a new form of storytelling. Inspired by personal stories, the plot primarily revolves around two people who are trapped in the void of an altercation. Crafted on a romantic-emotional theme, the movie scrutinizes the powerful medium of non-verbal communication.”
 Created under the banner of Eastern Light Films, Talk Me Not focuses on how communication, or rather the lack of it, can strain relationships. The cast includes actor Victor Mukherjee, Anshulika Kapoor and Nizam Sharieff.
