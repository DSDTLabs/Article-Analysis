Singer-composer  , who has collaborated with T-Series on hit tracks like 'Badnaamiyaan' and 'Main Rahoon Ya Na Rahoon' among others, is gearing up to unveil his latest single, 'Ghar Se Nikalte Hi'. The track originally featured in the Jugal Hansraj and Mayuri Kango-starrer, 'Papa Kehte Hain' (1996). This recreated version is the first of the many singles coming from T-Series in 2018. The video will also feature debutant  . The music has been recreated by Armaan’s elder brother, composer  , with additional lyrics by Kunaal Vermaa. 

 Talking about the single, Armaan says, “I feel fortunate that Bhushan Sir (Kumar) thought of me to reprise his all-time favourite song. It’s a beautiful melody, elevated by Amaal. The song also has new lyrics. The fun part was shooting the video in high speed; I had to sing the entire song two times faster than its original tempo!” Amaal shares, “'Ghar Se Nikalte Hi' gave me the freedom to explore my creativity. Bhushan Kumar’s ear for music and his ability to understand the audience’s pulse make you want to be a part of his vision.” On his part,  , says, “'Ghar Se Nikalte Hi' is like going back to an innocence that marks the emotions of love and longing of the bygone era. We felt Armaan was the right choice for it as he has a major fan-following among the youth. Shooting it in the old town of Chania (Greece) has further helped in evoking that tender, undefiled romance.” He plans to release around 20 singles this year.
