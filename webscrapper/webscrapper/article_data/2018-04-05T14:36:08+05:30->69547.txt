 At the event, Chetan Bhagat said, "I have become a part of Anand Kumar & iScholar in its JEE coaching program and partnered in this endeavor. I feel that this would be a game changer for lakhs of students preparing for IIT-JEE and particularly for students who are not able to afford coaching for these examinations. This would be our country’s big leap towards digital India. I will be sharing the essence of his knowledge in digital content format. This education dispersion will be cost effective and will aid learners in not just IIT JEE but also for other CET and board syllabus exams."
 
 Tushar Chhabra, Managing Director of Elite Consulting Group who is the chief strategists to take this initiative to the masses, said, “Vision behind this noble initiative is that lakhs of students in India, who are not able to pay huge fees charged by coaching institutes, feel alone and under confident. The plight of a student in a village whose parents are not able to bear the preparation cost of examinations can easily be understood. Our aim is to stand with that student and give him the confidence that nobody less than Anand Kumar is with you to help you in your preparations.”
