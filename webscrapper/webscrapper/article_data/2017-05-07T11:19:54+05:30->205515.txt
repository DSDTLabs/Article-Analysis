PANAJI: Over a year after work on the Canacona bypass from Char Rasta to Mashem began, it seems unlikely, going by the pace of work, that the December deadline will be met. The Galgibaga and   bridges are part of the bypass, and with officials now estimating that work will now go on well into next year, the wait for the bridges has only grown longer.

 The entire bypass, running from Char Rasta in Canacona town to Mashem, is expected to reduce travel by 15 km. The people worst affected by the absence of this bypass live along the Galgibaga and Talpona rivers. For now, they have to cross to the other side using motorboats, a service that shuts by 7pm. And in case of any emergencies beyond this time, they are forced to take the lengthy road route, via Poinguinim, to get help.
 
 The government had conceptualised the bypass as early as the late â€™80s and had acquired land for the project in 1989. Work, however, was not pursued for various reasons until 2015. The project, estimated to be worth Rs 297 crore, is currently being carried out by contractor  , with funding from the Union ministry of road transport and highways. The Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation is the supervising authority.
 
 The 7.74-km-long bypass road will include three bridges; one each over River Talpona (450m), River Galgibaga river (500m) and River Mashem (130m). The four-lane road will have a 1.2-metre-wide median and also 1.5-metre-wide footpaths on either side. 
 
 The bypass is an elevated route that will serve as an expressway of sorts and will have three vehicular underpasses, 17 piped culverts and four box culverts. 
 
 The elevation was conceptualised primarily because the current road stretch passes through a mix of developed areas, hilly terrains and forested patches, making widening difficult.
