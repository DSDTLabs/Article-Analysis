HYDERABAD: Amid rising cacophony that the state is falling into a debt trap, finance minister   brushed aside criticism from opposition parties. “We have limitations under the rules and the loans we have taken are as per norms,” he clarified on Thursday after presenting the budget.

 To a query at a press conference, he said: “Everyone borrows. We also have to do it for taking up development.”
 
 
 
  
 
 
 But limitations are placed on borrowings under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2005. According to the statement of fiscal policy laid on the table of the state legislature on Thursday, the outstanding amount for the year 2017-18, till March end, was Rs 1,51,133 crore as per revised estimates.
 
 The state’s liabilities include market borrowings of Rs 1,11,535 crore, Rs 9,010 crore loans taken from the Centre, Rs 9,867 crore towards special securities issued to  , borrowings of Rs 13,742 crore from financial institutions as well as Rs 6,976 crore towards provident funds and insurance funds.
 
 Under the FRBM Act, the state was required to eliminate revenue deficit by March 31, 2009, by reducing it by 0.32 percentage points of GSDP every year. At the same time, fiscal deficit has to be brought down to 3% of GSDP by reducing 0.25 percentage points yearly.
 
 “Telangana, despite being a new state with huge commitments across sectors, has been maintaining surplus on the revenue account in 2014-15, 2015-16, and 2016-17,” the document said. Revised estimates for 2017-18 and budget estimates for 2018-19 also indicate surplus on the revenue account. “Effective debt management is vital for fiscal health and its main objective is to ensure that financing of the budget and refinancing of debt is done at the lowest possible cost,” the document added.
