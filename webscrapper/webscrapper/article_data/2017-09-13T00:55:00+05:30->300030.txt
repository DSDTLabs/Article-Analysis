MUMBAI:   ( ) are yet to nab the   who allegedly pushed a teenager out of a running   in Virar last week. 

 RPF obtained CCTV footage of the mugger from Virar and Nalasopara stations, but decided to get a sketch done based on the description provided by the victim, Komal Chavan (19). However, Komal, who is recuperating in hospital after a surgery to fix her dislocated right shoulder, has not been able to give a proper description of the mugger. RPF sources said the sketch does not entirely match the with the image captured on CCTV cameras. tnn
