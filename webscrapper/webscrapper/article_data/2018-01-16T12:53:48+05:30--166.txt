THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: As many as 766 days have passed since   began his protest in front of  . Nothing has shaken his determination over the past two-and-a-half years as he wants only one thing: ensure justice for his brother who allegedly died due to custodial torture in 2014.

 Nine days ago, he began a hunger strike and there is a stark difference at his protest venue now as the scene changed within a week. After #justicforsreejith campaign was launched in social media a couple of days ago, his solo stir went viral and support flowed in from all over the state. People from different cities, mainly college students, gathered in front of the Secretariat to support him.
 
 A day after hundreds of people gathered at the protest venue, several politicians came to visit Sreejith and his mother   on Monday. KPCC president MM Hassan, congress leader VM Sudheeran, Youth League president  , MLA PV Anwar and CPM’s V Sivankutty met them.
 
 They rejected Sivankutty and Anwar’s offer to arrange a meeting with minister’s PS. They wanted to see the chief minister and it was arranged by Monday evening. Ramani signed the affidavit for a   probe which Sudheeran furnished. “We want a CBI probe to punish the real culprits,” she said.
 
 In May 2014,   was arrested by Parassala police on allegations of mobile phone theft. After a couple of days, his family was told that he had tried to commit suicide. Though police said that Sreejeev had consumed poison, Sreejith alleged that his brother was brutally tortured and killed by the police. After two years, the police complaints authority concluded that it was a case of custodial torture. Later, the state government gave Rs 10 lakh as compensation to the family.
 
 Sreejith’s demand for a CBI project did not fructify. In November 2017, home department informed him that the state will request CBI to take up the case. Later, the state government informed him that CBI had refused its request.
