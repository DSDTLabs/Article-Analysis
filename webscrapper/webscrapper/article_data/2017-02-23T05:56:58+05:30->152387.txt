  has asked the authorities to file their response to the petition filed by   and others. 
 
 “The sole intent and objective of the respondents is to gain wrongfully from the funds of the University. The whole episode of clearing a building to shift the University to Ramanagaram is an eyewash. The government gains nothing from a mere shift. The tortuous aim is to force the university into paying for construction of a new building and campus, a project worth approximately Rs 520 crores and arm twisting the University into additionally building a hospital etc. with absolutely no contribution from the government, whereby the government would unscrupulously choose the builder, allot works contract, gain from a free hospital, all from the funds of RGUHS which is directly the fee paid by all the students to RGUHS. The respondents have no right or authority over the money paid by the Petitioners and students to RGUHS” the petitioners have claimed while seeking a direction from the court to quash the February 8,2017 order for shifting of the campus
 
 "The management of examination forms, applications, issuance of hall tickets, announcement of results, etc., is affected if the infrastructure is not in place, as most of the data is entered and compiled online. In such circumstances, shifting of the campus immediately to Ramanagaram would hamper the working of the university and would jeopardize the future of over 1.5 Lakh students. The delay in conducting examinations and announcement of results due to the shifting of the campus would result in students losing out on opportunities to join postgraduate programs or appearing for job interviews” the petitioners have further stated.
