BENGALURU: In a bid to handle additional passenger rush during   match days, the   (BMRCL), for the first time, will use pre-printed paper tickets.

 It will cost Rs 50 per passenger and can be used only for travel from   and Mahatma Gandhi Metro stations to any station along the Purple and Green Lines. Passengers must show the ticket to the guard at the entry and after the journey, it must be handed over at the exit gate.
 
 “Commuters can purchase return journey tickets (paper ticket) from any Metro station valid till the last train service from 4pm onwards on each match day,” BMRCL managing director Mahendra Jain said.
 
 The objective is to clear the rush after matches and avoid long queues due to unavailability of exact change at counters. Paper tickets are available to commuters in addition to tokens. Smartcard holders will have regular discounted rates for the distance travelled during extended hours on all match days.
 
 The ridership touches more than 4 lakh during IPL days. BMRCL has extended services up to 12.30am on match days — April 13, 21, 25, 29 and May 1and 17 — on both the lines.
