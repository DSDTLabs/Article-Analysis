VADODARA: After razing shops in three complexes near the station, the   (VMC) has now started the drive to bring down  , a building of Vadodara district panchayat. 

 VMC teams on Sunday evening reached the station area to raze the Pathik Bhavan building which also houses nine eateries on the ground floor. When the VMC team along with police personnel and team from the   (MGVCL) reached the spot, there was ruckus as shop owners resisted the   drive. 
 
 The shopowners objected saying that the building was not dilapidated. Amidst heated arguments between the teams and the shop owners, a 70-year-old owner of the sweet mart also fell unconscious and was shifted to a hospital. 
 
 VMC had intimated the panchayat office-bearers that the building was in dilapidated condition.
