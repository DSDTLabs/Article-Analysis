 The petition, which was started on March 7 by Shyamala Gogu, has received over 335 supporters within 24 hours. Calling Radhika's ordeal following Rohith's death as "chilling", the petition stated: "The discrediting of Radhika Vemula and devaluation of her life's struggles are indeed a blow to all movements for women's rights and dignity. This move is unequivocally regressive and has dangerous implication for women's rights and undermines decades of feminist struggle for a more egalitarian world where women are not merely tools of reproduction." 
 
 The petition further goes on to say that instead of investigating the alleged offence of abetting Rohith Vemula's suicide,  's state apparatus is being used extensively to disprove the Dalit identity of Rohith Vemula and his brother and mother.
