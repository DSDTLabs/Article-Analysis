 The ‘shoulder duster’ style is a big hit among the stylish divas   and  . This accessory's dramatic shape and the flirty fringe is clearly one style to steal. And what’s not to love about big statement earrings? Take a cue from Deepika and Kareena to ace this style. 
 
 Here are a few tips to work this accessory trend:
 
 
 Both divas opted for ponytails. For such baubles, try to go for minimal hairstyles that don't clash with your accessory. 
 
 
 When wearing such dangly earrings, go for a matching shade of accessory to look coordinated and sleek. And if you’re wearing a solid-coloured outfit, try to pick earrings a shade lighter or darker. 
 
  
  
 
 For neutral shades, you can try bold-coloured earrings like blue ones with a white dress. This will surely add extra drama to your style.

 Go for off-shoulder outfits or necklines that are broader to show off the earrings.
