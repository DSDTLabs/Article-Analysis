PORVORIM: Chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s entry into the Goa legislative assembly complex may not have been so eagerly watched in his entire political career as it was on Thursday.

 The atmosphere was electric and filled with suspense as ministers from his cabinet, legislators from across party lines and others waited with bated breath to receive him in the foyer. Bureaucrats, mediapersons, staff, police personnel and others stood either in the line of his expected path, or watched him from the cordoned area.
 
 Every door, window and opening that faced the foyer and passage to the assembly had people standing and watching Parrikar’s entry with excitement, a scenario that came about after his sudden illness and subsequent hospitalisation in Mumbai.
 
 Though there was no clapping, it was apparent   had arrived to present the budget to a hero’s welcome. The entire corridor was cordoned off in order to prevent people from approaching the chief minister as he has been advised to stay away from meeting people to avoid any infection, the police said.
 
 Peeping through the corridor, an assembly staffer requesting anonymity, said, “There were a lot of rumours about the chief minister’s health. I thought I would stand by the corridor to see for myself how he is doing.”
 
 “Parrikar is looking a little weak, but there is no change in him,” another staffer said.
 
 After entering the assembly complex, Parrikar walked straight to his chamber to convene the cabinet meeting. After the meeting, he walked to the assembly hall, where he presented the Budget. The visitors’ gallery was also full, with many flocking to the assembly to watch Parrikar present the budget.
 
 Speaker Pramod Sawant advised members of the House not to leave the   till Parrikar left. As the chief minister was exiting the complex, people began to gather to watch him leave. Before leaving, Parrikar told TOI, “Nothing has happened to me. I have just been told to keep away.”
