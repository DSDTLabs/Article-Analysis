Bhopal: A shocking case of insensitivity by school was reported at  , Rajgarh, recently when a 5-year-old LKG student of a private school in Sarangpur district was made to sit half-naked for about 4 hours, as he had peed in his uniform and the school did not provide him with spare clothes in chilling cold.

 Parents of Vineet (name changed) came to know about the incident only after they reached school to pick him up. On Monday, child welfare committee (CWC) asked Childline to visit the school with its team and prepare a report on the incident, besides sensitising staff on how to take care of children in such a scenario.
 
 Talking to TOI, Atul Satalkar, director of Childline, Rajgarh, said, “We received the complaint from parents about the incident on our helpline number on January 17. They were extremely hurt by the behaviour of school staff towards the child. We have got the letter from CWC today and will be proceeding as per the directions.” Sachin Pandey, father of the child, was shocked to see his child half-naked when he reached the school to pick him up. On being asked, he told that a peon took off his pants and washed it, but did not give anything else to wear, as a result of which he had to stand half-naked from 10 am to 2 pm.
 
 “I was shocked to see this. They did not even inform us to take him back home. He might have been teased due to which he was in shock for two days,” said Pandey. Senior officials from school administration were not available for comments while other staff denied having received any such complaint. Childline staff will now be visiting the school on Tuesday to talk to principal, staff and schoolchildren.
