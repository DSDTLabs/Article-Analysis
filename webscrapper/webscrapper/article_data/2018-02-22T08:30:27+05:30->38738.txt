RANCHI:   on Tuesday evening arrested a labourer in Rewari district for allegedly raping a 10-year-old blind girl from   about 10 days ago. 

 The crime came to light after the survivor's parents, both migrant labourers, lodged a police complaint earlier on Tuesday. Cops said the girl was raped by her neighbour - from Bihar's Chhapra district - while she was alone at home after her parents had gone to dine at their elder daughter's place, also in Rewari.
 
 After her parents returned, the survivor narrated her ordeal, saying that she would be able to recognise the rapist by his voice. On February 19, the accused visited their house and she recognised him. Her father confronted the accused, who allegedly confessed to the crime, cops said.
