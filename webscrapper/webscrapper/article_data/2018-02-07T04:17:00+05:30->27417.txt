Vadodara: Six policemen including two inspectors were shunted out of the Mahisgar district on Tuesday. The action is believed to be a fallout of the seizure of liquor by officials of the state monitoring cell earlier this month.

 The state monitoring cell had seized liquor being carried in a light commercial vehicle in the precincts of the Santrampur police station in the night of February 1. An offence was registered regarding the incident and one person was arrested. Kingpins of liquor supply in the state Ashok Marwadi, Vinod Sindhi and Dilip Marwadi were as accused in the case registered at the Santrampur police station even as one Dolatsinh Sisodiya was nabbed with the stock.
 
 Days after the seizure that had raised several eyebrows, two police inspectors, two head constables and two constables who were posted with the Santrampur police station were shunted out of the Mahisagar district. The transfers were made after instructions in this regard by the office of the director general of police.
 
 Those who were transferred include police inspector (PI) C R Sangada of the Santrampur police station, PI S S Ninama of the local crime branch, two head constables posted with the Santrampur police station and two constables. Sangada was shunted to the CID (intelligence) while Ninama was shifted to the state reserve police training centre at Sorath. One of the constable was posted at the Santrampur police station while another was posted at the district police headquarters, but was attached with the police station.
