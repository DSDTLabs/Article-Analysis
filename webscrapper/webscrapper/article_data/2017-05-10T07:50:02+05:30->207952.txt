KOTTAYAM:   Uzhunnalil, who was abducted in Yemen last year, made a fresh appeal in a new video where he asked his family members to secure his release. The video was posted on a Yemeni news portal and its authenticity could not be ascertained. The date April 15, 2017 was written on a cardboard and pasted on his body; a relative first saw the video on Tuesday.

 Father Uzhunnalil, who hails from Ramapuram in Kottayam District, was abducted in March last year by suspected ISIS militants. His cousin Shajan Thomas confirmed that the person in the video was Fr Tom. “He appeared week and the beard has lengthened,” he said, adding that his cousin had thanked relatives in the video. The priest had put in a similar request in a video that was uploaded on social media on Dec 26. Thomas said that the location of the video shot this time appears to be different.
 
 Thomas said that family members had met Abu Dhabi Bishop   after the video in December had come out. “A delegation from the family had met the   and the news had appeared in the local dailies. His abductors might have shown this to the priest. This might have prompted him to thank our efforts,” he said. 
 
 In the new video, the priest is seen saying that he was being treated well. “My health is deteriorating and I need hospitalisation as early as possible,” he said.
 
 He added that the response of the Indian Government was poor when his abductors contacted officials. The response of the Abu Dhabi Bishop too was not very encouraging he said. “I am sad as Indian authorities or the bishop did not ask them what they really wanted to secure my release,” he said. He concludes by urging his family members to somehow secure his freedom. 
 
 Jose K Mani, who is representing Fr Tom’s constituency, said: “His folks are worried about his safety,” he said. He urged the Centre to seek the aid of international agencies like UN for the   of the priest.
