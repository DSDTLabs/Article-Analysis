PANAJI: Days after a 10-metre portion of the dilapidated Portuguese-era bailey bridge at Borim and its three columns collapsed into the  , the   has warned local fishermen and commercial vessels against transiting the area during low tide. While the average depth of the river is around 4-5 meters, due to the collapsed span, the depth has been reduced to 2.5 meters, captain of ports   said.

 With locals claiming that the remaining spans were also precariously placed, the Captain of Ports department,   and PWD have undertaken a joint inspection to salvage the collapsed portion of the bridge and to take preventive measures for the other spans and columns still standing.
 
 “We conducted a site inspection today has and though navigation is not blocked, as an extra precautionary measure we have issued a notice to mariners about the underwater navigational hazard and have asked them to transit only during high tide,” Braganza said.
 
 The department has informed all the owners and masters of barges, passenger launches, ferry boats, tindels of fishing trawlers and operators of the mechanized and non-mechanized crafts, including the tourist boats, cruise boats and other through the area.
 
 Braganza went on to say that there would be no impact on iron ore transportation or pleasure crafts as navigation had not been completely hindered and that vessels could go around the obstruction.
 
 There have been calls for the government to demolish the remaining portion of the bridge which is on the verge of collapse to prevent any untoward incident. The bridge was first demolished during the liberation war in 1961 but rebuilt later. Sand extraction is also done near the broken bridge.
