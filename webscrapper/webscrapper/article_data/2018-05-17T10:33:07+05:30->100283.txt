Cuttack: Delay in the desiltation drive on city drains, to be undertaken by the  , has resulted in a nightmarish situation for residents. Most of the drains are choked with garbages, as the monsoon is likely to arrive early. 

 Corporators allege that more than 70 per cent of the drains in the city are choked. The desiltation process, which is generally taken up by March-end or the first week of April, is supposed to end in May, with the onset of monsoon. 
 
 The Nor'westers have already resulted in many of the city drains overflowing. Several low-lying areas in the city, like Buxi Bazar, Stewartpatna, Bajrakabati, Friends Colony and  , are routinely water-logged. "The situation will only grow worse with the oncoming rains," said  , corporator of ward four.
 
 "We have requested the commissioner that there is a dire need to start work by this week or else will protest against the delay," added Behera.
 
 In 2007, Cuttack residents experienced the worst-ever case of waterlogging, with most parts of the city submerged during the monsoon showers due to choked drains. Cuttack has a network of 25-km-long storm water channels, 29 km of branch drains and 72 km of tertiary drains.
 
 The civic body spends over a crore in a year in removing silt from the main and branch storm water channels.
 
 Admitting the delay, CMC commissioner   said the Odisha water supply and sewage board has been notified. "Several major drains are under construction by the. We will hold discussions by them and they will be desilting of the major drains in the city," said Mohapatra.
 
 Small drains in various places will be the desilted by the CMC, added Mohapatra.
