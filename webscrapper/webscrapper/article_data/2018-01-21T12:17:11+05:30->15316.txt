KOLHAPUR: Senior leader N D Patil said they would continue the work started by rationalists Narendra Dabholkar, Govind   and M M Kalburgi in social sector and would not let their sacrifice go waste. 

 He was addressing the gathering of like-minded organisations and activists that had come together for the Morning Walk organised to remember rationalist   and spread his thoughts among people. The walk is organised on the 20th of every month since Pansare was killed in 2015.
 
 On Saturday, the morning walk began at around 8am from   talim and the people walked through Maskuti lake,   peth, Mahadev temple, Shukrawar peth, Dhotir lane and concluded at Mahadev temple.
 
 Addressing the gathering, Patil said, “Though we were few in numbers today, our work will increase our following. One day will come when people will be aware of the work of these leaders and stand together for social upliftment. We are waiting for justice and one day truth will come out. The guilty who are responsible for the death of these leaders will be punished by the court.”
 
 A participant said that the morning walk was also a way to raise awareness regarding the delay in the investigation of the Pansare murder case. 
 
 Dabholkar, the crusader against the superstition and religious charlatans, was shot at a bridge near   temple in Pune by unidentified gunmen on August 20, 2013, when he was out for morning walk.
 
 Pansare and his wife Uma were attacked by two unidentified men riding on motorcycle on February 16,2015 when they were returning after their morning walk. Pansare was hit by three bullets and had succumbed to injuries on February 20.
