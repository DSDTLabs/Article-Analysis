JALANDHAR: A senior British civil servant has apologized for mentioning Darbar Sahib ( ) as ‘Golden Mosque’ in a tweet on Monday. Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) permanent under secretary Simon McDonald attracted criticism from Sikhs for wrong mention of the holiest of the Sikh shrines in Amritsar.

 McDonald had tweeted a picture from Queen’s birthday celebrations organized by the British deputy high commissioner in Chandigarh.
 
 “At QBP in Chandigarh @SinghLions presented @DHCAndrewAyre with picture of HM The Queen at   in Amritsar in 1997, a permanent momento for Deputy High Commissioner’s wall @UKinIndia,” McDonald tweeted on Monday.
 
 He was apparently referring to a picture of Queen Elizabeth’s visit to Darbar Sahib in 1997. However, after the reference ‘Golden Mosque’ attracted strong criticism from Sikhs and some twitterati took dig at him for lack of information about the most revered Sikh shrine, where not only people of different faiths come from across the globe but several world leaders have also visited.
 
 Realizing the blunder in the latest tweet, McDonald said, “I was wrong: I am sorry. I should of course have said the Golden Temple or, better, Sri Harmandir Sahib.”
 
  UK, which had earlier asked McDonald to apologize within 24 hours and also tagged British prime minister and foreign secretary, after the apology said, “This was a major gaffe by a top civil servant and totally unacceptable. It demonstrates a remarkable level of ignorance from someone in his position.”
 
 Federation chair Amrik Singh urged the UK government to go beyond apology and sought commitment from the government and senior civil servants to root out such ignorance and discrimination or “we will continue to face hate, abuse and threats of violence”.
