Mumbai: The   is likely to get pushed to the end of the year. The government has referred the proposal for merger of   with   to attorney general   for a legal opinion, which is expected this month. However, the companies would need a fresh round of clearances from various authorities.

 The Centre has sought a legal opinion on the three-stage merger as it involves an intermediate step where Max Life will merge with its parent — a finance company. Following this, the merged company would shed the non-insurance business through a demerger and then merge with HDFC Life. The government has sought an opinion because the process involves merger with a non-insurance company. HDFC and Max Life have explained that this would be only a momentary aberration as the subsequent demerger would happen instantly.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Amitabh Chaudhry, MD & CEO, HDFC Life, said that the process would involve getting permission from the   (CCI). The merging companies would have to obtain approval of the   (NCLT) instead of a high court. The two insurance companies would also have to approach   again and would need to seek separate permission for merger of schemes.
 
 The partners have taken a complex three-step process as this would enable the merged HDFC Life Insurance Company to be listed without going through an initial public offer. After the merger, HDFC Life Insurance would be the largest private insurer in India.
 
 In a presentation to shareholders in December 2016, Max Financial Services had said that the IRDAI had expressed reservations on MFSL’s merger with life insurance companies. As a result, the merger would not happen before the third quarter of 2017-18. MFSL said that the proposal had been sent to the CCI and Sebi and all queries raised by these regulators have been addressed. However, approvals will be progressed only after IRDAI grants its approval.
