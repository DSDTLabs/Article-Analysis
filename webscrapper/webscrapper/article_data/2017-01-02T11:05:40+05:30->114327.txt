VADODARA: Police yet to decide whether to arrest the 64   who tested positive for alcohol in the December 22   at   in Sevasi. 

 The blood samples of 143 of the 271 guests contained alcohol as per the   (FSL) report recieved on Saturday.
 
 "We are yet to have clarity about whether the women guests tested positive for alcohol will be arrested or not. The investigating officer will go through Supreme Court judgments and decide about it," said Saurabh Tolumbiya, superintendent of police, Vadodara (rural). The police is wary about arresting the women as it doesn't want to take unnecessary steps that could put them in quandary. 
 
 A day after raiding the pre-wedding ceremony where liquor was being served, the police had arrested all the men and then granted them bail from the police station. Blood test of women was done but they were allowed to go as, according to the law, females cannot be arrested in night. 
 
 "We will investigate the case in detail and also take further statements if necessary," Tolumbiya added.
