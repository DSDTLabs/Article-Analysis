CHENNAI: A cancerous tumour on the thigh of a six-year-old boy could not have formed due to vaccination given several years ago, as occurrence of   following immunization had not been reported anywhere in the world,   government informed the Madras high court on Monday.

 The submission came in response to a suo motu PIL proceeding initiated by a division bench comprising Justice S Nagamuthu and Justice Anita Sumanth on the basis of a photograph and news article published by a Tamil daily last week. Moved by the plight of the boy  , the court had directed the state government to admit him in   or any other hospital and provide him necessary treatment at government’s cost.
 
 On Monday, the state health secretary filed a report stating that the boy was evaluated by a medical team at Adyar Cancer Institute. Noting that the present ailment of the boy was not due to immunization injection given to him when he was a 4-month-old child, the official enclosed a report of director of public health and preventive medicine.
 
 However, the court chose to go for a second opinion and directed the government to send details of immunization injection given to the boy to the head of the department of oncology, at AIMS in New Delhi, and to the head of the department of oncology at Tata Memorial hospital Mumbai.
 
 The judges who had visited the child at Adyar Cancer Institute on March 23, said: “We cannot close the case simply accepting the statement of the director of public health and preventive medicine wherein it was stated that the occurrence of cancer following immunization is not reported anywhere in the world.”
 
 The bench posted the matter for further hearing to April 5.
