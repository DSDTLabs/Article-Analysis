BALLIA (UP): The horrifying gang-rape of   in New Delhi in December 2012 sparked international outrage and turned the spotlight on her otherwise little-known east UP village. Politicians made a beeline for   to mark their presence in her last rites in January 2013. They made myriad promises about sprucing up amenities, schools and roads to honour her memory. 

 Four years on, nothing has changed. As Nirbhaya’s village votes on March 4, girls here still trudge 10 km to the nearest high school — the promised government inter-college remains a pipe dream. “Let’s see when the inter college comes up. It’s only on paper,” an elderly Dev Muni says. People here have lost faith in politicians’ promises. 
 
 A day before the spirited physiotherapy intern’s terhwi (13th day rites) in January 2013, CM Akhilesh Yadav visited Medaura Kalan to console the kin and offer government help. He promised a primary health centre (PHC), an inter college and jobs to four from our family, recalls Lalji Singh, Nirbhaya’s grandfather. Barring the primary health facility, most other promises remain unfulfilled, he says. Worse, the PHC remains locked most of the time for want of doctors. Villagers say there are two paramedics, who give medicines for minor ailments. “Most of the time we return disappointed from the PHC,” an elderly woman Naina Devi says.
 
 "What’s the use of a facility that doesn’t provide medical help when needed,” another villager Ajay Kumar Pandey laments. Land for the college has been identified and a proposal for its construction awaits government approval, district inspector of schools of Ballia Ramesh Kumar Singh says. 
 
 Though Nirbhaya’s parents and brothers are settled in Delhi, her grandfather, uncle and other family members live in the ancestral village. Ballia district is regarded as one of the most underdeveloped in east UP. “The main occupation is farming, though many have regular jobs too,” says Nirbhaya’s grandfather.
