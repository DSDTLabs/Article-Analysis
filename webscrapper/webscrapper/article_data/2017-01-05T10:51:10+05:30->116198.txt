HUBBALLI: Members of the Hubballi Autorickshaw Owners and Drivers Association held a   rally on Wednesday urging the authorities not to issue permits for new autos in Hubballi.

 They took out a rally from Laxmi Complex in   to Mini Vidhana Soudha and held a protest there. Shekharayya Mathapati, association president, said that the city already has more autos than required and if   are issued, it will be difficult for those, who operate the existing ones, to feed their families. 
 
 Secretary Pundalik Badiger said that the news of issuing permits autos has already made the existing   feel insecure. This apart, the new autos will also add to the traffic on the already congested roads in the city.
 
 Later, they submitted a memorandum to the deputy commissioner through the tahsildar.
