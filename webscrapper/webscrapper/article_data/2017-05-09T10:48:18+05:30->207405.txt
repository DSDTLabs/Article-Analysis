NEW DELHI: Flying to   for a summer break may not remain just a dream if SpiceJet’s plans for medium to long haul international flights work out. The low cost carrier (LCC) is currently working out the economies of this model and says return fares could be about Rs 25,000 to places like London, Paris and Amsterdam in all-economy seating wide body aircraft. Return fares on these sectors is mostly upwards of Rs 40,000 on full service Indian and foreign airlines, especially in peak travel seasons.

 This January   had placed an order for up to 205 Boeing aircraft — 155 B-737 and an optional order for 50 more that was a mix of wide and narrow body planes. “We are evaluating the low cost long haul model for which an optional order for wide body planes has been placed. There is a good market for this segment in India if a good product is offered at the right price. Imagine the demand that a fare of Rs 10,000-15,000 on Delhi-London will have,” SpiceJet chairman Ajay Singh had said on January 13 while signing the deal with Boeing.
 
 The airline has made headway with those plans and shared some key features with TOI. “SpiceJet will follow the same low cost/no frills model on its long haul routes as it does on its domestic and short haul international sectors where passengers pay for additional services like meals, seat selection, priority check-in, priority boarding and excess baggage. However, unlike some other international LCCs, the first (check-in) bag would be free of charge,” said a SpiceJet official. 
 
 A leading international long haul LCC, for instance charges $32 for a check-in bag of up to 20 kg — one way -- on its India-Southeast Asia flights. So if SpiceJet is able to offer this service at no extra cost, that will be significant saving for flyers. 
 
 “SpiceJet plans to have 350-380 seats on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. It would be an all-economy class configuration with few select rows of SpiceMax seats offering extra leg room. Full service Air India has 256 seats on its Dreamliners with 18 in business class. (With this seating capacity) if we can cap return fares at levels of about Rs 25,000, many would prefer a European vacation when a domestic return ticket can cost the same during peak season,” said another SpiceJet official, adding that the LCC is looking at London, Birmingham, Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Zurich as the possible destinations. It will offer in flight entertainment on its flights from later this year. 
 
 The airline did not give a firm date for starting these flights. “SpiceJet continues to study the viability of low-cost long haul travel and a decision will be taken in due course,” said Ajay Singh.
 
 However, actual fares will depend on oil prices when SpiceJet launches these flights.
 
 Indian LCCs — IndiGo, SpiceJet and GoAir — have narrow body planes like B-737 and   A-320 in their fleet. IndiGo and SpiceJet operate to nearby foreign countries like Gulf and   and GoAir also plans to do the same. But as of now, no Indian budget airlines flies long haul.
 
 On the other hand, foreign LCCs offer connections to as far as Australia and eastern Europe through their hubs in Dubai and Singapore and Indians are already flying long haul on them. The biggest foreign LCCs currently operating to India are Singapore-based Scoot and Tiger (both part of Singapore Airlines’ Group); Kuala Lumpur-based AirAsia; Dubai-based flydubai and Sharjah’s Air Arabia. While the SIA budget carriers offer connections to China, Southeast Asia and Australia from their hub, the Gulf LCCs do so to eastern Europe, West Asia and  . In fact, flydubai gets a significant transfer traffic for its Europe flights from India.
 
 Indian LCCs like SpiceJet now want a share of the growing pie of long haul budget travel to and from the country.
