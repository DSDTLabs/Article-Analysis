Yesterday, Nagpur voters exercised their right to choose their civic representatives. While the seniors went about the task in a monotonous way, wearing a ‘been there done that’ air, it was interesting to see the   quite gung ho about their right to vote…

 
 
 For a student of LAD College, Payal Shambharkar, Tuesday would remain etched in her memories forever. She shared, “Yesterday, I was like a child who was about to enjoy a treat for the first time. It was, after all, my first chance to cast the ballot and I was waiting for that moment for years. After casting my vote, I really felt quite responsible, having made a difference in my own small way.”
 
 
 
 A student of Ramdeobaba College of Engineering, Vivek Tiwari, cast his vote in the afternoon. After that, He said, “Once I was done, I gave gyan to all my friends who had not gone to the polling booth. It is important that we exercise our right to choose now, instead of whining about the quality of candidates elected. It gave me a high when some of my friends actually paid heed and went to vote.”
 
 
 
 Preparing for her M.Tech, Akshita Bhonsale, revealed, “The   day, started with a fight between me and my brother. I won the fight and my brother had to come along with me to vote. Post that, all of us made the most of the holiday and celebrated our right to vote with a leisurely dinner and family adda. Being aware voters certainly calls for a celebration.”
 
 
 
 To motivate more Nagpurians to exercise their right to vote, a lot of eateries and restaurants in the city offered 20-25 percent discount to people who had cast their vote. Rachita Dutt and her friends, who enjoyed a pizza treat at one of the fast food restaurants, shared, “Our entire gang of five friends enjoyed a sumptuous dinner at straight 25 percent discount, followed by selfie sessions. After doing our duty as responsible citizens, we sure deserve such a treat.”
