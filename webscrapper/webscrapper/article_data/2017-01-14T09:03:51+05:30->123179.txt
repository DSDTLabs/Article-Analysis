JAIPUR: This ‘Makar Sankranti’ the Congressmen in Jaipur are resorting what the party did in Delhi in protest against the Simon Commission in 1928. To express their opposition to the state BJP government, the Congressmen here are flying kites with protest slogans written on them, as was reportedly done against the Simon Commission sent by the British government to suggest changes in the Government of India Act.

 Congress’s Jaipur city president and former legislator   flew some slogan-written kites and distributed 5100 of these, which were prepared by the party’s ‘Abhav Abhiyog Prakosth’ general secretary Nitesh Paliwal, to the people on Friday. The kites have slogans like “Pradesh mein BJP Sarkar ke kushashan ke teen varsh” (three years of poor-governance of BJP government in the state) and would be flown from different areas of the city on the ‘Makar Sankranti’ festival on Saturday. Kite-flying on  , which mostly falls on January 14, has long been a major festivity in Jaipur. Such is the craze for kite-flying among Jaipur-born people that some even fly back to the city from their workplaces abroad on Makar Sankranti.
 
 The Vasundhara Raje-government is planning a grand function in Jaipur on January 22 to mark three years of its rule in the state.
