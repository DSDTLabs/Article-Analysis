CHENNAI:   Suresh Prabhu has directed Southern Railway general manager to speed up the project of redevelopment of Chnenai Central, at a review meeting on Monday.

  He was in the state for two functions at Tiruchirapalli and Kumbakonam over the weekend where he inaugurated a slew of passenger amenities.
 
 In a series of tweets, Prabhu said that station redevelopment was very important for non-fare revenue and better travel experience. In the first phase,   and Kozhikode have been announced in the list.
 
 Sources said that Prabhu asked the GM Vashishta Johri to be ready for second phase of station redevelopment, where Coimbatore, Ernakulam and   would be included in the list.
 
 Southern Railway has already floated tenders for commercial space around Chennai Central so that it can be developed by private players. The funds available through this would be used to build better passenger amenities in the station.
 
 Prabhu also reviewed punctuality, passenger amenities and participation of state governments of Kerala and Tamil Nadu in railway projects. “We shall take up with state governments regarding land acquisition, law and order issues so that we can complete projects on time,” he said in a tweet.
 
 Prabhu also directed the Southern Railway administration to expedite the projects in the zone. The zone has been only an average performer in the recent times due to falling freight revenue and other factors as noted in an internal review of the railway Board. The operating ratio, a performance indicator, has worsened over the last financial year.
