 is literally living out of a suitcase these days. The actress, who plays   on TV show ' ', got married to her beau   in December last year. Since then, she has been shuttling between Mumbai, her show’s set in   and London, where her husband works as a financial consultant.

 The actress, who last visited London for four days in April, says, “I got to know just a day earlier that I could leave for London after the shoot wraps up around 8 pm. I left directly for the airport from Umergaon. The saving grace is that I have acquired the habit of sleeping on flights, so that keeps me fresh.”
 
 While the actress has always been in a long-distance relationship with Prathmesh, she pines to move in with him for good. Suhani tells us, “Prathamesh keeps joking that though we are married on paper and in photographs, it still feels like our courtship period. Honestly, I didn’t feel the need to get married, but Prathmesh wanted to. He is quite chilled out and follows my show. He tells me, ‘Though you are not physically present in London, I can see you every day’. I love my job, but I often feel like giving up everything just to be with him.” 
 
 The actress, however, plans to move to London after 'Porus' wraps up, and pursue dance as a career. She says, “I will be moving to London, but that doesn’t mean that I will be detached from the industry. I will take up interesting projects, but not a daily soap, as it’s too big a commitment. I would also like to pursue classical dance as a career; I have been learning Bharatnatyam since the age of six. If and when my husband decides to relocate to India, I will take up more work here.”
