ROPAR: The panchayat and villagers of   village, 2km away from the   national highway, in   sub-division, submitted a memorandum to the Ropar deputy commissioner on Thursday, alleging some unidentified persons had levelled a drain. The villagers said the alleged act could raise the risk of floods during monsoons. 

 They alleged mining also took place in the area following which the   drain's banks were levelled and tress uprooted from the site. The Mudki drain was constructed during the British Raj to manage the overflowing rainwater. 
 
 Village numberdar   said, "The land was levelled and sand was taken away from the banks. We have requested the administration to act in the matter as it could leave our villages submerged under water. In past, the villages nearby have faced the floods many times."
 
 Irrigation department's executive engineer (drainage),  , said, "There was no mining at the spot. Land mafia had levelled the banks of the drain and had filled the vacant space with sand. The mafia seemed to have used tractors and trucks besides JCBs to level the banks. All this happened in a single night. The mafia had uprooted around 200 trees and forest officials have lodged a complaint in this regard. We have also filed a complaint with the police over this matter." 
 
 SSP   said a case under had been registered.
