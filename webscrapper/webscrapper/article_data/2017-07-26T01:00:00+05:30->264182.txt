PATNA: IG (prisons) Anand Kishor on Tuesday dismissed assistant jail superintendent Sudhir Kumar from service for acting in connivance with criminals lodged in jail. He was also found guilty of insubordination, disobedience and misbehaving with senior officials besides harassing his junior colleagues and some inmates who had complained against him.

 The IG, in a press release, said Sudhir was suspended on November 22 last year when he was posted as the assistant jail superintendent at Rosera sub-jail after complaints were received against him from department officials as well as some jail inmates.
 
 After his suspension, Sudhir was found guilty in the departmental proceedings initiated against him. During the internal investigation, it also surfaced that he was collecting money inside jail with the connivance of some criminals.
 
 Beur central jail superintend Rupak Kumar, after investigating the matter, had submitted his report on May 9 on the basis of which Kishor dismissed Sudhir. The officer was given the chance twice to give explanation, which was not found satisfactory.
 
 Sudhir had misbehaved with his senior on March 3 last year. Earlier, on April 20, 2015, he had abused some inmates on whose complaint he was officially warned. Again on October 15 2015, he misbehaved with jail inmates after which he was warned by additional district and sessions judge (ADJ) of Samastipur. Following the ADJ warning, he was kept away from prisons for sometime.
