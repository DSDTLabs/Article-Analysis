AMRITSAR: Former secretary of the Chief   (CKD) Bhagh Singh Ankhi has written to the jathedar of   to excommunicate the body’s suspended head Charanjit Singh   from the Panth for being booked in a case of making sexual advances towards a woman principal of a school run by the CKD. 

 The Diwan is a prominent Sikh body running schools, orphanages and hospitals.
 
 On December 26, 2017, an objectionable video of Chadha, along with a woman principal of a school run under the management of the CKD, went viral on net, which was followed by registration of a police case against him and his son  , who later committed suicide on January 3. Ankhi has asked the   president to pass a resolution, condemning Chadha’s “despicable act” in its executive committee meeting. 
 
 Talking to TOI on Monday, Ankhi said not only the   jathedar should excommunicate Chadha but the SGPC should also take cognizance of the incident and pass a resolution in its executive committee meeting, denouncing Chadha’s act.
 
 Ankhi also blamed Chadha for allegedly violating an edict of the Akal Takht issued about langar.
