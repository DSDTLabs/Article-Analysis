NEW DELHI: Chief Justice of India   said on Wednesday that making strict laws was not sufficient to prevent crimes against women. 

  He emphasised that the mindset of society had to change to ensure women enjoy equal status as men. 
 
  "A man goes outside house as per his will but wife goes outside after taking permission. A man spends money as he chooses but wife spends as per his nod. A man is considered to be the master of the house but not wife, because she cooks, washes clothes, keeps the house clean and makes all efforts to make life comfortable. This is the mindset which must change. Children also see the behaviour of their parents and follow the same mindset where a girl child is treated as liability and a boy is considered as a future asset," he said. 
 
  Speaking at a seminar organised by SC's Gender Sensitisation and Internal Complaints Committee, Khehar said there was psychological as well as physiological issues behind rape and eve-teasing. He said crimes against women were more prevalent in lower strata of society and it was not only punishment which could set things right. He said that needs of the poor and deprived must be taken care of by the society. 
 
  Justice Dipak Misra said that putting restriction on women's freedom was a medieval practice that must be done away. GSICC chief and the lone woman SC judge Justice R Banumathi said that the court had always been upfront in protecting the rights of women and in implementing constitutional mandate against gender discrimination.
