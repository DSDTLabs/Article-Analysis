Kapil Sharma, who was missing from the small screen, is now all set to return with his new show Family Time With  , which will premiere on March 25. The channel recently shared a new trailer, where Kapil can be seen talking to Bollywood actor  . 

 The promo begins with Kapil calling Ajay and reminding him who he is. The latter, however, keeps him on hold and asks him to wait just like he makes other people wait for him. 
 
 On his part, Kapil justifies that his time was bad, but he is a good person. He pleads him to come to the show. Ajay continues to tease him and disconnects the call. But then he tells everyone that he'd definitely come on the show, since Kapil is coming up with something new this time. 
 
 This also indicates that Ajay might be the first guest on the show. Take a look at the teaser:
 
  
  
 
 Kapil, who has an impeccable comic timing, has chosen a game show for his return to TV this time.
  
 From his mid-air brawl with co-star   to the dud performance of his debut home production film at the box-office, Kapil was in news for all the wrong reasons last year. 
 
 
  
  
 Eventually the comedian had decided to take a break from work as his professional life took a toll on his health. This is also the reason for which   was taken off air and the channel had decided to give Kapil time to rejuvenate.
 
 But all seems well now with fans waiting for the premiere of the comedian's new show.
