Mumbai: The city’s planning body has sought from the Centre a finance Special Economic Zone (SEZ) tag for the 50.31 hectares of land at   that has been cleared for the   (IFSC). On Thursday, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority had formally approved the 50.31 hectares for the proposed financial hub. 

 Getting a   tag is essential for BKC if it has to get the tax sops and other concessions offered to an IFSC to attract global players. 
 
 According to the rules, the minimum area required to be declared an SEZ is 50 hectares. Last year, the Centre had sent back the state government’s proposal to consider 20 hectares of land in BKC and the rest from built-up area to meet the 50-hectare requirement.

 MMRDA is also working on preparing a master plan for the IFSC. Madan said, “We will approach the RBI and the finance ministry for various clearances.” He added that the decision on the bullet train terminus below the IFSC plot is not yet taken. “We have not set any deadline to begin construction; we will first wait to get all approvals.”
