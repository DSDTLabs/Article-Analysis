AHMEDABAD: The non-performing assets (NPAs) of various banks in Gujarat rose to 7.40% of gross advances for the quarter that ended in June 2017. The   stood at 6.78% during the corresponding quarter in the last fiscal. Interestingly, NPAs in non-priority sector as well as the agri term loan segment have crossed the 8% mark. According to bankers, NPAs above 8% are generally considered a trigger point for banks to take necessary actions.

 According to the latest report of the   ( ), gross NPAs of banks in Gujarat were Rs 35,342 crore during the first quarter of the current fiscal as against Rs 29,734 crore in the same quarter last year. Banks seems to be concerned over growing NPAs in segments such as non-priority (mainly driven by corporates) and agri term loans. Non-priority NPAs surged to 8.39% and agri term loan NPAs to 8.47%.
 
 Bankers attribute this rise to moderate economic activity. As far as agri term loans are concerned, the amount of gross NPA stood at Rs 2,831 crore, while the non-priority sector NPAs were at Rs 22,334 crore. “A number of banks have been put under prompt corrective action by the RBI as well,” said  , the convener of the SLBC-Gujarat.
 
 In fact, several individual banks — mainly public sector banks — have reported NPAs in the range of 10% to 32%. The average gross NPAs for nationalized banks stood at 14.18% for the quarter. This indicates a slowdown in economic activity.
 
 “Main borrowers include steel, infrastructure, cement and textiles,” Khichi said. “Any slow movement or hiccups in the operations of these industries will reflect in the NPAs.”
