HYDERABAD: It isn’t   alone who are unhappy with   to further reduce their base price.   working with the taxi aggregators are equally upset, especially since the operators have already tightened their purse strings around the incentives given previously. Drivers fear that their income, which has dropped significantly of late, would suffer a further beating if the rates are revised. 

 “We would be happy if the cab fares were fixed at Rs 14 per km like autos. That would ensure we had a steady monthly income. We wouldn’t have to struggle to make ends meet,” said Anjaneyulu K, president of Telangana State Cabs Association (TSCA). “Having a fixed fare for cabs would prove to be a win-win situation for both auto and cab drivers,” he said.
 
 According to cab drivers, making even Rs 1,000 a day has become a Herculean task as their incentives have been reduced by at least half. “Earlier, we used to get a bonus of Rs 500 per trip, which helped us earn up to Rs 5,000 per day. That’s not the case now. Given the money we spend on diesel and maintenance, we are hardly left with anything by the end of the day,” said Chandra, another cabbie.
 
 As opposed to Rs 6,000 for 16 bookings earlier, drivers said they make only Rs 4,800 for 18 bookings per day. Of this, 20% is paid to the taxi aggregators as commission. Further, the Rs 2,000 ‘reward’ paid to drivers for business worth Rs 1,000 has now been reduced to Rs 1,600.
 
 It may be recalled that   went on a major protest against taxi aggregators on New Year’s Eve, demanding fixed tariffs and phasing out of share cabs. The strike was called off after operators refused to oblige.
