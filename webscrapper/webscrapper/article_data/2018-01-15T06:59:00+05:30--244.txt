Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad Development Authority has decided to recover Rs 1.11 crore from three private firms that had contracts for providing municipal services in Indirapuram after an inquiry into allegations of improper solid waste management in the township. The municipal services in Indirapuram are provided by the   through private firms because the township is yet to be handed over to the GMC.

 The three firms had held the contract to provide municipal services in Indirapuram in the past three years.
 
 “An inquiry has revealed that door-to-door collection of municipal waste was not being undertaken in areas with low-rise apartments in the past three years. The inquiry has also revealed that certain officials did not initiate any action despite complaints that the private firms were not adhering to the terms and conditions contained within the scope of work. A recommendation has also been sent to the state government to conduct a departmental inquiry into the role of these GDA officials. The recovery order will be issued on the firms next week,” district magistrate and vice-chairperson of GDA Ritu Maheshwari told TOI.
 
 The inquiry had been initiated by the vice-chairperson on the basis of a TOI report that highlighted replies to a set of RTI queries by social activist Alok Kumar about alleged irregularities in solid waste management in Indirapuram.
 
  Sahibabad MLA Sunil Sharma had also written to the GDA demanding a probe into the issues raised by Kumar.
 
 “We have, meanwhile, begun door-to-door collection of municipal waste in low-rise building areas with vans, tippers and tractors by two contractors. We have also sought a time-chart from RWAs for the movement of these vehicles within the township.”
 
 “ A bid for night-cleaning in Indirapuram will also be floated in the next 90 days. Various main roads and market areas of the township will be cleaned during the night to avoid inconvenience to local public and traffic,” Maheshwari said.
