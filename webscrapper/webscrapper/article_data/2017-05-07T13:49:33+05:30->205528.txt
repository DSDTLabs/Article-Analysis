MAPUSA: The Mapusa Municipal Councilâ€™s (MMC) drive against shopkeepers for alleged encroachment on footpaths was kept on hold on Saturday, after it met with resistance from the shopkeepers under the banner of Mapusa Merchants Association. The association claimed that it is opposed to the fact that the drive is against them (shopkeepers) instead of the vendors.

 Sources said MMC began its drive against shopkeepers for alleged encroachment on the footpaths in front of their shops. Sources added that the drive was initiated by a team led by the municipal inspector on directives of the chief officer. 
 
 When the team began its drive, the shopkeepers arrived there and began questioning them. Sources said that the argument of the shopkeepers was that MMC should first clear the encroachments on roads. 
 
 MMC chairperson  , who was called in, inquired into the matter stopped the drive.
 
 President of the Mapusa Merchants Association, Ashish  , said that Kavlekar has invited the association to attend a joint meeting in his office with the chief officer and municipal engineer on Monday to discuss issues regarding footpath clearing, vendors problem and pre-monsoon drainage cleaning, in the Mapusa market.
