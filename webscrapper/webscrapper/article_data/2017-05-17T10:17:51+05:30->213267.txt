CHANDIGARH: With   (MCI) amending its clause, making it mandatory for doctors to prescribe generic medicines, the director   has issued a circular asking the in-charges of various departments to keep a vigil on their  , house surgeons and medical interns to ensure that they adhere to the norm.

 The notice mentions, “It is reiterated that all senior medical officers (SMOs), medical officers working in Government Multi Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, are directed to prescribe medicines with generic name or medicines available from the hospital pharmacy in GMSH; Civil Hospital Sector 22; Civil Hospital Sector 45; and Civil Hospital Manimajra. The same can be purchased from   store at GMSH-16.“
 
 The notice also revealed that all the SMOs working in the department of gynaecology would ensure that no patient is made to spend out of her pocket during delivery in any of above-mentioned health institutions.
 
 The list of the medicines available in the hospital pharmacy , Jan Aushadi stores will be circulated among all the medical institutions every month.
 
 The Indian Medical Association ( ), Chandigarh, had also opposed the idea of making such prescriptions mandatory and instead wanted a regulation on quality and pricing of medicines.
 
 Though the IMA has not condemned prescription of generic drugs, the doctors expressed concern regarding substandard and spurious drugs.
 
 “Generic medicines are manufactured following the same quality standards just like other medicines. A company can only develop a generic medicine for marketing once the period of exclusivity on the reference medicine has expired. This is usually 10 years from the date of first authorization,“ said a pharmacist at National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Mohali.
