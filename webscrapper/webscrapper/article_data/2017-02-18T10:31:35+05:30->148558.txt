CCP has asked for 100 workers during the monsoon who will be stationed at the flooding points. “As soon as it rains they will remove the plastic and paper cups which get stuck and clog the mouth of the drains during the first rains,” he added.
 
 The mayor urged citizens to cooperate by not dumping garbage and rubbish in the drains. The   has been asked for the contract workers till August and the wages are likely to be paid by the DMA. “We will send them the bill as they have prescribed the rate per day for a worker,” Furtado said.
