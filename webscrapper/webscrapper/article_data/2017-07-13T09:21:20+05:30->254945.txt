 “I am a man of my words. I am committed to develop Karimnagar on the lines of London. If London has Thames, Karimnagar has Manair,“ said KCR while launching the third  .
 
 “My appeal to the people here is to take up sapling plantation in such a big way that this place should give an impression of being dense forest from aerial view when I come in helicopter after two years,“ he said. The government planned a Rs 500-crore   near Lower Manair Dam, KCR said.
 
 In an obvious reference to Etela Rajender, who also took part in the programme, KCR said the district has a good minister who can take care of its development. He said the city has no good committee hall.Promising to fulfill it soon, he announced Rs 25 crore fund for the purpose.
 
 The CM called upon the women folk and the people to understand that their children cannot enjoy the wealth and property given by them unless they are provided a good environment.
 
 “You work hard to provide good future, wealth and property for your children. But to enjoy them your children need good environment and climate. The temperatures are already touching 46 degrees and this is not good for our future.It is the responsibility of every one of us to plant saplings, and not the government alone,“ KCR said.
 
 Stressing the importance of trees, KCR said right from the swing in which we play as children to the last bed on which our mortal remains are carried, are made of wood.“Telangana people are known for their `pourusham'. Lets take a vow to make a green Telangana,“ he said.
 
 “I bow before you (Paadabhivandanam chesi) and request you to plant saplings in the name of each family member and name each one after them and ensure its healthy growth,“ KCR said. Green brigades should be constituted from the village level itself.These brigades should take care of procurement of saplings to plantation, maintenance and growth of trees, he said.
