CHANDIGARH: The city is staring at a major water crisis and this issue is set to rock the   meeting, which will be held on April 29. The members of the various resident welfare associations (RWAs) are planning to raise this topic in the meeting so that the executive committee can take up the matter with the authorities and find a quick solution to it.

 The residents of Sectors 19, 22, 30, 34, 35 and Manimajra complained that for more than a year, they have been raising the issue to replace the old pipelines but till date, no solution has been found.
 
 The residents said at some places after the intervention of the area councilor, the pipelines were replaced. However, the pipelines need to be repaired for all residential areas too to get a proper flow of water. The representatives of the RWAs said they will take up the issue in the meeting as a large number of residents are affected due to this problem. The representatives of the association said the water pipes are old and rusty and have serious leakage problems but UT   is not acting upon it.
 
 On the basis of the complaints, the MC officials repaired the pipelines but on a temporary basis. The pipeline works fine only for a month and then, it gets back to the same old situation.
