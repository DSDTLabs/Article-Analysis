AJMER: Two years after being declared a smart city in 2016,   is facing acute shortage of drinking water supply.   in 100 zones of the city comes after intervals of 48 hours. This is the first time in four years that such a problem is being faced by the city.

Meanwhile Parihar said that he was out of Ajmer for some official work and will soon try to fix the problem.
 
  of Vaishali Nagar said that since the last two months, water supply has been hampered and they have to purchase drinking water from the market. Meena Dullani of Ajay Nagar said, “The supply comes without pressure and only for 10-15 minutes in two days.” People from different regions of the city have made complaints in the last fifteen days about the irregular supply of drinking water.
 
 “Water supply from Bisalpur dam is sufficient and we have stored it in a proper way but there is distribution problem,” said an official. He added that soon the distribution system will be made proper for summers.
 
 Congress party members gathered at Jal Bhavan and shouted slogans against state government and demanded proper drinking water supply in the city. “There are two state ministers from Ajmer and even then people are facing an acute water supply problem,” said Muffar Bharti, city spokesman of the party. State education minister Vasudev Devnani sanctioned seven crore rupees to provide Bisalpur water to Ajaysar and Kharkheri villages but the condition in these villages is such that they get water in six to seven days.
