NEW DELHI: The cash-strapped north coproration, which hasn’t been able to pay most of its staff for the past three months, is looking at mobile towers to boost its financial condition. 

 The standing committee of   on Thursday decided to allow installation of mobile towers on the roofs of over 800 municipal properties that will not only improve mobile connectivity in north and west Delhi but will also generate an annual revenue of at least Rs 43.5 crore.
 
 The approved sites are spread over six zones — Rohini, Civil Lines, City, Karol Bagh, Sadar Paharganj and Narela — and include gyms, community centres, sports complexes, senior citizen recreation centres, mahila haats, approved dhalaos and zonal offices. Private companies will install mobile towers by erecting necessary structural infrastructure after getting a technical clearance from the engineering department, said an official.
 
 The scheme seeks to make use of the corporation properties at prime locations in north and west Delhi, which remain underutilised. The corporation also plans to demolish the staff quarters on Minto Road, and in Azadpur and Model Town, and redevelop these prime plots into multistoreyed towers, where commercial space will be rented out while the staff quarters would be built on upper floors.
 
 Senior officials said they expected to get around Rs 60,000 per month as rent from each tower. “The mobile towers may also be constructed at the ground level if additional space is available and a monthly licence fee of Rs 292 per square feet will be levied by the civic body, as per the orders of the directorate of estates, urban development ministry,” said the official. 
 
 After inviting an ‘expression of interest’ from the companies with expertise in the field, the body has shortlisted four private tower installation firms —  ,  , Indus Tower and TAIPA.
