KOLKATA: Rachna, the   (TBM) that had entered the riverbed from the Howrah side on  , has reached the Kolkata bank much ahead of its schedule. It is now parked below the site earmarked for the ventilation shaft near   

 The TBM reached the Armenian Ghat jetty on Saturday when commuters went about usual everyday journey, unaware of the significant development 33m below. On Tuesday, it reached the ventilation shaft. Transtonnelstory Afcons, an Indo-Russian joint venture constructing the tunnel below the river bed, had set a deadline of 50 days for the construction of the tunnel. 
 
 “The dedication of workers engaged in tunnel boring and the right kind of soil we got below the river bed helped us to achieve this feat,” said an Afcons official. For the time being, Rachna will be rested for overhauling and maintenance.
 
 “In terms of our job, it is just another day for us. But this is momentous. We’ve been waiting for the under-river tunnel since 2010 when the TBMs first arrived. The boring began only in March 2016 from Howrah Maidan after a six-year delay,” said an officer of Transtonnelstory Afcons, which has been given the contract for the 2.9km twin tunnels between Howrah Maidan and Mahakaran, the first station on the eastern bank.
 
 “It is a collective feat of around 250 employees who have worked in shifts for boring the tunnel under the river. A host of engineers, including shifts in charge Jan Ellis and   from South Africa, were part of the historic moment,” said an Afcons engineer.
 
 While Rachna moved eastward, Prerna, the other TBM, is currently at a spot where Rachna was on April 14. It is ready to drill the Howrah-bound under-river tunnel. The TBM, as mandated by the high court will move slower — 5m per day instead of 14m, its natural momentum below the river bed – to reach the east bank in mid-June.
