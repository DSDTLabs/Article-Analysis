NEW DELHI: The   on Tuesday asked actor Rajinikanth's wife Latha   to pay Rs 6.2 crore to a marketing and media management company which had invested in the superstar's film 'Kochadaiiyaan' in 2014 but was not refunded the money. The court granted her three months to pay the sum back.

 
 A bench of Justices   and R Banumathi passed the order on a plea filed by   challenging a Madras HC verdict quashing criminal proceedings against Latha which was initiated on its complaint.
 
 Advocate Alphi Chugh, appearing for the company, said Latha had sold the distribution rights of the movie in   to Ad-Bureau Advertising through a memorandum of understanding after which the company had invested Rs 10 crore.
 
 He alleged that Latha resold the distribution rights to some other party and also refused to refund the money. He said total amount due along with interest was Rs 14.9 crore out of which Rs 8.7 crore had been paid and Rs 6.2 crore remained outstanding.
 
 Senior advocate Nalini Chidambaram, appearing for Latha, said the amount was taken by her and was paid to Mediaone Global Entertainment Limited. She argued that Latha was not liable to refund the money and the order should be passed against the company.
 
 The bench, however, was not convinced and pointed out that Latha was one of the directors of Mediaone Global Entertainment and her daughter was its chairman.
