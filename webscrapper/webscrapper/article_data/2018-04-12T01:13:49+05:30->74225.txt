Subsequently, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) too registered a money-laundering case against the duo under the PMLA.

 PMLA has a set of procedures, where proceeds of crime or ill-gotten wealth is added to the government’s kitty. After registering a case, the ED provisionally attaches properties that fall within the ambit of proceeds of crime. The adjudication authority then hears the ED and the affected parties and passes an order. If the authority confirms the attachment, ED after a probe files a prosecution complaint in the special court. The court conducts the trial and passes an order on the property as well as the accused. 
 
 The Union government is working on an amendment in the Act so that the properties are auctioned and the proceeds distributed among investors. In   cases registered under Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (Financial Establishments) Act, a competent authority decides on the disposal of assets and the proceeds are then distributed among investors.
