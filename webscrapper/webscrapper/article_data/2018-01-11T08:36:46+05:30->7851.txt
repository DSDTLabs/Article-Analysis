HYDERABAD:  , the co-owner of Mojo’s in Kamala Mills, Mumbai, where a blaze claimed the lives of 14 people a few days ago, is suspected to have fled to Amritsar from Hyderabad. After knowing that the accused had escaped, a Mumbai police team that was in Hyderabad left the city.

  police sources said that on Monday, a Mumbai police team arrived in Hyderabad after getting a lead that Tuli and his wife were here. Initially, cops from two police stations —   and Raiduram — were involved in the search. They traced the residence of Tuli’s relative,  , near KBR Park, in Jubilee Hills.
 
 “During the investigation, it emerged that Yug Tuli had taken shelter at Surjith Singh’s residence for a few days. Later, from Hyderabad, we believe, had went to Amritsar,” credible sources told TOI. It is learnt that the police arrived at the information of Tuli’s suspected escape to Amritsar based on his travel information.
 
 On learning about this development, the Mumbai police team, aided by the RGI Airport police, verified the CCTV footage at the airport. The footage revealed that Tuli was present at the airport.
 
 The police, then, verified his travel information and subsequently, returned to Mumbai. Subsequently, the Mumbai team returned to their city.
 
 At Singh’s residence, police found a car belonging to Yug Tuli, which was perhaps used by him to reach Hyderabad from Mumbai after knowing that he was made an accused in the fire mishap case.
