NEW DELHI: A day after initiating a probe against Delhi’s deputy chief minister   for alleged irregularities in a social media campaign run for an interactive session between chief minister   and the public, the   on Thursday visited the state government’s directorate of information and publicity (DIP) and collected documents pertaining to the “Talk to AK” campaign.

  officials said there were no ‘raids’ or ‘searches’ and only documents were sought from DIP department, which is the usual process under a preliminary enquiry.
 
 Official sources said since Sisodia is incharge of the ministry heading the publicity department in AAP- led Delhi government; hence documents were sought from there. “The approval for such a campaign and payments would not have been made without his approval,” said a CBI officer.
 
 Meanwhile, the anti-corruption agency has also approached Google, Facebook and YouTube seeking details of payments made to it by private PR agency Perfect Relations to run the campaign on their social network. It has been alleged that the PR firm paid Rs 1.5 crore in advance to the three on behalf of Delhi government flouting official procedures. 
 
 CBI sources reiterated that Manish Sisodia will be soon questioned after examining all the documents.
 
 The ‘TalktoAK’ campaign was started by AAP government in July 2016. As part of the campaign, people from across the country could ask Kejriwal questions over the phone, through text messages and social media. 
 
 During the first and only session of “TalktoAK”, Kejriwal had interacted with people at Delhi secretariat.
 
 AAP had even launched a dedicated website – ‘talktoak.com’ – through which people were supposed to ask questions. They could also ask questions by dialing 011-23392999.
