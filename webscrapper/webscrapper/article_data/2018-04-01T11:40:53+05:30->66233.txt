AHMEDABAD: Can a person be sent behind the bars under Prevention of Anti Social Activities Act ( ) for cheating and criminal breach of trust just by terming him a ‘dangerous person’?   disagreed and quashed one such detention order and directed the government to release the accused immediately from jail.

 The case involves Jodhpur area resident, Sanjay Agarwal, against whom Ramol police had registered an FIR last year. 
 
 He was booked under sections 406 and 420 of the IPC. Another FIR cited by city police to invoke PASA against Agarwal was registered in 2016 on charges of assault and criminal intimidation with Danilimda police station.
 
 The city police commissioner ordered Agarwal’s detention on February 15 and he was sent to Palara jail near   on March 7. 
 
 Agarwal moved the   against the detention order through advocate H B Champavat, who submitted that a local court had granted bail in the earlier FIR, whereas the second FIR was the result of a business transaction, and there is nothing to show Agarwal could disrupt public order.
 
 After hearing the case, Justice S G Shah said , “It appears that the subjective satisfaction arrived at by the detaining authority cannot be said to be legal, valid and in accordance with law inasmuch as the offences alleged in the FIRs cannot have any bearing on the public order since the law of the land.”
 
 The HC said that detaining a person for an FIR under sections 324, 323, 294B, 406, 420 etc. of IPC is not proper.
 
 Moreover, the court pulled up police authorities for not invoking powers of the CrPC under sections 107 and 110 to ask for security, so that a person does not indulge in offences again. 
 
 “Unfortunately and surprisingly, the authority has disclosed in the impugned order that they do not believe in taking action under sections 107 and 110 of the CrPC and instead of following such rule of law, they selected to pass an order of detention,” the court observed.
