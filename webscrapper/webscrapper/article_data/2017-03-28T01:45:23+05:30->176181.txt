GREEATER NOIDA: Integrated Industrial Township (IIT) in   under the   (DMIC) project has on Monday revised its land allotment rates under its land disposal policy. The decision was taken during a board meeting held in Greater Noida. The meeting was attended by Alkesh Kumar Sharma, chief executive officer and managing director,  , and Deepak Agarwal, CEO,   (GNIDA). The board also approved an incentive plan for the first investor, besides reviewing the physical and financial progress of the township.

 According to GNIDA officials, the lowest slab for plot size greater than 40,000 square metres has been reduced by almost 27% for the industrial allotment of land in the under-construction 335-hectare township, which will boost the walk-to-work concept. “The new rates will be Rs 5,100 instead of Rs 7,000 per square metre in this slab. This has been done to attract investment and promote industry,” Agarwal told TOI. “We have made sure that the land rates are attractive to the investor as well as competitive to woo industrialists,” he said.
 
 The earlier land rates had been finalised in December last year. “As an incentive, the board has also approved an early investor rebate of 20% in the land allotment rate for industrial plots. The first investor will be able to avail himself of this discount provided he starts construction immediately,” he said. We are expecting anchor units, which are electronics manufacturing units, IT-based, hi-tech, bio-tech and research and development units to set up base here,” Agarwal said.
 
 Mumbai-based developer Shapoorji Pallonji, which was awarded the project on January 9, 2016, has been directed to complete the project within two years. Located in the Dadri-Noida-Ghaziabad investment region of the corridor, the township is expected to provide employment to thousands of workers.
