NOIDA: Nearly 200   protested against the three-fold fee hike in the four government inter colleges of   outside the   on Tuesday. They demanded that the schools be taken over by the state government under the Deen Dayal Upadhyay model school scheme under which 166 new schools have been started by the UP government.

 Built in 2010, schools were free for first two years and fees started being charged in 2012. However, in 2018 the schools revealed the new structure to new and old students.
 
 While two-month fee for a class VI child in SC/ST category till 2017 was Rs 5,775 including three fee sections — pupil fee, tution fee and transport charges, the fee has been increased to Rs 16,950 in 2018- — almost three times the previous year. The new sections include admission fee, caution money (refundable), maintenance charge, co-curricular activity, examination and e-learning and lab fee.
 
 They alleged a minor percentage was reduced from the fees after a meeting with   mandal commissioner Prabhat Kumar, who is also the chairman of   education society, which manages four schools funded by authorities.
 
 “We met the commissioner 10 days ago and he promised some respite but to our shock, fee was reduced by between Rs 500-1,000,” a parent said.
 
 Prabhat Kumarsaid they will look into the demands. “The fee has not been hiked for a long time. We’re running a deficit and a hike is essential to make schools self-dependent,” he said.
