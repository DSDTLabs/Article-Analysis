 Bittu added: “The sports department has also received equipment for other parks, where they are now being installed. Civic bodies maintaining parks as per jurisdiction will also look after gym equipment in the park. The open-air gyms are bringing residents — especially youth and children — to the parks, and also making them healthy with regular exercise.”
 
 Bittu also said at a time most youngsters are busy with their mobiles or social media, and don’t go for morning walks or exercise, open air gyms are making them more conscious about their health.
