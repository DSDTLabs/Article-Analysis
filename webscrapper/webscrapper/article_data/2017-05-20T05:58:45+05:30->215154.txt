LUCKNOW: There were some embarrassing moments for the   when its own MLA   Srivastava — from Lucknow West — raised the issue of blatant sale of   in the market and excess use of Oxytocin to extract maximum yield from cattle.

 Srivastava said that it was a matter of great concern that the dairy owners were applying Oxytocin injections to raise the cattle’s yield unnaturally and such poisonous milks was available in the market, putting people in grave heath risk.
 
 The BJP MLA did not stop here, but also asked his own government how many laboratories were functioning in the state to test milk. This led to an eerie silence in the treasury bench and the Opposition tried to corner the government, when Speaker Hriday Narain Dixit intervened to save the government by saying that Srivastava had not raised any objection or asked a question, but simply informed the   about the state of affairs in the state, so the government would take note of it.
 
 Earlier, the state government had itself admitted that nearly 50% samples of milk had failed the quality test and efforts were being made to improve the situation. Two SP members — Sanjay Garg and Nitin Agarwal — had asked about failure of milk samples and government’s steps to check sale of spurious milk
