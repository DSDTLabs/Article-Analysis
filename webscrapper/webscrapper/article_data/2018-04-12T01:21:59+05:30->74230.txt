MUMBAI: There is more trouble for the Bhagtani family. The chief metropolitan magistrate has sealed their project at Powai in connection with a loan default of over Rs 14 crore.

 The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the city   is probing several complaints of investors being cheated to the tune of Rs600 crore in various projects in Mumbai and Thane.
 
 
  
 Chief metropolitan magistrate   of Esplanade court was hearing a petition filed by   alleging the Bhagtanis’ real estate firm Jaycee Homes and JVPD Properties had defaulted on a loan of Rs 14.61 crore.
 
 The CMM court on Monday appointed three lawyers as court commissioners to seal the two-acre plot at Chandivli in Powai where a residential project- Bhagtani Krishaang—is slated to come up. Krishaang, comprising Serenity and Shalom buildings, were part of JVPD Properties mortgaged by the Bhagtanis while seeking a loan.
 
 Xander Finance had filed an application before the court seeking sealing of the properties. Advocate Sunil Pandey, who led the sealing process, said the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT), where Xander Finance had lodged its complaint, had ruled in its favour. “But, as the DRT does not have the authority to seal any property, the complainant finance company had appealed before the CMM court. The CMM on Monday ordered sealing of the property,” said Pandey. Pandey was assisted by two lawyers—Abhishek More and Manoj Bachate— who took the help of Powai police to seal the plot. Advocate Bachate said an order like this will send out a strong message to other defaulters. According to police, the Bhagtanis had taken a loan of Rs 11.25 crore for this project from Xander Finance in 2015.
