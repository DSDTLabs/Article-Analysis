PUNE: The continuous   by the   on   about its services in general, and the alleged lackadaisical attitude of airlines in particular, has become a matter of concern for  . 

 "We have noticed that a majority of complaints on social media - mainly on Twitter - are related to flight operations. While some comments don't make sense, some are serious in nature. With the Pune airport under expansion mode now and new services having been added, the services offered by the airlines need improvement," an airport official told TOI. 
 
 If one scrolls through the social media platforms, there are many complaints. For example, a passenger on Friday posted on Twitter that there was no one at an airlines' counter outside the terminal building to inform the passengers that the flight was delayed.
 
 On Thursday, a flier, Ankit Agarwal, tweeted "@digilocker_in Pune airport authority doesn't accept aadhar shown from digilocker app, have to show other ID proof." Similarly, on March 1, one   aired his frustration, "Total confusion at Pune airport. None of them know which gate is for which flight. Ten minutes before departure they have opened the gate."
 
 Sources told TOI that on February 12 there was a delay of an airline for around three hours and a passenger vented his anger about not being informed. 
 
 Sources pointed out that senior airport officials had called a meeting of officials of some selected airlines which face a lot of criticisms on social media for their alleged non-cooperation with passengers. The officials had directed the representatives of these airlines to pull up their socks and ensure that passengers were not troubled.
