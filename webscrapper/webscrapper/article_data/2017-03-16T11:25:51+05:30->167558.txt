VISAKHAPATNAM: The state government is facing severe criticism from all sections of the society for not allotting any funds for the   project even though it was mooted before the Vijayawada Metro Railway project. However, the concerned authorities claim that the project is in the pipeline and a detailed project report (DPR) has been submitted to the central government for in-principle approval. 

 The metro rail project was planned in 2014 and the DPR prepared in 2015 was approved by the state cabinet following which it was sent to the central government in January last year. The central government proposed the project under the PPP mode against the conventional method of construction and the revised DPR was submitted in December. 
 
 “We are waiting for the in-principle nod from the central government following which allocation of funds will be done,”   ( ) managing director N Ramakrishna Reddy told TOI. 
 
 The state government had mooted the   project even before that in Vijayawada but the latter gained momentum as it comes under the new capital region. 
 
 The Vizag metro rail will cover 42.04 km stretch in three corridors -- Kommadi to Gajuwaka, Gurudwara Junction to Old Post office via Dwarakanagar and Dabagardens, and Thatichetlapalem to Park Hotel on Beach Road via the station complex. The cost of the project was estimated to be Rs 12,000 crore as per the 2015-16 report, sources said.
 
 Reddy said once they get permission from the central government, they will invite expressions of interest (EOI). “We need to send the project for approval in each stage from the central government as it will provide viability gap funding. Any metro rail project will take years together for completion. The project is under consideration by the central government,” he added.
