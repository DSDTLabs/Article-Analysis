CHANDIGARH: Chief minister   on Wednesday met All India   Committee (AICC) president   and discussed the re-organization of the Punjab party unit ahead of the 2019   elections.

 He was accompanied by Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president   and AICC in-charge of Punjab affairs Asha Kumari. A party spokesperson said the discussion centred around revamping the PPCC organizational structure in order to strengthen the Punjab unit and prepare it better for the next year’s parliamentary elections.
 
 The possibility of holding the AICC plenary session, likely to be held in March-April, in Punjab was also discussed during the Wednesday meeting. Though any final decision of holding the plenary session was not taken, but Punjab is being considered as a possible venue for the session because of the Congress rule in the state.
 
 A delegation of five ex-servicemen from various parts of country, led by Subedar Bir Singh Chauhan (retired), also accompanied Amarinder to meet the AICC president. These ex-servicemen had quit the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ahead of the Punjab elections and had campaigned for Amarinder in Patiala along with the suspended Delhi’s AAP MLA Major Devinder Shekhawat (retired). They expressed the desire to join the Congress.
