AHMEDABAD : Irked with the   with two orders on reinstating an employee, a division bench of the   on Monday pulled up the   (GNLU) and issued a contempt notice to the institute. A bench of Justice A S Dave and Justice Biren Vaishnav made an oral comment that it was unfortunate that the university did not follow court directions in their true spirit, though they were issued twice. The university can start a new subject on how to undermine a court order, sources said. The case involves Manoj Patel, who was appointed as the head of the accounts section at GNLU and his contract was to end in 2019. But he was orally told that his contract ended in December 2016. When Patel moved the HC, GNLU was directed to reinstate him. The university filed an appeal, but it was asked by the court to go ahead with the reinstatement of the employee.

 After the second such order, Patel appeared before the authority on February 5 and he was taken back into the job on February 6. However, the next day, he was sent on paid leave.
 
 Meanwhile, Patel got a job with another establishment, but since he did not get a clean relieving letter, he proposed to withdraw all litigation. However, the university allegedly did not heed his demands resulting in Patel losing the opportunity in another establishment. The HC has given two days to the university to implement its order and in case of default, the GNLU director has been asked to remain present in the court on Wednesday.
