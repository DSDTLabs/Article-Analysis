With dreamy, muse-worthy music, this three-piece band from Delhi is an experimental bunch. With genres ranging from rock and roll to shoe gaze, folk, post punk and flesh antenna, 11th century seduction music is what they ace at. Formed through a series of “unconceivable events” in 2013, it comprises   (vocalist /guitarist /melodica/synthesisers),   (drummer/keyboardist/backing vocals), while their third member keeps interchanging between  ,   and Anand Viankara (bassist/samples/backing vocals).

 Talking about their brand of music, Kartik says, “Ours is honest and uninhibited music, which channels the ether and becomes an efficient funnel to embrace our desires, feel the movement of the universe through us, witness the beauty, delve and dissolve into all experiences that makes us what we are.” In keeping with the mood of the band’s name, they disclose that qawwali wins, hands down, when it comes to their favourite form of music. Elaborating on the same, Kartik says, “Its use of a question-answer format, harmonies and spontaneity is an amazing thing to witness. While this and other forms of music are being fostered, I can’t vouch for their authenticity, given that I am in no way an expert of them.”
 
 Gearing up for a few music videos, their third album and more concept-based shows, they believe that the Indian music scene could do with a better royalties’ system. “We need a functioning and kind music society on par with the European and American industries, like ASCAP,” signs off Kartik.
