KOLKATA: At 83, Soumitra Chatterjee no longer works for awards. They don't even inspire him creatively. Yet, the legend admitted that receiving the Legion d'honneur has been a "overwhelming" experience.

 On Tuesday, when he received the award from the ambassador of France in India Alexandre Ziegler at a city hotel, Chatterjee became the first Bengali actor to be conferred with this honour. Chatterjee now joins an august list of Indian Legion d'honneur recipients, including  , JRD Tata,  , Pt Ravi Shankar, Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan.
 
 Chatterjee began his career as an LIC agent before taking up a job as a radio announcer. Subsequently, he went on to act in over 300 feature films, among which 14 were with Ray and six with Tapan Sinha. It was indeed thoughtful to have two posters from Ray and Sinha film on display at the ceremony. The icing on the cake was the display of the vintage Ash Carbon projector that screened Chatterjee's debut film 'Apur Sansar' at Basusree. 
 
  
  
 
 An overwhelmed Chatterjee spoke about his strong French connection - how he, a student of literature, was first introduced to France through literature. Cinema strengthened the ties as much as his love for French impressionist painting. "I am honoured and privileged and I will remember this evening as long as I live," he said. 
 
 His wife Deepa Chatterjee, who watched the proceedings, said, "Usually, he is indifferent to awards. But this event is special for the whole family."  , who was happy for Chatterjee, added that this award was "long overdue".
 
 Describing Chatterjee as the "emblematic actor of Ray's cinema" and a "prototype of the Bengali gentleman", Ziegler recollected how former French President   had presented the award to Ray when he visited Kolkata in 1988. "You've just turned 83 but look 50. You are a true friend of France. France loves you as much as you love France," he said.
