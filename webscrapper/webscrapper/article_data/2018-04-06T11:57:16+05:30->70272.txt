 on the transition from small screen to big screen and how he's juggling both.

 I give my nod to a project if I like the content and my character. The medium — be it stage, television or films — doesn’t really bother me. I enjoy acting and the medium doesn’t make a difference. At present,I’m doing   for the small screen. But that hasn’t stopped the audience from watching my films or directors from casting me in their projects. Today’s audience is intelligent and educated, so they will watch me in films,   or   if the content is good and relatable. Of course, my acting has to be decent enough to make them watch me. As a performing artiste, my aim is to deliver my best so that my audience is satisfied when they watch me in films or on the small screen. The division between the big and small screens is slowly fading away.
