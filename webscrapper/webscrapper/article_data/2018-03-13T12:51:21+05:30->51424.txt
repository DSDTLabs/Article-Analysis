Actor  , who shot to fame with serials like   and  , was recently in the city for a promotional event. "I am so happy to come back to Lucknow. I was last here some three years back. Lucknowites are so loving. Lucknow airport par bhi I was stopped by people who were telling me that I was their favourite contestant in   and that I deserved to win. You hardly get to experience such pyaar bhare encounters in other cities,” shared Hiten, adding, “Apart from the love that I get from people here, another thing that I love about the city is yahan ka khana, especially the kebabs. Since I didn’t have much time during this visit, I got them packed. But fresh Tundey ke kebabs khane ka maza alag hi hota hai!"
Talking about Bigg Boss Hiten feels that the reality show experience has taught him a lot – professionally and personally. "Doing a reality show like Bigg Boss has created a fan base of youngsters for me. Bahut saare youngsters, who did not know me, are now my fans. Even my wife ( ) felt that I was the winner since I played the game without creating any unwanted controversies. Also, I have now become more patient. You need a lot of patience to survive inside the house,” said he, adding, “Apart from TV shows, because of Bigg Boss, I am now getting a lot of offers to be a celebrity guest at event, which wasn’t the case earlier."
 However, Hiten, who is known for his reserved and calm nature, feels that the reality show is not for people like him. "You have to be little extrovert and blunt in order to survive for long inside the Bigg Boss house. People actually want inmates in the house to fight. They want to see that the housemates are playing mind games. I am not a violent person and I hate fighting and I don’t like to shout," said the actor who was last seen in the TV serial Gangaa.
