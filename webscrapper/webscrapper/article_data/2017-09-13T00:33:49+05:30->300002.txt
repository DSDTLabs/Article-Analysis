The All India   Federation (AIFF) is set to cancel a scheduled international friendly against Palestine to protect its players from injuries and a potential drop in rankings.
 
  India were scheduled to play Palestine in a friendly in Mumbai on October 2 as preparation for the crucial Asian Cup qualifier against   at home.
  
  India need just a win from their remaining three matches to confirm their place at the Asian Cup 2019 and the AIFF believes it’s pointless to take any risk at this stage.
  
  “We had a meeting with coach   today and the general feeling was that we should not risk anything against Palestine. The friendly (against Palestine) was finalised a long time ago, but now things have changed. We have to look at the bigger picture,” said a senior AIFF official.
  
  The ‘bigger picture’ involves draw for the Asian Cup 2019. Should India qualify as expected, a good ranking will give India a favourable draw at the Asian Cup 2019. India are ranked 12th in Asia at the moment which the AIFF is keen to hold on to so that it ends up with just one strong side – from the top six – in its group.
  
  There are fears that a negative result against Palestine — ranked three spots higher than India and unbeaten in their last five matches — would hamper India’s ranking which needs to be protected till April next year when the draw is conducted. Palestine are firm favourites to qualify for the Asian Cup as well, having defeated opponents like Maldives and Oman.
  
  “Friendlies don’t give you too many points. We won the Tri-Nation Cup in Mumbai and beat teams like Mauritius and Macau last month but our ranking will still drop. We are expected to be around 106-107 when rankings are next announced,” said the official.
