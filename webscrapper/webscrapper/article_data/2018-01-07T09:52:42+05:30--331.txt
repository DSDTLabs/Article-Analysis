PATNA: The Bihar police has placed an order for 20 sniffer dogs that will be deployed in the task of detecting hidden liquor stocks. Security forces generally use sniffer dogs to detect explosives and narcotics besides locating people. However, large scale smuggling of liquor in dry Bihar has forced police to deploy pups.

 “The sniffer dogs of Labrador breed will assist the state police and excise officials in examination of vehicles and travellers’ luggage at check-posts in border districts, bus stands and railway stations in the state,” said a senior police officer. These canines are trained at selected places in the country, including   at   in  .
 
 Sources said senior police officers are in touch with BSF to purchase the dogs. The dog squad of Bihar police functions under   (CID). Earlier, 45 trained dogs were purchased by the Bihar police in 2016 from Remount and Veterinary Corps Centre and College of Indian Army in Meerut for Rs 63.53 lakh. The present strength of CID’s dog squad is 51, including 27 sniffers and 23 trackers. However, these canines cannot sniff out liquor.
 
 Complete prohibition was enforced in the state on April 5, 2016 and it gave birth to rampant liquor smuggling. The government had earlier planned to install full-body truck scanners at five check points in the state to check liquor smuggling. The plan, however, has not materialised yet. Officials said buying five full-body truck scanners was an expensive idea as it would cost the government over Rs 600 crore. “Such scanners will lead to traffic jams on national highways,” they added.
 
 Sources said after their purchase, the sniffer dogs would be handed over to the office of IG (prohibition). The government had created the post of IG (prohibition) in December last year to ensure strict implementation of total prohibition in the state.
