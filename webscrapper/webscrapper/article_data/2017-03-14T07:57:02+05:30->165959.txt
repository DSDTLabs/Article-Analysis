PUNE: The bright red, brick building in   will look more resplendent in a few months. 

 Renovation and repairs at the historic   in the heart of the city will be taken up to draw more tourists. 
 
 An exhibition centre, a performing arts platform and other facilities will be added and efforts will be taken to give it a special look.   (PMC) will spend Rs 2 crore to give the structure a facelift.
 
 Lal Mahal has immense historical relevance as it was here that Chhatrapati   Maharaj spent his childhood with his mother  . The structure, originally built in the 1640s, was captured by Mughal leader Mirza Abu Talib (Shaista Khan) in 1663 CE. 
 
 The structure has a prominent place in history due to the valour shown by the Marathas in a fight here. Led by Shivaji, they fought against Shaista Khan and recaptured the palace. During this attack, Shivaji sliced off Khan's fingers when he jumped through a window to escape.
 
 Originally a wooden structure, the palace was revamped in the 1980s. The four umbrella-shaped structures on the roof are prime attractions. It has a garden named after Jijabai and a sculpture depicting Shivaji ploughing land in Pune with a golden hoe is inspiring. The civic body had updated its list of heritage structures to add 17 more to the new one.
 
 "Currently, only one section of the building is in use. After renovation, three floors of the building will be utilized. The works will be completed by the end of the year," Shyam Dhavale, head of PMC's heritage department, said.
 
 Other works include installations of rare oil paintings and photographs. Replicas of important forts will be placed on the terrace. The interiors will be improved. An exhibition displaying events from Shivaji's era will be curated. A brick wall around the structure will also be built. 
 
 The palace had a special place for the Peshwas too. When   was being built, soil and stones from Lal Mahal were added to the foundation of the new palace.
