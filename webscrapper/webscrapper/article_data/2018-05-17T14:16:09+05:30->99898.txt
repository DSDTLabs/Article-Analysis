PATNA: Bihar   ( ) has been allotted work by the central government agencies and other state governments also, state road construction department (RCD) minister Nand Kishore   said on Wednesday.

 He said after successful bidding, National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) has allotted work order to BRPNNL to construct 3km-long flyover at a cost of Rs129.30 crore in Kishanganj district.
 
 Besides, BRPNNL has also been allotted work regarding the construction of hospitals of employeesâ€™ state insurance corporation (ESIC) at   and Bhagalpur, which would entail an expenditure of Rs300 crore, Yadav said. The minster said the corporation has also been preparing tender to bid for the construction of four major projects worth Rs1,386.43 crore in Bihar, Jharkhand and Maharashtra.
 
 Yadav said under the RJD rule before 2005, BRPNNL was a loss-making body and the then government had decided to close it down. However, under the NDA rule, it turned into a profit-making organization, he added. 
 
 Till now, the state undertaking has completed 2,000 major projects of which 1,700 pertained to the last ten years only, the minister said. He also said in the backdrop of the sustained success of the corporation and profits made by it, CM   felt it should also take up works in other states. 
 
 Accordingly, BRPNNL started bidding for work in other states. A separate business development cell headed by a retired chief engineer was set up for that, Yadav said, adding that this body would monitor the work undertaken from NHAI at Kishanganj or with regard to the construction of the two ESIC hospitals.
