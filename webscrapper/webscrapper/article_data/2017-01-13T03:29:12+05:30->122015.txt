MUMBAI: On Sunday, when 42,000 enthusiasts from various parts of the world will put on their running shoes for the  , it isn’t the cold weather or the lengthy routes they will brave. Many of the   will be putting behind their  , physical troubles and hardships too.

 Sixty-year-old Amarjeet Singh Chawla is visually impaired, but has run the same number of half marathons as his age. Chawla, who lost his eyesight at 40 years of age, will participate in the half marathon this Sunday along with Rahul Brahme, a BEST conductor with BEST, as his escort. “Sometimes, I stumble on potholes and speedbreakers and even I run into the other contestants. So, having a good escort is very important, but also very difficult. I run to complete the race because the chants and cheers of onlookers inspire you to do so,” he says. 
 
 Chawla had started running marathons in 2004, and is the only visually impaired mountaineer to scale the Dolma Pass in Tibet.
 
 For Bandra resident Shibani Gulati, who underwent a kidney transplant in 2010, the marathon is her way to challenge herself. “Just after my surgery, I grappled with fear and depression that I could not lead a normal life again. But then I learnt about running and decided to give it a try. Initially, 3km felt like 30km, but now I feel so much better and I want to continue doing so,” adds Gulati. 
 
 She is running the half marathon for the fourth consecutive year, but this year is special as her husband Gautam is running with her too.
 
 Sandeep Yadav (22), who was detected with Ewing’s Sarcoma—a type of bone cancer—at 13 years of age, is a first timer at the marathon. He now interns with Cankids, an NGO working to bring a change in childhood cancer in the country. 
 
 “There is still lack of awareness on the causes and effects of cancer. I wanted to change this and so decided to participate in the marathon. I have been practising by walking 3km every morning and evening,” said the boy who hails from Uttar Pradesh.
