TRICHY: The forest department’s office has been given a fresh look as tourists locations in the district have been painted on its compound walls, in an attempt to promote tourism in   under the forest department. 

 The walls have paintings of   hills,   and butterfly park at  .
 
 Puliyancholai, a natural bathing area, is fed by a water stream from the   hills. The butterfly park at Srirangam is turning out to be an ideal picnic spot similar to   in Trichy. 
 
 The facility raised at a cost of Rs 8.67 crore on 25 hectares was thrown open to public during the end of 2015. 
 
 “It didn’t cost much the forest department except for the artist’s labour, which is worth appreciation,” said DFO Naga Sathish Gidijala who initiated the process, which will be replicated in other forest department offices in Trichy. 
 
 Apart from giving a facelift to an otherwise dull looking office, it also comes with a message of protecting the green cover. Work is on to provide lighting so that the paintings are visible even during night, he said. 
 
 The forest department is in talks with the railway and the airport authorities to raise advertisement banners to promote tourist destination in Trichy. 
 
 While speaking in the enormous tourism potential at the butterfly park and Patchamalai hills, the DFO said that the forest department is in talks with the airport authorities and the railways department to promote them. 
 
 “We are planning to promote such tourism spots at railway stations and airports that receive much of the floating population. This would help promote these places which are unique in their own sense,” Gidijala said.
 
 A proposal has been sent to the state government in this regard and a decision would soon be taken on this, he added.
