NEW DELHI:   comprise 78% of the beneficiaries of   and are recipients of 50% of the Rs 3,55,590 crore sanctioned under the scheme to help micro businesses which often struggle to get bank loans and official assistance.

 Around Rs 1,78,313 crore of loans sanctioned were to women who were self-employed and running businesses such as bakeries, paper products,food parlours, hair dressing and personal care. Other micro businesses, run by men and women, could include computer assemblers and roadside vendors.
 
 In response to a question raised by   MP Vinay JSahasrabuddhe, the finance ministry supplied statistics which showed that 23% of the loan amounts sanctioned went to OBC beneficiaries, 10.5% to scheduled castes and 3% to scheduled tribes.
 
 The distribution of loan amounts among these categories reflect the disadvantages tribal communities continue to face in terms of skills and education, and subsequent access to financial services. Remote areas where many tribals reside add to the hurdles in the way to their development.
 
 The loan disbursal among OBCs is the highest as compared to SCs and STs, indicating the rising social and economic profiles of these communities and their ability to migrate to urban areas and become a part of the semi-skilled and skilled market. Going by the 15% quotas for SCs in central educational institutions and Dalits accounting for a little over 16% of Indiaâ€™s population, the 10.5% share of Mudra loans can clearly be improved but is nonetheless a reasonable share. The STs add up to 8.2% of the population and have a 7.5% quota in central institutions and the 3% share is rather low.
 
 The good news, however, is that women comprise 6.2 crore of the 8.19 crore Mudra beneficiaries. They have done well in claiming loans offered through the Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency (Mudra) launched by PM   to address problems of credit faced by persons with small incomes who are often daunted by paper work and requirements for collateral.
 
 In disbursing loans under the scheme, states like Bihar (Rs 21,651cr), Andhra Pradesh (Rs 13,781cr), Delhi (Rs 7,518cr), Gujarat (Rs 15,385cr), Karnataka (Rs 39,107cr), Maharashtra (Rs 34,168cr), Odisha (Rs 15,589cr), Tamil Nadu (Rs 38,297cr), Uttar Pradesh (Rs 30,783cr), MP (Rs 20,634cr) and West Bengal (Rs 25,928cr) have all done well.
 
 Even smaller states like Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Sikkim have loan disbursals of around Rs 200 crore and above.
