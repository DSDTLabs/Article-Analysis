NEW DELHI: The Crime Branch arrested two men along with   worth Rs 1.5 crore at   on Monday and also nabbed a third man who bought the narcotic from them and sold them to truckers at his roadside. Bhisham Singh, DCP (Crime), disclosed that Alam Sheikh (26) and Shakeel (45) and eatery owner Jasvinder (32) were caught at Majnu ka Tila in north Delhi.

 Police also impounded the Eicher truck in which the 15kg of opium was being ferried. The drug had been sourced from Bangladesh and was being driven from Malda in West Bengal to Punjab. Jasvinder sold opium to truck drivers who stopped at his dhaba, called  , on Karnal-Shamli Road. Truckers often consume the deadening substance to overcome fatigue from driving for long hours. Between January and May this year, 157 people were killed by speeding trucks at night and 61,000 drivers hauled up for illegal consumption of opium. Industry sources disclosed that truck drivers high on “afeem” sometimes place bricks on the accelerator and drive using just the steering wheel, their eyes barely open.
 
 A team has gone to Malda to arrest Ibrahim, considered the mastermind of the operations.   hired Alam Sheikh as a carrier five months ago at a salary of Rs 10,000 a month. Shakeel, with two decades of experience driving trucks on long routes, was paid Rs 20,000 for each trip he made to ferry the drug. In 2008, he had gone to Saudi Arabia, worked as a truck driver for about six years and returned to India in 2014. He had brought his own truck and joined Ibrahim’s set-up.
 
 Jasvinder told the cops that he met Shakil at his dhaba two years ago and learnt about the drug business and about the potential for rich takings. He agreed to a deal and regularly sourced his supplies from them. Aside from the truckers, he also sold the opium to his contacts in Punjab.
