AHMEDABAD: Enforcement directorate (ED) officials on Tuesday registered a case against former IAS officer Sanjay Gupta under the Prevention of   Act (PMLA) in connection with the alleged Rs 211 crore scam in the   for Gandhinagar and Ahmedabad Company Ltd (MEGA).

 Senior ED officials said that cases against Gupta have been registered for floating some 50 bogus companies through which monetary benefits were gained and these firms facilitated the scam. Initially the case was registered by CID (crime) but as the aspect of money laundering came in, ED began its probe.
 
 Gupta and his associates were arrested by CID (crime) in May 2015 and charged with cheating, forgery, criminal conspiracy and siphoning off public money. The first charge sheet filed by CID described how false invoices were generated without getting supplies to fill the land at Motera, for a casting yard and depot. The value of these materials at the prescribed rates came was Rs113.22 crore. This amount increased in the supplementary charge sheet. 
 
 The probe further revealed that Rs 211 crore was routed through 36 different companies by raising false invoices to Guptaâ€™s Neesa Group of Companies. The money for the MEGA project was given to these bogus companies through cheques and crores were paid to such companies. The probe will make it clear how much money was gained through the bogus companies, said sources in ED. 
 
 Gupta had allegedly channelled the money to several accounts, making it difficult to trace the account where the money ended up, added a source. Gupta is behind bars at present.
