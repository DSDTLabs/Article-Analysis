HOWRAH: Union Bank’s Uluberia branch manager Chinmoy Dutta, bank cashier  , businessman Somnath Ghosh and his associate  , accused in bank facilitator Rajat Chowdhury’s death case have been declared absconders by police. They had been served notice on Tuesday, asking them to appear for questioning. On Thursday, they became untraceable.

 Chowdhury was found dead on railway tracks on February 9, a few days after Ghosh lodged a police complaint against him. Chowdhury was accused of swapping 100- rupee notes — that Ghosh allegedly handed over to him — with scrapped 1,000- and 500-rupee notes. Apparently, Chowdhury was not even authorised to handle cash.
 
 “Their behaviour is adding credence to the allegations against them. The bank manager and cashier did not go to work since Wednesday. Their phones were switched off. They were not at home either. Under these circumstances, they are absconders. We have contacted the bank’s regional headquarters. The businessman’s son has altered his earlier statement. Now he claims even 2,000- rupee notes were deposited in Ghosh’s account,” said Sumit Kumar, SP (Rural), Howrah.
 
 A bank source said Dutta and Pramanik are consulting their lawyers and plan to seek anticipatory bail. After repeated efforts, TOI succeeded in getting through to Dutta over phone. “I don’t owe you an explanation. I am acting on my lawyer’s advice,” he curtly said before hanging up.
 
 The police, meanwhile, have access to the bank CCTV footage of February 7, the day Chowdhury allegedly wrote a confessional statement in Dutta’s presence. Ghosh subsequently handed this letter to the cops which is being examined. Now the case has been taken over by the SP after Chowdhury’s family accused the investigating officer of inaction on Wednesday. According to his nephew Bappa, the cops assured the family that the accused will be traced by Friday.
