HYDERABAD: Days after AP chief minister Chandrababu Naidu said people are fast losing faith in the banking system, the two Telugu-speaking states — Telangana and Andhra Pradesh — have joined hands on the cash crunch, contesting Union finance minister Arun Jaitley’s claims that the cash shortage is only a temporary phenomenon.

 Mincing no words, Telangana IT minister KT   faulted Jaitley’s argument on the burning issue. “Sir, with due respect, the cash shortage in banks and ATMs is neither sudden nor temporary. I have been hearing complaints for over three months repeatedly in Hyderabad. Please have the RBI and the finance ministry team dig deeper and not brush away an issue that is eroding people’s confidence in the banking system,” Rama Rao said in a reply to Jaitley’s tweet.
 
 
 The FM said that he had reviewed the currency situation which, he said, is not too much to be alarmed about. “Overall, there is more than adequate currency in circulation and also available with the banks. The temporary shortage caused by sudden and unusual increase in some areas is being tackled quickly and effectively,” he said.
 
 Taking a leaf out of Rama Rao’s book, AP IT minister Nara Lokesh said Jaitley is not understanding the ground reality. “It is very sad that FM Jaitley is not understanding the reality and saying everything is good.AP is facing severe cash crunch. We are not able to give pensions and pay MGNREGS workers,” he said in a tweet.
 
 Stressing the fact that Naidu had raised the cash crunch concerns several times, Lokesh said: “The CM has written several times about the issue to the central government. But the situation has not improved. At least now, the Centre has to react on this and resolve it at the earliest.”
