KOLKATA: He is the man behind the restoration of   Subhas Chandra Bose’s  car,   Its restoration was a big challenge, but thanks to   of   and his team, the car has sprung back to life 60 years after its last use and 75 years after the Great Escape.

 On Monday, Roy and his team of 12 hand-picked mechanics, were felicitated by Netaji Research Bureau at Netaji Bhawan for executing the task. Audi commissioned Roy to restore the Wanderer sedan after Netaji Research Bureau (NRB) approached the Audi Germany, one of the four arms of Auto Union, the manufacturer of the car. “Audi CEO came to my house and took me to Netaji Bhawan to show me the car. Before reaching there, I did not know where I was going. But after seeing the car, I did not think twice about lapping up the proposal,” said Roy.
 
 The car was in use till 1957, when its owner and Netaji’s nephew Sisir Kumar Bose, who actually had driven car from the Elgin Road house to Gomoh Railway station, donated it to NRB. “Since then it has been lying idle. When we tried to open the doors, they just came off. The engine was particularly in bad shape. It was opened in 1971. Many of the original parts were not put back in the engine after an abortive attempt of restoring it,” said Roy. His son Sourav also helped his father in the project.
 
 “Then I started my research as it required original parts. Audi helped me a lot. But the spare parts were no more manufactured. So, I had to often make them with lathe machine. Usually, such delicate restoration takes more than a year. But on the insistence of NRB, I had to finish it within 6-7 months. I often worked till late night. But such restoration also gives you a sense of satisfaction as you take part in the living history of the country,” said Roy.
