VISAKHAPATNAM: Even as the Indian Railways recently made an announcement on developing certain railway stations with private partnership, the Vizagapatam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI) has urged chief minister N   to take up the issue of formation of a new Waltair zone, which has been a long-pending demand of the region, with the central government.

 In a letter, VCCI president AV Monish Row said, “An invitation document has been published by   (ECoR), Bhubaneswar, to develop   railway station to international standards on the Swiss-challenge method. The invitation also offers Vizag railway land for development along with the railway station. The East Coast Railway has also offered Vizianagaram and   railway stations and land in those towns for development.”
 
 He said, “These huge development projects cannot and must not be allowed to come under the present zonal system and should necessarily be under the supervision of the Waltair zone which has already been promised not just under the AP Reorganisation Act but also by various leaders at different times.” Elaborating on the issue, Row said, “Moreover, if these type of railway projects come under a Waltair zone, the entire eco system of a smart city, Sagarmala, PCPIR, Coastal Economic Zone, logistics hub, various MOUs and other such proposals can all be synchronised and investors will show enthusiasm in this region, ultimately creating more jobs for locals.”
 
 “These type of projects come once in the life of a railway station and are not to be taken lying down. Visakhapatnam is the crown jewel in the entire zone and if these projects are allowed to come under the control of the East Coast Railway zone, it would be a travesty of justice for the generations that have been agitating for a separate zone for Waltair. The citizens have a very strong attachment to the creation of the Waltair zone and these new projects make it more and more difficult to create a new zone,” he added.
