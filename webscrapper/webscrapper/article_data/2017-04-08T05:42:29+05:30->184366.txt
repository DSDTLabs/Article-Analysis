NEW DELHI: Prime Minister   is likely to be felicitated by   MPs in   next week over the Centre’s decision to accord constitutional status to the  .

 A request has been made to the PM to find time for a function likely to be scheduled for Tuesday in Parliament where MPs belonging to Other Backward Classes will meet Modi for an informal exchange ahead of the budget session coming to a close.
 
 The function will also serve to subtly underscore Modi’s own OBC link that is seen to have served the party well in the 2014   polls and more recently in the   elections.
 
 The bill, which is expected to be passed by then, is being seen by   as a major step to woo the politically significant backward castes as it gives Parliament the right to include castes in the quota list.
 
 Constitutional status is seen to be a measure that will put the   at par with the national commissions for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes that has had such status for long.
 
 The bill has been subject to a heated discussion in Parliament with some opposition leaders arguing that the proposed law will do away with the powers of states to make inclusions to the OBC list.
 
 The government has denied that this is the case and said the powers of states were not affected by the bill currently in Parliament.
