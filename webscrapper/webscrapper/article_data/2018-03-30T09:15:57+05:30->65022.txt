LUCKNOW: The ongoing renovation work at   appears to be giving a tough time to passengers. While the platforms are damaged leaving little space for people to walk, even the public address system is dysfunctional, which adds to the chaos.

 
 In a reality check by TOI on Thursday, passengers shared their plight. A 70-year-old Rupendra Kumar, who had to board a train to Varanasi said, “I had a narrow escape near the parcel section. I could not balance myself ahead of a huge mountain of debris.”
 
 
 Rishi, resident of Aliganj sector-5, whose mother was travelling to Dehradun, said, “The platform was changed at the last minute, but we didn’t get to know as the public address system was not working.”
 
 
 Similarly,   could not even use the toilet as its entrance was blocked. “When I lodged a complaint with the station master, he asked me to take my father to platform one. The management was ridiculous.”
 
 
 The extent of the problem can be gauged from the fact that at least 250 trains pass through various   everyday, while the passenger load exceeds 1.25 lakh.
 
 
 When asked, divisional railway manager (DRM)   said, “The renovation work is for passenger convenience. But we shall try to sort out the complaints.”
 
 The renovation work includes the foundation work of 6 meter wide foot   one, expansion of platforms 2 and 3 and construction of route relay interlocking system (RRIS) building near platform 1.
