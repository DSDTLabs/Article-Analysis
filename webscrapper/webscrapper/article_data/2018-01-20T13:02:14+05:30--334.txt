Bambolim: A comprehensive   policy was required to bring in investment and create employment opportunities, president of the   (MRAI),  , said at the International Indian Metals Recycling Conference.

 Mehta was hopeful of the recycling policy being notified within the coming year after being evaluated by Niti Aayog.   had prepared a recycling policy for metals for the Union ministry of steel, but the Niti Aayog is now incorporating policies for recycling of chemicals, rubber and other materials.
 
 Stating that on an average, 50% of metal production in the country comes from scrap metal, Mehta said once the recycling policy was in place, foreign direct investment and technology sharing with foreign companies would get a boost.
 
 MRAI vice-president  , said setting up of an independent ministry for the recycling sector could go a long way in promoting recycling in the country. “If I have an issue with ferrous metals, I have to go to the steel ministry. If I have an issue with non-ferrous metals, I have to go to ministry of mines. If I have issues related to ships, I have to go to ministry of shipping. For other things I have to go to ministry for environment,” he explained.
