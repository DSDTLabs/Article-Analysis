Panaji: While Goa sits on bountiful marine resources, the lack of aquaculture in the state has led to a dip in seafood exports, even as the country scaled success in the fisheries sector in 2016-17 with seafood worth $5.78 billion exported out of the country. 

 The MPEDA (Marine Products Export Development Authority) statistics show a concerning trend in marine exports from Goa, where seafood worth $93.38 million was exported in 2014-15. This figure weakened to $75.09 million in 2015-16. 
 
 Local exporters are wary of this steep decline and agree that addressing the situation should be made priority. “There is hardly any fish for domestic consumption, forget about exports. Other states are able to export more because they have adopted fish farming. Goa also has to get into aquaculture to enhance the fisheries sector,” said a representative from export association of Goa.
 
 He added that “overfishing and use of more modern fishing techniques” are depleting the fish population. Even if some businessmen overcome these hurdles and manage to export a little, getting through the export process is another source of discouragement in this area. 
 
 “The importing countries have several labeling rules and health guidelines which Indian companies are not always able to keep up with. The quality of Indian fish/meat is also not as preferred in those countries unlike the local palate here,” said a spokesperson from Costa’s exports. The central government started allocating funds to Goa in the fisheries sector under the Blue revolution since last year. A total of 13 schemes have been listed under this initiative to increase fisheries production in a sustainable manner for Goa’s economic prosperity.
