Barcelona: On Sunday at the Mobile World Congress 2018, Samsung released its flagship Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus, which saw a dual aperture camera featured for the first time in a smartphone. The phone saw specs broadly unchanged from its predecessor S8, except for superior camera-linked features. Similar to Appleâ€™s Animojis, the S9 and S9 Plus offer AR emojis that allow users to create 3D avatars and use these as part of the keyboard. The phones also support super slow-motion (slow-mo) mode and live translation and more. For instance, once pointed at a dish, the S9 camera can show calories and other details of the dish.
