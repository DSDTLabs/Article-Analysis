MUMBAI: State BJP president and   MP   on Thursday apologised for using abusive language against the agitating farmers.State Congress president   and leader of the opposition in the assembly   have condemned him for the remark, with the former demanding Danve's resignation.

Danve told party workers that despite the Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government taking a series of measures to tackle agrarian crisis, particularly the dispute over procurement of tur dal, farmers were still crying.

If farmers are hurt by my comments, I tender an apology,“ Danve said in a statement.
