PATIALA: The police here booked an accused for abducting a 17-year-old girl who had gone missing on Tuesday, on a complaint lodged by her family. However, the girl returned home on Wednesday and was produced before the local court on Thursday.

 According to the police, the girl in her statement said she had gone to a local gurdwara on her own.
 
 The investigating officer said the minor girl wanted to marry a 23-year-old man who was working as a labourer and was residing in the village as her. The family of the girl also work as labourers but were against their marriage.
 
 “As the girl is a minor we registered a case immediately under the Indian Penal Code. Later, the girl came back and hence no arrests were made. Both the families of the accused and the complainant are labourers and not economically sound”, said investigation officer Sohan Singh of Dkala police station. He said the procedure for the cancellation of the FIR against the accused would be carried on.
