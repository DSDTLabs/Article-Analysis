KOCHI: The   of alternate learning that was to start   year in Kochi will now admit even students from the marginalized sections.The school authorities said that if transgenders want societal acceptance, then they can't work in isolation.

 The school, the first-of its-kind in the country, is headed by transgender activist Vijayraja Mallika. Observing that transgenders too need acceptance in society, Mallika shared a recent experience that helped her decide on this. “I was standing in the queue for blood test at a government medical college. I was surprised at the way people stared at me. Despite policy decisions in our favour, people still find it difficult to accept us as we are.To change this mindset we need to work in tandem. Therefore, we decided to admit even marginalized students in the school. Both of us come from the underprivileged group,“ said Mallika.
 
 India's first school for transgenders was recently inaugurated in Kochi. Named  , the original plan was to admit 10 transgender students, aged 25-30, and help them prepare for secondary and senior secondary examinations. They will also be taught some vocational skills such as beautician course. “We will tie-up with other agencies for shortterm job oriented courses,“ she said.
 
 Recently, they have sent a proposal to the Ernakulam collector to give four to five volunteers to help run the centre.
 
 The school will function from the shelter home for transgenders that started on December 30, 2016. The 17bedded shelter home has at the moment five inmates.
 
 Explaining how the idea to start an alternate learning centre came, Mallika said, “We realized that majority of transgenders who came to our shelter were not educated and sending them to an open school would be a good idea.“
 
 The admission process has started and so far two students, both transgenders, have taken admission.They are expected to start classes by June.
