NEW DELHI: The government will allot 100 cold chain projects on Monday as it moves to create a national grid to cut wastage of fruits, vegetables and perishables and ensure better remuneration for farmers.

 “We received almost 350 applications and we will announce the names of 100 who have been allotted the cold chains. There are many players both large and small,“ Harsimrat Kaur  , minister for food processing industries, told TOI. These chains will be spread across 20 states. The objective is to provide integrated cold chain and preservation facilities without any break from the farm gate to the consumer. The government has embarked on this scheme to cut down on wastage and develop food clusters as well as a tool to fight price hikes at times of shortages.
 
 “There is a shortage of 29 million tonnes in cold chains Last year, with 30 cold chains, we created 4 million tonnes capacity . With these 100 cold chains, it will be another 10-12 million tonnes,“ Badal said, adding that the setting up of a grid would help in better monitoring of the scheme.
 
 The government provides Rs 10 crore as subsidy to each project and the promoter has to invest in   and provide details of farmer groups that he intends to work with. “Food processing is very low, barely 10%, in India and various steps have been taken in the past nearly three years. Smaller countries like the   and   do 80% processing. Fruits and perishables processing is only 2%. Almost Rs 44,000 crore worth of fruits and perishable are wasted ac cording to a 2010 study,“ Badal said.
 
 “In 2017, we can imagine what that value will be. There should be zero tolerance to wards wastage,“ she added.
 
 Badal said development of the cold chain grid would help the government's SAMPADA (Agro-Marine Produce Proc essing and Development of Agro-clusters) scheme and boost food processing. She said several countries such as the   and Japan were keen to import fruits and vegetables from India.
