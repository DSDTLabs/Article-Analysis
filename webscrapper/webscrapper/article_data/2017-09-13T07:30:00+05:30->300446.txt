Chandigarh: Since National Assessment and Accreditation Council ( ) now gives 70 marks to the educational institutions for the information they put online, Panjab University has decided to revamp its website.

 In the last general-body meeting called to discuss the NAAC-audit preparedness of the university, all members of the faculty agreed that the website was in a mess and the information over it no so accessible. Besides, the university also doesn’t have a data policy to determine what content goes online and what doesn’t. The teachers called for a template for storing information online.
 
 Sources in the university said the participants in that meeting had suggested three main points—identifying gaps in the website, making a data policy, and creating a formal code of conduct for the students, teachers, and other member of the staff. 
 
 Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) director M Rajivlochan said the university departments needed to maintain detailed data of their teachers, students, and programmes. For helping them out, IQAC will make an ‘Information Resource Book’ online.
 
 Vice-chancellor Arun Kumar Grover told the teachers to gather all the information that the NAAC might require for auditing and upload it by the second half of 2019. 
 
 The teachers said the university should maintain its links with the alumni, while the departments should widen their alumni network and keep a record of their old students. They called for annual alumni meets at all departments and the keeping of student data at least since 2015. They said the departments should keep track of these students and stay in touch with them.
