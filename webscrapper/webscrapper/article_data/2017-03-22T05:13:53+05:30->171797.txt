KOLKATA: A fresh case has been drawn up against   Superspeciality hospital — the third in three weeks — by the   police. 

 This case, though, has not been drawn under the usual negligence case; instead, the lighter   section 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others) has been slapped along with IPC section 34 (common intention). 
 
 According to the FIR filed against some doctors of Medica, Supratik Basu (64), a resident of Baidyapara Road of Baruipur, has said his wife Rita was admitted to the hospital on January 20 with a history of breathlessness, swelling of body and water in stomach. The doctors treated her before releasing her on January 24.
 
 However, according to the FIR, after being discharged, the patient’s condition deteriorated. She was moved first to   and then to Peerless Hospital, where she was cured. Supratik claimed due to negligence in treatment and improper diagnosis of the Medica doctors, the patient could have died. 
 
 Meanwhile, in the case related to Sanjay Pandey’s death at the same hospital, his widow Sujata met the Swasthya Bhawan-appointed committee members on Tuesday. 
 
 Investigators probing charges by Ruby Roy — wife of deceased patient Sanjoy Roy — against Apollo Gleneagles hospitals said they were consulting legal experts after a probe showed extortion charges can be substantiated. 
 
 The investigating officers spent over two hours on Tuesday at the office of deputy commissioner of police Debasmita Das going through the evidence collected from Apollo Hospital. “We are probing whether there was any deliberate criminal dereliction of duty during communications between juniors and seniors. We will be checking the server where Sanjoy’s data is stored is to ensure we do not act in haste without collecting necessary evidence,” said an officer.
