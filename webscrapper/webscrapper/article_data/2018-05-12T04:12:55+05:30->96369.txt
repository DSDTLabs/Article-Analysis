NAVI MUMBAI: As many as 15 prime plots in the upmarket sector 19 of   were reclaimed by   during a day-long   drive conducted by the Chief Controller of Unauthorised Constructions ( ) of Cidco on Friday. 

 The anti-encroachment squad was backed by a strong team of the local police to avoid any untoward incidents. According to a police officer, the drive was peaceful.
 
 The plots in sector 19A of Vashi were cleared by the Cidco anti-encroachment team which had its security personnel apart from the 80 local policemen led by   police station in-charge and senior inspector Rajeendra Galande who thwarted some mild protests by the slum dwellers.
 
 The plots have been reserved for the service industry which will fetch the city planner a huge amount. A total area of 12,000 square meter have been freed from encroachments during the campaign under the instruction of Cidco’s additional collector and CCUC Shivraj S Patil.
 
 “The plots were occupied by slum dwellers for a long time. We successfully conducted the demolition drive with the help of the APMC police who provided us full-proof security along with our own security staffers. The plots will have a great market value reserved for the service sector. Our marketing department will soon strike deals of the plots with prospective buyers,” said P B Rajput, controller of unauthorized constructions, Cidco, Navi Mumbai (north).
