JAIPUR: The Jaipur police on Saturday arrested three people in connection with the   of property dealer and Congress party worker Madan Mogra in   five days ago.

 Deputy Commissioner of police (Jaipur-South) Manish Agarwal told TOI that three people, Rambabu, Mahesh Meena and   on February 28 stopped Mogra’s bike and slit his throat in order to settle personal enmity. 
 
 “Two months ago Mogra and another villager Gopal Kumhar had a fight over some property related issue. Rambabu defended Gopal Kumhar and a verbal spat with Mogra,” Agarwal said, adding that Rambabu decided to kill Mogra with an aim to take revenge.
 
 Rambabu roped in his two friends, Mahesh Meena and Prince Singh and hatched a conspiracy. On the morning of February 28, the trio stopped Mogra’s bike near Baksawala area of Sanganer and attacked his throat with a sharp weapon. The trio left the spot, leaving the victim profusely bleeding on the spot. 
 
 “Rambabu, Meena, and Singh were planning to leave the city and were arrested by outside the Gandhi Nagar Railway station. We are currently interrogating them to get more details about the weapons and car used in the crime,” Agarwal said.
 
 The sources within Jaipur police told TOI that they suspect the role of a history sheeter, Mangal in the case. “We are also probing the role of other land mafias in the case who may have helped the trio in carrying out the attack on Mogra,” the official said, adding that Gopal and Mogra had a clash 20 days ago over a piece of land in Sanganer. 
 
 “The fight turned ugly when Mogra allegedly attacked Rambabu’s mother. Rambabu was furious and decided to kill Mogra,” the official said, adding that while post mortem shows death with a sharp edged weapon, the cops had also found empty shells of a bullets.
