PUNE: Osmanabad MP  , who was supposed to board his first flight on Monday after the revocation of travel ban on him by airlines, chose to travel by train to Delhi.

 “It is confirmed that he took the   to Delhi. He has already reached the country’s capital and had called me to confirm it,”   Shinde, a close aid of the MP told TOI.
 
 It is the second time in a few days, since the flight ban was lifted, that the MP chose to travel by train. Gaikwad had been barred from flying after he reportedly hit an   staffer. Later, the ban was lifted after he expressed “regret” over the incident. 
 
 “He isn’t trying to avoid flying after whatever happened. Everything related to that incident is over,” the MP’s aid said
 
 Shinde, however, wasn’t sure from which station the MP had boarded the train. “Mumbai Delhi Rajdhani Express leaves from Mumbai Central station and makes the first stop at Borivli. I am not sure whether he boarded the train from Mumbai Central or Borivli. He will be in Delhi until the Parliament session is over. He might stay there for some more days ,” he said.
 
 Gaikwad had taken a train to Mumbai from Delhi on Saturday last, the day the travel ban was lifted by the airlines following the intervention of the civil aviation ministry.
