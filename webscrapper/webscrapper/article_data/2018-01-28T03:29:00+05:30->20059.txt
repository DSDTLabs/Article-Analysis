Colva: Former minister and ex-MLA of Nuvem, Mickky Pacheco demanded that South Goa superintendent of police, Arvind Gawas tender an apology to the family of Colva resident Baptisto D’Costa for making remarks that he was murdered by the accused, Amaan Kavitiya, for his bisexual orientation. He said such a statement, a day prior to carrying out the final rites of the victim, brought shame to his family and maligned the image of the village. Addressing reporters Mickky said, “Such an insensitive statement by a high-ranking officer is not only illegal, but can force family members to commit suicide.’’ He further said that such a statement before the lapse of the police custody of the accused has only weakened the case.  Pacheco questioned the police assertion saying that if the accused had alleged that the deceased was gay and sexually harassing him, then why didn’t he file a complaint to the police. Mickky went on to say that the investigation wasn’t proper and there was more to the murder than the alleged sexual harassment angle. Colva police inspector, Filomena Costa said the medical samples have been preserved to be sent to an outstation laboratory and that once the reports are out, they will comment on the same.
