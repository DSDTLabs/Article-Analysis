AHMEDABAD: The harvest season is here. While most people are gearing to celebrate Uttarayan, making merry on terraces and rooftops by flying kites and savouring undhiyu, jalebi, chikki and seasonal fruits, those coming from other states who call the city home, are preparing for the harvest festival —   for the Assamese,   for those from   or Pongal for Tamils.

 While the idea behind all these festivals is the first harvest of the season, the rituals and cultures are different.
 
 “Pongal is a five-day festival which begins on the eve of Makar Sankranti. We celebrate it to thank the almighty for the harvest. The first day is Bogi, when we clean our homes and light a bonfire of discarded or unused items,” said  , a resident of Chandkheda.
 
 Similarly, the Assamese community celebrates Bihu with a feast. “January 13 is usually celebrated as Bhogali Bihu, when villagers get together and enjoy a feast with the new crops. Here, at the individual level, we prepare a sweet – Pitha – which is a cake made of rice flour. That there is a delicacy made from rice flakes and curd,” said  , a resident of Bopal, who has been in   for 60 years.
 
 Lohri, which also marks the celebration of the first harvest is widely celebrated in North India. “A ritual involving the lighting of a bonfire and worshipping the almighty for the harvest typically marks Lohri and is usually done at the community level. It is a way of spreading joy with traditional folk dance and food,” said  , a resident of  .
