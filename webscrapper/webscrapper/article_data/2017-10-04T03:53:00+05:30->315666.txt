Panaji: Reacting to news reports, leader of opposition Chandrakant ‘Babu’ Kavlekar said that the information that was leaked by the Anti Corruption Bureau ( ), was nothing but conjecture and inferences “which had no factual foundation”.

 Asserting that he had disclosed all his assets in his income tax returns before the Lokayukta, Kavlekar said that the information leaked by the ACB “creates the impression that the investigation officials acquired knowledge about the property in Kerala only in 2017” even though he had given the same information to the ACB in 2013.
 
 “The properties in Kerala were acquired pursuant to a loan obtained by the company known as Vrushal Estate and Development Private Limited. The ACB failed to recognize that companies are not owned by individuals and a company is an independent corporate entity,” he said.
