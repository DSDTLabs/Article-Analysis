 Vibhuti said, “I have just completed my masters. My sister Yashshvi has a fashion studio, where lots of cotton and waste fabric is generat- ed. So, we decided to make pads from these left- over cotton.” She was inspired by the movie ‘Pad- man’. The pads were made as per the doctor’s advice after desanitizing the cotton and cloth.
