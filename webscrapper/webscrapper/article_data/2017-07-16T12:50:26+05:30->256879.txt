NAGPUR: A group of parents whose children study in Guru Nanak High School on Saturday protested management’s decision to charge a nominal fee for school’s expenses. 

 The school cannot charge fee because it receives government grant from Std I onwards. Therefore, the school is struggling to generate money for other expenses.
 
  Kalsi, general secretary of  , said, “We have already approached the court seeking non-salary grant funds to ensure that we are able to pay our bills. This entire episode is now sub-judice.” 
 
 The state government pays all teachers’ salaries and gives 5% (of fifth pay commission scale) to meet expenses. Of this 4% is to meet expenses like civic taxes, utilities etc and 1% is the rent paid school. 
 
 The state pays the rent because it uses the private school’s infrastructure and gets to implement its curriculum and policies. 
 
 Kalsi said, “The rent paid for our junior college is only Rs4,800 per year. We have to pay for maintenance staff, clear electricity bills, water bills, property tax and maintain the building infrastructure.”
 
 School’s principal   said, “Some parents were misinformed that we are changing our state board school to CBSE. That’s incorrect because our management already has a CBSE school just next door. our management has clarified the issue of fee hike too.” 
 
 Secretary Kalsi said, “We have been honest with parents that a nominal fee will be charged as there is no other way to meet expenses.” 
 
 TOI had reported earlier on how private-aided schools are struggling to meet their expenses ever since non-salary grants were stopped over a decade ago.
