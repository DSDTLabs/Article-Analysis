TIRUPUR: The deadline-sensitive garment manufacturing units here joined the state-wide bandh, downing shutters along with other commercial establishments on Friday.

 A trade body representing garment manufacturers and exporters, which usually do not take on the government, issued a strongly-worded statement condemning the police firing. “If a government did not heed to the worries of the people even after continuous protests, it should be undemocratic. Killing the protesters in police firings should be a barbaric act. Even for those who involve in terrorism, the punishment could be given only after proper legal trials,” president of the Tirupur Exporters and Manufacturers Association (TEAMA) S P   said in a statement.
 
 “Even if the protesters committed crimes, they should have been arrested and interrogated. But depriving humanity, shooting down 13 people was an atrocity. Such heinous crime could not have been committed without the nod of the government, which should take full responsibility for the excess of its police department,” Muthurathinam added.
 
 The bandh called by the opposition parties received a good response in the district. More than 60% of commercial establishments including knitwear units, silver utensil units and other shops remained shut.
 
 Meanwhile, two motorcycle riders pelted stones at a Tnstc bus in   near  . The windscreen of the bus was broken. Bus driver   was injured. Avinashipalayam police have registered a case.
