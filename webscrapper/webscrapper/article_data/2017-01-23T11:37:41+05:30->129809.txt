KOLHAPUR: Besides political rallies and campaigns, sale of mutton and mutton feasts in   are also set to be under the  's (EC) scanner for the next month ahead of  .

 According to sources, sale of mutton and its consumption usually go up during election and is used as a tool to influence voters. The poll authorities, this time, have stepped up to keep a tab on the sale of mutton and also monitor events like “mutton parties and feasts“ that take place during elections.
 
 Vigilance squads are being deployed at every village and mutton shops have been asked to keep a record of daily sales. “Every mutton shop owner will have to maintain a register of sales and purchase. The shop keeper will also keep details of buyers,“ an official said.
 
 Sources said, “Mutton parties are common in villages during election. The agenda is to ensure maximum votes and make voters happy by offering free meals. Night hours and remote areas like farms and fields are safe to hold such events,“ sources said.
 
 Ajay Pawar, sub divisional officer of Panhala, said, “ A 4member squad is set up for every village. Their job is to prepare a list of mutton shops and monitor daily sales. In cases of unusual increase in sales, squads will seek details of buyers and visit the buyers. Cases will be referred to the code of conduct cell if they seem politically motivated.“
