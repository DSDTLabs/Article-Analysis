INDORE: The Indore bench of   has directed divisional commissioner to conduct an inquiry into the last year’s admission process of   with respect to RTE Act and CBSE guidelines.

 Division bench of Justice PK Jaiswal and Justice   issued the interim order and asked the commissioner to submit a report within next three months on a petition filed by Yogendra Singh through advocate GP Singh. 
 
 The petition alleged that Daly College was giving admission to students in manner of favoritism. The petitioners alleged that the school had not given admission to students in a transparent manner as neither was there a public advertisement made to invite applications of students and nor was the open draw held to determine which student got admission. 
 
 “We also told the court that the process adopted by the school was nothing but eye wash rigged with mala fide favoritism and reputism,” advocate LC Patne arguing on behalf of the petitioner said. 
 
 To this, the Daly College had submitted preliminary objections that the school was not receiving any grant from the state of   and any other state and was not under government control either financially or administratively or functionally, and hence a writ petition against them was not maintainable. 
 
 The petitioners had argued that two nominees of the board of directors of governing body at the Daly College were government employees and that they had been given vast land by Indore Municipal Corporation for running the school. Also, since the school performed a public function of educating children a writ could be issued by the court against them. 
 
 After taking on record the arguments advanced by both the parties the court ruled that the petition against Daly College was maintainable and requested divisional commissioner to look into the grievance of the petitioner and submit a report within three weeks.
