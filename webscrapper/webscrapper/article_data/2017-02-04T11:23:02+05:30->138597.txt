NEW DELHI: A 35-year-old man posing as a doctor at   was caught in the   ward and handed over to the police on Friday afternoon for taking money from patients to get their work done. The accused,  , had mentioned on his Facebook profile that he was therapist at the premier institute. This is the second such case reported in the last one month.

 The doctors who caught him said that the man used to wear a surgical mask and attend to patients in the waiting area. He used to tell them that other doctors were busy, so he had been asked to attend to them. “He used to talk to patients with a stethoscope around his neck. He was unmasked while trying to get a patient admitted in the emergency ward,” said a hospital official.
 
 The hospital official said that he had approached two patients claiming to be a doctor in the neurology department. When doctors suspected something fishy and asked him to show his Identity card, Tripathi failed to do so.
 
 Tripathi, however, justified his actions and told the police that he was helping patients, who otherwise have to wait endlessly to get treatment.
