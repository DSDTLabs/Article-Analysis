GHAZIABAD: A 20-year-old   student, a resident of Meerut, went missing from Vaishali metro station on Monday night. A missing person’s complaint was registered at   police station and a manhunt has been launched to trace   Khan, a first-year student at ITS Engineering College in Greater Noida. 

 Maaz’s family lives in Meerut’s Humayun Nagar. On Monday afternoon, Maaz, who was going to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to meet his father, an electrician with an automobile company, left home with his brother and mother to board the flight from IGI Airport in Delhi. 
 
 Maaz’s elder brother Izhar Khan said, “The flight was scheduled to take off at 7 pm. As we were getting late due to a traffic jam, we dropped Maaz off at Vaishali metro station. However, my brother could not make it to the airport on time and informed us that he was returning. He told us he was taking the metro and would meet us at Mohan Nagar Crossing. He kept talking to us at quick intervals throughout his return journey to Vaishali metro station.” 
 
 He further said, “After getting down at metro station around 9.30pm Maaz said he was taking an auto to reach Mohan Nagar Crossing. After a while when we called him to know where he was, the phone was answered by a woman. We could hear Maaz’s screams in background, loudly asking where he was but then his phone got disconnected and became unreachable.”
 
 Throughout the night, Izhar and his mother frantically searched for Maaz but could not locate him. Izhar alleged that officers at Sahibabad and Link road police stations refused to file an FIR, causing him to run from pillar to post between the two locations to lodge a complaint.
 
 Finally, Sahibabad police recovered call details of Maaz’s mobile number and based on last location asked Izhar to go to Indirapuram police station to lodge a complaint.
