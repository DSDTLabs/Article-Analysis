CHENNAI: Flying to Chennai from Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Jaipur, Singapore and Dubai has become expensive in the next few days as there is a rush of people returning to the city after short getaways for Christmas and New Year holidays. Delhi-Chennai fare has reached Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 while Mumbai-Chennai has increased from the usual Rs 4,000 to Rs 7,000 and above because of the demand. Students returning after vacation too have contributed to this hike. Fares are low from Chennai to these cities as holiday traffic will increase only during Pongal. 

 The high demand from holidayers and people who are returning after visiting their friends and relatives have put last minute travellers in a fix. An airline official said, “As the seats are full, the fare slab has increased making it expensive for last-minute travellers, mostly businessmen or those travelling for official purposes, because they have to shell out a huge price.”
 
 Basheer Ahmed of Metro Travels said, “Air fares to Chennai from other cities in the country and international destinations are also high. A large number of people travel to Delhi, Jaipur, Mumbai, Dubai and Singapore for short getaways. This trend has been seen in the last few years. The numbers were high this time because New Year was an extended weekend. This is causing the fare to go up. People wanting to travel to Chennai are finding it difficult because of this hike.”
 
 A good number of students from other cities who study in Chennai will also be traveling in the coming days. This has added to the fare hike. A Chennai-Delhi one-way fare is in the range of Rs 8,500 to Rs 15,000 while a one-way fare from Mumbai to Chennai is selling in the range of Rs 4,600 to Rs 12,000. “The fare may go up further in the coming days, especially for travel during the weekend,” Ahmed added.
