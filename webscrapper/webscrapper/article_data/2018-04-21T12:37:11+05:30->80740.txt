TIRUPUR: The   (enforcement) has found 17 provisional and grocery shops that have violated rules in utilisation of weighing scales and sales of packaged food products.

 Recently, officials of the department had inspected more than 42 shops, including supermarkets, during raids conducted in   and Dharapuram taluks. “As per the Legal Metrology Act 2009, the shops should submit electronic weighing scales and mechanical scales before the department every year and every two years respectively, and obtain certificates/seals. Moreover, they should display those certificates. But many shops have failed in that front,” assistant commissioner of labour (In-charge) T Murugesan said.
 
 The officials also verified violations in packaged food products under Legal Metrology (packaged commodities) Rules, 2011. “Many products did not carry the required details including name and address of manufacturers, expiry date and ingredients,” the official said.
 
 The shops will soon be issued show-cause notices and based on their replies, further action will be initiated. “Shops that concede violations will be directed to pay fines from Rs 2,500 to Rs 5,000. Otherwise, they will be dragged to the labour court,” Murugesan added.
