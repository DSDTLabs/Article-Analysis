MARGAO:   locals expressed their disapproval over the non-functioning street lights in the village at the gram sabha of the Varca village panchayat held on Sunday. 

 The members pointed out that any attempts to contact the contractor who installed the   street lights is futile. They demanded that the panchayat takes up the issue with the electricity department at the earliest possible.
 
 Several other issues were also discussed at the meeting. However, the gram sabha was poorly attended.
