AHMEDABAD: In an interesting twist to the Rs 17.83 lakh theft from an SBI ATM in Krishnanagar, Naroda police on Saturday arrested  , 25, a resident of Memco and recovered Rs 8.60 lakh cash from him. The crime branch had earlier arrested   for the same offence and recovered over Rs 9 lakh from him. It has now come to light that the two accused arrested for the same offence don’t know each other.

 Inspector V R Chaudhary of the Naroda police station said Chauhan, who was working with Logicash, was sent to the ATM to check the status of cash after the bank received the message of “no cash” though cash had been loaded the same day.
 
 “Chauhan noticed that the ATM had been broken into,” Chaudhary said. “As Hardik Patel had stolen only Rs 9 lakh of the Rs 26 lakh in the ATM, Chauhan saw it as a chance to pick up Rs 8.60 lakh, thinking that the original thief would be held responsible for stealing all of the cash.” 
 
 Sub-inspector Nikul Maru said Patel had drilled a hole into the back of the ATM. “During the reconstruction of the crime, Patel showed us how he picked up Rs 2000 notes, one by one, from the small gap.” Maru said it would have been impossible for Patel to take out 2,100 notes of Rs 2000 between 45 minutes to 1 hour, the time during which he was at the ATM.
 
 Police officials said they came to the conclusion that Patel alone could not have stolen so much cash by picking up notes one by one. Hence they decided to interrogate others involved in the chain of events which followed the theft.
 
 “We zeroed in on Chauhan who was the first to visit the ATM after the message of “no cash” was received,” said Maru. “He broke down during interrogation and confessed to his crime.”
