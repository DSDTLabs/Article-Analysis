HYDERABAD: The   of both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh want the Centre to take a speedy decision on the appointment of a permanent   and new judges so that pending 3.5 lakh cases in the   can be disposed of. On Thursday, they submitted a representation to Union law minister   and urged him to appoint a permanent CJ for Hyderabad   and also fill up vacancies of judges at the earliest. 

 
  president Challa Damodar Reddy and   president   in a combined representation said the Hyderabad HC has been functioning without a regular CJ for over three years.
 
 "The sanctioned strength of judges in Hyderabad HC is 61 and current strength is only 29, which is less than 50% of total strength. Bar members are deprived of the opportunity to become HC judges for many years. Even the speed of disposal of cases is poor. Around 3.5 lakh cases are pending in the HC. A significant number of criminal appeals are pending due to which appellants are languishing in jails for many years. Currently, HC is hearing criminal appeals of 2011. The first appeals, including land acquisition appeals, are pending since 1987. The writ petitions are pending since 1999 and stay petitions pending since 2000," said Damodar Reddy.
 
 He added, "Due to delay in appointments, not only the bar members are suffering but the litigant public too is denied speedy justice. Recently, the SC had directed all the HCs to notify that all the interim stay orders passed in case of pending trial shall be automatically vacated after six months unless the court extends them for valid reasons. Recently, we learnt that SC collegium has already recommended a name for the appointment of CJ and the same is pending with the Centre."
