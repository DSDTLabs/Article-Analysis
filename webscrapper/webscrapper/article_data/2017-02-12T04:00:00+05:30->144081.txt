Palanpur: A court in Vadgam taluka of Banaskantha granted police remand of controversial Sadhvi Jaishree Giri of Mukhteshwar Math on Saturday under the Arms Act. 

 In December last year, two persons had fired two rounds in the air from a gun during a ‘Lok Dayro’ where Giri was seen showering new currency notes on a folk singer.
 
 According to police sub-inspector Vadgam C P Chaudhary, “On the basis of the video clip that went viral, two people were seen firing in the air. We ascertained genuineness of the video. However, we could not know the identity of the person who fired in the air from the gun.”
 
 There are about 18 offences registered in different police stations against Giri. Giri was arrested for cheating a local jeweller of Rs 5 crore.
