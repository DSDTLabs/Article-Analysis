Margao: Volunteer organisation Children’s Rights in Goa (CRG) that works for the cause of children has appreciated the directorate of panchayats’ move to hold bal sabhas along with special gram sabhas on National Panchayati Raj Day.

 In a press note, CRG stated that, in 2006, as per the mandate of the Goa Children’s Act, 2003, it had initiated the process of setting up village child committees (VCCs), bal sabhas and bal panchayats in Arambol, and, subsequently, had facilitated the process of bal sabhas and bal panchayats in Anjuna, Arambol, Assagao, Camurlim, Moira, Morjim, Salvador do Mundo, Sodiem, and Verla Canca.
 
 “The most interesting part of the bal sabha and bal   process is that children actively participate on this platform to express their grievances and issues affecting them whether it is in their villages or in schools,” CRG stated. 
 
 CRG expressed the need for convergence between the directorate of panchayat and the directorate of women and child development to ensure that children enjoy their right to participation through bal sabhas and bal panchayats.
