GHAZIABAD: A 24-year-old woman allegedly committed suicide by jumping off the 22nd floor of a society in   on Wednesday. The woman,  , was working as a housemaid in the house of one Puja Khanna, who discovered her body on Wednesday morning.

 “Gulab was attending to household chores like any other day,” said Puja  , who lives on the 22nd floor of the highrise in Crossings Republik with her mother. “I was calling her for some work around 9am. When she didn’t respond, I went to her room. It was locked from inside. I panicked and when I looked down from the balcony, I saw her lying in a pool of blood,” Puja told TOI. She then informed the security guards.
 
 When asked about what could have been the reason behind taking the extreme step, Puja said, “Gulab, a resident of Chattisgarh, was working for us for the last two months. She told me that she wanted to visit her home a week ago, so I informed the agency through which we had hired her. They said that they would arrange her ticket. But Gulab kept on insisting on going home immediately, so someone from the agency promised to pay a visit on Wednesday afternoon to talk to her. Before he could come over, she committed suicide.”
 
 Arun Mishra, SSI, Crossings Republik police chowki, said the body has been sent for a postmortem. “We received information from a security guard that a woman’s body was found who was later identified as Gulab,” he said.
