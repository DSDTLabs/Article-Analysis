In March 2012, heavily-tattooed   decided to go for a small cross on her left collarbone. Celebrity   artist Bang Bang cut the ink with water to make the tattoo light. Be it the ‘Made in England’ stamp on model Cara Delevingne’s sole, a wave on Miley Cyrus’ foot, a star on Sonakshi Sinha’s neck or Priyanka Chopra’s famous ‘Daddy’s lil girl...’ scribbled on the side of the hand as a tribute to her father – good ink now comes in small packages.

 Given the minimalism wave, with everything getting pared down, tattoos are the next step. Delhi-based tattoo artist Mickey Malani calls it a new era of tattooing. “It is a more subtle approach and suits people who want a tattoo but don’t want to go for anything bold. Also, these can be easily hidden,” he says. Tattoos usually mark a milestone – after all, it is going to be permanent. But tattoo wearers are usually stereotyped as being loud or fringe. Minimalist tattoo helps break that. And small doesn’t mean insignificant. Malani says, “These tattoos have their own meanings and significance.”

That’s why, the popular picks are mainly geometric shapes; especially those like glyphs and runes where each symbol has its own meanings. And where should you get marked? Malani says, “It all depends on how visible you want it to be. But below the collar bone, on the ribs/wrist are most preferred places.”
