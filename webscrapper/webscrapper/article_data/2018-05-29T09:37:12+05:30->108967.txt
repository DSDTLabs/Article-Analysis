NEW DELHI: Facing threat of eviction from official accommodation following the  's ruling, former UP chief ministers   and   on Monday approached the apex court seeking appropriate time to vacate the premises. 

 The apex court on May 7 ruled that former CMs could not be allotted official   after demitting office and they should be treated at par with common citizens.
 
  The court had said that occupying a constitutional post in the past cannot entitle a person to residential accommodation by government.
 
 The court had declared unconstitutional Section 4(3) of UP Ministers (Salaries, Allowances and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, which was brought in by state government in 2016 for allotting official bungalows to former CMs and termed it as arbitrary and violative of constitutional principle of equality.
 
 Complying with the SC order, the UP government served notices to six former chief ministers - Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Rajasthan Governor  , Samajwadi Party leaders Mulayam Singh Yadav and   Yadav, BSP chief   and   veteran N D Tiwari - to vacate government bungalows in Lucknow within 15 days. Seeking more time, Mulayam Singh and his son Akhilesh approached the SC contending that they need time to make arrangements for their accommodation and it cannot be done within the 15-day period granted by the state government.
 
 Section 4(3) was introduced by the state to frustrate SC's 2016 verdict in which it had directed the former CMs to vacate their bungalows allotted by the government.
