According to the Hindu Mythology, Navratri is considered as one of the most auspicious festivals. As the name suggests, the festival is celebrated for nine days where each day is dedicated to the nine avatars of Goddess Durga. The different avatars of goddess Durga that are worshipped on these nine auspicious days are Shailaputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skanda Mata, Katyayani, Kalaratri, Mahagauri, and Siddhidatri. 

 Traditionally, the Navratri is celebrated four times a year marking the change of seasons. But the most popular ones are Sharad and Chaiytra Navratri. Chaiytra Navratri marks the transition from spring from summers and it began from March 18 this year and will go on till March 26. 
 
 The fourth day of Chaitra Navratri, observed on March 21 this year, worships the fourth form of Goddess Durga called Kushmanda Mata. She is worshipped as she is considered to eliminate the darkness and give light to the universe. Her name literally means-- Ku means little, Ushma means energy and Anda means the cosmic egg. Thus, the cosmic egg represents the whole universe and the Devi's divine smile is believed to end the darkness.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 It is believed that Goddess Durga resides in the center of the sun and so she liberates energy to the universe. Thus this avatar of hers is known as Goddess Kushmanda which is believed to possesses healing powers. People worship Mother Kushmanda offering flowers, fruits and incense and request for good health and blessings for themselves and their loved ones.
 
 Goddess Kushmanda is generally seen riding a lioness and has eight hands. In her right hands are Kamandal, Dhanush, Bada and Kamal while the left hand has AmritKalash, Jap Mala, Gada and Chakra in that order.
 
 
 
 Goddess Kushmanda's puja is performed on the 4th day of Navratri and the tithi is Chaturthitithi.
