AHMEDABAD: A division bench of   high court on Thursday dismissed the appeals filed by the managing committee of Mehsana District Milk Producers’ Union Ltd ( ) against show-cause notices issued to them by the cooperative registrar on alleged irregularities and a multi-crore scam.

 The bench headed by Chief Justice R S Reddy upheld the single-judge bench’s order in this case. According to additional advocate general Prakash Jani, the district registrar reported to the cooperative registrar that elected members of Dudhsagar Dairy had not followed law and acted contrary to the interests of the society and its members.
 
 In November 2016, the cooperative registrar issued show-cause notices to the elected members seeking explanation on why they should not be removed from their posts and an administrator should not be appointed to look after the dairy’s affairs.
 
 The elected members were charged for disregarding the orders of the concerned court, creating commotion in the general meeting and removal of three directors without following any procedure.
