THANE: The move to GST and emergence of new growth centres in Thane, Navi Mumbai, Vasai and Kalyan seems to have fuelled the sale of automobiles as the collective revenue at these four   offices touched an all-time high of over 1,388 crore in the last fiscal.

 The registration of new vehicles and collection of taxes and fines by the transport frpartment in all four offices here saw the collective annual revenue target of the Thane region RTO exceed by over 24 crore. The revenue collected from these four RTOs was over Rs 1,388 crore on March 31, as against the target of Rs 1,364 crore set by the state transport department at the beginning of the last financial year.
 
 
  
 The rise in the RTO revenue charts has been largely attributed to the rush to buy cars, especially fleet cabs, and the improved sales of bikes and autos, following the abolition of Octroi, excise duty and VAT.
 
 “The growing demand for cars and bikes in Vasai and Kalyan has spiraled the registration at these two RTOs. The Kalyan RTO office caters to Dombivli, Ambernath, Titwala, Shahapur, while the   covers most of the talukas in   district. These semi-urban centres are witnessing a rise in population which is evident by the rise in the number of vehicle registrations,’’ said a senior transport official.
 
 Regional transport officer of   said, “The growth in the annual income is due to the overall increase of 10% in the vehicle registration of two wheelers and four wheelers as compared to the previous fiscal. Consumers choose to purchase a new vehicle as they did not have to pay for the Octroi’’
