NEW DELHI: As   in the AAP government that its   with the   might   several projects and therefore earn public ire, it’s been   over an idea to live-stream all its official meetings. 

 The plan is to live-stream even the CM’s meetings with the bureaucracy so that the people could understand how the political executive and the bureaucracy play a crucial role in governance. 
 
 The live-streaming would also include audio and would be accessible to the common man. As the exercise would open the planning and processing of projects at the highest level to wider public scrutiny, there would be wider implications too. For instance, it might reduce the room for free-wheeling ideation and deliberation. But confidential meetings would be kept out of its purview. 
 
 A cabinet note on the plan may be prepared in the coming weeks and the matter taken up for discussion. 
 
 In addition to this, the government is also planning to develop a file-tracking system that would be accessible to the public. Anyone could access the details of the files—the creator, who held the file for how many days, remarks of the officers and the political executive on it etc. All the confidential meetings would be kept away from live-streaming. 
 
 “The live feed would be available on a dedicated website where people could hear who spoke what in the meetings. With the file-tracking plan, we want to put every noting and detail of each file pending at each stage on the website so that people can know which officer or which political functionary held up the file for how many days,” said a government official. 
 
 If the plan is okayed, funds would be allocated for it in the forthcoming budget, he said. 
 
 AAP’s Delhi chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said on Monday that he would request the speaker to keep meetings of all assembly committees open to the media for the sake of transparency.
