It is an all too familiar story for defending champions   who are yet to register a win in the   succumbing to three loses in as many games, and according to former Indian skipper  , the three-time   champions need a calming influence in the middle order. 

 
 
 
 Writing in his column for TOI, Srikkanth opined that Mumbai’s fortunes can turn around with a little tweak in combination. “Mumbai Indians are finding themselves at the bottom of the barrel. To be on the wrong end of three close games is not easy to take for any side, wrote Srikkanth, adding “To me the solution lies in a tweak to the combination. They are a side full of heavy hitters and once the screws come off, they fall in a heap. The defending champions need a calming influence in the middle.”
 
 
 
 
 
  will be taking on Virat Kohli’s Royal Challengers Bangalore next at the Wankhede Stadium in a marquee clash on Tuesday, and Srikkanth feels that the team should find a place for South African allrounder   in the playing XI. 
 
 “If I was the captain, I would play JP Duminy in the middle order. His fielding and off-spin will also come in handy. “ he said. “In all T20 he has bowled, JP bowls an average of 2.2 overs per game. This could also help   from breaking the monotony. He has a class leg-spinner and a useful left-arm spinner in place so the South African will lend a good balance not only with the bat but also with the ball,” wrote Srikkanth. 
 
 Their biggest worry for MI is the poor form of their captain Rohit Sharma who has registered scores of 15, 11 and 18 so far, but Srikkanth has backed Rohit to come good. 
 
 “I have also noticed that Rohit drops himself down the order after a few failures in the IPL. In my opinion he is still one of the best T20 openers and he needs to bat there. Once he finds his rhythm, Mumbai will become an extremely tough side to beat,” added the 58-year-old.
