LUCKNOW: Attacking former chief minister   for his jibe that lions were starving in the wake of BJP government’s crackdown on  , government spokesperson and cabinet minister for health   said, “More than the lions, Akhilesh Yadav should have been more concerned about the people of the state, for how many many jobs did he create in five years or how many illegal businesses he allow?” 

 He added that illegal activities have thrived in the state—be it in mining or construction sector, a slaughter houses or any other. “Order related to illegal slaughterhouses came in 2015,” said Singh, adding, “The former chief minister was busy making statements and jibes and he should be asked that if he was concerned about public, why didn’t he issue   then and what were his ministers and officials doing. Without issuing licence, they were making a fast buck to allow illegal business and now he is making fun of the present government.”
 
 Stating that the Yogi government was committed to putting things in order, he urged delegation of   owners to come and meet the government. “We will meet any delegation with an open mind and open heart,” he said.
