Emotions ran high at the   function for the outgoing batch of Symbiosis Centre for Management Studies, Noida, which was held on Wednesday.

  Around 150 students of the outgoing batch were given a fond send off by their juniors. It was difficult for the outgoing students to control their emotions and tears they were not able to accept that they will no longer be called students of the institute and they can’t come to the college where they created some of the best memories of their lifetime.
