HYDERABAD: The family of yesteryear film director 'Talibottu' Madhava Rao has approached the state government with a request to name an award after him during the the state   function to be held from Dasara this year.

What set the film apart was that the characters spoke in Telanga na dialect. `Chillara Devullu` was based on noted Telugu novelist and writer from Telangana, Dasarathi's novel set in the backdrop of the situation prevailing at that time Â­ suppression of peasants by landlords. The film received critical acclaim.
 
 What stuck to Madhava Rao's name was his first film `Talibottu' released in 1970.The script of the film was also penned by him. At a time when everyone in the Telugu film industry was practically from Andhra, Madhava Rao not only forayed into the territory but also made a mark for himself. His exploits in Telugu cinema also encouraged him to venture into directing two Hindi films `Suraj Aur Chanda' and `Baharonki Mazil'. As director Madhava Rao showed his talent through the films `Kanna Thalli', made in 1972 and also `Parijatham' in 1980. Madhava Rao also worked as assistant director and associate director for 10 years before his directorial venture. Madhava Rao had worked under well-known director Adurthi Subba Rao for the films `Manchi Manasulu', `Moogamanasulu', `Tenemanasulu', `Kannemanasulu' and `Sudigundalu' in Telugu and also worked for Hindi films `Milan', `Man ki Meeth', `Doli' and `Darpan'.
