 Despite being a female-centric movie directed by  , Kidman said it's disappointing that female filmmakers are still in the minority.
 
 Speaking at a press conference to promote the movie at the Cannes Film Festival, she said, "Still only about four per cent of women directed the major motion pictures of 2016. That there says it all. I think that's an important thing to say and keep saying."
 
 "Luckily, we had Jane Campion and Sofia here. We as women have to support female directors, that's a given now. Everyone is saying it's so different now - but it isn't. Listen to the statistics."
