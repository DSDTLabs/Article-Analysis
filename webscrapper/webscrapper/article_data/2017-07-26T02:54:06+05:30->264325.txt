NEW DELHI: With a court remanding them in 10 days of   custody, the seven arrested   activists are set to be questioned on their Pakistani links in India and people who funded them over the years even as sources said more arrests could follow in the case which may include a senior separatist leader.

 The National Investigation Agency on Tuesday sought 18 day remand of the seven accused from a court here claiming that various documents and articles retrieved from them reveal their involvement in a criminal conspiracy against India.
 
 With the court granting a 10-day remand, Syed Ali Shah Geelani’s son-in-law Altaf Ahmad Shah ‘Funtoosh’ and six others — Ayas Akbar Khandey, Raja Mehrajuddin Kalwal, Peer Saifullah, Shahidul-Islam, Nayeem Khan and Farooq Ahmed Dar — will undergo sustained interrogation in NIA custody about the   masterminds based in India and across the border who actually direct them to run all operations in the valley.
 
 Special court of district and sessions judge Poonam A Bamba, while granting the remand said it would help the agency unearth the larger conspiracy of creating unrest, anti-India demonstrations and raising of funds to carry out illegal activities. “Considering the detailed reasons for custodial interrogation as given in the application and that accused persons may be taken to J&K /other places for the purpose of investigation, I am of the considered opinion that the ends of justice would be met by granting 10 days police custody remand to enable the NIA to unearth the complete conspiracy,” the court observed.
 
 The NIA, through its special prosecutor Surinder Singh, submitted in court that credible information shows that Hafiz Saeed, the Pakistan-based chief of the Jamaat-ud Dawa, the front of the banned Lashker-e-Taiba, and   including members/cadres of the Hurriyat Conference have been acting in connivance with active militants of proscribed terror outfits such as Hizbul Mujahideen, Dukhtarane Millat, etc., for raising funds for terror activities.
