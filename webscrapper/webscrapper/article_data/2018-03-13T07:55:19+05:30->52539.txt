AMRITSAR: The Kamboj community has finally been successful in getting permission to install the statue of Udham Singh, who had avenged the   massacre, exactly 78 years after he killed Michael Francis O’Dwyer, then lieutenant governor of Punjab, to avenge the killing of thousands of Indian freedom fighters at Jallianwala Bagh.

 The statue will be installed at Jallianwala Bagh on Tuesday. President of the youth wing of International Sarav Kamboj Samaj Joginderpal Singh told TOI on Monday that they were dismayed with successive governments for not giving due respect and honour to the martyrdom of Udham Singh, who was from the Kamboj community, and decided to begin an agitation to get his statue at Jallianwala Bagh. “Udham Singh’s martydom fills the Dyer, who had ordered firing on the unarmed gathering at Jallianwala Bagh that had left over a thousand people dead and several injured.
 
 
 
 
 Chief   (CKD)-run orphanage, where Udham Singh had arrived along with his brother   after death of their father in 1907, has preserved utensils, bed, trunk and other belongings used by him in its museum. CKD officiating president   told TOI that when he arrived in Amritsar his name was Sher Singh but after he took initiation and his name was changed to Udham Singh. 
 
 He added that the CKD had set up a ‘chhabeel’ at Jallianwala Bagh on April 13, 1919, where Udham Singh’s duty was to serve water. He saw the killings of freedom fighters by the British forces and collected their bodies later. Dhanraj said CKD had decided to develop the museum and also announced Rs 21,000 award for the author for writing a book on Udham Singh’s life and an annual award of Rs 21,000 and Rs 11,000 to the print and photo journalists, respectively, in the memory of the martyr.
