NEW DELHI: A day after a 75-year-old man, father of a gangster  , was gunned down outside his house in  , police on Monday have zeroed in on three gangs who could be involved in the  . 

 Mahal was trying to field his wife as a candidate for the upcoming municipal elections and had brought his family in public light. This, police suspect, could have made his family members vulnerable to attacks. Mahal’s father, Shri Kishan, was a former sarpanch in Mitraon who was helping Mahal in the election work.
 
 Police suspect the role of   Kapil Sangwan and Jyoti in the killing. Mahal and his associate Nafe had gunned down Sunil, Sangwan’s brother-in-law, in one of the earlier instance. This could have incited Sangwan to kill Kishan, police said.
 
 Police further said in the past few months they have seen a new trend in rivalry where the gangsters are targeting family members. 
 
 With elections in the neighbouring states around the corner, police expect a spurt in revenge killings.
 
 In fact, after Sunday’s incident, police have asked the police stations around southwest Delhi to be to be alert about such killings. 
 
 Police are now looking for a white Scorpio car, owned by Sangwan’s relative, which was used in the murder. 
 
 Sources said two of Sangwan’s gang members, Ankush and Boxer, have been detained for questioning.
