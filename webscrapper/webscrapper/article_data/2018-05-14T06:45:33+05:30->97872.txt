LUCKNOW: The much-hyped plan of   to allow only registered vendors to sell   products failed to kickoff in April. Not a single tobacco vendor was registered until April 30 deadline.

 
 Left red-faced, the corporation is now giving excuses. It attributes the delay to lack of planning, poor coordination and recent transfers of top officers of the corporation.
 
 In February this year, then municipal commissioner had made it mandatory for all tobacco vendors to obtain   from   or face penal action. He had set April 30 deadline.
 
 The city has more than 7,000 tobacco vendors and most of them violate the norms laid down under The Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade & Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution Act) 2003 â€“ COTPA.
 
 LMC has now asked its legal cell to frame guidelines to ensure implementation of COTPA rules in Lucknow. The legal cell officials said that guidelines would be issued in next 15 days.
 
 The guidelines (TOI has a copy of it) mandate that all tobacco vendors need to seek vending licence from LMC at annual fee of Rs 1,000. The fee would be renewable every year.
