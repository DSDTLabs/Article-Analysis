NEW DELHI: Heated arguments over the installation of BJP-led governments in Goa and Manipur saw   member   demand a discussion on subversion of democracy while minister of state for parliamentary affairs Mukhtar   hit back saying Singh’s partymen were looking for him in Goa.

 Initially, Naqvi struck an accommodating stance, saying he will convey the sentiments to leader of the House  , but soon became assertive, pointing to media reports on Goa Congress members being cut up with Singh. Congress leaders are looking for you, said Naqvi.
 
 Singh said he had, as suggested by the government, submitted a substantive motion on conduct of Goa and Manipur governors. Singh alleged that his motion was pending for two weeks because Jaitley was not finding time and that the Constitution has been violated in forming the governments.
 
 Naqvi countered him by saying that Congress did not stake claim to form the government in time and with adequate numbers and was now crying foul. He added that even Congress MLAs were asking where were they (Congress leaders) were and why didn’t they go to the governor to claim the government.
 
 Singh said the governors didn’t invite single largest party Congress to form the government despite having secured maximum seats. Singh said he was not asking to protect his interest, but that of democracy and the people of Goa and Manipur. He was supported by leader of opposition  .
 
 After the long argument, deputy chairman P J Kurien directed that Jaitley be told that substantive motion on the conduct of governors of Goa and Manipur is pending.
