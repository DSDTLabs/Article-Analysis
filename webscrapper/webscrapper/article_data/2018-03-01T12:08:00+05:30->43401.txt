PUNE: The   has ordered Mumbai-based realty firm   to hand over the possession of a flat in a housing project at   to its purchaser within two months. The commission also directed the firm to pay Rs2.25 lakh compensation and cost to the purchaser for causing mental agony due to the seven-year delay in possession. 
 
  
 Lawyer Dnyanaraj Sant had filed the complaint on behalf of   seeking directions to the realty firm to hand over possession of the flat after accepting the remainder of the amount towards the total consideration and also a compensation at the rate of Rs10,000 per month from March 31, 2011 when the flat was agreed to be delivered. 
  
 The bench, however, observed that the agreement did not carry any clause to the effect of paying such amounts in case of delayed possession, hence, the complainant was not entitled to Rs10,000, per month, compensation as demanded. 
  
 The bench though added, “As there is delay in completing the construction and possession of flat is not yet handed over even after payment of more than Rs25 lakh out of the Rs28.08 lakh consideration, the complainant must have suffered mental harassment and hence complainant is entitled for some amount on that account. We find that an amount of Rs2 lakh is sufficient on account of compensation on that count.” 
  
 The realty firm had taken a stance that the possession of flat was not delivered on account of the remainder sum of Rs2.84 lakh besides, the construction of the project was delayed for reasons beyond its control. It contended that there was no cause of action for filing the consumer complaint. 
  
 The bench observed, “Apart from the reasons mentioned in the written version, the fact remains that there is deficiency on the part of the realty firm in not handing over possession of flat within time as agreed. Hence, we find there is deficiency in service.”
