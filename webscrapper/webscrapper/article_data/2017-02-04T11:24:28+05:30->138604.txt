GHAZIABAD: A 30-year-old woman was allegedly raped by her neighbour in New Vikas Nagar in Loni a little after Thursday midnight. 

 The woman lives with her husband, a taxi driver who usually works at night, and her child. However, the woman has been incapable in providing the name of the accused, while he remains absconding.
 
 According to police, around 12.30 am on Friday, soon after the woman’s husband left for his night shift, a man who is said to be their neighbour and lives close to the house, forcefully entered the house while the woman was asleep. “The woman told us that she heard a sound coming from the main gate of the house and she thought it was a thief. However, when she woke up to see, the accused silenced her with his hand by attacking her from behind and raped her,” said O P Chaudhary, SHO of Loni police station.
 
 The woman’s husband came back home around 2.30 am and saw his wife crying and her clothes torn. The woman told her husband everything who then informed the police.
 
 “The woman’s statements have been recorded. Even though she seems to have seen the accused before, she does not know his name,” said Chaudhary.
 
 The woman has been taken for medical examination and the details of the reports are awaited. “It’s usually hard to determine   in married women, even though the medical reports will be reviewed,” said Chaudhary, adding, “We have started the investigation and are looking for the accused. We will also prepare his sketch after taking the victim’s version of his physical description into account. I will alert all the nearby chowkis (police posts).”
 
 An FIR under Section 375 (Rape) has been registered against an unknown person with Loni police station.
