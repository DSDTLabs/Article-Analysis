Taapsee is all set to come back to   with her next project ‘Anando Brahma’, but she seems to be rubbing Tollywood Director K Raghavendra Rao’s fans the wrong way. 

 Recently, a video was released online with the actress talking about her experiences with Bollywood and Tollywood. Speaking about her first film ‘Jhummandi Naadam’ with the veteran director and the film industry down South in general, she says, “In the South, they think I can only pull off glamorous roles. When they saw ‘Pink’ and '(Naam) Shabana’, they were like, oh, she can act.” 
 
 When the host of the online show brought up the South Indian film industry’s ‘fascination with navel’, she said, “If I knew about this in my research before I’d gone to the South I would’ve worked on my navel. I clearly didn’t. They didn’t even start with a scene. They started with a song itself.” She went on to say,”(The director who launched me) is known to show the sensuality of a woman by showing the midriff and throwing fruits and flowers on the midriff. My turn came, and maybe because I was not prepared as I told you, they threw a coconut at me! I don’t know what’s sensuous about a coconut hitting my midriff.”
 
 The actress then went on to laugh along with the host and the audience, a move many people seem to have taken offence to. Social media is now strife with fans calling out Taapsee for speaking her mind and sharing her opinion. Many comments call her ‘ungrateful’ for making fun of the industry and the director that launched her. Reports state that Taapsee had to resort to blocking those calling her out on Twitter.
