CHENNAI: The  , which starts on May 29, is likely to be   with the opposition parties sharpening their knives against the   government on various issues, mainly the killing of 13 people in the   at Tuticorin two days ago. 

 The session is mainly to get the assembly’s nod for grants from the   for various departments. The session starting with the debate on forest department will continue till July 9. Apart from weekends, the assembly will not meet between June 15 and June 24. The debate on home department will be for two days. 
 
 Even during the business advisory meeting on Thursday, the DMK and the Congress walked out seeking the resignation of chief minister K Palaniswami and DGP T K Rajendran on the issue of police firing at Tuticorin. Similarly, the parties are ready to raise the issue of gutka scam, with the Supreme Court giving its nod for a CBI probe. 
 
 “We are not against the assembly session. In fact, the DMK as well as other opposition parties want the session to be convened to raise several issues affecting people,” said DMK working president M K Stalin. 
 
 Analysts also say that the coming session will be an acid test for the government. “It is likely that in the middle of the session, the Madras high court may give its judgment on the disqualification of 18 MLAs by speaker P Dhanapal. Apart from this, from the start of the session itself, the government will be on the back foot on issues like police firing at Tuticorin,” said political analyst Tharasu Shyam. 
 
 “Never in the history of Tamil Nadu, the government has blocked internet in any district. Apart from people not being able to use their smartphones, even ATMs will not work if there is no internet. Thus, the situation in the state is not normal and the Centre is also watching all these developments,” he said.
