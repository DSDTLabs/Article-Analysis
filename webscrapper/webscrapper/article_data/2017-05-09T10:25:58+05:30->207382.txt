NEW DELHI: A day after a mentally challenged girl was found locked up in a flat in east Delhi, her father told TOI that he was informed by his divorced wife that his daughter had died of an electric shock.

 He said that even then, nobody from his estranged wife’s family spoke to him. They ignored his calls even after his repeated attempts of getting in touch with her other daughter.
 
 “Both my daughters were very close to me, until my wife and I separated. Back then, she promised that I would be allowed to meet my daughters at least once a month, but it never happened. I can count the number of times I have spoken to my daughters after our divorce. 
 
 “The last time I got a chance to speak to my daughters was when I told my wife that I would come to her place if she didn’t allow me to talk to my children. My younger daughter told me that she hated me and never wanted to talk to me again,” said the girl’s father.
 
 The father said that if he is given custody of his daughters now, he would keep them with him. “I am ready to keep my daughter with me even though I don’t have a place to live as I stay at my shop. I had a flourishing business until my wife took everything away from me. I am trying to collect money to get a house on rent,” he added.
 
 Neighbours said that the wife would often scream at her younger daughter. However, on being questioned, the woman said that she used to argue over the phone with someone else. “There were days when she would scream at someone on the phone before entering the building, so that when she came out, nobody could questions her,” said Sushil Sarkar, a neighbour.
 
 Police said the girl was being treated at Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital and a number of people have come forward to help her. “Over 50 families have come forward,” said a senior police officer.
