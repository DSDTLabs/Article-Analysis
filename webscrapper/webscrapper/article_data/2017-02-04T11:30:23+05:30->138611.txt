GUWAHATI:   Pallab Lochan Das on Friday informed the house that the department will consider probing allegations of   to around 10 lakh   across the state over the past several years. The minister was replying to a   by MLA Terash Gowalla. 

 Taking part in the discussion, AGP legislator Ramendra Narayan Kalita alleged that largescale corruption in distribution of the rice took place in the previous government's tenure.
 
 "As per records, there are nine lakh tea garden workers in Assam. But rice was distributed among 19 lakh beneficiaries," said Kalita. He added, "There should be an inquiry by a retired judge or CBI into the the matter."
 
 Parliamentary affairs minister Chandra Mohan Patowary said he will take up the issue with the chief minister and will inform the house accordingly. Speaker Hitendra Nath Goswami said, "This is a very serious matter. I request the minister to do something. I reserve my ruling today and will announce it later."
 
 Earlier, the minister informed the house that subsidised rice meant for APL categories was diverted to the owners of tea gardens for distribution among workers for Rs 0.50 per kg.
 
 "After the National Food Security Act was implemented, this APL rice was stopped by the Centre. It was done during Congress's tenure and not by BJP. But a propaganda is being carried out that BJP has stopped rice distribution to poor labourers," he added.
 
 Das alleged that the owners of tea gardens are trying to create a law and order disturbance and if anything like this takes place, strict action should be initiated against them. "Tea gardens are violating various provisions of the Plantation Labour Act. It is very sad that not a single tea garden is giving minimum wages to workers. Also, the wages in Brahmaputra and Barak valleys are different. There are many such anomalies," the minister said.
