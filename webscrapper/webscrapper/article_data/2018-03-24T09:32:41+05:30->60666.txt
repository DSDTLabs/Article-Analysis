SALEM: The condition of   temple elephant   has further deteriorated with maggots coming out of its foreleg. This is despite a team of veterinary doctors from Salem and Coimbatore monitoring the elephant round-the-clock. 

 One of its forelegs had developed lameness years ago. "Owing to this, the animal has been giving more stress to the other foreleg, which has now developed wounds," said veterinary doctors. 
 
 Meanwhile, Salem-based activist A   urged forest and Hindu Religious and   department officials to take steps to bring experts from other states such as Karnataka or   to treat the elephant.
