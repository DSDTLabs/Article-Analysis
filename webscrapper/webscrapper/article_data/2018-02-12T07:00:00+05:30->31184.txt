Ludhiana: Northern Railways will soon start its service of providing unreserved tickets to rail commuters through a mobile app, with an aim of promoting the railway ministry initiative of a paperless ticketing system across the zone. A notification on starting this paperless initiative has been issued at the Ferozepur Division (under which Ludhiana railway station falls).

 Ferozepur Division’s senior divisional commercial manager Monu Luthra said preparations to start the central ministry initiative in the division had begun. “Earlier, the authorities had got only a verbal instruction, but this time, we have got a notification containing some technical points regarding setting up ticket vending machines, through which a passenger is able to get a hard copy of the ticket just after booking an online unreserved ticket through a mobile app.”
 
 “Southern Railways have already started this project in their railway stations, and the same will be implemented in our division in the forthcoming days for the convenience of passengers travelling on unreserved tickets,” said Luthra. Meanwhile, sources claimed that a specific time period of two to three months had been given to local division officials to make proper preparations and set up all machines that can issue a hard copy of the unreserved booked ticket through a mobile app. They have also been asked to give a proper database of trains passing through the division, so that passengers can take advantage of the initiative without facing any technical issue.
 
 One of the passengers, Gurjot Singh, claimed: “Railways have made great improvements in their ticket generating system, but the problem of getting an unreserved ticket from the station counter after standing for two to three hours still remains the same. If they start an unreserved ticket booking facility through a mobile app, then it would prove to be a great relief to passengers travelling on unreserved tickets.”
