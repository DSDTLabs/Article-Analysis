Vadodara: Following extensive damage to roads this monsoon, Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has decided to revamp the annual rate contracts that it floated for laying roads in the city. It is for the first time that this is being done for such contracts for laying roads in the city.

 According to officials, the contracts for roads at zonal level in VMC were given to three different agencies for three different tasks involved in laying a road. Different agencies used to perform the tasks of grouting, asphalt carpeting and seal coating.
 
 VMC commissioner Vinod Rao said due to different agencies working on the same road there was lack of coordination at times. Also, it became difficult to fix responsibility in case a road was damaged. After the damage to roads in the city this monsoon, VMC decided to float an integrated-tender by combining all three works and invited single agency for the same. Standing committee of the civic body gave its nod to the tenders for all the zones based on the new system last week.
 
 The VMC has also increased the deficit liability period of the roads for contractors from three years to five years. Rao said this would ensure that fly-by-night contractors did not take up works.
 
 Rao added that a committee that included experts from outside the VMC too had prepared its report. Once the suggestions of the committee are approved, the VMC will go public with them and look at implementing them.
