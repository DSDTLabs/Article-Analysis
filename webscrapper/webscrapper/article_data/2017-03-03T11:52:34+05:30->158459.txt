Looking to take on Japanese rivals in Pakistan,   recently entered into an agreement with Nishat Group - a local textile firm - to assemble small cars in the country. The Pakistani company, it is learnt, also wants the Koreans to bring in electric and hybrid vehicles.

 Pakistani car market is currently dominated by the likes of  ,   and Suzuki. The three Japanese companies assemble cars in partnership with local partners. 
 
 Interestingly, this is not the first time   has entered the country. Hyundai and South Korea's   used to assemble cars here till 2004 but withdrew after their local partner Dewan Farooque Motors Limited went bust.
 
 Now, the company is back for a second innings.
 
 "The South Korean carmaker wants to first start the assembly of small cars that could compete with the existing (Japanese) assemblers already operating in this market," Nishat Groupâ€™s chairman Mian Mansha told Pakistan's Dawn. "We are discussing with them (and) trying to convince them to also bring electric and hybrid cars."
 
 While Nishat Group is reportedly investing $120 million in the project, there is no word on how much money Hyundai plans to pump in. 
 
 It is also interesting to note that in India, Hyundai Motors does not yet have production-line electric or hybrid vehicles despite the country being one of its biggest markets. The auto industry here is booming even as its counterpart in Pakistan has hopes pinned on a revival.
 
 In 2014-15 fiscal, India sold two million passenger vehicles while only 180,000 were sold in Pakistan. With the world eying cleaner and greener modes of transportation, it would be interesting to see if global auto giants show intent in bringing these to the sub-continent.
