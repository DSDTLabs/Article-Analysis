CHENNAI:   authorities have caught nearly 60 students for creating fake free bus passes in and around Chennai. 

 As a part of the ongoing drive to reduce misuse of concession passes, officials started checking genuineness of passes issued to students.
 
 "We found students made photocopies of original passes and superimposed personal and other details on the duplicate ones," said an MTC official who was a part of the team.
 
 Most of the violators were students in government arts and science colleges and some   were also involved, the official added. Parents of all the 60 students were informed and they were let off with a warning.
 
 This move comes against the backdrop of MTC temporarily scrapping daily concession passes due to misuse thereby causing losses worth several lakhsof rupees. 
 
 The MTC issued a circular to all the depots on Monday instructing conductors to allow only those who will be taking up their board exams next month along routes specified on their passes. 
 
 The corporation has requested cooperation from its staff in to ensure that these students reach their examination centres on time. Ticket checking inspectors have also been told not to delay operation of buses when students are on their way to the  . 
 
 "Nearly 2,770 crore has been spent towards this concessional subsidy in between 2011 and 2017 and nearly 10 % of this can be reduced if action was taken against similar violations in other transport corporations," said a   official. tnn
