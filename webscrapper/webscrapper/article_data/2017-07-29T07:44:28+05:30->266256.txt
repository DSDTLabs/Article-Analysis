PUNE: Samples of drinking   in the city have passed all the parameters in the tests conducted by   ( ), the   states. 

 The test results have shown “nil” presence of elements such as lead, cadmium and zinc which can damage health. 
 
 “The key factors, which can cause problems to the water quality, are not present. The performance in the   test is way better than the standards set,” Mangesh Dighe, environment officer of the PMC, said.
 
 “The accurate monitoring and continuous testing and the purification plants help us maintain the quality,” V G Kulkarni, head of PMC’s water department, said. The tests are carried out as per WHO standards. The city gets water from the four reservoirs of Khadakwasla, Temghar, Varasgaon and Panshet dams. The civic budget has proposed to get water from   river in the Konkan region for the city.
 
 Almost 40% of the drinking water is lost to leakage, pilferage and wastage through uncontrolled stand posts. Water supply lines are rusted and there is no system to calculate the water usage. Water   have supported the PMC’s claims. They said the absence of chemical and polluting industries in Pune’s vicinity keep the water clean. “External factors such as chemicals, which may pollute water, are hardly present. The situation is different in PCMC, which is surrounded by industries,” Suresh Shirke, chairman of  , said.
 
 Some local factors like drainage leaks or storm water can add impurities to potable water. It happens at a few places in Pune, but it can be treated.
