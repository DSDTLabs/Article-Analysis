BHUBANESWAR: Protesters demanded   against those who had administered the vaccine and a Rs 20 lakh compensation to the family of the deceased boy.

  When contacted,   chief district medical officer Dr   said the exact cause of the death can only be known after reports from the postmorten of the body arrive. "We had administrated MR vaccines to all the students of the school on February 3. Prima facie, there does not seem to be a connection between the vaccination and the death of the boy. 
 
 We sent the body to the district government hospital at Jagatsinghpur for autopsy on Saturday," Pradhan said. 
 
 Chief minister Naveen Patnaik had launched the statewide   campaign on January 29.
