The recent spate of crime against women in the city, including the murders of techie Rasila Raju and Antara Das, had put the city police on high alert. However, the Buddy Cop project 
 initiated by the department seems to be sorting these issues to a large extent.
 
 Since March 8, when the project was put into practice, the police have managed to crack three cases of harassment and stalking, primarily in IT campuses. Currently focussing on IT sector, the plan is to include colleges and other areas under the project soon
 
 
 
 Under the project, a cop is assigned and is in constant touch with a group of 50 women through WhatsApp. In case of an emergency, members can drop a message and seek help from the cops, even if they see something wrong happening to others.
  
  
  
 Currently, 25 such WhatsApp groups are functional and the number is on the rise. Three major cases have been solved and the accused arrested, while a number of minor issues were resolved on the spot.
  
 While we have covered most IT companies, the work to expand this project is going on. We want the cityâ€™s women to feel safe and are creating awareness about the same. Soon enough, colleges too will have a similar system in place.
 
 
  A housekeeping staff was clicking pictures in the ladies washroom. I raised an alarm and put up a message on the buddy cop group. Within six minutes of my complaint, the police were in the campus and took the suspect into custody.
 
  
 We have trained 20 cops from each police station in responding and interacting with the victims. They will further train others. We are also developing an app which gives out a SOS message and the location of the person in need of help. This will help us trace crimes happening on the outskirts of the city too.
