PANAJI: Even as the last batch of mancurad mangoes are being harvested and newer varieties from neighbouring states are yet to hit the local market,   have drastically dropped, especially for the popular mancurad variety.

 A dozen of this variety which sold at Rs 700 until last month is now going at throwaway prices, with some as less as Rs 120 per dozen.
 
 Fruit vendor   said, “This year, there has been an abundance in the mancurad crop. While this made things favourable for farmers, it hasn’t been as easy for businessmen. It has been quite difficult to push daily sales.”
 
 Wide availability and over-consumption have also been attributed as reasons for people’s disinterest in purchasing the fruit. “Besides the regular fruit vendors in the market, hawkers have also been selling mangoes at affordable prices. There are, in fact, more sellers and less buyers. Over time, the consumer is bound to grow weary of eating the same fruit every day,” said another vendor.
 
 Many of them are, thus, forced to offer the king of fruits at a humble price.
 
 Fruit seller   said, “There are not many takers for mangoes this week, forcing us to reduce rates. Despite this, however, not many people are purchasing mangoes. Instead they are opting for cooler fruits like watermelon and pineapple.”
