NEW DELHI: After a reportedly stormy phone call with Australian Prime Minister  , US President   turned to Twitter to vent his ire.

 "Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from  . Why? I will study this dumb deal!" Trump tweeted on Thursday.
 
 
 
 Earlier in the day, media reports emerged stating that during a telephonic conversation with Turnbull, Trump had criticized a bilateral agreement to accept predominantly Muslim refugees from Australia. 
 
 The reports claimed that Trump called the   accord as "the worst deal ever" and accused the Australian Prime Minister of trying to export the "next Boston bombers" to the US, before hanging up on him.
 
 In the backdrop of these reports and the fact that Australia is a long-standing ally of the US, Trump's tweet has been greeted with incredulity and exasperation by the Twitterati.
 
  
  
  
 
 While some expressed disappointment with the US President's alleged behaviour...
 
  
  
 ... others were busy keeping score.
 
  
  
 Others extended apologies to Australia on behalf of their President.
  
  
 
 Reality Check!
 
  
  
 
 Trump also reportedly dubbed his talk with Turnbull "the worst by far" out of the conversations he's had with other leaders of state.
 
 Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull refused to give credence to these reports, but said that the US-Australia alliance continues to remain strong as ever.
