CHANDIGARH:   on Monday arrested sub-inspector ( )   for allegedly taking a bribe of Rs 5,000. A high drama was witnessed prior to the arrest. A middleman and a constable have also been arrested for their alleged involvement in the case. 

 As per the CBI officials, when complainant Munna Singh reached Singh’s room in the police station to give the bribe, a middleman named Ajay Kumar was already present there. 
 
 As the complainant entered, Singh switched off his mobile phone. After taking the money, he handed it to Ajay and asked him to leave. Munna was allowed to leave from the police station only after it had been a while since Ajay left. After coming out of the police station, Munna informed the CBI official that the bribe had been paid and handed over to the middleman by Singh. 
 
 CBI then left with Singh to reach Ajay’s residence but were mislead by the former who kept on giving them the wrong address as many as four times. When CBI finally got Ajay’s correct address, they raided his house and recovered the bribe money.
 
 Now, it had become difficult for the CBI to prove the involvement of the SI in the graft case. Following this, CBI collected the CCTV footage of the room in the police station where the bribe was handed over. Singh was caught in the camera. 
 
 CBI officials said that another constable named Sumit had also been in touch with Munna assuring him that Rs 4,000 to Rs 5,000 bribe would be sufficient to settle the latter’s matter. It was added that as soon as the constable came to know about the raid, he fled from the police station. But by night, Sumit was also arrested by the CBI. 
 
 CBI raided Singh’s residence in Sector 46 and recovered 1 lakh in cash. Meantime, CBI produced all the three accused—SI, constable and the middleman—in the special court of CBI that sent them in 14 -day judicial custody on Tuesday.
