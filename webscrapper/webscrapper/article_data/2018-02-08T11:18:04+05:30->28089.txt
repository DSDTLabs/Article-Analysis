PATNA: Farmers participating in a pre-budget consultative meeting convened by deputy CM   on Wednesday demanded additional subsidy on farm equipment and inclusion of tractor in the category of agriculture equipment.

 At the meeting, the farmers also insisted on freeing of ‘jalkars (water bodies)’ and ponds from encroachers and their digging to facilitate fishery activities. They said if the farmers were given training in modern agriculture practices, dairy, fishery and poultry activities, it would bring remarkable transformation in the agriculture sector. “We are ready to pay the required fee for getting the training,” they said, adding properly improved seeds should be provided to them for cultivation. 
 
 Modi, on his part, said the state government was concerned about the problems being faced by farmers. He added the government was committed to doubling the income of farmers for which separate power feeder exclusively for the agriculture sector would be created in the next two years.
 
 “The use of electricity for running pumps for irrigation purposes will drastically bring down the cost of production of the agriculture produces,”   said, adding among other measures, the promotion of fishery and dairy as well as agriculture forestry is high on the government agenda.
 
 He said July 10 would be celebrated as ‘Machchhuara Diwas (fishermen’s day)’ in the state, while a mega meet on the promotion of agriculture forestry will be held at   here February 13.
