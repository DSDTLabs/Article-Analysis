Ahmedabad: The second edition of Buddha International Conference will be inaugurated at Mahatma Mandir in Gandhinagar on Sunday. Led by the Sangha Kaya Foundation, the conference will work towards creating awareness about the Buddhist Heritage in Gujarat. 

 The five-day conference will see the presence of 100 foreign delegates including artists, scholars and state representatives, 200 buddhist monks and other spiritual gurus. Five collaborative performances by Indian and international artists will make it a grand event.
 
 “We are already in talks with the government of Gujarat to set up a Buddha Tourism Circuit in Gujarat as there are a number of destinations such as Dev ni Mori near Shyamalaji, Vadnagar, Khambalida caves near Rajkot and Uparkot caves in Junagadh, which are a valuable Buddhist heritage and could be developed as potential tourism destinations,” said Bhante Prashil Ratna, president, Sangha Kaya Foundation – Gujarat chapter.
 
 In fact, Dev ni Mori was excavated by the state archaeology department in 1953. Dating back to 3rd century AD, the site had a monastery and a stupa. The most important discovery from the site however was a 1,700 year old casket which has bodily relics of the Buddha.
 
 PM Narendra Modi had earlier, in 2015, announced plans to build a Buddha statue at Dev ni Mori near Shamlaji, 150km north of Ahmedabad.
 
 “This will unquestionably enhance the uncharted cultural and spiritual tourism in Gujarat by drawing the attention of pious pilgrims from South, South-East Asia and Far East. This again contributes in already established and rich culture of Gujarat, rather enhancing it and also adds on and creates new vertical of job opportunities for the unskilled and semi-skilled people of the state,” said Prashil Ratna.
