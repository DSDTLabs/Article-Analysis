PATNA: The special vigilance court of judge Madhukar Kumar on Tuesday rejected the bail petitions of former   Staff Selection Commission (BSSC) chairman Sudhir Kumar, his sister-in-law Manju Kumari and AVN School’s IT manager  , who are in jail in the BSSC paper leak case.
 
  1987 batch IAS official Sudhir, along with his brother  , head of the Geography department in Patna Women’s College, his wife Manju Kumari and nephew Ashish Kumar were arrested on February 24.
  
  Public prosecutors (PPs)   Singh and   said Sudhir did not maintain official secrecy about the details and location of the firm where the question papers for the four-phase intermediate level clerical grade examinations were printed.
  
  “The confessional statements of Sudhir’s nephew Ashish and Manju corroborate the fact that the now suspended IAS official had asked Ashish to go to   and collect handwritten questions and answers. Moreover, technical investigation of Ashish’s cellphones also proved he was in Hazaribagh on January 23,” the prosecution pleaded while opposing his bail petition.
  
  The PPs also said Sudhir misled the police by saying that Professor Dev Vrat Dasgupta of IIT Delhi prepared the questions, while investigation revealed that Dasgupta had joined the institute in November while the questions had been prepared in April last year.
  
  “Manju also told police that it was Sudhir who had assured her and other family members to provide questions and answer key. Manju admitted that she had asked her nephew Ranjan Kumar, also a candidate for the exams, to destroy all evidences after the matter was highlighted in media,” the prosecution said.
  
  Eleven more accused in the case have moved bail petitions to be heard on April 11.
  
  Meanwhile, the SIT (special investigation team) took Delhi-based BSSC evaluator Anand Preet Singh Barar on 48 hours police remand for interrogation on Tuesday.
