Actor-filmmaker   who was last seen on the big screen in the Pulkit Samrat starrer   in March, will now be sharing screen space with   and   in Prakash Kovelamudi’s directorial debut, 
 Mental Hai Kya'. In the film, Satish plays a cop investigating a case involving the protagonists and started shooting last week before heading to London for a short family holiday.

  
  
 
  had earlier reported (February 17) about Satish’s weight-loss struggle and how he finally succeeded in shedding 25 kg a while ago but his new film may be undoing all the hard work. “My diet has gone for a toss while shooting as I’m playing a character that eats junk food all through his investigation. So pizza, samosa, chhole bhature, namkeen, biscuits, bhel — nothing was off-limits on the sets. But I’m satisfied that the scenes will look very real on screen,” the actor explains, adding that shooting with Prakash and his team has been great. “I have worked with his father, Sir K Raghavendra Rao, as well, who is among the best directors in Tamil and Telegu cinema.”
 
 The film, which kicked off earlier this month, also features Amyra Dastur as Rajkummar’s girlfriend.
