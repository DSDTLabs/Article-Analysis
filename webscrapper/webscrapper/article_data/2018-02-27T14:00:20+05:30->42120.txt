MYSURU: Making a distinction between the kind of education offered by private and government schools, member of the Karnataka State Children Rights Protection Commission Y Mariswamy on Monday said that, while   produced students who went on to   the society, those produced by   were committed to serving the same.

 Mariswamy, who was at the brand ambassador meet of the alumni association for government schools, said, “Achievers in all sectors have studied in government schools. Privatisation of education has resulted in lakhs of private schools being set up across the country. But they cannot match the government schools in terms of their contribution to society.”
 
 Charging private schools with having commercialised education, Mariswamy said, “Education has been reduced to a commodity by private schools. People who can purchase education, and buy degrees send their children to private schools.”
 
 He further accused private schools of depicting government institutions in a poor light. “Only 10% of the private schools provide quality education,” Mariswamy added.
 
 Lashing out at the meager allocation made for education in the state budget, Mariswamy said, “In the last budget, a sum of Rs 18,000 crore was earmarked for education, of which Rs 14,000 crore was spent on salary and administration expenses. Although Rs 26,000 crore has been allocated in this year’s budget, even that won’t be enough since the number of students at government schools has swelled.”
 
 Endorsing Mariswamy’s observations, director of the Birds Institute Venkatesh said that most great leaders in India had studied at government institutions.
 
 On the other hand, former director of the PU department Shridhar Raje Urs said that the country was in need of a ‘thinking’ revolution. “The government system needs a complete overhaul. Government schools can be revived and improved only through a thinking revolution,” he said.
