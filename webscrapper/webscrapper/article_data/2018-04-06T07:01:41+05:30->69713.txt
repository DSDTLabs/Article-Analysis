MYSURU: Ending six days of speculation following a meeting with BJP national president  ,   of the Mysuru royal family on Thursday put to rest all rumours that the BJP is trying rope in her family members into Karnataka politics, by announcing that she has no interest in politics nor was she invited to join a party, or campaign in the election. 

 The family is for the people and ready to fight for the people’s causes, Pramoda told reporters at her residence on Thursday. 
 
 Speculation was rife about the Mysuru royal family members entering politics and possibly contesting the assembly polls in May, after Amit Shah’s hour-long meeting on March 30. His visit to Mysuru Palace and discussion with royal family members last Friday created curiosity over the BJP’s attempts to woo the royals to take on the ruling  . The BJP, which doesn’t have any assembly seat in Old Mysuru region, especially in Mysuru city, was looking to open its account here. 
 
 Though Shah, a day later, clarified it as a courtesy visit and that he can’t make public what he discussed with royal family, there was no official communiqué from the family on this score. 
 
 “There is nothing to disclose about the meeting with Shah. I have said earlier and am reiterating that I have total disinterest in politics,” Pramoda stated. 
 
 She said it will be the personal choice of Wadiyar scion Yaduveer, whether to jump into politics or not. “The question of giving him the green signal doesn’t arise. Yaduveer too has stated that he is not interested in politics,” Pramoda disclosed.
