PANAJI: A China-based company   has been awarded the work of four-laning the 17.4km-stretch from Karaswada to Bambolim (excluding the Mandovi bridge project). The company has entered into a joint venture with a Hyderabad firm for the project. 

 Another Hyderabad-based company   has bagged the contract for four-laning the 25km-stretch from Patradevi to Karaswada. While the Karaswada to Bambolim contract is worth Rs 850 crore, the Patradevi to Karaswada project has been awarded for Rs 630 crore.
 
 The four-laning project, funded by the central government, includes roads of two carriageways of two lane each on either side with a median dividing the two carriageways, footpaths on either sides, and a service lane that gives enough buffer so that vehicles entering the highway do not collide into the traffic on the highway.
 
 Work on the Karaswada to Bambolim stretch has already begun in areas where the land is already in the state’s possession. In case of the remaining stretch, the land acquisition process is presently on. “For the Karaswada to Bambolim four-laning, a plant for batch mixing of concrete has already been set up at Colvale,” an official said.
 
 The deadline set for both the sections is two years from the commencement of work.
 
 Under the multi-crore project, the national highway is slated to be widened from its current two-lane structure to four lanes. This will allow vehicles to cruise at a speed of 80 to 100 kmph. 
 
 The project will also bring in a new bridge at Colvale and multiple elevated corridors at Porvorim, the Green Park junction at Guirim and the Binani junction at Colvale. The   will also include vehicular underpasses all along the highway.
