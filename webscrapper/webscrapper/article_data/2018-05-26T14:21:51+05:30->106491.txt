COLVA: The traffic cell of Goa police has failed to act against goods carrier rickshaws and other private vehicles parking on the national highway-66 stretch at the   circle that witnesses a lot of movement during the 10-day annual Purumentachem Fest.

 In 2015, high court had restricted authorities to allow vendors to set up stalls on the pavements during the feast as it was causing traffic snarls. Sellers offering dry fish, chillies, furniture, earthen vessels besides other items attract hordes of people during the feast leading to chaos.
 
 A non-government organization,   had approached the high court against the inconvenience to commuters. Subsequently,   municipality decided to allow vendors to put up stalls at the South Goa Planning and Development Authority ground.
 
 At the busy stretch, traffic personnel are always conspicuous by their absence. Further ahead, however, they are seen issuing challans to erring riders.
 
 The official vehicle of Salcete deputy superintendent of police,   was also seen parked at the busy stretch on Wednesday. When questioned, his driver said the superior has gone to attend a meeting at the Collectorate building, almost 700m away from the parked vehicle. 
 
 Margao traffic cell official   admitted to snarls, and promised to crack the whip on violators.
