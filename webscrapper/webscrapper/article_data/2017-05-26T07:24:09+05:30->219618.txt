AHMEDABAD: Federation of   and   ( ) on Thursday announced that around 22,000 chemists across the state will keep their shops closed on May 30 to protest Centre’s proposal for mandatory registration of all allopathic medicine sales on an e-portal. The union government has proposed the same to prevent sale of substandard drugs as well as to curb the sale of anti-microbial resistance drugs.

 “We do not have sufficient IT infrastructure to implement this and for those operating in rural and semi-urban areas, doing so will not only be cumbersome but nearly impossible without necessary digital connectivity. Chemists don’t have technology-efficient staff members to implement this and thus the move is not practical,” said  , president, FGSCDA.
 
 Apart from that, chemists also plan to protest illegal sale of medicines by various e-commerce portals. The association claims that online sale of medicine, if allowed, will prove hazardous to public health as unscrupulous elements can route spurious drugs to customers via online platform.
