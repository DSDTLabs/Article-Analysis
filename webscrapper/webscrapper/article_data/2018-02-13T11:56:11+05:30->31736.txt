PATNA: Chief minister   on Monday sought to defend RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s remark that he could raise an   to defend the country’s borders within days. He also called the RSS an “organisation of citizens”.

 “If an organisation talks about its preparedness to protect the country’s borders, what comment should I give? If an organisation of citizens is talking about its preparedness for the protection of borders, what is the dispute about it?”   asked reporters after his weekly ‘Lok Samvad’ and added, however, that he was not fully aware of Bhagwat’s statement.
 
 The CM was responding to a newsman’s query on Bhagwat’s statement. Addressing an RSS volunteers’ meeting in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur on Sunday,   said: “Ours is not a military organisation, but we have military-like discipline. If the country requires and our Constitution permits, the RSS workers will be battle ready in three days.”
 
 The RSS chief also said the Army otherwise needs months to prepare itself for a battle.
