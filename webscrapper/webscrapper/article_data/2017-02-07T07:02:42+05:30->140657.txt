THANE: The Nationalist Congress Party ( ) has blamed the ruling   for the water woes faced by lakhs of Thaneites over the years alleging the party in power in the city had failed to take a timely call on construction of the Shai dam project in 2000.

 NCP party president Anand Paranjpe, while addressing the media on Monday, claimed the Shai dam project that was approved by the then Congress-NCP state government for Thane in the previous decade would have cost the civic body Rs 450 crore. However, the Sena that was ruling the civic body then reportedly delayed taking a decision escalating the dam cost to around Rs 1,500 crore now. 
 
 Taking potshots at Sena’s claim to build the dam now, the NCP questioned the delay that led to an immense cost escalation and the rationale behind purchasing water from external sources when the Sena could have easily constructed the Shai dam at a fraction of the present cost and ensured continued supply for 50 years. 
 
 “The Sena-ruled   has spent excess in purchase of potable water from various agencies at an inflated rate thus unnecessarily running up a huge bill of around Rs 3,500 crore. The civic body could have constructed three dams in the amount that it has spent on purchasing water over the last 25 years. This is sheer wastage of the taxpayer’s money,” said NCP MLA Jitendra Awhad. 
 
 The NCP also criticized the alleged dynasty rule in the Sena taking note of the notable section of tickets distributed within the family of sitting corporators for the 2017  . Over 25 seats have been allotted to the kin of sitting corporators and leaders leaving the common Sainik out of the fray, observed a senior leader of the party.
