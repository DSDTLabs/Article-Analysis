BENGALURU: The battle between   and   to win over  , who constitute about 24% of  's population, was intense and keenly watched. BJP would be the happier party with the results.

 
 Of the seats reserved for scheduled castes (SCs), BJP won 16, Congress 12 and JD(S) 5. In the scheduled tribe (ST) seats, BJP had a tally of eight, Congress 6 and JD(S) 1. There were a total of 36 seats reserved for SCs and 15 for STs. Results for some seats were yet to be declared at the time of writing.
 
 SCs in Karnataka are broadly divided into two subsets, the Holeyas and the Madigas. The result suggests the Madigas have deserted Congress, largely because they feel the Holeyas have cornered benefits in jobs and education.
 
 "This is the reason why  , during the last cabinet reshuffle, chose to have a Dalit (A H Anjenaya) from the Madiga group as social welfare minister," a senior Congress leader said. "But the benefits did not accrue since many Madiga group candidates, including Anjenya, lost."
 
 The campaign also saw an intense battle between Congress and JD(S), with Nowhera Shaik's Mahila Empowerment Party as another player, to win the Muslim vote that makes up about 12% of the electorate. The Congress appears to have retained its vote base except in JD(S)-dominated constituencies like Ramanagara and Channapatna. But this played into BJP's hands since the Muslim vote was divided between its two rival parties.
