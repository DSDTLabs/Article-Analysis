CHENNAI:   knows all about overseas Test defeats. After all, it was his team that had the dubious 0-8 record over two series in England and Australia in 2011-12. But the former captain feels that the current 0-2 drubbing in South Africa is not the end of the world for  's boys because there are a "lot of positives" despite the losses.

 
 
 
 
 
 The fact that the bowlers have taken 20 wickets in both the Tests is a step in the right direction, feels Dhoni. "We have to look at the positives. To win a Test, we need 20 wickets. If you can't take 20 wickets, you can never win a Test, irrespective of whether you are playing at home or away. We have taken 20 wickets (in both Tests in SA)," Dhoni, who is back as the   skipper, said at a promotional event on Friday.
 
 
 
 When Dhoni was the captain, the bowlers often failed to take 20 wickets despite being in good positions, a case in point being the second Test against New Zealand in Wellington in 2014. "If you can't take 20 wickets, what's the next thing? You try to force a draw. How can you draw a Test? It is by conceding less and by scoring more runs. But the fact that we are taking 20 wickets means we are always in a position to win a Test," said the 36-year-old.
 
 The former skipper feels now it's up to the batsmen to back the bowlers up and things will fall into place. "Once you start scoring runs, you are there," he added.
 
 He cited examples from his own career to add that the "ups and downs" on foreign soil is part of a cricketer's learning curve. "When I was part of the Indian (Test) team I have seen the ups and downs. When we didn't perform well on tours, you have to know the reasons why things are not going well. If you know that, you can actually address the problem. But at the same time you have to accept the reasons as well," he added.
