VADODARA:The sessions court on Wednesday rejected the bail applications of  , former sarpanch of Shanor village and Manhar Vankar, a cluster coordinator, who were booked with 11 others for siphoning off Rs 52.95 lakh in construction of toilets.

 Vasava and Vankar had filed   on March 28. 
 
 The police opposed their pleas stating that they had siphoned off money by showing old toilet blocks as new ones. 
 
 Police told the court that the accused need to be interrogated in custody to know about their bank details.
 
 Cops also said that the accused could also destroy evidence if let out on bail.
 
 Additional district judge A L Vyas rejected their applications on Tuesday after several hearings.
 
 Police have so far arrested only three accused in the case â€“ Gajendrasinh Vajir, a former sarpanch,   and Raju Parmar, both cluster coordinators.
 
 Before his arrest, Patel too had filed for anticipatory bail last month but it was rejected. 
 
 Irregularities in construction of the 265 toilet blocks in Dabhoi taluka had surfaced after site inspection was done by a team of district authorities. The district development officer Sourabh Pardhi had called for departmental inquiry against all accused after which four FIRs were registered at Chanod and Dabhoi police stations.
