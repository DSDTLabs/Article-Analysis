They say history repeats itself and this saying was proved right on   Love School Season 2.
 
  A Delhi based couple,   and   had participated in MTV   to mend their relationship. However, the tasks and tips in the school of love were not of much help to Jagnoor and Monica and the couple parted ways in the show. What’s interesting is that Jagnoor who had participated in Love School Season 1 with his then girlfriend, Manisha had broken up on the show due to some misunderstanding when a fellow contestant raised questions on Jagnoor’s sexual orientation and allegedly called him ‘gay’.
  
  Soon after Love School Season 1, Jagnoor got into a relationship with Monica and participated in the second season of MTV Love School.
  
  
 
  
  Recently, Karan and Anusha got to know that Jagnoor has been lying to his girlfriend about being in love with her which led to a resurfacing of the conversation from the last season and questions about his sexual orientation cropped up. This really upset the love professors and they brought up the sensitive topic during the judgment night.
  
  Monica did admit that Jagnoor and her physical intimacy has not been as good as other couples because Jagnoor never takes any initiative. Looking at Monica breaking down and pleading Jagnoor to be honest, Karan urged Jagnoor, “Be honest to Monica. Do not ruin her life and that’s all we want.”
  
  Commenting on the situation, Anusha said, “Jagnoor your life, your choice, your decisions, I respect it and I think for anybody out there that’s watching this, whatever you preferences, it’s yours, it’s not incorrect. I hope and pray that everybody has the right to choose whatever or whoever they want to fall in love with and live freely and happily.”
  
  After being encouraged by the love professors to follow her heart, Monica finally decided to part ways with Jagnoor for her own good.
