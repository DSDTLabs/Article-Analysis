Nothing says love like a bouquet of long-stemmed  . And around Valentine’s Day, they become an irreplaceable symbol of love. The day marks the annual high point of red rose sales and traders at the   tell us that from February 12 to February 14, Delhi will have spent Rs 5-6 crore on these flowers. This is not taking into account the sale of roses of other colours. While on any other day, a red rose in the retail market can cost you about Rs 20, the prices see a tenfold surge around February 14. But in dilwalon ki Dilli, nobody shys away from spending from Rs 200 to even Rs 2,100 (yes, you read that right!) for a single red rose to celebrate love.

 We visited the Ghazipur phool mandi yesterday, and found the market packed with flowers of every colour imaginable. The traders told us that like every year, they are expecting the entire stock to be sold out. 
 
  Ache Lal, a wholesaler in the market, tells us that the sale of red roses starts to surge from February 12. "Saal ke baaki din, log gende ke phool zyada khareedte hain. Par iss time log roses hi lete hain. Humne do din mein 1,000 bundle beche hain red roses ke. Each bundle costs Rs 180-220, so that’s Rs 2 lakh worth of sales for me."
 
  Anand Singh, another wholesaler from the market, adds, "The demand for red roses doubles from February 12. We earn approximately Rs 4 lakh in these three days. Yahi toh time hota hai couples ke liye, aur hamara bhi fayda hota hai. Humne sirf aaj hi 1,000-1,500 red rose ke bundles beche hain."
 
  Narendra Talvar, a florist in the mandi, says, "Humare liye toh Rose Day Valentine’s Day hi hota hai. Even those who buy expensive gifts on this day, don’t give the gift without a red rose." There are about 50-odd vendors in the mandi who deal only in roses, supplying ‘love’ to not just NCR, but to neighbouring states too.

 During the Valentine’s week, each vendor in the mandi sells around 1,500-2000 bundles of red roses each day. According to their estimate, red roses worth Rs 1.5-2 crore are sold each day in the mandi from Feb 12 to Feb 14. The vendors reach the market at 3 am and stay till 11 am. 
 
  Sher Singh Saini, a florist who has been in the business for 30 years, says, "There are different prices for red rose bundles also – starting from Rs 150 and going to Rs 300-400. During this time, an average red rose costs Rs 8 in the mandi and is sold in the retail market for about Rs 200. On regular days, the red rose bundles that we are selling for Rs 150 now, cost only Rs 100."
 
  Amit Mandal, a wholesaler in the mandi, says, "While we sell around 500 bundles on regular days, around V-Day, we well 1,000 bundles a day. If the demand is more, we also end up selling 2,000 bundles. Demand badhti hai toh hum bhi apne rates badha dete hain."

 Vendors tell us that on Valentine’s Day, people don’t mind shelling even Rs 200-300 on a rose. 
 
  Ram Kumar, without disclosing how much he earns, tells us, "Florists from all over Delhi visit this market. Even event management companies and restaurants buy flowers from us. Poori market mein, sabki sales mila ke, Rs 1.5 crore tak ki sale ho jati hai on February 14."
 
  Vivek Dhingra, a florist, says, "It’s unbelievable how much people are ready to spend for a rose on Valentine’s Day. People don’t even hesitate to buy special roses worth Rs 2,100. I have sold a special variety of rose worth Rs 2,100 per piece on V-Day."
 
  And while you might think that’s a lot of red roses being sold, the vendors are not that happy with the sales! They say that the business should have been double, and that demonetisation has hit their business this year.
