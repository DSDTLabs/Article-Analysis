SURAT: People had no respite from hot winds and scorching   with the temperature rising to 36.8 degrees Celsius in the city on Monday. South westerly winds and 60 per cent humidity made life unbearable for people.

 
 GVK EMRI 108 emergency services alone reported 45 cases of heat-related illness in the city.
 
  and Climate Resilience Centre (UHCRC) director   told TOI, “Temperature is not that high, but because of humidity it seems so. There are a number of cases of heat-related illness. The reason is a person’s body is yet to get acclimatized to this condition. People with high blood pressure and sugar problem are falling unconscious because of improper hydration.” 
 
 Surat reported 12 cases of abdominal pain, 12 of unconsciousness, six of vomiting, two of high blood pressure, three of chest pain, four of fainting and six of just falling due to weakness, sources in GVK EMRI 108 emergency services said.
