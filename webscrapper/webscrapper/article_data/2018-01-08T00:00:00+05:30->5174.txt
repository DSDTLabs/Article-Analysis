The outpouring of support that the team of the upcoming Kannada film,   (HPN), has received in the recent past from different quarters across the country has been nothing short of phenomenal. So much so that lead actor   is quite literally humbled. “Rana (Daggubati) was among the first to tweet his best wishes to the team after we released the teaser of the film, which was quickly followed by people like music composer Anirudh Ravichander, actresses Varalaxmi Sarath Kumar, Rakul Preet Singh and  ,   and, of course, Indian cricket captain,   among many others. More recently,  , Nivin Pauly, Ali Fazal, Richa Chaddha and Dino Morea also wrote about our film online. I am very grateful to each and every one who has spoken about HPN and supported us. These are very big names and, honestly, they don’t have to go out of their way and back the film or me. But they have and that means a lot to us. It’s my first film and it is incredible that we have got this kind of support,” says Danish.
