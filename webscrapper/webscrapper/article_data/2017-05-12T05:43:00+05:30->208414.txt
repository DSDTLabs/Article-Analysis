MUMBAI: Work on the Rs 15,000 crore   is likely to speed up soon as the the Union ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) has given the final approval for the ambitious project along the western seafront to connect   and  . 

 On Thursday, chief minister   tweeted about the approval and thanked Union minister of state for environment Anil Dave for it. The work is expected to start around November once the tender process is over. The notification about the clearance will be issued soon, said an official. 
 
 An official from the chief minister office said that during a recent visit to Delhi, Fadnavis met Dave regarding pending projects in the state. 
 
 The project has been delayed for years as MoEF had sent the proposal back to the state environment body pointing out several deficiencies in the project, which requires reclamation of land and removal of mangroves. The eight-lane road will be partly landfilled, having bridges and tunnels (near Marine Lines), partly elevated and partly on reclaimed land, with sea wall along its route. The BMC will build the Marine Drive to Bandra stretch, while the second phase (Bandra-end of sea link to Kandivli) is likely to be built by MSRDC.
 
 The project was proposed during the Congress-NCP rule in the state. In 2014, when BJP came to power at the centre and the state, the project was tweaked and fast-tracked. In the BMC elections earlier this year, the Shiv Sena manifesto promised to get all permission for the project.
