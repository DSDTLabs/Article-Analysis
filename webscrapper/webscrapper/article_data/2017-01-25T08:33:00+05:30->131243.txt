MUMBAI: Starting April, all examinations conducted by the   will be assessed online, like it is currently done for engineering papers. Principals have raised doubts over this digital move’s implementation on the ground though, citing the volume of answer sheets to be corrected.

 Every semester, the university conducts 402 examinations in various faculties such as arts, science, commerce, management and law. Officials say over 19.5 lakh answer sheets are evaluated every semester.
 
 On Tuesday,   Sanjay Deshmukh said, “Answer sheets of University examinations for all courses will be scanned and examiners will be given a password, which will allow them to access the papers and evaluate them on the screen itself.” 
 
 Starting 2013, the university began online assessment for four semesters of engineering exams that it conducts. This involves scanning around two lakh answer sheets per semester. 
 
 The university, though, hopes the process will ensure better security during evaluation. “Digital evaluation means lower human interference. Once papers are scanned, there will be no physical copies piled next to examiners. Papers will be sealed as soon as they are corrected. This would mean fewer cases of malpractice, and increased efficiency and transparency. Results could be announced in 15-20 days,” said Deshmukh.
 
 Deshmukh said the infrastructure is already in place. “A six-storey building is being constructed for the exam house. There would be centrally AC halls with computers and scanners which examiners can work out of. The infrastructure will be ready by April. What will need to change is the mindset of the evaluators.” Orientation sessions and workshops will be conducted for the examiners ahead of the evaluation.
