Vijayawada: The decision of the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation ( ) to increase the lease of Karmala Bhavans by 33% has come in for sharp criticism from denizens across the city. 

 The rent of the Karmala Bhavans will increase by 40% with the recent decision taken by the VMC’s standing committee.
 
 VMC had constructed Karmala Bhavans to facilitate citizens who are residing in rented houses across the city to organise death ceremonies and 10th days rituals of the deceased. 
 
 However, the   wing has failed to maintain them properly and so leased them to private agencies.
 
 These agencies are collecting huge amounts in the name of rents and maintenance of these bhavans and now. VMC’s standing committee has decided to extend the lease of Karmala Bhavans at Ayodhya Nagar, Satyanarayana Puram by increasing the lease amount by 33% which is putting additional burden on denizens.
 
 “Rentals of Karmala Bhavan increased drastically in recent times and we have spent Rs 10,000 last month to pay for packages offered by the leaseholder at Durgapuram Karmala Bhavan,” said K Rama Govinda Rao, a private employee. 
 
 “Maintenance of these bhavans is still very poor, but agencies continue to collect exorbitant rents,” Rama Govinda Rao added.
 
 “Karmala Bhavans which are meant to provide a place for denizens to perform traditional rituals at afffordable prices has now become costly due to the greed of contractors. VMC which rented these estates for Rs 300 to Rs 700 per day has now increased to Rs 3,500 to Rs 4,000 based on their location with the entry of private agencies,” said Communist Party of India (Marxist), Capital Region organizing secretary, Ch Babu Rao.
 
 Agencies which leased these bhavans are insisting denizens to rent utensils and tents prescribed by them at double cost and still VMC is continuing the leases for the sake of earning money, he alleged.
