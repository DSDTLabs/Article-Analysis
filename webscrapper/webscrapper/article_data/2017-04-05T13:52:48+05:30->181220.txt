PUNE: Both the engineering students found dead in an isolated place in Lonavla on Monday were hit hard and repeatedly with a heavy stone or a stone-like object that partially smashed their heads causing death, the   examination carried out at the state-run Sassoon General Hospital in Pune on Tuesday said. 

 Doctors said both bodies were in a partially decomposed state. They also confirmed that the preliminary examination showed that the girl was not sexually assaulted. Other confirmatory reports are awaited.
 
 “Since the bodies were partially decomposed, it means they had succumbed to injuries more than 24 hours ago and their bodies were lying unattended,” said a doctor.
 
 Another doctor said, “ Their heads were smashed with a stone or stone-like weapon. There were internal skull fractures which shows they were hit repeatedly till they died. Hence, the cause of death was grievous   in both the cases.”
 
 “We have preserved the viscera. Their reports are awaited. It will take another 15 to 30 days for the reports to confirm other details,” the doctor said.
