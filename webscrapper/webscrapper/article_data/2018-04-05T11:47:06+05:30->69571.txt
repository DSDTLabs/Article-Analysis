KOLKATA: On the seventh day of the ongoing building   to make way for the Airport-Garia project at  , the   authorities further razed down the major part of the OYO Building or white building that was till Wednesday morning standing on the left side of the Sector V bound flank of the box bridge.

 As the OYO building used to stood only a few feets of the box bridge, the lane moving just besides the building where pedestrians, ricksaw and autos move on, was closed for about two and half hours.
 
 Also, only about half portion of the Sector V bound flank of the box bridge was barricaded for about 30 minutes while the OYO building was being razed down to ensure that there was no accident or damage to any vehicle moving on the flank due to any accidental falling off of any large chuck of the building.
 
 Demolition of the buildings that have come up in the way of the New Garia- Airport Metro project is being at a slow pace to keep the traffic around the structures moving.
