PUDUCHERRY: The Union territory of   filing a contempt petition against the Union government ‘is not appropriate and is not legally permissible’, said lt governor   on Monday.

 Bedi made this observation while declining approval to the Congress government to file a contempt petition against the officers of Union government for not implementing the   order on constituting the   and   water regulatory authority.
 
 In a letter addressed to Union home minister Rajnath Singh, Bedi said she advised the Puducherry government not to file the contempt petition as it is not appropriate and not legally permissible in the light of provisions of Section 55 (b) of the Government of Union Territories’ Act, 1963.
 
 “All suits and proceedings in connection with the administration of the Union territory shall be instituted by or against the Government of India,” she quoted the Section while explaining her stance.
 
 She said Puducherry being a Union territory ‘is not an independent legal person’. “All suits and proceedings for and against the administration should be instituted only in the name of Union of India. Filing of a contempt petition by Union of India represented by the Puducherry government against the officers of the Union of India will not be appropriate. Therefore I have disagreed with the request of the chief minister in filing contempt petition,” she said.
 
 Narayanasamy, while resubmitting a proposal, claimed that ‘there is no impropriety in filing the contempt petition against the Union water resources ministry’ and sought Bedi’s approval. “I still hold that filing of a contempt petition by the Union territory administration against the   is appropriate neither administratively or legally,” she said.
 
 She referred the issue to the Union home ministry as there is a difference of opinion between the elected government and the administrator. She said as an interim measure she directed the Puducherry government to file an interlocutory petition.
