MUMBAI:   drugs have for quite some time been an ingredient on the party scene. But now, the authorities say, their consumption has reached alarming proportions. 

 "This year, 75 cases of party-drug use have been registered in Mumbai till now. Last year, 99 persons were arrested, from whom in all 49kg of MD (a recreational drug) were seized," said an officer from the anti-narcotics cell of the police.
 
 "Parents should be careful before sending children to parties. Education and resisting temptation is crucial," believes Dr  , mother of a 20-year-old college student.
 
 Party drugs are considerably different from hard drugs, and this distinction is embedded in Mumbai's youth culture: consuming hard drugs is frowned upon, but taking softer drugs is looked at with the same degree of caution as alcoholic drinks. "Drugs most frequently used in rave parties are LSA (acid), MDMA (ecstasy), and sometimes cocaine. MD is the most common as it is readily available and cheap," said   (name changed), an 18-year-old who frequently encounters drug consumption at rave parties.
 
 Many say drug consumption is mainly due to peer pressure. "Social-climbing often influences youngsters to consume drugs at parties as it's perceived as cool and daring," explained   (17). A few youngsters also said drugs can sometimes act as a gateway for stress-relief, an escape from reality for a few hours.
 
 Private parties are not necessarily synonymous with clubbing. While it is a well-established trend for youngsters to visit popular clubs or bars, drug-consumption is most frequent at house and rave parties. "No bouncers and no rules. At rave parties, people are free to do drugs," said a 23-year-old who frequently gets invited to house parties.
