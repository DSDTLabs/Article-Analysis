COIMBATORE: Municipal administration minister S P   on Sunday defended his party members in the clash with   cadres at  , saying it was   Dhinakaran’s men who attacked   workers.

 He also came down heavily on TTV for levelling charges against AIADMK leaders and cadres in connection with the incident.
 
 “I was not in the city when the clash erupted at Vadavalli. I inquired and came to know that AMMK cadres involved in the clash had hockey sticks and wooden logs with them. Police are taking appropriate action against the people involved in the clash. TTV always blames me, but I don’t have any connection with the clash. I won’t do such cheap politics,” Velumani said.
 
 Stating that AIADMK leaders have been working together, he said TTV had been targeting chief minister   and ministers Thangamani, Jayakumar and him. “TTV was sidelined by Amma and he was not a party member for the past 10 years. So, we asked TTV to keep away from the party. Hence, he is levelling charges against us,” Velumani added.
 
 Meanwhile, TTV is expected to meet the AMMK cadres who were lodged at the Coimbatore Central Prison. He has also plans to stage a massive protest against the government and Coimbatore rural police for foisting fake cases against his party cadres.
