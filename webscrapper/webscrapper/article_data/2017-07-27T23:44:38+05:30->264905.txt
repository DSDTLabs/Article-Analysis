Hyderabad: IT player   Inc on Thursday announced the expansion of its Hyderabad facility with the addition of another 400 seats to its existing capacity of close to 1000 people in the city. The company has a total headcount of around 1400 in India, including 400 at the Bengaluru facility.

 The new Hyderabad facility, which is spread over 58,000 sft and is located in the same building in Raheja Mindspace that houses Pega’s existing operations, was inaugurated by IT minister K Taraka Rama Rao.
 
 Commenting on the expansion, Mike Pyle, senior vice president, engineering and product development, Pegasystems said: “Pega India is an important part of the Pega family, and this expansion is proof of the great work that is executed out of this center, which positively impacts our global business.”
 
 He said the main factor that drew Pegasystems to Hyderabad in the first place was its availability of a huge engineering talent pool, which is why it has continued to expand here. Incidentally, while Pegasystems’ Bengaluru facility houses only around 400 people, its India operations account for nearly half its existing headcount of around 3,000. 
 
 “Pega India has come a long way since we started operations in 2008, and we are proud to expand our capacity to support the company’s global vision,” said Pegasystems India managing director Suman Reddy. The company said that the new floor design provides a collaborative space replete with standing desks and a fully equipped gym that focuses on workplace wellness, and promotes cross-functional engagement and team building. Pegasystems’ Hyderabad R&D centre, which opened in 2007, has been instrumental in delivering functions such as engineering services, solutions development, and customer support, including global cloud support.
