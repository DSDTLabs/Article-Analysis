NEW DELHI: The   on Monday asked BJP leader   to   why his plea for SIT probe into the mysterious death of   should be  , saying it would adjudicate the case on merit only after being satisfied on maintainability of the petition.

 After being snubbed by the Delhi high court, which had in October dismissed his PIL, calling it a “textbook example of a political interest litigation”, Swamy approached the Supreme Court challenging the HC order.
 
 Appearing before a bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Amitava Roy, Swamy contended that he had filed numerous PILs on various issues and his petition on Sunanda’s death should be heard on merit. He said the Delhi Police was not conducting a proper investigation in the case and FIR was filed almost one year after the death. 
 
 The bench, however, said it would decide the maintainability of his petition and adjourned the hearing by three weeks. ““Before going into the merits you have to first satisfy us on maintainability,” the bench said.
 
 Pushkar was found dead under mysterious circumstances in a suite of a five-star hotel in Delhi on the night of January 17, 2014.
 
 Swamy, in his plea before the high court, had alleged that police had “botched up” the probe and accused her husband and Congress leader Shashi Tharoor of “interfering” in the investigation. The HC had chided both Swamy and advocate Ishkaran Singh Bhandari — the second petitioner — for making “sweeping allegations” in the petition against Tharoor and the Delhi Police, without giving any basis for these accusations such as source or documents. 
 
 The court had also underlined that Swamy ought to have mentioned his political affiliation as well as that of Tharoor in his petition as these facts were important to the adjudication of the case. It had further pointed out that even though Swamy and Bhandari levelled allegations against several persons, they failed to make them a party to the PIL.
