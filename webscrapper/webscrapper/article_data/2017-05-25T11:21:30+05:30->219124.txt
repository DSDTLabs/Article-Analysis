VADODARA:   who did not report for work or were away from their centres in   were in for some   with the   conducting surprise checks. 

 The checks were carried out after the district development officer (DDO) himself found officials missing from a primary health centre (PHC) in Ghoghamba taluka.
 
 The issue of staff not being on duty came to light when Panchmahal DDO K H Zaveri visited the Kharod PHC on Tuesday. He saw that the staff there was missing. Zaveri has sought an explanation from the officials regarding the absence on duty.
 
 Following the incident, Zaveri asked 15 other officials to take a round of health centres in the district and report to him regarding the situation there. Some staffers were found missing again and even they would be asked to explain the absence.
 
 Zaveri said that the idea behind the drive was to ensure that most people got benefit of government services. “We want the people to know that doctors will be available between 8am to 12pm and from 4pm to 6pm at the health centres,” said Zaveri.
 
 Sources said that Zaveri had instructed officials soon after joining recently that they should ensure that they remain present on duty and attend citizens. It was only after this that the move to conduct surprise checks was taken up. Sources added that similar checks may be conducted in departments other than health too in the near future.
