Right since its inception, director David Dhawan’s 'Judwaa 2' has been grabbing headlines and piquing audiences’ curiosity around the content. Headlined by Varun Dhawan, who plays twin brothers Raja and Prem, the film, which releases on September 29, also stars Jacqueline Fernandez and Taapsee Pannu. The trailer of the rebooted and revamped version of the Salman Khan-starrer 'Judwaa' (1997) was instantly lapped up by the audience, followed by two reworked versions of the original film’s hit tracks. The trailer launch in Mumbai attended by 50 pairs of twins from across the country and subsequently, the launch of songs like 'Chalti Hai Kya 9 Se 12', 'Suno Ganpati Bappa, 'Oonchi Hai Building' and 'Aa Toh Sahi' has drawn the audiences’ attention to the comic entertainer. The tracks are steadily climbing the music charts and finding their way into festive playlists. Additionally, apart from a dash of freshness that the lead trio offers, the most recent promo of the film, offering a glimpse of Salman Khan, has added to the film’s buzz.
