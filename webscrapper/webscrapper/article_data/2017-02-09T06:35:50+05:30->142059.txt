CHANDIGARH: As leaders of various political parties continue to express their solidarity with agitating Jats, AIJASS convener   on Wednesday termed BJP president Amit Shah’s meeting with the community leaders in Uttar Pradesh an eyewash to get political mileage.

 Two days after Congress vice-president   and former Haryana chief minister   met the Jat leaders in poll-bound UP, Shah had met the community leaders in the company of Jat ministers and MLAs in Meerut.
 
 “Those who attended the meeting of BJP president are not even remotely linked to the organizations associated with Jat agitation. Hence, this was merely an eyewash. Secondly, we have also issued warning to all political parties to send their representatives to express their solidarity with us. We will openly announce boycott of political parties that do not give any assurance to us,” Malik said.
 
 The Congress was the first to express solidarity as former CM Hooda’s emissary Krishan Moorti Hooda had reached the Jat dharna site. Following that the INLD also had started supporting the agitation with senior party leader   coming in support of the Jats. 
 
 Meanwhile, in an indirect reference to the politicians lending support to Jat protesters, Haryana chief minister   said on Wednesday that the parties should desist from taking part in the agitations in the manner they were doing currently in the state.
