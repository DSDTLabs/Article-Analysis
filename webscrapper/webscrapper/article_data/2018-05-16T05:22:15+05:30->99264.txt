NEW DELHI: Delhi Police managed to invoke the   section related to abetment in the Sunanda Pushkar case without a suicide note but has failed to make any headway in the case of suicide of bureaucrat   and his family members. They had killed themselves in a space of two months in 2016, allegedly due to torture inflicted by CBI officials during a probe in a corruption case. 

 
 Bansal had named four CBI officials in a suicide note, levelling allegations of torture. He had named a DIG, an SP, a deputy SP, an IO and a "fat, balding hawaldar". He had said in a note found in the house along with four photocopies: "I am committing suicide due to torture by CBI." After two years, no FIR has been registered.
 
 Sources say National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), which has taken suo motu cognizance of the matter, has asked Delhi Police to submit reports on the case but the police have looked the other way.   sources said they have sought the reports by next week. The police probe went dormant as CBI said it would conduct an internal inquiry. The police said they were still awaiting the report and that the case is "pending inquest". Inquest proceedings are carried out to probe cases of unnatural deaths. A magisterial inquiry is also conducted to finish an inquest. On July 18, Bansal's wife and daughter had committed suicide two days after the CBI arrested Bansal, director general of corporate affairs, at their home in east Delhi's Madhu Vihar. Satyabala (58) and her daughter, Neha (28), killed themselves by hanging in separate rooms. 
 
 Bansal had been arrested for allegedly receiving Rs 9 lakh as bribe for extending favours to a company. When his wife and daughter died, Bansal was in jail. On September 19, Bansal, out on bail, and his 28-year-old son hung themselves in a similar manner. Bansal had sent the suicide note to nine places, mostly news channels and the CBI.
