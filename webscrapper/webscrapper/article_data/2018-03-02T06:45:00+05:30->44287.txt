Mohali: Strengthening it defense to tackle riot-like situations or mob attacks, Mohali police have procured a bulletproof-armoured vehicle.

 Senior superintended of police (SSP) Kuldeep Singh Chahal said the vehicle, named Capture, will increase the penetration power of the police during emergency.
 
 This is the first-of-its-kind vehicle with Mohali police, said SSP Chahal.
 
 Explaining the salient features of the vehicle, the SSP said, “Somewhat on the lines of ‘Kavach’ in possession of Chandigarh police, we have procured ‘Capture’, a bulletproof-armoured vehicle. It is fitted with light machine gun and is capable of carrying eight to 10 people. Earlier, we have a smaller vehicle which can carry only four persons.”
 
 The SSP said with the addition of this vehicle, Mohali police will be better prepared to control riot-like situations as well as agitations. As Mohali shares a common border with Chandigarh, agitators tend to gather at the borders in attempt to enter Chandigarh.
 
 These specially designed and light-armoured vehicles are used by Indian military to combat intruders and here police will use them to tackle the rioters, Chahal said. The SSP said, “The need was felt after riots broke out in Panchkula last year.”
 
 The vehicle has openings from where police personnel can use tear gas shells on mobs without being exposed to the rioters, the SSP said.
