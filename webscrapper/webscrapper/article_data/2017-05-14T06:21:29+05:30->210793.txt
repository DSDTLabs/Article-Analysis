MUMBAI:   chief   has issued a warning to party MLAs who flouted his diktat and stayed away from the recent outreach campaign in drought-hit areas, it is learnt.

 Thackeray has sought reports from 'samparka pramukhs', who monitor the organisational affairs of the party in districts, on the indiscipline shown by the MLAs.
 
 The Shiv Sena president is said to be upset with 27 of the 40 MLAs who skipped the campaign planned to reach out to farmers in the parched regions of the state. The legislators' decision to keep away from the outreach campaign is seen as open defiance of  's orders, said a key Sena functionary. The incident comes at a time when Thackeray is keen on deepening party roots in the heartland. Thackeray had instructed 40 Shiv Sena MLAs to go to the drought-hit rural parts and meet farmers for first-hand information on issues such as the of tur daal glut and administrative glitches in its procurement, the water crisis, crop failure and the worsening condition of debt-ridden farmers.
 
 Though a part of the coalition government in the state, the Shiv Sena has not got along with senior partner BJP. The campaign was aimed at targeting the government policies, already under fire from the Opposition over the issue of loan waiver. It was also aimed as consolidating the Shiv Sena base in villages in a bid to cut the   down to size.
