BENGALURU: The Bangalore   Rail Corporation Limited ( ), sources said on Saturday, has served a noticeto  , Austria, thefirmthat suppliedthecrossover at   station, which has developed cracks. A crossover is a track that connects two parallel tracks, allowing trains to switch from one to another.

 While the cracks developed about two weeks ago, the BMRCL closed services on the stretch on Friday for maintenance. VAE did not respond to mail from STOI.
 
 “We have taken up the issue with the manufacturer and are replacing thedefective piece. We have been checking all the crossovers after the incident. There is no reason to worry,” a senior BMRCL official said.
 
 BMRCL on Saturday night commenced maintenance work between RV Road and Yelachenahalli stations, and Metro services between three stations — Banashankari, JP Nagar and Yelachenahalli — will resume only from 5am on Monday.
 
 The   connecting Nagasandra in north and Yelachenahalli in south was opened in June 2017. The appearance of cracks in just eight months has raised several eyebrows, especially because a crossover isn’t used as much as the main line.
