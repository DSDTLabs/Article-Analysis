Nagpur: The National Students Union of India (NSUI) on Friday staged a protest in front of Nagpur University (NU) over its admission process, which is causing trouble to a lot of students.

 NSUI said the semi-centralized process is not favourable to the students and they are suffering from the chaos created by the university.
 
 Due to the semi-centralized process, students can apply for several colleges of their choice. However, if they are unable to take admission in these colleges, they will not get admitted to rest of the colleges without donation.
 
 Earlier, vice-chancellor had the powers to increase the seats up to 20%. But now, colleges have the option to start a new batch in case of more admissions with at least half of the total intake capacity.
 
 NSUI vice-president Ajit Singh said that in such cases, the college should give priority to those students who have already applied for that particular college with whatever percentage. “We also want that the colleges that are found guilty during the admission process should be punished by not only imposing heavy fine but also with the charges of corruption,” he said.
 
 Their demand also included removal of all private security guards from the university departments as there are reports of heavy corruption in their salary structure.
 
 “As per the actual structure, NU should give Rs10,000-12,000 salary per month to guards. But despite working for 12 hours a day, they are only being paid Rs4,000-5,000,” he added.
 
 Later, vice-chancellor SP Kane held a meeting with the protesters where he assured to take proper action and said preference will be given to the students who have applied for the college.
