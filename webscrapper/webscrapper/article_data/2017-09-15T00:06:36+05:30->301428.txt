NAVI MUMBAI: Due to   work taken up by   on the   bridge, the motorists heading towards Mumbai along the Sion-Panvel highway were compelled to move at snail’s pace from Vashi creek   till Sanpada junction on Thursday morning. 

  cops were deployed along the 1.8 km long bridge to regulate the traffic as vehicles were allowed to ply only on two lanes of the bridge
 
 PWD deputy engineer P Lahane said, “One of the expansion joint plates was damaged and there was a huge gap at the spot. It could have caused major mishap. So we immediately replaced it. As it was morning peak hours, the snarl was apparent due to the bottleneck at the maintenance spot. The work started at 9 am and was over by 12 noon and the traffic movement was restored to normalcy.
