INDORE: Even after spending crores of rupees,   remains without life. It contains  , which is 10-12 per cent riskier than carbon dioxide, said   professor & HOD Environmental Science,   here on Friday

 “We should not even call Kahn as a river as it is dead. A river must have marine life,” Dr Sharma said during his visit to the city.
 
 Dr Sharma said he visited Kahn and felt it needs more attention from the public. The government must involve people by means of  .
 
 He stressed that climate science is the need of the hour and it must be a part of university syllabus. “Nowadays people are aware of the term-climate science- but they don’t really know about it. We need to develop awareness among people so that we can receive support from them.”
 
 Due to disposal of waste water from residential and commercial set-ups in Kahn river, the marine life which was present in it years ago has been destroyed.
 
 “Industries must have their own treatment plants because different varieties of effluents come out of them,” he said.
 
 Construction of dams and huge ponds for conservation of water and slowly releasing the water in the Kahn would also be helpful.
 
 Dr Sharma suggested ways to revive Kahn by constructing dams over the river. He has also recommended treatment of waste water before its entrance to Kahn River. Plantation on the river banks, construction of small ponds near the banks to store rain water as measures to protect Kahn can also be adopted.
 
 ”Planting saplings would definitely help river. Marginal farming must be done near the banks to keep the quality of the products,” he added
 
 Dr Sharma claimed, if all the measures suggested by him are adopted, then after end of one monsoon season changes in the Kahn rive can be seen. After it is cleansed, don’t allow entrance of any contaminated water to it.
 
 During the conference he also spoke about revival of Narmada. He said, “We call Narmada as mother and then we pollute it. Both these acts are differing.”
