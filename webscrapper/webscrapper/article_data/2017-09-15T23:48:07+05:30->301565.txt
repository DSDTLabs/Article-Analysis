Hyderabad: City based pharma player   Labs Ltd on Friday said it has received the Establishment Inspection Report (EIR) from the US drug regulator, US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), for its finished dosage formulations (FDF) & active pharmaceutical ingredients (API’s) manufacturing plant, Unit-2, located at Achutapuram, Visakhapatnam. The inspection was completed by USFDA in May 2017. The company also said that while the German regulatory authority BGV Hamburg has completed inspection of its Unit-2 FDF facility, its Units 1 and 3 located at Parawada, Visakhapatnam, have “successfully completed” WHO (Geneva) inspection during the month with no critical or major observations.

 Hyderabad-based Laurus Labs Limited, which makes APIs for anti-retroviral (ARV) and Hepatitis C, oncology and other therapeutic areas, plans to develop finished dosage forms capabilities on the back of its existing strengths in APIs and is also driving growth opportunities in the synthesis and ingredients businesses.
