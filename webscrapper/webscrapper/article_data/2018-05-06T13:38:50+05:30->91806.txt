PATNA: Under the   project, many government and private buildings will soon have GPS (global positioning system)-based sensors and meters to monitor the quantity and quality of water being supplied to them as well as leakage in pipelines.

 The sensors will determine four components — chlorine content and contaminants, pH value (the pH of pure water is 7), total dissolved solids and turbidity (measure of relative clarity of a liquid). 
 
 “They will be set up free of cost at three points, including the source of water supply, distribution channel and point of consumption. The data collected from these sensors will be sent to the supervisory control and data acquisition centre to be established near Miller School,” Patna divisional commissioner Anand Kishor told reporters on Saturday and added remote terminal instruments would also be installed to analyse data and determine water consumption by individuals.
 
 Buildings falling under an area of 865 acres ( ) have been earmarked for the water sensors. As per a survey conducted by Spanish firm Eptisa Servicios de Ingenieria, the management consultant for the smart city project, a total of 7,277 domestic, 332 institutional and 689 commercial buildings are present in this area.
 
 The divisional commissioner said, “Sensors will not be installed in buildings which only have personal boring system. Those buildings which utilize both personal boring and Patna Municipal Corporation’s water supply system will get the sensors.”
 
 Solar cells: Under the Patna smart city project, at least 42 government-owned buildings, including   and  , have been selected for setting up of solar cells for electricity generation. As per sources, the preliminary estimated cost of the project is Rs 25 crore.
 
 “The solar cells are expected to produce 4.05MW electricity. The buildings will be self-sufficient in terms of electricity. The electricity produced during holidays and off hours will be sent to power grid stations,” Kishor said.
