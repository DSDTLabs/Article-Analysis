CHENNAI: On Thursday,   evicted 46 families which had settled along the banks of   in  , and moved them to Perumbakkam slum board tenements, as part of Cooum restoration.

 Unlike the previous eviction at MSP Nagar in   which was done amid a huge media glare, Thursday’s eviction was carried out in the morning hours and was finished by 10am.
 
 A senior official told TOI that as part of Cooum restoration, of the total 55 identified slum settlements along the banks of Cooum, ten have been cleared till date, and residents have been relocated.
 
 “Eviction of the remaining 45 settlements would be carried out in a phased manner. We are working tandem with other departments involved to decide upon the eviction plan,” said a senior corporation official. The official added that the civic body was aiming to carry out a number of evictions before monsoon hits the city.
 
 “Since the 2015 deluge, families living on the banks of the Cooum have known that they would need to vacate the houses they have built on the banks of the river,” the official added. Even though the civic body was undertaking biometric verification at the eviction sites, the process is not free of lacunae.
 
 “My voter ID does not carry my husband’s name, as it was issued before I got married. There is no clarity,” said Murugamma, an evictee.
 
 “There needs to be transparency... There is no protocol followed, no eviction notices issued and no social impact assessment done,” said   of Information and Resource Centre for the Deprived Urban Communities (IRCDUC).
