Noida: A 24-year-old woman and her friend were arrested for allegedly stealing a   from a paying guest accommodation in Sector 12 on July 4. The accused, Divya Gupta and Sushil Kumar, had stolen the laptop when nobody was around at the   facility.

 Surendra Tanwar, the PG manager, said he had gone to   for some personal work. “A young girl and a boy came on a bike to the PG to enquire about rooms on rent. They entered our office and found a laptop on the table. Since there was no one around, they stole the laptop and fled,” Tanwar said.
 
 When he returned to Noida, he found the laptop missing. He searched the footage of   camera and found a girl entering the office and stealing the laptop.
 
 Tanwar said he checked his phone and scanned the call logs to get some more clue. Tanwar found a missed call from an unknown number and suspected it. He checked the number using True Caller app and found it registered in the name of a girl, whose face was matching with the photo in CCTV footage. He further searched the number on Facebook and found a girl named Divya Gupta.
 
 Tanwar then registered an FIR at Sector 24 police station. Ummed Singh, SHO Sector 24 police station, said the police put the woman’s mobile phone on surveillance and arrested her in the evening.
 
 “We have also recovered the stolen laptop from their possession. They were produced in court and sent to judicial custody,” Singh said.
