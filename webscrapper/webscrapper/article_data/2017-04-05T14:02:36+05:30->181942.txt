PUNE: The   police on Tuesday detained three minor boys for stealing cash of Rs55,000 from a donation box at the   temple in  .

 The minor suspects conducted the theft in two separate attempts on April 1 and 3.
 
 The school-going boys, aged 10, 12 and 16, had planned to spend the money eating fast food and enjoying their summer vacation.
 
 Temple official Rani Bhoite (39) of Laxminagar said that a cash amount of Rs55,000 was saved in the donation box which was to be used for a function at the temple.
 
 The boys used a sharp object to unlock the donation box and stole all the cash from it, but in two separate attempts. As soon as the temple committee members found all the money gone, they filed a police complaint against unidentified suspects under sections 379 (theft) read with 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code on Tuesday night.
 
 During investigation, local residents of the area confirmed that the three boys were spotted near the temple on April 1 around 8am and again on April 3 around 2pm. They also suspected their involvement in the crime.
 
 Acting on the information, a police team led by sub-inspector Ankush Karche, under senior inspector Satish Govekar of the Kondhwa police station, detained the minors and recovered cash of Rs46,000 from the house of one of the suspects. They had already spent the remaining Rs9,000.
 
 Karche told TOI that the minors had conspired to steal cash from the donation box because they desired to eat fast food and spend the money over the summer break.
 
 The students were produced before the juvenile court and were later released on bail, he added.
