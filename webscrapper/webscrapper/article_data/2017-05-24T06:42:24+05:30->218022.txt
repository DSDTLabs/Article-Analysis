GANDHINAGAR: Prime Minister   on Tuesday delayed his scheduled departure by more than four hours to review his pet projects that were initiated when he was Gujarat chief minister. Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, deputy CM   and top officials briefed him about the progress in various infrastructure projects. 

 Sources said Modi discussed with Rupani, Patel and other senior BJP leaders the political developments in the state and the possibility of senior Congress leaders, including leader of opposition (LOP)  , joining the ruling party. 
 
 When contacted, Nitin Patel said that Modi had done a review of various projects, including the work on Statue of Unity and Narmada canal. “PM also reviewed ICreate start-up initiative; Ghogha (Bhavnagar)-Dahej (Bharuch) Ro-Ro ferry service; and Dholera SIR projects among others. He also made a few suggestions,” Patel said.
 
 However, the deputy CM denied there was any discussion on Vaghela. “PM focused only on the state's core issues. He was supposed to leave at 1:00 pm but left at 4:30 pm,” Nitin Patel said.
 
 Official close to the development claimed that Modi was not happy with the slow progress in key projects. “For instance, the Ro-Ro ferry service was supposed to start from May but that is not possible after monsoon. He was not happy with the slow pace of work on Narmada canal network and the work on Statue of Unity project. Icreate is also not working according to his expecations,” an official said.
 
  president   and other senior leaders of the party also met Modi at the Raj Bhavan. The PM is expected to visit Gujarat again in June for various programmes.
