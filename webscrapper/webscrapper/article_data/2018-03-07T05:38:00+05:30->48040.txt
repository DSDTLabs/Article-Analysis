Nagpur: The civic body’s Dhantoli zone, under which many medical institutions, tony colonies and houses of prominent citizens fall, is indifferent towards recovering property tax dues.

 The zone has identified 491 defaulters and executed warrants for recovery, yet not a single property has been auctioned even as the owners failed to pay attention to reminders.
 
 Overall, the effort of all the 10 zones is not satisfactory. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has identified 1.98 lakh defaulters, who have not paid property tax to the tune of over Rs 266 crore. Against 8,592 tax defaulters who were issued warrants to pay outstanding dues, these zones have attached 3,460 properties. Of these, the zones have carried out auctions of only 209 properties, which is only 2.42%, reveals a data compiled by NMC’s tax department.
 
 “NMC has informed the registrar office about these properties, and asked them not to allow their sale,” said a senior official from the tax department.
 
 Despite amnesty schemes, under which 90% interest and penalty was waived off on outstanding property tax, NMC has not made much headway in recovering dues.
 
 According to the data, Laxmi Nagar zone has executed highest number of warrants — 2,250 — to tax defaulters, but has auctioned only 3 properties.
 
 The performance of Dharampeth zone is no good either. Against execution of 526 warrants, the zone has so far auctioned only 18 properties, while Hanuman Nagar zone has executed 868 warrants and auctioned 55 properties.
 
 Sources wondered how the Dhantoli zone that has already attached six properties could not auction even a single one when the dues are Rs19.05 crore.
 
 The target was set at Rs 564.63 crore, but the 10 zonal commissioners have achieved only 22.85 % (Rs 129.04 crore) from April 2017 to February 3. The property tax department is the key revenue gainer for the NMC and the failure to meet the tax targets would directly impact all development works in the city.
