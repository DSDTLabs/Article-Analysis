Bathinda: The Faridkot sessions judge on Thursday dismissed an appeal against the acquittal of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal in an assault case. The complainant said he would approach the Punjab and Haryana high court.

 The court also dismissed the application for revision filed under Section 311 of CrPC to summon record in the case and some witnesses. The court, however, asked Sukhbir to furnish bail bond of Rs 50,000 as surety to appear if the appeal was filed in a higher court.
 
 Sukhbir was present in the court with a number of Akali leaders. Faridkot sessions judge Satvinder Singh announced the verdict in the afternoon dismissing the appeal filed by Kotkapura resident Naresh Sehgal on May 5, 2016.
 
 Earlier, the court of judicial magistrate first class had acquitted Sukhbir of all charges on April 2, 2016.
 
 Sehgal had alleged that he was assaulted by Sukhbir on September 5, 1999, while the latter was campaigning during Lok Sabha elections at Kotkapura and contesting from Faridkot parliamentary constituency. Sehgal, then a photojournalist with a vernacular newspaper, alleged Sukhbir had beaten him when he had clicked some pictures of Sukhbir campaigning at some religious place in violation of the code of conduct for elections. The case against Sukhbir was registered in 2006 on the directions of the Punjab and Haryana high court.
 
 Sukhbir’s counsel Shivkartar Singh said, “The sessions court on Thursday dismissed the appeal against acquittal of Sukhbir. It also dismissed application for summoning of record and some witnesses in the case.”
 
 After the verdict, Sehgal said, “Justice has been denied to me. I will appeal against the order in the high court.” He alleged a score of Akali leaders, including one with a weapon, had entered the court. “Only after I insisted that the persons not associated with case should be vacated from the court that they were asked to go out,” he said.
