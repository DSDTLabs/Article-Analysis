IMPHAL: The second   between the   and   did not make much progress, sources said. 

 The   (JAC) has been protesting against the passing of three  , which restrict possession of property and movement within the state, denouncing them as "anti-tribal". After nine protesters were killed in violence during protests against the bills, bodies of eight have remained unclaimed at the morgue of the Churachandpur district hospital as a sign of protest. 
 
 After months of deadlock over the issue, chief minister Biren Singh met the JAC for the first round of talks and said the meeting had been "positive", adding that the impasse would be resolved within a few days.
 
 When it came to Monday's discussion, leaders of the tribal pressure group refused to divulge the outcome of the dialogue. 
 
 The JAC has presented a charter of demands to the government, the source said.
 
 Meanwhile, the CM has announced that people can easily meet him, ministers and top state officials on the 15th of every month, calling the day 'Meeyamgi Numit' (People's Day).
 
 With the primary target to forge a close affinity between the public and the government, people will be allowed to meet the CM, ministers, MLAs, chief secretary, commissioners, secretaries, DCs and SPs to lodge their grievances and apprise them of other developmental aspects on such day of the month, Biren said.
 
 An official order to this effect will be issued soon, Biren said while addressing a reception function accorded to him in his honour by women vendors and Khwairamband Ima Keithel (women's market). He made the announcement while speaking at a reception function hosted by the women vendors of Khwairamband Keithel in his honour on Sunday.
