GURUGRAM: Members of several trade unions will hold a ‘jail bharo andolan’ on January 30 as part of a nationwide campaign being organised by labour associations over minimum   and other demands. 

 At a meeting in Kamla Nehru Park on Friday, around 300 trade union representatives also confirmed their presence in a rally being organised by Anganwadi and Asha workers in Delhi on January 17. The workers have long been demanding payment of minimum wages and that they be made permanent.
 
 “We had gathered here today to confirm our participation and support to the protest by the Anganwadi and Asha workers. We will also hold a jail bharo andolan on January 30 when hundreds of workers and union leaders are expected to participate,” said Anil Pawar of the All India Trade Union Congress.
 
 Pawar alleged that the anganwadi workers were being exploited in the absence of a fixed minimium wage. 
 
 Other trade unions that participated in the meeting at Kamla Nehru Park included  ,  ,  ,  , Hero workers’ union and Maruti workers’ union. 
 
 Thousands of labourers from Gurgaon, Faridabad and other regions of Haryana had participated in a national rally by RSS-affiliate   in Delhi in November last year to protest multiple issues that had affected the working class because of the implementation of demonetisation and GST. The absence of cash during demonetisation and the implementation of the GST had had a huge impact on the labour class, with thousands losing their jobs and wages being slashed.
 
 Labour association members had also criticised the Haryana government on its attitude towards labour, alleging that many of its schemes were eyewash and weren’t reaching those in need.
