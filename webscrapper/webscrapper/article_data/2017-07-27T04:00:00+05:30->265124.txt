Mumbai: The country’s largest   HDFC reported a net profit of Rs 1,556 crore for the first quarter of 2017, which was 17% lower compared to Rs 1,871 crore reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The numbers are not comparable as the previous year’s profit included exceptional gains following a stake sale in   Ergo General Insurance.

 “After considering the one-time transaction, the adjusted profit before tax for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 stood at Rs 2,053 crore — up 15% from Rs 2,359 crore in the corresponding quarter last year,” the company said.
 
 According to  , vice-chairman & CEO, HDFC, the profit before tax was much better than the 10-12% recorded in recent quarters. “Loan growth has been good during the quarter with individual disbursements growing by 21%,” said Mistry. He added that while the short term might see some slowdown as industry adjusts to the creation of a real estate regulator and the new goods and services tax, this would be offset by sops on affordable housing.Mistry indicated that another set of exceptional gains were likely this year with HDFC selling close to 10% stake in   through an IPO. The draft prospectus will be filed next month and an   is likely this year itself. Given that analysts value HDFC Life at Rs 60,000 crore, HDFC could realize close to Rs 6,000 crore from the IPO.
