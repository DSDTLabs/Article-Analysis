NEW DELHI:   moderated for the third consecutive month to a seven-month low in February on the back of cooling food and non-food articles.

 
 Data released by the commerce and industry ministry on Wednesday showed inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index (WPI), rose an annual 2.5%, slower than the previous month’s 2.8% and lower than 5.5% in the year earlier period.
 
 Retail   in February slowed to 4.4% in February due to lower food prices, which calmed fears about a spike in price pressure. The WPI data showed prices of pulses contracted an annual 24.3%, while those of vegetables rose 15.4% during the month, slower than the 36.7% rise in the previous month. Onion prices remained stubborn, increasing nearly 80% in February but lower than 127% in the previous month.
 
 “Available trends suggest a pick-up in prices of some cereals, edible oils and milk was offset by a continued correction in prices of onions and tomatoes in the current month. Moreover, average crude oil prices so far in March 2018 remain lower than the trend for the previous month. However, an unfavourable base effect for crude petroleum and natural gas, and fuel and power is likely to push up the   in March 2018. At present, we expect the average WPI inflation to rise to 3.9% in FY2019 from around 2.9% in FY2018,” said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at credit rating agency ICRA.
 
 “With both retail and wholesale inflation recording a decline in February 2018, the MPC is likely to keep the repo rate unchanged in the upcoming policy review in April 2018,” she added.
