PATNA: A poster showing   chief Lalu Prasad’s elder son   as Lord Shiva and his bride   as Goddess Parvati adorned the roadside in front of the gate of Tej’s mother and former CM Rabri Devi’s 10, Circular Road bungalow from where Tej’s marriage procession started for the bride’s home at 5, Circular Road, few hundred metres away, on Saturday evening. 

 Rabri’s home, which would otherwise wear a sombre look ever since the Grand Alliance government fell after   severed ties with RJD in July 2017 and Lalu was jailed in December 2017 to serve imprisonment awarded in fodder scam cases, has been abuzz with marriage-related hustle and bustle for the past few days.
 
 Outside the bungalow, deafening sounds of ‘nagada’ greeted the leaders as well as jubilant RJD workers and supporters pouring in to extend wishes. Granted 3-day parole to attend the wedding, Lalu has been barred from holding political meetings and interactions with media. He stayed away from the battery of media persons covering the marriage.
 
 Durga Mahli, who headed the ‘nagada’ players who had arrived from Lohardaga, said they were tribals and were playing their traditional music meant for pious occasions.
 
 These tribals were brought to Patna for the marriage ceremony by an RJD woman leader of  . “We have gone to Bhutan, Assam, Kolkata, Delhi and several other places to play our traditional music on special occasions,” Mahli said.
 
 Another team from Maner was playing Bhangra music. “We never expected to play at such a big function,” team member Chhotu Kumar said, adding an RJD leader from Maner hired them for the purpose.
 
 The RJD workers could be seen dancing to the accompaniment of the music almost throughout the day outside the groom’s home.
