HYDERABAD: External affairs minister   will lay the foundation stone for a proposed   in the city soon.   affairs minister   said on Wednesday that the land for the purpose will be identified. 

 KTR attended a meeting of NRI affairs ministers of all states in Delhi. During the meeting, Swaraj proposed that passports of workers who go illegally to the Gulf - despite getting rescued and helped the first time when they land in trouble - would be cancelled for five years. "We have supported the proposal," KTR said. 
 
 The minister said during the meeting convened by Swaraj, on migrant NRI workers issues, he had proposed several changes to existing policies and promised full support from Telangana on curbing illegal agents. He said he would discuss the issue with state home minister   and call for a meeting with various stakeholders. 
 
 KTR also said he had urged Swaraj to recruit Telugu-speaking staff in embassies in the Gulf. "There should be at least four Telugu workers in Indian embassies. We have also offered that if necessary, the Telangana government would send the staff on special duty," he said. The minister said the Centre should reach out to those in trouble. Recalling that e-sanad portal had been inaugurated in Hyderabad for certificate verification, he said this would be popularised by awareness campaigns.
