CHENNAI:A group of 17  , including  ,   and  , have come out in support of lyricist  , who is under attack over the past ten days for his alleged reference to a Hindu deity   as a ‘devadasi’ in an essay he wrote for a Tamil daily earlier this month.

 Though Vairamuthu had tendered an apology, leaders of Hindu outfits including Hindu Munnani’s Rama Gopalan, Hindu Makkal Katchi president   and BJP national secretary H Raja had demanded a written apology from the lyricist. Early this week, several thousand brahmins assembled near the State Guest House at Chepauk to protest against Vairamuthu for casting aspersions on Andal.
 
 
 Recalling his contribution to Tamil literature, the writers highlighted the fact that Vairamuthu has been consistently recording the works of stalwarts from the past to strengthen Tamil as a language and its literature. “His essay ‘Thamizhai Andal’ (One who ruled Tamil) was in line with that. By attributing to him something that he has not said, attempts are being made by vested interests to disrupt the cordial atmosphere in the state,” the writers collectively said in a statement on Wednesday. They said people were attacking him without reading the essay in which he highlighted Andal’s contributions to Tamil. Even while quoting from a research paper, Vairamuthu mentioned that even rationalists and nonbelievers should study Andal’s Tamil.
 
 “He has already apologised for the reference though he has not done anything wrong. We have to condemn attempts by divisive forces to sensationalise the issue by instigating orchestrated protests,” the writers said.
 
 Protests against Vairamuthu seem to be spreading fast across the state. On Wednesday, the Jeer of Manavala Maamuni, based in Virudhunagar, began an indefinite fast saying an apology from Vairamuthu was yet to come. Hindu protesters raised slogans against the lyricist near a government office in Coimbatore. Cases have also been filed against him in Chennai and Rajapalayam.
