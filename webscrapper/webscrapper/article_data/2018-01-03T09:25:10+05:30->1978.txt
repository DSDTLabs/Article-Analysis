KOLKATA: It wasn’t the return stint to their club ground that   would have wished for in the I-League. After three consecutive home draws in the national league, the pressure had been mounting on  . The 1-2 loss against ten-man   broke the camel’s back.

 “It is the end of the road for me at Mohun Bagan. The team failed to come back after three draws. I take responsibility of the team’s performance and have decided to quit,” Sen broke the news to the media before even telling his players.
 
 Assistant coach Shankarlal Chakraborty is likely to be given temporary charge.
 
 After the one-all draw against ten-man Indian Arrows on Dec 29, the Bagan faithful had given the Luis de Matos’ a standing ovation, but it was clear the patience was running thin. Slogans of “Go back Sanjoy Sen” were first heard that Friday. The chants against Sen grew shriller on Tuesday when 10-man Chennai City were on the brink of victory.
 
 On Tuesday, Bagan supporters were stunned to silence in the fifth minute when Chennai City striker Jean-Michael Joachim ruffled the net. Although they drew level half hour later through Ansumana Kromah’s converted penalty kick (when Pradeep Mohanraj was red-carded), Sanjoy Sen’s men ended up conceding another goal in the 71st minute.
 
 The loss was Sen’s first in the I-League at home and it left Bagan stranded on 10 points from seven matches.
