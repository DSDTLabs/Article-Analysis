KOLKATA:   founder-member and once the party’s second-in-command,  , on Monday resigned from the party’s working committee and wanted to give up the party’s primary membership as well as his Rajya Sabha membership after Durga Puja, prompting the party to suspend him for six years.

 Roy’s Rajya Sabha term would have ended on April 3, 2018. His decision is a culmination of his increasing distance with the party leadership over the past three years following the emergence of party chief Mamata Banerjee’s nephew,  , as the new power centre after the CM.
 
 “I was among the first signatories to Trinamool Congress when the party began its journey on December 17, 1997. At present, I hold no party post, except the fact that I am a member of the party working committee and a Trinamool Rajya Sabha member. It pains me to say that I have e-mailed my resignation from the working committee today. I will also tender my resignation from the Rajya Sabha after the Puja festivities are over,” said 63-year-old Roy. 
 
 The announcement triggered speculation on Roy’s next move.   leader Siddharth Nath Singh said he had no information about Roy joining BJP. “The development vindicates the rising resentment against autocratic tendencies and corruption within the Trinamool. Mukul Roy has opened the gates for many others to follow,” he said. According to Roy loyalists, the suspended MP may announce a new outfit and use it as a platform to train his guns on Trinamool to BJP’s advantage.
 
 Though no Trinamool leader, other than suspended party MP Kunal Ghosh, has openly come out in Roy’s support, he is marking time to turn out to be the rallying point for disgruntled elements. Even Roy’s son and Trianmool’s Bijpur MLA Subhrangshu didn’t comment.
