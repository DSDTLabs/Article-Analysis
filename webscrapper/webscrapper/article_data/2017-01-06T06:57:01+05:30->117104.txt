 chief   has his campaign schedule turn more hectic with both Goa and Punjab - his party is contesting for the first time in both states - polling on the same day, February 4. Rohan Dua catches up with the Delhi CM in Chandigarh. Excerpts:

 
 
 Elections are fought by our people. It's not about Aam Aadmi Party or Arvind Kejriwal. The reason AAP is popular is that it brings hope to the people. We don't even have money for our campaign. It's our people and volunteers who are doing our campaigning; they will win it for us. People have seen that both BJP and   hired  , spent crores of money on him to build their campaign. But not us. We bank on the masses.
 
 
 
 We want to expose both Congress and  , who love playing musical chairs. Till last polls,   Singh would tell people it is their turn to take power; he wouldn't find problems in Sukhbir (Badal)'s business interests or the drug trade in Punjab. Three years ago, Amarinder silenced the demand for a CBI probe against Bikram Majithia Three months before the polls, Akalis gifted him a clean chit in the Amritsar Improvement Trust case. Why did Amarinder take Majithia's right-hand man Inderbir Bolaria, in his party? Why did he induct Sarwan Singh he induct Sarwan Singh Phillaur, who was dropped by SAD? Both parties pandered to the sand and mining mafia. It's a friendly match of power.
 
 
 
 Amarinder Singh is nervous about his candidature. Why is the Congress not announcing Amarinder as its chief ministerial candidate? Why is it that Navjot Singh Sidhu, who was also offered the deputy CM post by AAP, went to the Congress? We are told that Sidhu has been assured that Amarinder will be used only till the end of campaign.Congress insiders also know unofficially that Sidhu will be their CM candidate.
