 Since building basements are often infested with rodents wading through water either accumulated due to rain or faulty drainage lines, it can put residents at higher risk of contracting leptospirosis — a bacterial infection.
 
 It is caused when people come into contact with water contaminated by animal urine, especially rodents. “People wading through waterlogged areas have a high chance of contracting the disease, if they have wounds or cuts on their feet. Cases of leptospirosis usually rise during the monsoon,” experts said.
 
 “The alert was issued on July 17. Our health staff will initially warn people staying in such premises to clear water, failure of which will attract legal action,” Kalpana Baliwant, head of the insect control department at Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), told TOI.
 
 Baliwant said, “The issue of waterlogging in building basements is especially worrisome in old structures and wadas in the Kasba-Vishrambaug ward office areas and the Kasba Peth ward office areas. Similarly, societies located on the fringe areas of the city are also prone to rainwater accumulation in their basements, especially during the monsoon. People living here need to be extra careful.”
 
 As per civic records, there are over 1,186 old properties, including old wadas prone to water accumulation. Most of these buildings are located in Kasba Peth, Budhwar Peth, Shaniwar Peth, Nana Peth, Bhavani Peth and Narayan Peth.
 
 Maharashtra has reported a total of 58 cases of leptospirosis and three deaths this year. Most cases are from the endemic Konkan belt.
