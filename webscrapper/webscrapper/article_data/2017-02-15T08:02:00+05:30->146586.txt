 However, from the last four months, the app has not been updating the city about power cuts. 
 
 “I followed all the instructions and downloaded the app, but couldn’t find any information,” alleged SP Kumar, a resident of Central Park in Golf Course Road.
 
 When contacted, Anil Sharma, the superintendent engineer at Restructured Accelerated Power Development and Reforms Programme, said, “I will write to the concerned circle officers and ask them to take necessary steps.” TNN
