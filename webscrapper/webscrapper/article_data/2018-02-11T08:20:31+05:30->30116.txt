JAIPUR: The   has picked up four districts from Rajasthan—Jaisalmer, Karauli, Sirohi and Baran—for the inspirational districts programme. The districts were chosen due to poor performance in health, nutrition, agriculture and education sectors.

 In association with the state government, NITI Aayog will carry out remedial measures to improve these parameters in the selected districts. 
 
 Jaisalmer district collector   told TOI that they have held a meeting with different departments to improve the scores in required areas. “A blueprint has been prepared after meetings with all departments concerned in the city. I have started activities in required areas to improve health, education and other indicators. The special drive will improve the indicators,” said Meena.
 
 These four districts have scored poorly in all major studies conducted by ministers, state departments and private NGOs like Pratham. The most common thread running through these districts is the poor learning outcomes at schools. Reports have stated that, in these districts, learning outcomes—reading, comprehension and mathematics—are way below the state average. The dropout rate in these districts is also high.
 
 Even health indicators—life expectancy, infant mortality and female mortality and reach of health departments—are alarmingly low. “The programme seeks to identify districts across the country lacking in basic indicators and implement remedial measures so that they are on par with the rest,” said  , managing trustee of Pratham.
 
 A total of 115 districts have been chosen across the country by different agencies and ministries to implement remedial measures. The Niti Aayog has selected 30 districts, ministry of home affairs 32, with other ministries sharing the rest. 
 
 The assessment of the programme will be done by NITI Aayog after April 2018. The selected districts will be ranked on the basis of their performance.
