NEW DELHI: Central workers’ unions have welcomed the government’s move to include workers in the unorganised sector under the pension fund scheme, but say the government must bear the cost of employer’s contribution to the fund for it to be feasible.

 The unions have asked labour minister   and chairman of   ( ) of EPFO whether the proposal has taken into account that the government will also have to bear the cost of “the employer’s contribution” to the fund.
 
 The CBT can go ahead with the scheme only after the government agrees to bear this cost.
 
 At a meeting of CBT on Thursday, at which representatives of all central trade unions and employers’ associations like  , ASSOCHAM were present, the minister said he would go back to the ministries that employ unorganised labour to get an approval on the issue, sources said. The scheme will cover an estimated 61.50 lakh workers.
