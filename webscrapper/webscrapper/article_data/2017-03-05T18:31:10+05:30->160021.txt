NEW DELHI: A hurricane prediction tool from the ancient Maya civilisation of Mexico has captured the imagination of United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR).

 The UNISDR is organising a global platform, a multilateral forum for addressing disaster risk, in Cancun, Mexico next May. India, which has assumed a leadership role in the Asia Pacific region on disaster mitigation efforts, will be represented by a six-member strong delegation led by minister of state for home Kiren Rijiju. The minister has recently been conferred the   (DRR) by UNISDR.
 
 Brigitte Leoni, senior communication officer of the UNISDR, writes about the importance of Maya's hurricane early warning system that has not only helped in averting severe disaster casualties but also helped in development of modern tools.
 
 The Maya early warning system, says Leoni, is housed in the clifftop  , or Temple of the God of the Wind, in Tulum, a Maya site that had its heyday in the years 1200 to 1450.
 
 "The temple contains an intricate web of holes that cause an extremely loud whistling sound when early hurricane-force winds blow in from the Caribbean sea towards Tulum," she explains.
 
 The whistling sound at the temple even today serves as a warning for approaching hurricane for local residents in Tulum. The God of Wind temple is 130 km south of Cancun, which is hosting the UN's biggest event on DRR with thousands of delegates from across the world participating including senior government officials, ministers, scientists and experts on disaster mitigation.
 
 Leoni says the UNISDR has dedicated two days on discussing issues related to increasing availability of and access to alert systems and disaster risk information.
 
 Mexico is worst affected by hurricanes. On an average 23 hurricanes with a speed of 63 km/hour hit the cities facing the Pacific and those in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean.
