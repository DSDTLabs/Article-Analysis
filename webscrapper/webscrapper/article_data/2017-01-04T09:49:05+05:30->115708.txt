UDUPI: Farmers associated with the Udupi district   plans to stage protest in front of CMC water lifting unit at  , opposing the DC T Venkatesh‘s recent order to remove fuse from farmers’ pump sheds at areas surrounding Swarna River. 

 Kudi Sriniwas Bhat, secretary of Udupi district Krishika Sangha said, “ Outflow of water is still happening and the farmers do not lift water, it will simply flow into the sea. Water should be allowed to be lifted till the outflow stops. After that, let them start rationing. Around 620 farms depend on river water.”
 
 President of Krishika Sangha, Ram Krishna Sharma, questioned why farmers are always targeted. “CMC lifts 350hp water every day and Manipal lifts 150hp water at night time. We are not asking water for the entire year. Let them ration water twice or thrice a week, but not stop in entirely.”
 
 Meanwhile, a local farmer, P  , said the move would also lead to drinking water crisis in the area. “We do not have drinking water facility from Panchayat nor do we have wells. We don’t have an option to get down to the river to bring water as well,” he said.
 
 Sarvotham Shetty, another farmer, flayed the DC’s order, calling it sudden and ill-informed.
