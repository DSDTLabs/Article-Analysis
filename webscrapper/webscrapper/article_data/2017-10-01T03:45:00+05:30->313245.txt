Panaji: The archdiocese of Goa and Daman has appealed to its faithful to be respectful of the last rites performed by people of other faiths and not to interfere with their legitimate endeavours in this direction. 

 The Church observed that there are often objections from some sections of the Catholic community during attempts to purchase land or even find a site for a kabrastan. The basic right that a religious community — in this case the Muslim community — has for a place to dispose of the bodies of their dead is viewed by the Church as a question of justice and human rights, enshrined in our constitution, the Church’s statement released by director of the archdiocese’s Diocesan Centre for Social Communications Media, Fr Olavo Caiado, said.
 
 On his return from the Holy Land, archbishop Rev Filipe Neri Ferrao has instructed the faithful to work beyond mere coexistence with people of other religious traditions and move towards a more proactive collaboration, particularly in matters that demand mutual respect and understanding, adding that “we are a human community, live with and for each other”.
 
 The Church’s appeal comes in the wake of the incident in Sonsodo a fortnight ago where priests from the archdiocese of Goa, Fr Maverick Fernandes and Fr Freddy Braganca, were asked to vacate the premises when they tried to understand the objections of the people to the rightful claims for a kabrastan on the land allocated to the Muslim community by the Margao municipality.
 
 Terming the behaviour of the leaders ‘reprehensible’, the Church said that they shouted and used foul language while trying to incite the crowd.
