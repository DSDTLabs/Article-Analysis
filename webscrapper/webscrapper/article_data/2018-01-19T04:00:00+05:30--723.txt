Surat: A 33-year-old   and a duplicate key maker were arrested by Salabatpura police on Thursday for allegedly stealing valuables from locked homes. In an unusual modus operandi, the accused woman, who is mother of two children, used open locked houses with the help of keys made by his aide in day time.

The accused mostly targeted houses in Begampura and Zampa Bazaar area that remained locked during daytime. Police recovered valuables worth Rs 1.52 lakh from the accused. 
 
 “The accused was trying to open the lock of a house which belongs to family member of Saiyedna Saheb, the chief religious preacher of Bohra community. The family lives abroad and neighbours became suspicious when the woman was trying to open the lock with the help of a man. On being asked, the woman said she was given keys to open it,” a local resident, who nabbed her, said.
 
 Soon, the local residents contacted the owner of the house and he clarified that he did not send anyone. The residents then informed the police and handed over the accused to them. 
 
 “Police have recovered valuables from the woman and she has stolen these valuables from different homes. Further investigation will reveal other places where the accused carried out thefts,” assistant commissioner of police, C division, P K Patel said. tnn
