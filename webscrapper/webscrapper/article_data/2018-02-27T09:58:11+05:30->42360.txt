THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The   on Monday directed   leader   to obtain the statement of assets of CPM state secretary   from the office of Governor   through RTI Act.

 Considering the petition by Radhakrishnan alleging that the CPM leader possesses disproportionate assets, a division bench comprising lokayukta Pius C Kuriakose and upalokayukta A K Basheer observed that going by the complaint, it appears that the complainant is under the wrong notion that the competent authority of office-bearers of political parties at the state level is registrar of lokayukta.
 
 
 For public servants such as chief minister, MLAs and office-bearers of political parties at the state level, the competent authority is the governor and property statement should be submitted before him. If a public servant does not file his/her property statement or file incorrect statement, it is for the competent authority to report the matter to the lokayukta. The bench observed that till date no such report has been received from the governorâ€™s office.
