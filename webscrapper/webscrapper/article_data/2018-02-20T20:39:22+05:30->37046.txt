Creating non-farm jobs remains a huge problem, with the government's latest   in eight key sectors revealing that there's been a net addition of just 64,000 jobs across these sectors between April and June last year. Even more worryingly, the manufacturing sector lost 87,000 jobs over this period, indicating that   remains a distant dream.

 
 The  's quarterly survey shows that the   and health sectors between them added 1.3 lakh jobs in April-June 2017, while the other six sectors - manufacturing, construction, trade, transport, accommodation & restaurants, and the IT/BPO industry - put together saw a net loss of 66,000 jobs.
 
 Education was by far the biggest job creator, adding 99,000 jobs over this quarter. Health saw an addition of 31,000 jobs. The survey, which in its current format has been running since April 2016, covers both regular and casual   as well as the selfemployed in these sectors.
 
 Since April 2016, there has been a net addition of 4.8 lakh jobs in these eight sectors with over half from education (1.7 lakh) and health (1 lakh). That translates to a 2.3% growth in employment over 15 months, an annualised growth rate of barely 1.8%. This rate is not enough to even take care of new entrants to the job market each year, leave alone reducing unemployment.
 
  
  
 
 The increase in employment in the manufacturing sector, the focus of the Make in India programme, is an even lower 1% over the 15-month period.
 
 One positive spin-off of most new jobs being in the education and health sectors is that women have gained more than men. Of the net 64,000 new jobs created in April-June last year, 51,000 went to women and 13,000 to men.
 
 Over the 15-month period since this survey began, however, female employment in these sectors has risen by a little over 2.1 lakh while male employment has gained about 2.7 lakh.
