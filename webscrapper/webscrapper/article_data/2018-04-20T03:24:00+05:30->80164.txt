Panaji: Urban development minister Francis D’Souza has convened a joint   of the commissioner of the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP), director of municipal administration (DMA) and Panaji mayor on April 25 to resolve the grievances raised by the trading community. 

 D’Souza told TOI that a delegation of Panaji Hotel and Traders Association (PHTA) met him on Thursday, and put forth their problems in renewing trade licences issued by the CCP. “They complained they have to make several trips to the CCP office to renew licences. Despite these visits, it is not renewed in time, as a result a penalty is imposed on them,” said D’Souza. 
 
 Irked traders complained that every year garbage fees, trade licence board tax and house tax is drastically hiked, yet there is no quality improvement in services offered. “The CCP should be scrapped for its failure to maintain city affairs,” the association said. 
 
 PHTA has demanded that renewal of trade licences be simplified and made business-friendly.
