NEW DELHI: Spotted a junk vehicle in your neighbourhood wasting parking space? Now you can report it through a mobile application — ‘Khatara Gaadi’ — that will soon be launched by Delhi government. 

 The application will allow users to find out if a vehicle is over 15 years old in case of petrol vehicles and 10 years old in case of diesel ones, which are not allowed on Delhi’s roads. Users would need to type in the registration number of a vehicle in the   to get necessary details about the car. The app, which will be available on both Android and   platforms, won’t reveal the name or address of the owner. 
 
 The app can then be used to click a photograph of the vehicle, which will be sent directly to the control room of the   department. The photos would be geo-tagged, which would help the department find the location of the vehicle. 
 
 Through this app, the department, in a joint drive with the municipal corporations, plans to target old and defunct vehicles that remained parked for years in residential areas or the roadside. “We are going to start the drive from   and later cover the whole city,” said an official. “There are thousands of such junk vehicles lying around in the city that are not fit to be driven but occupy premium parking space. We have come across many that don’t even have tyres and are supported by bricks,” he said. “Sometimes, people even buy junk vehicles just to occupy parking space. It’s time to remove them and make the valuable space available for functional vehicles,” he said. 
 
 Transport department also plans to rope in local resident’s welfare associations to identify such vehicles in their respective areas. “The government can’t carry out this exercise alone and we need the support of people,” the official said.
