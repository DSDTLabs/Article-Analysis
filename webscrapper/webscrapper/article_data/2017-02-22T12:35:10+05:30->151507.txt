 “In preparation for the actual rollout on July 1, this seminar is being organized to enable those having difficulties in migrating to GST with a PowerPoint presentation, detailing the step-by-step procedure, wherein you will obtain a provisional ID. At the head office in Panaji, we have commenced a Seva Kendra to assist people, while two Indian Revenue Services ( ) officials are posted at the district office to guide those facing difficulties. Citizens can also take assistance from range officers posted at divisional offices at Verna, Sanguem, Colva, Vasco, and other areas,” additional commissioner of customs, central excise and service tax, Geovani Santimano, told reporters. 
 
 “Once an individual has registered for GST, that comprises the central goods and service tax (CGST), as well as state goods and service tax ( ), the individual need not re-register with the service and central excise tax department. Similarly, once migration is done from value added tax (VAT) or sales tax or commercial tax, the individual need not register again with the service and central excise tax department. Regarding the inter-state transfer of goods, wherein a Goan manufacturer sends his goods to Maharashtra or Bengaluru, there will be another tax called IGST,” Santimano added. 
 
 Explaining that there are many service providers who are not connected with VAT, such as beauticians and event managers, Santimano said, “These providers won’t need to go to the VAT department, as their services don’t attract any sales tax. They will migrate through us.”
