GURUGRAM: In 2004, Vikram Bisnoi had bought a 260 sq yd residential plot from Huda in Sector 57, for Rs 9.24 lakh. In 2012, just as he was planning to start construction, he received a   from Huda asking for enhanced compensation of Rs 15 lakh. A week ago, he received another Huda notice, demanding a further Rs 15 lakh by May 10, as a second enhanced compensation for the same plot.

 Bisnoi and 3,500 other people who own plots in Sector 57 are now up in arms against Huda. On Wednesday, a group of plot owners submitted a memorandum to Huda estate officer Bharat Bhushan Gogia, addressed to the chief minister, demanding waiver of the interest component in the second enhancement.
 
 “The price of my plot has gone up from Rs 9.5 lakh to around Rs 40 lakh,” said Vikram Bisnoi, adding he had already withdrawn from his pension funds to pay the first enhancement. He’s clueless about how to arrange more funds at such a short notice. Nearly 2,000 of the 3,500 allottees in Sector 57 have received similar notices in the last week. The rest are expected to receive their notices in the next few days.
 
  Gogia said according to   (Disposal of Land and Building) Regulations, 1978, an allottee is liable to pay additional amount as enhancement, if land owners were awarded higher compensation by courts. Huda launched Sector 57 in 2004, by acquiring 550 acre in Wazirabad and Ghata. This was later challenged by land owners in a Gurugram court, which, in 2011, directed Huda to award higher compensation to land owners. Following this, Huda collected Rs 5,600 per sq yd more from allottees in 2012. Not satisfied with the amount, land owners filed another petition. In 2015, Punjab and Haryana high court asked Huda to pay more.
 
 “Huda is issuing notices for enhanced pay three years after the high court order, with 15% annual interest. It also claims that some part of the first enhancement was not collected in 2012, which is being collected now by adding the balance to the second enhancement, with 15% annual interest,” said plot owner  , adding they are planning to approach the courts against Huda’s “unjustified demand”.
 
 “Why didn’t Huda collect the entire first enhancement in 2012? Why did they take three years to issue notice for the second enhancement, and demand interest on it?” said Bisnoi, adding that of the Rs 15 lakh he has been asked to pay now, Rs 10 lakh is interest.
 
 “We demand a roll-back of the interest,” said Bisnoi, adding the government should bear the burden of interest.
