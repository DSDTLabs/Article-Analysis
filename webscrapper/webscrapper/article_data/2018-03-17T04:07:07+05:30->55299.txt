Noida: The UP   has directed its officials to install   in   too. The board had in January asked all test centres to be equipped with cameras.

 The new directive has triggered concerns about funds in several evaluation centres. Sources said the instruction appeared to have been issued on the assumption that the exam centres, where CCTVs are already installed, would double as evaluation centres.
 
 In Gautam Budh Nagar, there are two inter-colleges that have been turned into evaluation centres —   in Sector 12 and   in Hoshiarpur of Sector 51.
 
 Officials confirmed that a letter directing the installation of CCTV cameras in evaluation centres had been recently sent by the secretary of the Madhyamik Shiksha Board, Neena Srivastava. The district inspector of schools issued a circular to evaluation centres on March 13.
 
 While the Rajkiya Inter College has cameras installed as it was an exam centre, the college in Hoshiarpur has cited shortage of funds.
 
 Hemlata, the principal of the Hoshiarpur college, said: “We have been asked to use the fees we charge to install the cameras. But being a new school, we do not have enough students.”
 
 The school, which was opened in July, needs at least 11 CCTV cameras for the 11 rooms where the papers would be evaluated. Sources said it involved an expense of Rs 50,000.
 
 PK Upadhyay, the DIOS, said the school was not made an invigilation centre because it is new and is yet to have the required infrastructure. 
 
 “The school is new and we understand that it does not have enough funds,” Upadhyay said.
