NEW DELHI: The   in which a man was injected with a deadly drug at   would have probably remained another unresolved crime had not the victim caught hold of the contract killer. The main conspirator, Anish Yadav, and the implementer, Prem Kumar, had not factored such a possibility while planning the devious liquidation. 

 Ravi died on Monday morning in hospital, but he had done his bit to identify his attackers by holding on to Kumar despite being injected with the drug. Kumar tried to mislead the police by claiming he had been hired by the victim’s brother-in-law over a property dispute. Soon after questioning the family, the cops nailed Kumar’s lie and forced him to reveal the real name of his hirer.
 
 The questioning of the two men revealed how meticulously they had planned the crime. Yadav put his intentions into action on December 27 last year, when he was at AIIMS accompanying his UP Police constable cousin, who had attempted suicide by shooting himself with his service revolver. While his cousin was being treated, Yadav befriended a nursing staff and stole an anaesthetic drug from a fridge.
 
 Yadav located Kumar after trawling the internet for a person who knew how to administer intravenous injections. He promised the man Rs 3 lakh to carry out the attack, ensuring his compliance with an advance payment. The duo also purchased surgical masks to conceal their identity — CCTV footage places them at a medical store trying out the masks. 
 
 Police found Yadav had been jailed in 2010 on charges of gang-raping a woman but had been bailed out last year. His wife divorced him in June 2016, and filed a case of dowry, which is pending trial.
 
 Yadav was enamoured of the woman Ravi had married. He persuaded her to get a divorce, a proposition she rebuffed by citing her father’s cancer. Two days before the murder, Yadav morphed her picture to show her in his company and sent it to Ravi along with a threat to kill him.
