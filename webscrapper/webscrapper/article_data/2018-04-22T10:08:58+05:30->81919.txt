HYDERABAD: Chief minister   on Saturday said action will be taken against banks if Rs4,000 per acre is not immediately disbursed to farmers on presentation of cheques under   farmers’ investment support scheme, which will roll out on May 10.

 Addressing a meeting of district collectors at   here,   said 58 lakh passbooks and cheque books will be distributed across the state over a period of one week. Upon presentation of the cheques to banks, the farmers will be given cash immediately. Similarly, distribution of new pattadar passbooks will begin on May 10.
 
 
 “We have taken up a responsibility which no government in the country, or for that matter, in the world has ever taken up. Nobody till date has ever made an attempt to survey the land, issue new passbooks and provide financial assistance towards investment support. Hence, we have no previous experience. We have formulated the scheme on our own and are implementing it,” the CM said.
 
 Claiming that the investment support scheme has been conceived to make agriculture profitable, the CM instructed the collectors to invite public representatives when the programme kicks off on May 10. In instances where a farmer may have to get more than Rs50,000 for the land he holds, the CM told the officials to split the amount and issue two cheques.
 
 Each farmer is given Rs4,000 per acre for any number of acres of land he/she holds under Rythu Bandhu. This exercise will be repeated next season as well. The government has allocated Rs12,000 crore in the budget for the scheme, of which Rs6,000 crore is for the monsoon crops in the first phase.
 
 Meanwhile, the ‘Kanti Velugu’ programme to conduct eye check-ups for everyone will be taken up in the last week of May.
