GHAZIABAD: Family members of 12-year-old Archie Yadav, who went missing from her Shakti Khand-3 residence on Monday, held a march on Wednesday. 

 The march began around 6 pm from the girl’s residence and culminated at Mangal Chowk in Indirapuram. “We organised this march as the police have not given us any updates about my missing daughter,” said Subhash Yadav, Archie’s father. Over 500 people gathered at Mangal Chowk, leading to a traffic jam on Kala Patthar road for almost 30 minutes. 
 
 When asked about the family's allegations, Pradeep Tripathi, SHO, Indirapuram said, “We are trying our best. Our SWAT, forensics and crime branch team are all working day and night all over the city and even in the nearby towns and villages to get clues. We are also trying to trace her through some phone numbers too.”
