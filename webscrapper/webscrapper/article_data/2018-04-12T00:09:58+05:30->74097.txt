Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala   Authority has launched the digital version of ‘Hamari Malayalam’, the text book to teach   to  . 

 The digital book was released by education minister C Raveendranath who handed over the CD to   mission director P S Sreekala at a function held here on Wednesday.
 
 The digital book to be used at ‘Changathi’ (the particular project under the literacy mission) study centres and at junctions where migrant workers usually gather, by making maximum use of available electronic systems, will further popularize the project, said an official release from the Mission.
 
 The digital book was prepared by animation and graphic design students of Aluva Marampally MES College, who were also the instructors of the model ‘Changathi’ project launched at Perumbavoor earlier, with the support of their teachers. The digital book comprises 10 lessons through which Malayalam is taught with the help of Malayalam and Hindi alphabets and words besides pictures.
 
 The lessons are prepared based on the situations migrant workers might confront at their workplace and residential places. “Instead of going directly into alphabets and words, the students are made to learn Malayalam easily through life situations. The lessons are based on various sectors they interact continuously including food, health, travel and equipment,” the release said.
 
 As many as 5,268 migrant workers in the state are now learning Malayalam under the project, which had begun at Perumabavoor with 432 students.
