 There were reports recently that Sugandha is planning to get married to Sanket. But the actress rubbished the rumours in an exclusive interview to TV Times.
 
 Talking to the timesofindia.com, Sugandha had said, "I think the report is a bad joke and lacks content. It's a very bad thing that people cook up a story and don't even clarify before publishing it." Even Sanket slammed the reports and called it "a figment of someone's imagination".
