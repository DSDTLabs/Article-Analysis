COIMBATORE: Ousted   functionary KC Palanisamy continued his attack against chief minister   and his deputy O Panneerselvam here on Friday, accusing them of toeing the BJP line at the cost of Tamil Nadu’s welfare.

 Targeting OPS, Palanisamy said the deputy chief minister, who revolted against VK Sasikala’s ascension to general secretary post, was now backtracking in the demand for a fair election for the post. “Initially, Sasikala opposed the idea of conducting the election to the post where all the primary members of the party will vote. But, OPS demanded an election. However, now Dhinakaran wants an election but OPS has backtracked,” he said at a press conference held here on Friday.
 
 “But my demand has been consistent all through. I was demanding election to GS post from the beginning,” he said.
 
 Predicting the Delhi high court issuing a direction to hold the election to the general secretary post, Palanisamy said OPS was blocking him from arguing the case in the court in favour of elections by highlighting his ouster from AIADMK. He said the election should be conducted under the supervision of a retired of sitting judge appointed by Delhi high court.
 
 KCP also alleged that EPS and OPS mishandled the   issue. “CM has not dealt it diplomatically. He could have spoken to Prime Minister   and convinced him on the necessity for Cauvery Management Board. Instead, he complicated the issue by convening an all party meeting just to compete with DMK,” he added.
