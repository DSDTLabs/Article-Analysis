CHANDIGARH: Hundreds of farmers from across   on Tuesday held a   and demanded waiver of farmers' loans at the earliest. The farmers were navigated by   (Lakhowal). 

 General secretary of the kisan union Sukhdev Singh alleged that before coming to power in Punjab, chief minister Captain   had promised to waive off farm loans, but even after completing one year, the CM has failed to keep his promise.
 
 "Now farmers are ready to launch a state-wide protest, if their demands are not acknowledged," Sukhdev said. Meanwhile, after submitting a memorandum to the Punjab government, a large number of farmers were seen crowding liquor vends of Sectors 25, 37 and 38. Economical liquor rates as compared to Punjab attracted many farmers, who came for protest. Some of the farmers were even seen buying full cartons of liquor.
 
 The farmers' rally also impacted the city traffic. Road from   to the roundabout of sectors 29/31 remained jammed for more than one hour. Traffic also remained slow at sector 25/38 light point.
