HYDERABAD: Three of the five Indian Mujahideen (IM) convicts in the   were moved out of   and, amid unprecedented security, flown to Delhi and Mumbai where they were booked for   committed there.

 Sources in the prison department said   were flown to Delhi, while software engineer Aijaz Sheikh was taken to Mumbai. Amid heavy security, the convicts were shifted from Cherlapally jail to RGI Airport by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Telangana police. At least, 50 policemen were drafted for the secret morning operation. Even aboard the aircraft, security officials took many precautions.
 
 Though prison officials claimed ignorance about the cases for which the IM activists were taken to different places, it is learnt that Yasin and Tehseen were taken to Delhi for their role in hatching a conspiracy to carry out terror activities across the country. One of the convicts, Aijaz, who is a software engineer, was taken to Mumbai to appear in a blast case.
 
 “The three convicts were taken as courts in Delhi and Mumbai summoned them to face trial in pending cases. The three did not resist nor create any nuisance,“ the source said. The five IM operatives Yasin Bhatkal, Asadullah Akhtar, Tehseen Akhtar, Zia Ur Rehman and Aijaz Sheikh -were convicted last December and sentenced to death by a local NIA court for their involvement in the Dilsukhnagar twin blasts. The convicts recently moved a petition in the high court appealing against the lower court order. The other convicts -Asadullah Akhtar and Zia Ur Rehman -might be moved out of Cherlapally jail too as summons are likely from courts in other cities where they were involved in terror activities.
