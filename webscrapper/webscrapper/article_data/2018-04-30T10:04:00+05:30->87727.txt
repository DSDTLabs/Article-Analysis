PUNE: Two boys drowned in a water-filled pit at an under-construction site of a   (PMC) school in   on Sunday. The boys had accidentally fallen into the pit while trying to retrieve their cricket ball.

 The boys were identified as   (7) and   (8), students of different private English medium schools. The father of one boy is a political worker while that of the other works in a private company.
 
 Local residents were able to pull out one of the boys while the other was fished out by the fire brigade personnel. Both boys were motionless when pulled out. They were rushed to a nearby hospital where the doctors declared them brought dead.
 
 The incident took place at the PMC-run Matoshree English medium school located in the   area of Yerawada. According to Yerawada police, a group of boys was playing cricket near the school when their ball went into the construction site. The gate to the construction site was locked, but the two boys managed to crawl under it to fetch the ball. While they were trying to pull out the ball from the pit using sticks, they slipped and fell in at around 4.30pm.
 
 Inspector Ashok Kadam of the Yerawada police station said, “The other boys raised an alarm and local residents rushed to the site and pulled out one of the boys. However, they could not locate the other boy in the water. The city fire brigade department, which received an emergency call, rushed a team to the site. Within 20 minutes, the fire brigade personnel found the other boy,” he said.
 
 Kadam said a contractor has been given the task of constructing a few more classrooms at the PMC school. The contractor had dug up the 50x50 feet pit. The water in the pit, which was six feet deep, had come from a nearby quarry.
