"While the speculation on cricketer   and his actress fiancée   Ghatge’s wedding date is on, Bombay Times has learnt that the couple has finally zeroed in on their big day. A source revealed, “Zaheer and Sagarika are all set to tie the knot in November and their wedding reception will take place on the 27th of the same month. There could be two ceremonies — one each in Mumbai and Pune. Close friends and family have been informed in advance to save the date.” While the venue is yet to be revealed, preparation is on in full swing for the post-Diwali ceremony. 

 During a previous interaction with Bombay Times, Sagarika had said, "I always knew   was going to propose but didn't know it would be in the middle of the  ! My mom and dad are very happy. Zaheer has interacted with them a lot and even they knew it would happen, just that nobody knew when. That was definitely a surprise for me. For any good occasion, I think the right time is when you feel it. I am sure he found it right enough to do it."
