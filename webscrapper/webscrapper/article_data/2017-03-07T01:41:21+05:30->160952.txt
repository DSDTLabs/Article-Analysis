NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Monday observed that if “trees could vote they would not be hacked” for infrastructure projects.

 Hearing a PIL related to the rising air pollution in the city, HC also said that there should be a CAG audit of timber generated by encroachers or authorities for various projects in the national capital.
 
 “If trees were included in electoral rolls as voters, then they would remain,” a bench of Justices Badar Durrez Ahmed and   remarked after learning that that a large number of trees were felled by local authorities, including  , for their projects and also by encroachers.
 
 Taking up the issue suo motu, the court has been trying to stem the rise in pollution and is monitoring steps taken in this regard. It found that one of the reasons for the pollution was decline in the   and surrounding areas.
 
 “The income (from trees cut for timber) has to be accounted for, hence the need for CAG audit,” the bench said.
 
 The court also took note of the fact that Delhi government has not adhered to timelines fixed early last year for identifying encroachments in the Asola-Bhati sanctuary and removing them. HC told the government that wherever encroachments have been identified, the people there have to be relocated.
 
 Amicus Curiae Kailash Vasdev said that due to inaction by the government, forest cover has gone down since the encroachers keep felling trees to widen open area to settle in. Delhi government standing counsel Rahul Mehra opposed this argument and claimed that green cover has increased in the city.
 
 The bench listed the matter for further hearing on March 9.
