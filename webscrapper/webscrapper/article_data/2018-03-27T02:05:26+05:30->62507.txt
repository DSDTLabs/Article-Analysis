PATNA: Two journalists riding a motorcycle were allegedly crushed to death by the husband of a former village head-woman under his SUV in Bihar’s Bhojpur district on Sunday evening.

 
 The police on Monday arrested   alias Harsu for the double murder. Several cases of crime are registered against Harsu, police said.
 
 While Naveen Kumar Singh, 45, was associated with a national Hindi daily, Vijay Singh, 35, reportedly contributed to a local vernacular magazine. Police said Harsu had a heated argument with the two journalists over certain news reports in the market of Garahani, about 80km from Patna, at around 8pm on Sunday. “After the argument, Naveen and Vijay left the market on a motorcycle. An agitated Harsu followed them on his SUV and crushed them to death,” a senior police officer said.
 
 As people started gathering at the accident spot, the accused abandoned his SUV and fled. The mob later torched his vehicle. While Navin is survived by his wife, an 18-year-old daughter and a 15- year-old son, Vijay is survived by his wife and two children. Patna zone IG Nayyar Hasnain Khan on Monday said an FIR had been lodged at Garahani police station. “An SIT led by Bhojpur SP Awakash Kumar has been formed to investigate the case,” the IG said, adding that forensic experts have lifted evidences from the spot.
 
 Quoting the FIR lodged by Navin’s brother Rajesh, Garahani police station SHO   said Harsu had been nursing a grudge against Navin for writing against his family. The FIR has also alleged the involvement of Harsu’s son Dabloo in the murder.
 
 Sources said Harsu was also an accused in a case of communal riots at Garahani. Bhojpur SP Awakash Kumar said Dabloo was involved in liquor and ganja smuggling and had come out of the jail recently.
