AHMEDABAD:   on Wednesday issued notice to the   and sought reply over absence of rules with regard to   under provisions of  .

 A resident of Junagadh, Renish Mehta has sought HC directions to the state government to frame strict rules for issuance of licences to hotels for selling liquor under provisions of Section 143 of the Gujarat   Act as well as under the Bombay Foreign Liquor Rules.
 
 The petitioner has also sought an inquiry about the class of hotels having licences for liquor sale whether they have status of three star and above according to the criteria prescribed by the Union ministry of tourism, and submitted that if they do not subscribe to the criteria, their licenses should be cancelled
 
 While demanding framing of rules for liquor sale so that public life around   are not affected, the petitioner also highlighted that the guidelines, too, have been ignored by the authorities in granting licences. According to the guidelines, the hotels are required to fulfil preliminary two criteria – they should have three-star or higher status, and there should be no school, college, student hostel, public dispensary, hospital, prominent religious place or slum within 200 meters of the hotel.
 
 The petitioner claimed that there are nearly 55 hotels having licences to sell liquor and the guidelines are not followed in many cases. The status of most of the hotels was rated 10-15 years ago, but many of them have failed to maintain the standard prescribed by the ministry. A fresh check should be conducted with regard to the status of the hotel as well as their location so that the government can reconsider on continuing  .
 
 The petitioner cited the cases from Ahmedabad — Courtyard by Marriott, The Grand Bhagwati, Regenta and The Metropole — where there are either schools, temples or slums situated within a periphery of 200 metres.
 
 Petitioner’s advocate, Sharvil Majmudar, said that the HC sought reply from the government on the aspect of framing of rules to regulate liquor sale because the provisions are not clear for more than half a century.
