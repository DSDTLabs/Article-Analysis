VARANASI: Ballia BJP MP   has alleged that the   leadership was acting on the command of powerful Christian missionaries who were threatening Indian democracy. 

 "Democracy in the north-eastern states has been weakened due to the activities of these missionaries. They are very strong in north-eastern states of the country and are influencing people," he told reporters on Sunday.
 
 Singh said, "   missionary sabse powerful sanstha hai, aur Congress usi ke ishare par chalti hai (Christian missionaries are a powerful institution, and Congress acts on their directions)." 
 
 "Big schools run by these missionaries collect huge amounts of money which is sent out of the country," he said, adding that to counter them schools like Saraswati Shishu Mandir were being promoted in the country. "We believe in democracy and will not bulldoze these (missionary) schools overnight," he added. Singh had earlier targeted Christian missionaries on Ambedkar Jayanti, alleging that they were behind the desecration of statues of B R Ambedkar with a motive to break the social fabric of the country.
