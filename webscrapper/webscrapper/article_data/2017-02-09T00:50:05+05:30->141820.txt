MUMBAI: The   granted   to a 49-year-old man accused of raping a 29-year-old woman after holding that there was no proof of   or  . “She is an educated lady. There is nothing to show that the accused has blackmailed her and therefore, she surrendered to his sexual demands without consent. Except the words, there is nothing to show that she was continuously sexually exploited,” said Justice Mridula Bhatkar.

 The HC then ordered the release of the accused, Inayat Hurjuk, on a bail of Rs 30,000. Hurjuk, who was lodged in jail since his arrest on September 1, 2016, has been directed not to attempt to contact the complainant or pressure her.
 
 In her complaint, the woman had claimed that she had met Hurjuk in 2014, and he had drugged her in his car and then sexually assaulted her. She claimed he made a video clip of the sexual assault and then threatened her that he would upload it on the internet if she refused to continue to have a sexual relationship with him. In April 2015, when she became pregnant, he forced her to go for an abortion, the complainant alleged.
 
 Hurjuk’s lawyers argued that the complainant was an adult and there was a delay of over a year-and-a-half in filing the complaint. They further contended that besides the woman’s statement, there was no evidence and the police had not recovered any video clips from Hurjuk. The prosecution opposed the bail plea and argued that according to the complaint, the woman had been exploited under threat. 
 
 “After considering contents in the FIR..., (there is) prima facie unexplained delay in lodging FIR,” said the judge, while granting bail.
