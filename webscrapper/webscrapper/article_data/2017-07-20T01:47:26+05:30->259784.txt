NEW DELHI: A 41-year-old disabled man, who allegedly threatened   posing as a   sub-inspector, was arrested on Wednesday. Police said, the accused, Harender Malik, had called Hashmi a few days ago and threatened to kill her in an “encounter.”

 Malik, a resident of Loni in  , allegedly told Hashmi that the government had passed a new law — “ghero, aur maaro” (surround and kill) — for all those who don’t possess an Aadhaar card. 
 
 Malik, an unemployed person, confessed before cops that he would dial random numbers from his mobile phone. “If a woman picked up the call, he would try to strike a conversation and then use vulgar language. If she resisted, he would threaten her posing as a cop,” said deputy commissioner of police (southeast) Romil Baaniya. 
 
 In Hashmi’s case, Malik said he was an SI posted at the   police station, cops said. Malik had allegedly used abusive language under the influence of alcohol, Hashmi said in her complaint. Police said Hashmi had called Malik after one of the employees from her NGO complained to her on July 14 that the man had been harassing her over phone for some time. When she called on the given number, Malik made similar threats to Hashmi, cops said. 
 
 Malik is single and suffers from a disability due to polio infection. Police have seized his mobile phone. “He had bought the SIM card with the help of documents issued by his former employer. He has been using it since January 2017,” said Baaniya. 
 
 According to police, a case under sections 419 (punishment for cheating by personation), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of IPC has been registered against the accused.
