Aurangabad: Consul general of Germany in Mumbai Juergen Morhard said that he has not heard a single complaint from German companies about the city in the last two years. 

 He said, “For any place to attract investors, it is crucial to have an improved infrastructure and one key factor that can repel industry investors is red tape-ism. Procedural delays should come down and there should less paperwork.”
 
 He added, “In infrastructural development, city planning, sustainability, energy provisions and acceptability to Internet of Things (IoT) are the aspects that stand out to a manufacturer.”
 
 Automobile giant Skoda, educational institute Indo-German Tool Room and home appliance manufacturer Liebherr are some of the German firms working in city.
