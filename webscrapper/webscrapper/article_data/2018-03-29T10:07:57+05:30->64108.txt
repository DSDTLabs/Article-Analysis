 A: I had earlier visited Gujarat and cities like Ahmedabad, Bhavnagar, Anand and Rajkot with my family. I had accompanied former UK minister Priti Patel for a formal opening of Gujarat office of British high commissioner in 2015. I still have a plenty of places to visit and I am looking forward to relish Gujarati vegetarian food. 
 
 
 
 A: If you ask me about Karnataka elections, I will say I am a diplomat. It is part of my job to engage with different political parties. When I was in Karnataka, I met Congress, BJP and JDS . We take interest in Indian politics like the way we took interest in Gujarat elections. But we do not take sides. 
 
 
 
 
 A: We need to understand Brexit is about choice and it is about sovereignty for British people. We will still remain very strongly a free trade country because it was heart of how we approach the trade for a longer time. One of the things I would say is that we have a key partner like India and as we move to a post-Brexit world, Uk-India relationship will become more important.
 
 
 
 A: I was in J&K recently and had a meeting with CM Mehbooba Mufti. While I leave it on journalists to report on J&K, we also value our engagement with J&K. We would like to see good relationship between India and Pakistan, but it is not our business to tell Delhi and Islamabad what to do. One of the key things to do is to address the issue of terrorism. Gujarat, Mumbai and Delhi suffered terrorism attacks and J&K also suffers terrorism. So it is important to take effective actions against terror groups like Lashkar-E-Taiyaba, Jaish-E-Mahammad and Hizbul Muzahiddin- which all are banned in UK. Laskar-E-Taiyaba also killed and injured British citizens. Fight against terror is not only Indiaâ€™s agenda but it is the common agenda of countries that suffer the challenge of terrorism.
