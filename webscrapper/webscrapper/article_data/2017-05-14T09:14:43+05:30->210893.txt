THRISSUR: Activist  , who had filed a petition in the high court against power minister  , has complained that a team of police officers had asked his wife and son to affix their signatures on blank papers while he was away from home. 

 The activist claimed that the police team visited his home on Friday morning when he was in Kochi to attend court proceedings in connection with his petition. He had demanded action against Mani for his derogatory remarks against  , the women's collective in Munnar.
 
 George said that he had installed six CCTVs at home after he released the visuals of police entering his house. 
 
 He claimed that the police left when his wife and son refused to sign the papers. He alleged that this could be part of a retaliatory ploy to frame him in some cases. He said that he had filed a complaint with the state DGP and other senior officers in this case.
 
 However, Idukki SP   denied the charge and said police had visited his home to hand over the minister's reply. "We had sent the reply by e-mail to Viyyur police with an instruction to hand it over to George in person. When the team from Viyyur arrived, he was not at home. 
 
 The police had asked his family members to sign an acknowledgement receipt. When they refused, the team returned,'' Venugopal said, adding that the activist had accepted the reply that was sent on Saturday by a messenger from Idukki.
 
 The reply given by Idukki DSP stated that the minister had not committed a crime that merited the registration of a case. The reply, a copy of which was made available to TOI, claimed that the director general of prosecution had told that there was no need to register a case against Mani based on the activist's complaint.
