HYDERABAD: If you are one of those who grew up in Hyderabad of the late 90s-early 2000s, you’ll know what we mean when say Tankbund was Hyderabad’s ‘love spot’. Come Valentine’s Day, and it would seem like all the young and restless couples in love converged at the hotspots around  . So much so, Sanjeevaiah and Indira parks used to be synonymous with the moniker ‘lover’s spot’. Shy young couples, holding hands, sharing cone ice creams and stealing a kiss when no one’s looking used to V-day de rigueur. 
Cut to Valentine’s Day 2017, and there seems to be something missing. There’s no love in the air around Hussain Sagar — only that familiar, damp stink. No lovers strolling the lush lawns of  . No glassy-eyed young un’ licking the same ice candy. “Subah se koi nahi aaya... ek ice cream bhi nahi gaya ab tak,” said a vendor at Necklace Road. along with the sullen looking heart balloon vendors and ice cream pushcarts that dotted the city’s “lovers’ spots”, there were police pickets and patrol vans. Sridevi Katta, Inspector at Lake Police. “We increased vigilance and patrolling, just in case. But it has been a very peaceful Valentine’s Day. No moral police either.”
 Haye, haye! Looks like aashiqi is well and truly dead, at Tankbund at least.
