GANDHINAGAR: Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s   (Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik) scheme, aimed to bring flight fares within reach of the common man, the Gujarat government will be starting seven new flight routes, and enhancing regional connectivity with assembly elections just around the corner.

  Under Udan, according to government claims, people will be able to fly within fare costs of Rs 2,500 per trip.
 
 The ministry of civil aviation, government of India, has approved vendors for the seven new routes in Gujarat.
 
  S J  , principal secretary, tourism & civil aviation said, “The government of India’s ministry of civil aviation has cleared seven new routes for regional air connectivity in Gujarat.”
 
 Speaking of the vendors, Haider said, “SpiceJet and Air Odisha have been given contracts for running services on these routes. We have started development of required facilities on these small airports.”
 
 “Process of final clearances from the director general of civil aviation ( ) is expected shortly,” said Haider, adding, “Mostly, the service will be daily and have 9-seater to 40-seater planes. We expect these new routes to be functional by August this year.”
 
 Haider claimed the routes launched under Udan are expected to be a huge success considering tourist and flow of passengers. “We expect clearance for some more routes, too,” he added.
 
 There is a lot scepticism about the success of the new air routes in Gujarat, as earlier such services by private airlines had failed one after another.
