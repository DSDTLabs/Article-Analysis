PATNA: Workers from   prefer to seek work in the states down south, a study has found and indicated that language is not a barrier for the purpose.

 The study was done by Indrajeet Roy of the University of York (England), who shared his findings at a workshop on the ‘Rural-Urban Migration in Bihar’ organised by the International Growth Centre ( )’s   on the premises of Asian Development Research Institute ( ) in Patna on Thursday.
 
 According to Roy, the destinations and occupational profiles of labour migrants from Bihar have changed. “The occupational profile is increasingly diverse with workers not only seeking employment in the usual agricultural, manufacturing and services sectors but also in labour contracting, assistance to land brokers and political mediation fields,” he said.
 
 Presenting his paper, Roy said the main reason for the migration of labour was the perception of self respect and dignity. The other reasons included poverty (pushing out workers from the village) and economic growth (pulling workers out of the village).
 
 “Migration in India is transient, meaning it is unlikely to lead to settled urbanization. The ex-socialist countries of eastern Europe are also witnessing the same kind of transient migration. Rather, migration in India is circular. This means policy makers have to take seriously the portability of social entitlements, housing rights and voting rights,” said Roy.
 
 ADRI’s director (Centre for Health Policy) Basudeb Guha also spoke at the session which was presided over by state labour commissioner  . IGC’s Kumar Das proposed the vote of thanks.
