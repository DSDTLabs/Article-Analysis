 is a trendsetter, whatever he does or endorses, becomes an instant hit. Looks like   of 'Fan' fame has taken inspiration from the superstar. Following in Salman Khan’s footsteps, the petite actress was recently spotted riding a bicycle on the streets of Mumbai. She’s enjoying her rides around town so much, that the actress has decided to ditch the four-wheeler for the humble bicycle. 

  
  
 
 Speaking about her experience, the actress said, "I've always cycled back in Goa. It was the best way to get to the beach or up to the hills spots where all my friends would watch the sunset. We would cycle in groups and never had to depend on any other mode of transportation. So   is not new to me. The traffic situation in our city has increasingly become really bad. So I figured cycling short distances helps with many things, getting to where you want faster and I do my bit to save fuel and its pollution free and of course it helps with staying fit. I think a lot more people should think about adopting this mode."
