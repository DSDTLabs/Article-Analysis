CHANDIGARH: In a bid to check carterlisation by transporters,   chief minister Captain   has allowed the use of   to lift foodgrains and other agricultural produce from grain markets. Soon, the transport department will notify guidelines for grant of permit to tractor-trailers and their registration. The new transportation rates for lifting of food grains had yielded annual savings of Rs 150 crore, claimed the government spokesperson, alleging that the previous government caused losses of Rs 1,250 crore on this account.

 There is no legal bar on the use of tractor-trailers as goods transport vehicles, but as per the 1992 notification of the Union transport ministry, tractor-trolley owners have to register their transport if they intend to use transport commercially.
 
 Punjab transport department has decided to authorise regional transport authorities in sub-divisions and SDO (civil)-cum-SDM in rest of the sub-divisions to grant permit to tractor-trailers for the limited purpose of carrying food grains from a mandi yard or purchase centre to a delivery point not farther than 25 km. Beyond this, a maximum of 12 km can be on a state highway or national highway, mentioned on the permit. The grain delivery point would be a godown, a plinth, a warehouse, a silo, a rice mill or railway siding.
 
 The government has also considered that since tractor-trolleys have been lying idle after the harvest, its decision to allow their use for transporting of food grains will not only help support the procurement process but also generate additional income for the owner. The department has also decided that trolleys need not be called to the office for registration and registration certificates and permits may be issued on the spot in camp mode. The transport department notification will also lay down specifications for obtaining fitness certificates to enable such use of the tractor-trailers.
