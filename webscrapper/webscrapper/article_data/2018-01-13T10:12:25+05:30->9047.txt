PANAJI: The   (GSPCB) has directed mining companies to take short and medium-term measures to control air and water pollution in the vicinity. Measures include installation of wheel washing system at all exits on priority.

 There are around eight short-term and two-medium term measures that have to be taken by mining companies to control pollution.
 
 Pollution board member secretary   said that mining companies should put up geo-net fencing wherever feasible along the road in the vicinity of all residential areas, tar shoulders along the road from the mine to the junctions, install cat-eyes and take delineation measures along mining routes passing through villages, and wash roads during non-usage times in the evening.
 
 Other short term measures include regular cleaning of road shoulders and drainages all along the road from the mine to the major junctions, hot mixing at mine and jetty exits (minimum 50-100m), continued deployment of truck mounted mechanised road sweeping machine and repairing of existing potholes.
 
 The two-long term measures require mining companies to install rumblers at the start of tar roads within the mine and modify existing speed breakers/humps with due no-objection certificate from the PWD, and to install a wheel-washing system at all exists, on priority.
 
 Over 50% leases are likely to resume mining operations by next week with almost all leases being issued the consent to operate by the green board. The   has capped iron ore extraction in the state to 20 MMT per annum.
