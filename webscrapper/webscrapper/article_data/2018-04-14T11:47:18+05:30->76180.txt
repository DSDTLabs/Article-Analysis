NASHIK: Officials of the   of the   (PWD) are awaiting a report that would be filed by the   (NERI) with respect to removing the trees along the stretch between Sinnar Phata and Darna river of the Nashik  , which is left un-widened due to the presence of trees.

 On a petition filed by certain tree activists, the Bombay High Court has instructed NERI to give its opinion on hacking the trees. On the submission of the report, the HC is likely to give its judgement if the trees can be hacked for the road widening project.
 
 The national highways division of the state PWD has awarded the contract to a company to widen the road from Sinnar Phata to Sinnar, a stretch of approximately 25 kms.
 
 While the construction company has finished all the construction work, the 2.5 kms stretch from Sinnar Phata to Darna river is still pending.
 
 While the new widened highway is 22 meters long, apart from the service roads, the un-widened stretch of 2.5 kms is just 7 meters wide. The narrow width of the un-widened road creates a bottle-neck, on the undone road which not only leads to traffic jams but also petty accidents.
 
 On this backdrop, highway officials are hoping that NERI comes out with its report at the earliest so that the work on the unconstructed road can be taken up.
 
 Nashik Pune highway witnesses a huge traffic flow throughout the day. Many people also travel between Nashik Road and Sinnar for work. People who work and stay in Sinnar send their children to schools in Nashik city. The un-widened road has been posing a problem to everyone.
