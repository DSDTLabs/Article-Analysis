NAGPUR: Days after a child was murdered in a Gurgaon school,   has announced plans to frame guidelines to ensure the safety of school students on campus and to prevent abuse.

 Nand Kumar, secretary of the state’s school   department, told TOI that the government will take an aggressive stance while formulating guidelines. “We have a zero tolerance policy against child abuse. My ultimate goal is that our state does not get a single case where a child is harmed,” he said on Friday. “For us, the priority is to prevent such incidents, in which case ‘detection’ is redundant. A There is a plan to see how all resources at our disposal can empower a child.”
 
 Kumar said there is a plan to rope in professional counsellors. “The state was approached by people who shared their experience in working with kids across the world and how they can help at the local level as well. We are listening to everybody and all these inputs will be useful in the final guidelines,” said Kumar.
 
 He hinted at school infrastructure guidelines. “A security audit must also be done and our own people (education officials) can play a major role in it. But, as I said, the plan is being worked out and soon we shall have something concrete,” he said.
