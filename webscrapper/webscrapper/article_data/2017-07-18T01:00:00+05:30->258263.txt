Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s brand of cinema is synonymous with stunning visuals, soul-stirring music and intense characters. As commendable as his craft in storytelling is his ability to spot young, promising talent. 
The filmmaker, who has given   two of its most memorable debuts --   and   ('Saawariya', 2007) -- is all set to launch another industry kid. Waiting in the wings is Jaaved Jaaferi’s son, Meezan. 
 Like the Kapoor juniors, Meezan too has assisted Bhansali ('Bajirao Mastani', 2015). While he has trained in theatre and martial arts, the young lad has also inherited his father’s dancing genes. Not wanting to leave anything to chance, he also completed a four-year course in film making in New York.
 Meezan bagged the part after impressing the filmmaker with his acting abilities and dancing skills at the audition. His leading lady will be announced soon.
 The untitled film will be helmed by Mangesh Hadawale, known for his Marathi film 'Tingnya' (2008) and the Hindi film 'Dekh Indian Circus' (2011), which won many national and international awards.
