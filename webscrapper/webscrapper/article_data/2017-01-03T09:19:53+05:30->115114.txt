BHUBANESWAR: The BJD on Monday accused Prime Minister   of violating the model code of conduct by announcing sops on New Year's eve. It said the PM's annoucements came at a time when the poll code is already in force in the state for the  , scheduled to take place between February 13 and 21.

 The state's ruling party lodged a complaint with the   (SEC). "The Prime Minister has announced a package for farmers, etc, while the code of conduct is in force," the BJD wrote to the SEC and demanded "stringent action" against him.
 
 BJD vice-president  , who submitted the complaint to the SEC on behalf of the party, said the model code prohibits the parties in power, both at the Centre and the state, to announce any financial grants in any form after the poll dates are notified. 
 
 "But the PM in his televised address announced aid of Rs 6,000 for pregnant women, housing aid for rural poor and interest waivers on loans for farmers in gross violation of the code four days after the poll was notified on December 27. This is misuse of power to influence voters," Patro said.
 
 The BJD also took strong exception to issuing of an advertisement in newspapers in Odisha by the Union ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution on January 1 regarding central funding for subsidized rice and wheat in the state. "This is abuse of public money for electoral gains," Patro said.
 
 Defending the PM's speech, the BJP said the BJD is into nit-picking. "The PM's announcement was meant for the country. It has nothing special for Odisha. The Centre can't wait for Odisha poll to get over in matters which are needed for country's economy to prosper," said BJP legislature party leader K V Singhdeo.
 
 On the advertisement by the department of food and public distribution, Singhdeo said it is a public awareness advertisement for people on right to food. A senior officer of the SEC said the complaint is being looked into.
