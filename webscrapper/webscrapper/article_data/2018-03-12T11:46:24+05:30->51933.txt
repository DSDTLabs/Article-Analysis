The Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore ( ) and the   ( ), Madras, have collaborated to offer a certificate programme in technology and management.

 
 "While the programme is not a substitute for an MBA or a BTech, it covers most of the core courses covered in a general MBA programme. It is aimed at giving young students and working professionals with two-five years of experience an understanding of the recent developments in technology and management. It will be useful for those unable to take two years off for a regular in-campus programme," said  , programme director, and faculty in the strategy area at  .
 
 The 10-month programme comprises of 10 courses in management and engineering disciplines and 12 campus-connect sessions in each institute over three modules, delivered by the faculty.
 
 Since inter-disciplinary skills are the need of the hour, this certification will be a great value-addition. On successful completion of the programme, students will receive a certificate.
 
 The programme seeks for a work experience of three years or more, and is also open to IIMB and   students. Registrations have opened in March, and enrolments will begin soon after.
