GUWAHATI: The Regional Science Centre (RSC) here recently organized a city-level   in a bid to motivate students to pursue further studies in science and technology. 

 A total of 30 teams from 30 city schools, with around 60 students from Classes IV to XI, submitted the robots they made. The contest was conducted in two categories - the regular category with non-programmable robots, and the advanced category with programmable robots.
 
 "The main objective behind organizing the event is to popularize robotic activities among students and develop their creativity and problem-solving skills through challenging and educational robotic competitions. These activities will help students increase their positive attitude and motivate them in learning. Students can design their robot for solving real-world problems. This robotic competition can help in learning Maths, Physics or even Engineering," said Basudev Mandal, the project coordinator of the centre.
