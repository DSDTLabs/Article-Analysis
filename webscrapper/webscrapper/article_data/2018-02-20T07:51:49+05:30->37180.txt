LUCKNOW: Cops investigating the   assault case on Monday sought a legal opinion for conducting an ‘identification parade’ of girl students with boy-cut hair to see if the victim Class I student could identify his attacker.

 On January 16, Hrithik   (7) was allegedly stabbed by a senior girl student in the school toilet. The school authorities tried to hush-up the incident but it was exposed by media on the next day following a tip-off by   staff.

 Police will now also record statements of the victim’s two friends who were with him before the incident, said police officials. The blood stains, fingerprints on the knife recovered from the toilet and strands of hair found on the
 
 victim sent did not match with that of suspect girl during forensic analysis.
 
 ASP ( )   said, “The samples sent to forensic science laboratory had got contaminated due to delay since the school did not inform us in time. We had videographed the statements of the boy soon after the incident came to light on January 18.”
 
 “The victim is in good health now and so we will conduct an identification parade. We are taking legal opinion because the issue involves children and minors,” said Katyayan. However, police has still not been able to ascertain the motive behind the attack on the boy.
