LUCKNOW: Land for three satellite bus terminals in Lucknow has been identified in Jankipuram, Vrindavan Yojna and near Polytechnic crossing. 

 It was the identification of suitable site for the terminals that had been keeping the project from taking off for almost a year. 
 
  officials met officers of LDA and   during elections to arrive at a decision. While minutes of the meeting are yet to be released, sources said two of the sites belong to LDA and one to Awas Vikas. 
 
 A five-acre piece of land has been identified near engineering college along Ring Road in Jankipuram. "LDA had kept this land for construction of a bus station under the city development plan." 
 
 On Faizabad Road, near the high court complex, LDA is already constructing a hotel and a bus station. UPSRTC has identified land within the same premises for the bus terminal. Sources said UPSRTC would be given possession of the land after payment of 10% of the cost. The remaining amount will be paid in instalments.
 
 In March last year, UPSRTC had proposed satellite bus terminals on Faizabad Road, Sultanpur Road, Sitapur Road, Hardoi Road and Kanpur Road-all important highways passing through Lucknow-to reduce congestion at Charbagh, Kaiserbagh and Alambagh bus stations. The terminals would also be convenient for people living along highways as they will not need to come to stations in the city. 
 
 "Land has been identified. Modalities for payment now have to be worked out," said UPSRTC regional manager AK Singh.
 
 Though some sites were identified earlier, it was either a land-locked location or the cost was too high.
