MANGALURU: Supporters of Sangh Parivar leader Satjyajit Surathkal have alleged that money has played a key role in the BJP’s distribution of tickets.

 The allegation came to the fore even as scores of Satyajit’s supporters gathered at the Kordabbu Daivasthana in Hosabettu, around 13km from here, and declared openly that a few   leaders had got kickbacks as quid pro quo for   Assembly constituency, where till a few days back, Satyajit was the top contender.
 
 “The party preferred an outsider over Satyanna (Satyajit) who has been fighting relentlessly to protect Hindtuva for the past 35 years. We cannot support a candidature of a person who joined the party recently,” asserted a follower of Satyajit.
 
 Another member demanded that the party should give Satyajit a top post, preferably that of the district party president, by Monday. “The party has already meted out injustice to Satyanna. If it doesn’t make up for its mistake, we will plan our next move,” a supporter said, even as the gathering cheered in support of the opinion. Sanjeeva Matandoor, the BJP candidate from Puttur constituency, is the incumbent district party president.
 
 The third member opined that not supporting the official BJP candidate would dent the BJP’s prospects and that the Congress would have an upper hand in the elections. “Satyanna should not consider contesting as an independent candidate. We should continue working for the BJP, but the party needs to repent its mistake of accepting money,” he said.
 
 Contrary to the allegation of receiving kickback, Union minister for petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan had on Saturday told reporters that the party parliamentary board had selected candidates based only on their “winnability”.
