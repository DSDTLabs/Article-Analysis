NEW DELHI: A court has put on trial a lawyer for allegedly sexually assaulting his minor daughter after rejecting the cancellation report of the police giving him a clean chit.

 Additional sessions judge   pulled up the   for “not showing any sensitivity towards the plight of the child“ and deliberately delaying recording the statement of the 13-year-old girl before a magistrate.
 
 The court refused to accept the cancellation report filed by the police, summoned the accused lawyer after taking cognizance of the offences and framed charges of sexual assault, sexual harassment and threatening his daughter under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and IPC. “I find enough material on record not to accept the cancellation report filed in the matter as the child victim has levelled serious allegation of commission of sexual assault upon her by the accused, who is none other than her father.She had reiterated similar allegations against the accused at the time of her medical examination,“ the judge said.
 
 “For reasons best known to the investigating officer (IO) the statement of the child under section 164 CrPC was delayed for about six days. It appears that during those six days the accused could win over the child,“ the court said. The court framed charges against the lawyer, after he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. He was granted bail after he appeared in the court.
