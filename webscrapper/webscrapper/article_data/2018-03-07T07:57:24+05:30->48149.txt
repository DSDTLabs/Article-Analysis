CHANDIGARH: The three-day   organized by the   government with party MLAs, ministers and bureaucrats had cost over Rs 40 lakh, of which major chuck went towards payment for food and accommodation at a private resort near Parwanoo in  .

 This information was provided by Haryana chief minister   while replying to a question by   MLA   during the second day of the budget session in the state assembly on Tuesday.
 
 According to the CM, Rs 31.98 lakh was spent on accommodation while Rs 7.94 lakh was paid for food. The government spent Rs 15,420 on transportation. Since it was an unstarred question, no discussion could be held on the issue.
 
 Dalal however justified his reason for asking the question. “We were forced to ask what made the government spend such a huge amount at a private resort when better quality hotels are available with Haryana tourism. Secondly, we did not see any kind of public-friendly change in the official machinery after the session. We are not satisfied with the answer as the figure excludes manpower pressed into the action, and the fee paid to celebrities and cost incurred by the government by using its official machinery in another state. In short, we would say that it was criminal wastage of money from the state exchequer.”
