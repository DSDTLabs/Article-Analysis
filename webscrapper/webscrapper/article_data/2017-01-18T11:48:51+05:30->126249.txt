RAIPUR: A petition has been filed in the Chhattisgarh High court, seeking setting up of a special investigation team (SIT) to probe into the alleged fixing of Antagarh (ST) assembly bypoll in Chhattisgarh in September 2014. 

 State Congress president Bhupesh Baghel filed the petition, seeking SIT probe into the allegations that the by-election was fixed as the then Congress nominee   withdrew from the fray at the last minute thus enabling the ruling BJP candidate Bhojraj Naag to win the elections by an impressive margin.
 
 Opposition Congress has been repeatedly demanding a probe into the bypoll fixing scandal after audio tapes surfaced that purportedly contained conversations between former chief minister Ajit Jogi, his son Amit Jogi and chief minister  's son-in-law Dr  .
 
  These purported conversations suggested that a financial deal could have led to the withdrawal of a Congress candidate from the   by- election in 2014 to let the BJP win. 
 
 Rupdhar Pudo, the Ambedkarite Party of India candidate who lost the election, had then filed a police complaint alleging he was contacted by a personal secretary to chief minister and told to withdraw from the fray in exchange for anything.
 
 Manthuram Pawar, a senior tribal leader of the Congress and a former legislator, had surprised everyone by bowing out of contest at the last minute during 2014 by-election. 
 
 Later, he embraced the   (BJP) in March 2015. 
 
 After the controversial audio tapes leaked, the state Congress had expelled its legislator Amit Jogi from the party and had also recommended to party high command to initiate disciplinary action against former chief minister Ajit Jogi for their alleged involvement in the fixing of assembly by-election. 
 
 Besides, the Congress has been pressing for a probe into the role of all others in the election scandal but the ruling BJP dismissed the demand with the argument that it's an internal matter of the opposition Congress.
