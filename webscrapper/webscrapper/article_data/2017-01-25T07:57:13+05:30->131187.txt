PUNE: The   on Tuesday granted an interim   to the   in the Park Xpress housing project at Balewadi in connection with the July 29, 2016   tragedy.

 “No coercive steps, including arrest, shall be taken against the petitioners,” the SC bench of Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghose and Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman said, directing to issue notices to the respondents, including the state of Maharashtra.
 
 The project architect was granted a similar relief on January 13. 
 
 The developers — Kailash Babulal Wani, Arvind P Jain, Shamkant Jagannath Wani (Shende) and Shravan D Agarwal — and architect Pradeep J Kosumbkar had moved the apex court against the Bombay high court’s order of December 23 last year that rejected their anticipatory bail applications. 
 
 The SC bench has since ordered that the special leave petition (SLP) filed by Kosumbkar be clubbed with the SLPs of the four developers and be heard together. “The case is likely to come up for hearing on February 18,” a lawyer associated with the petitioners told TOI on Tuesday night. 
 
 Nine labourers were killed and three were injured when a 13th floor slab caved in at the Park Xpress housing project at Balewadi on July 29 last year.
