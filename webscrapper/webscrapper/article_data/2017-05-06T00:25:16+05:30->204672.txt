THANE: Even as residents from the lake city have been sweating it out from the scorching   over the last few weeks, the rising temperatures at night is also unbearable.

 According to the weather statistics received from the   Municipal Corporation (TMC), the maximum   in the city has been fluctuating between 35 and 40 degrees Celsius; while the minimum temperature was recorded at as low as 25 degrees Celsius on April 28 and as high as 28 degrees Celsius on Friday. The average mercury levels throughout the day have been crossing 20 degrees Celsius.
 
 A resident of Thane’s Devdayanagar area, Aryan Shrivastav, said, “My home is close to Yeoor Hills. Despite this, the weather has not been pleasant these days. Earlier, one could make do with just a fan in summer as we used to get good breeze. But now, it is impossible to stay without a fan or air condition.”
 
 The power cut that was scheduled in parts of Thane added to residents’ woes. “Our situation was terrible on Friday as we faced power cut for a few hours in the afternoon. With no electricity, I was forced to go to the supermarket where there is air condition,’’ said Revathi Iyer, a Ghodbunder Road resident.
 
 Meanwhile, officials from the weather department have blamed the continuouslychanging wind direction for the rising temperature. So, residents may have to brace for some more warm and humid days ahead. 
 
 “As we are in the middle of summer, the northerly and westerly winds are either hot or humid, which is making the climate unbearable. This situation may persist for a week more or even till the pre-monsoon showers arrive a couple of weeks later. While the coastal areas of Mumbai, Thane and Konkan will be dry for the coming week, central Maharasthtra will see isolated pre-monsoon showers,” said Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist at skymetweather.com.
