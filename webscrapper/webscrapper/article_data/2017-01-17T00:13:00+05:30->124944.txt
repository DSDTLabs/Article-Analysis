A case of sexual abuse of   girls at a government-aided residential school in   district in Aurangabad has come to light, close on the heels of the alleged rape of tribal   at an ashramshala in  .

 A class VII girl from the school in Shirur taluka of Beed district, around 150km from Aurangabad, wrote to advocacy group, Lek Ladki Abhiyan, a few days ago complaining about a male teacher who allegedly forced the girls to bathe nude in the open in his presence and also made sexual advances at them at night. The teacher is absconding.

 The Shirur police on Saturday night registered a case against the teacher under various sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 and 354 (A) of IPC.
