She might have been missing from the showbiz for quite some time now, but former Miss Universe-turned-actress   has definitely not lost one bit of her charm. She recently took to   to share few ravishing pictures and must say the lady’s totally slaying it in her all-black avatar. 

 Donning a little black dress, Sush struts towards the camera in matching peep toe stilettos and cat-eye shades. While it's difficult to take our eyes off her boss lady demeanour, the picture’s caption grabs major attention- "Always Love and Respect your #body it's the greatest instrument you'll ever own #homeofsoul #celebrateyourbody #celebratelife YOU ARE PERFECT IN EVERY SIZE, live #healthy own your body and let NO ONE tell you otherwise! Happppyyyyyy Weekend Jaan Meri!!!! love you!!!"
