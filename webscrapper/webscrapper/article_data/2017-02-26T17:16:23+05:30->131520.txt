 Since tracking Internet Protocol (IP) address of the user's server is mandatory to initiate action against culprits, the police has approached Facebook again. 'We have asked Facebook to track down the IP addresses so that we can book the culprits under the IT act and are now awaiting their response,' Jayakrishnan adds.

 While Kavya was not reachable for comment, her dad, P Madhavan explains what made her choose a legal route. 'We were left with no choice, but to take strong action against those, who tried to tarnish her image. How long can one tolerate such slanders?' he asks.
