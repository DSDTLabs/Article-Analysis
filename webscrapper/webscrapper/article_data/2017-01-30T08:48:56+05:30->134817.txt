JALANDHAR: Following the recent “leak“ of an “internal email“ purportedly written by   to Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi with  , the Congress has claimed that this forged mail originated from Delhi CM Arvind  's computer. 

 However, the latter has not only dissociated himself from the mail but has also lodged a complaint with the Election Commission, seeking investigation in the matter and getting a criminal case registered against those who forged his name on the letter and tried to damage Kejriwal's image.
 
 On the other hand, Bajwa tweeted that the letter doing the round on social media in his name was fake. “I will be taking strong legal action against people involved in the act.“ Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh tagged AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal, saying that “staying true to his character, stoops to new lows to fool the people of Punjab. Shame on him!“ Congress claimed that the fa ke letter was traced to the email of Bibhav Kumar, private secretary to Delhi CM.
 
 The email purportedly written by Partap Bajwa reads “your announcement of Capt as the chief minsterial face in Punjab has irked many, including Sherry. Capt has lost esteem and is not able to keep the flock together.It would have been better that we would have kept it open....Several candididates of ours are finding it tough to sell Capt as CM. Capt himself is locked in a tough fight both in Patiala and Lambi ­ as far as reports I am getting.“ It further reads, “Punjab unit has been divided into three, if not more. Capt, PK and Sherry“. It is hurting us a lot in Majha and Doaba. Malwa is already in the grip of AAP.“
 
 Congress leaders and supporters stamped “AAP exposed“ on the letter and tweeted it. However, AAP rubbished the allegation and denied its involvement. Bibhav tweeted in Hindi stating “I am not even remotely connected to the email. Don't drag me into it. My name has been included by use of Photoshop. Be ready for legal action.“
