 Panaji: The Goa police has decided to conduct a special drive to curtail drunken driving and other   violations as part of its bid to prevent road accidents and save lives.
 
 The inspector general of police has issued orders to conduct joint special drives at various junctions across the state.
 
 A police officer said one such special drive was undertaken by traffic police and district police with the assistance of Indian Reserve Battalion on Tuesday at Siolim bridge and Old Market Circle, Margao, during which a number of motorists were booked for driving under the influence of alcohol.
 
 The violators were issued challans and their driving licences confiscated and forwarded to the assistant director transport concerned for suspension as per directions of the Supreme Court-appointed committee on road safety.
 
 About 100 people have been booked in the state since the traffic cell of Goa police deployed four laser speed radar guns to crackdown on overspeeding. Another 100 alcohol meters have been procured to crackdown on drunken driving. Over 800 people have been issued challans for driving under the influence of alcohol this year in the state.
 
 Every 30 hours, a person is killed in a road accident due to rash and negligent driving in the state.
