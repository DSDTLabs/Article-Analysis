He has been in the industry for 17 years, having assisted on and directed a few   films. But when Duniya Vijay’s   releases this month, it will be a new beginning for  , better known as  , who made the film, Yuga. 
In the R Chandru directorial, Yuga Chandru plays one of the main villains, which is his debut in a prominent role, as he also bids adieu to filmmaking. “I have done small roles in my own films and those I have assisted on as well. Kanaka will be my first full-fledged character, wherein I play Ravi Shankar’s brother.   is a good pal and he asked me to do the role. At that point, though, I was very lean and I knew would not have been able to convincingly pass off as Ravi Shankar’s brother. So, I went on a high calorie diet and cut down on workouts, doing only the bare minimum, as I piled on the pounds,” explains Chandru. 
 Going forward, the director-actor wants to focus on being in front of the camera, rather than behind it. “Honestly, I realized that as a filmmaker I still had a lot to learn and my years in the industry were not as successful as I had hoped for. Right now, I want to be an actor and, in the process, hone my skill as a filmmaker. I know that by starting out as a villain, I may get typecast, but I am OK with that. Most of the antagonists in Kannada cinema are from other film industries because there is a dearth of quality baddies. If I can help fill that gap, then why not?” Chandru signs off.
