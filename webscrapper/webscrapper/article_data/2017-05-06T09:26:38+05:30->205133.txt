KOLHAPUR: As the state is facing a major power deficit of 4,000 megawatt, the agricultural consumers complain of major load shedding hampering the power needs of residential, commercial and agricultural consumers in the district. 

 Lack of maintenance of power generation turbines is the major cause of the power deficit. In order to balance the power supply across the district, Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) has started two hours load shedding of agricultural consumers on Thursday.
 
 The Kolhapur zone of MSEDCL comprises of Kolhapur and Sangli district. The sugarcane farmers there require continuous power to irrigate cane. These farmers will now have to face load shedding of two hours during the night time starting from May 5.
 
 Chief Engineer of Kolhapur zone M   said, “The technical issue is temporary. Therefore, we are left with no option except cutting power supply for agricultural consumers. We have decided to cut their power supply during the night. Normally, the slot starts from 10pm to 8am. The load shedding will continue for the next few more days.”
 
 Kolhapur president of state irrigation federation and organisation of farmers Vikram Patil said, “Farmers are soft targets of the government. Farmers have to bear consequences of load shedding. We have already demanded compensation for load shedding in the near future.”
