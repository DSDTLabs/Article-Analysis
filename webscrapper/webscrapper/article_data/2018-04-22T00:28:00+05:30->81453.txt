Trichy: AMMK deputy general secretary T T V Dhinakaran has criticised the state government for allegedly going soft on the central government which had been silent on setting up the Cauvery Management Board (CMB) ignoring the Supreme Court’s orders.

 “They have no guts to take on the Union government over the CMB issue. They have planned to conduct the public meeting only to insist on the implementation of the Supreme Court order,” Dhinakaran told reporters here on Saturday while referring to the state government’s proposed public meetings in the delta districts from April 25 to 29. Dhinakaran was in the city to attend the demonstration organised by his party near the district collector’s office demanding the setting up of CMB. 
 
 “I am wondering as to why the prime minister is hesitating to form the board. The protests against him are echoing in foreign countries also. His silence gives an impression to the Tamil Nadu people that they want the issue to drag on till the parliament elections,” Dhinakaran said at the meeting in the evening. He said that the people would dethrone the state government for its inaction on the issue. 
 
 He also criticized chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswamy for portraying himself as god in a government advertisement shown in cinema halls. Dhinakaran reiterated his stand that the court verdict on the disqualification of 18 MLAs would alter the fate of the EPS government. He also claimed that some of the sleeper cells on the EPS-OPS side would vote against them after the verdict.
