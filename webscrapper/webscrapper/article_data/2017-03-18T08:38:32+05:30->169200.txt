LUCKNOW: Reiterating that he is neither in the race for UP CM’s post nor has been instructed by the party to reach Lucknow as yet, Union minister of state for railway and communication   on Friday said he is enjoying his role at the Centre. 

 Sinha said he does not have any aspirations for the position of UP chief minister and has received no instructions from the party in this regard. “I will think about the CM’s post only after the party speaks to me on the issue,” he said. On speculation that a leader from eastern UP would be given the top post in Lucknow, he said choosing a CM from a particular region can never be the criteria as the CM will develop all regions of the state equally. 
 
 Sinha, who reached Varanasi late on Friday, was scheduled to stay at DLW guest house. However, in an apparent bid to avoid mediapersons present at the guest house, he eventually decided to stay at Hotel Gateway in Nadesar area. During an informal chat with reporters, he said he is in the city as a stopover on his way to Ghazipur where he has to attend the last rites of BJP’s district chief’s mother on Saturday. He said he would leave for Delhi on Saturday night itself.
 
 He also said he would continue his tradition of visiting Varanasi every Saturday to offer prayers at   temple.
