SHIMLA: The last place in the world where you expect   to land is the  . There are no winding coastlines here, but there is still a lot of water.

 And that is precisely what the newly-formed BJP government in Himachal Pradesh wants to exploit as it takes a leaf out of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s seaplane ride ahead of the   in Ahmedabad.
 
 The Himachal Pradesh government is looking to introduce seaplanes in its water bodies to give a bigger boost to tourism in the state. Once introduced, seaplanes could take tourists to high altitude lakes which otherwise need a strenuous trek to reach.
 
 In Kullu district, lakes like Bhrigu, Dashair and Mantalai could be major attractions for tourists while in Shimla, Chandernaun lake has a similar potential.
 
 Chief minister   has already raised the issue of introducing seaplanes in the state with Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin   when they met in New Delhi recently. Thakur requested Gadkari to explore the possibility for having seaplane connectivity to major water bodies as airstrips in the hill state are too small for large aircraft.
 
 Thakur has asked the Centre to conduct a feasibility study for seaplane operations to the lakes. “If seaplane service is started to the high altitude lakes, then tourists would love to visit these places and this could promote tourism,” Thakur told TOI. “Besides tourists, even local residents could use seaplanes to travel within the state.”
 
 Sources added that Himachal Pradesh is facing stiff challenge of attracting tourists with other states too creating elaborate campaigns for their destinations. But the Thakur government is hoping to generate curiosity about its lakes with the seaplanes and become more competitive.
