HYDERABAD: Peddapalli MP  , who is in China on an official visit, wrote an open letter to   chairman   questioning why he was bent upon holding his proposed rally on unemployment when “facts speak that the government was providing jobs.“

 In the letter on Tuesday, Suman said that during the agitation for a separate Telangana state, many who sympathised with the cause had come under the banner of TJAC. He said the position that he had been given by TRS leader   was now being misused by Kodandaram. “You know the truth about how government jobs are being provided and more notifications are being issued. Yet, you want to stick to your stance that jobs are not being provided.You are expected to be truthful,“ he said in the letter to Kodandaram.
