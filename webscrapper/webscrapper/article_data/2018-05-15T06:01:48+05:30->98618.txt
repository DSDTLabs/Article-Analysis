AHMEDABAD: Since 6:30am on Monday, a team of the civic body’s estate department began hammering down a five-storey building on the Pakwan Crossroads on SG Road. The building owners had permission only for the ground floor, and without leaving any margin or parking space, had begun the construction for other floors. Thanks to the high court’s intervention, the   was forced to pull the building down. The building, according to sources, belongs to Shvetank Patel and  .

  On January 25 this year, the AMC had issued a show-cause notice asking the owners to explain in 15 days why the building should not be pulled down. Since the owners did not respond, the town planning department on February 26 issued an order to demolish the building. But strangely, the AMC did not execute the order for over two months.
 
 Last week, while hearing a writ petition (PIL) 170 of 2017, while matters on traffic management and parking were being discussed, petitioner Mushtak Qadri’s advocate   cited the case of the five-storey building. 
 
 The AMC replied that it had already issued a notice and had passed the demolition order. The high court was surprised that the civic body had not taken action for long. 
 
 “The high court asked that if a competent authority like the AMC had already issued demolition orders, why should the AMC require the court’s direction to execute the demolition order,” a senior AMC official said. On Monday, the estate department began the demolition.
