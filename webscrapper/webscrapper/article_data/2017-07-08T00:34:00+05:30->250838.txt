Panaji: The 50th edition of the International Film Festival of India (Iffi) in 2019 is likely to be held at its new premises in the state-of-the-art venue at Taleigao, said director of film festivals Senthil Rajan on Friday.  “We aim to make Goa a permanent Iffi venue and the new premises will serve that purpose. We will have a clear picture about the nitty-gritties by December this year,” he said during the announcement for the upcoming edition of Iffi. Entertainment Society of Goa (ESG) vice-chairman Rajendra Talak said that the existing venue at Maquinez Palace and Old GMC complex has limited scope for activities. “Being a heritage site, there are restrictions with designing and technicalities. We have to keep with the times and move on to a new space. There will be more screens at the new venue, hence the number of films is likely to increase,” he said. The eight-day annual festival will be held on the usual dates from November 20 to 28. The directorate of film festivals (DFF) initiated the process for receiving entries for the Indian Panorama section on Friday. The deadline for submission of entries has been advanced by a month, making it August 7 this year. “Blackbox events focussed around directors and technical aspects of filmmaking will be held this year on the sidelines of the festival.” said Rajan.
