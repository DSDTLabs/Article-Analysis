PANAJI: Not one, but two high towers may come up atop the new  . Sources said one is likely to house an observatory or   and the second, an  .

 Each tower is expected to be around 110m high, while a permanent walkway will be installed on the northern side of the bridge on Pylons 72 and 73 and a passenger lift will carry visitors to the towers from the walkway. The towers are expected to serve as an international tourist attraction on a par with the Eiffel Tower.
 
 Bhopal-based   (DBL) is constructing the new Zuari bridge its debut project in the state. It has teamed up with the Ukrainian company, Mostobudivelnyi Zahin Limited.
 
 In addition, the French engineering group INGEROP, will provide expertise for the cable-stayed section of the bridge, the proof consultant for which is Shanghaiâ€™s Dr Dewei Chan.
 
 The approach roads of the new eight-lane bridge will taper into four lanes and will stretch to Siridao on one side and Verna industrial estate on the other, covering a distance of around 13km. The project will consist of flyovers to allow traffic to pass underneath along stretches such as Siridao.
 
 Over 7km of this project will be constructed at an elevated level in order to allow traffic to pass from below and enable vehicles using the bridge to pick up speed, on the lines of an expressway. It is thereby expected to reduce the 45-minute travel distance between Panaji and   considerably.
 
 As per the conditions of the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH), DBL will have to complete construction of the bridge within three years and will be responsible for its maintenance for eight years.
