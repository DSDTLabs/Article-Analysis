NEW DELHI:   (IRF) moved Delhi high court on Friday challenging Centreâ€™s decision to immediately ban the organisation.

 Its founder and Islamic preacher   said the government failed to give reasons for taking such drastic action under Unlawful Activities Prevention Act ( ) and should have waited for the special tribunal to take a call. 
 
 Justice   asked the government to produce the relevant file on January 17 so that the court can find out if there was compelling material to justify the urgent ban on IRF.
 
 In its plea the foundation has challenged the November 17, 2016, notification of the ministry of home affairs ( ) which had imposed an immediate ban on the organisation under UAPA. According to IRF, the notification gives no reason and cites no material for taking such a step.
