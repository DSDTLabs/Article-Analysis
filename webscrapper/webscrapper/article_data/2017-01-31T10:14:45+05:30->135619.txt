MUKTSAR: Holding a life-size poster of 20-year old   Badal, who has entered the last eight of a TV singing talent hunt show, his mother and five sisters hope that he gets the big prize money.
The result of the February 4 assembly elections is the last thing on their mind.This when in the past three decades, this  , living in a small quarter, has earned money by singing during election campaigning, marriage functions and small events. They are known as mirasi, who are traditional Muslim singers and come from the family of Bhai Mardana, a companion of Guru Nanak Dev.
 
 As far as their party allegiance is concerned, they are split over AAP euphoria and their services for the Badal family. “We understand that the popularity of the   is growing across the state and even here there is a lot of excitement. But we are caught in two minds. When CM saab's wife   was alive, she gave us work at her home and we made our little bucks by cleaning, cooking and maintaining the house.We will decide whom to vote for in a day or two,“ says  , mother of Khuda Baksh.
 
 The family claims that their fame in the market is not because the CM's clan is from Badal village. “It was first because my father Seera Badal, who released seven audio cassettes in the market and became a star.He is no more. Now, it's because of our brother Khuda Baksh,“ says 24-year-old Raftar Badal with pride in his eyes.
