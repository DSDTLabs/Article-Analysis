AMRITSAR: Various France-based NGOs and religious bodies will offer prayers in the memory of Indian soldiers who had laid down their lives during World War-I. They are all set to erect a statue of these unsung war heroes.

 Talking to TOI on Saturday, Iqbal Singh Bhatti, president of Paris-based human rights body Aurore Dawn, said that hardly any French national knew about the martyrdom of Indian soldiers in France. “These are our unsung heroes and not only the French nationals but the whole world should know about them,” he said.
 
 Bhatti said that Gurdwara Baba Makhan Shah Lubana, Le-Bourget, Gurdwara Sant Baba Prem Singh, La-Courneuve, Dashmesh  , Chardi   and Interfaith Shaheede Commemoration would hold religious services on March 18. “The akhand path in the memory of soldiers who sacrificed their lives in World War-I will begin on March 16 and its bhog will be performed on March 18,” he said. Prayers will be offered at   memorial, which has names of 4,700 Indian soldiers who had died in the war.
 
 Interfaith Shaheede Commemoration chief Ramesh Chander Vohra said that a statue of Indian soldiers would be erected at Neuve Chapelle, whereas 4,200-4,500 Indian soldiers had died in a single day in 1915. He said that presently an 11-tonne brass statue was under construction in Hardwar, Uttarakhand, and was likely to be ready by July. It will be transported to France in parts and installed on November 12. “We are having negotiations with an Indian airways company for free transportation of the statue,” he said, adding that four sculptors would be arriving from Hardwar to join the pieces and erect the statue costing around Rs 2.25 crore.
 
 Meanwhile, SGPC president   had made an appeal to the visiting French president Emmanuel Macron to intervene and redress the issues, especially the turban ban being faced by Sikhs living in France.
