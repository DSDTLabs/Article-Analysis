KOZHIKODE: Parents of the deceased engineering student   have approached the Kerala State Human Rights Commission ( ) seeking its intervention for justice in the case relating to the death of their son. 

 Jishnu's father Ashokan KP handed over the petition in this regard to  , acting chairperson of KSHRC, at the Police Club here on Wednesday.
 
 In the petition, the parents have also sought action against the police officers responsible for the alleged police excesses against Jishnu's mother Mahija and other family members, during the agitation staged by them before the office of the state police chief in Thiruvananthapuram on April 5.
 
 The petition said that though the state government authorities had promised to take action against the police personnel responsible for allegedly manhandling Mahija and others, no action has been taken yet even one month after the incident.
 
 Ashokan also alleged that sub-inspector of the Pazhayannur police station and the medical officer at the Thrissur medical college, who conducted the postmortem of Jishnu's body, made concerted efforts to destroy evidence in the case.
 
 Commission acting chairperson P Mohandas said that the commission will take stern action if there were lapses from the part of the police. He, however, said that commission cannot interfere in matters which are before the consideration of the high court and other courts.
 
 "I will forward the petition to KSHRC member   for further action. The commission has already intervened on the issue and will not turn a blind eye if any human rights violations have taken place," Mohandas said.
