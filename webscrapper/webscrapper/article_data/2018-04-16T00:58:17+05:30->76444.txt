Panaji: The Congress on Saturday said that chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s continued absence from the state could compromise Goa’s and the nation’s security.  All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary Girish Chodankar told mediapersons that Parrikar, who is also the state’s home minister, left the state government “headless” and security agencies “directionless”.  “BJP’s ‘Nation First’ slogan appears hollow,” the Congress leader said. “This government is headless and nobody knows who is guiding or directing the home ministry agencies.”  Chodankar said that the Congress would write to governor Mridula Sinha, asking her to “immediately dismiss the government” for the serious lapse.   “There is unrest within the party and party workers are disappointed with the BJP government,” the Congress leader said, adding that several BJP workers are in touch with Congress.
