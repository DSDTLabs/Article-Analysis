HYDERABAD: About 200 parents staged a protest at Government High School, Raj Bhavan Road, on Friday after management refused to allot admissions.

 As per the academic schedule, the   reopened after summer vacations on Friday. Scores of parents gathered at the school premises to seek   for their wards. Parents claimed that on April 12, when the school closed for summer vacation, the management had assured to commence admissions on the first day of reopening. “We’ve been waiting for the school to reopen to admit our children. However, the management just refused to offer admissions leaving us in a lurch,” said a parent.
 
 It was a rare sight wherein parents were protesting to seek admission in a government-run school, which was inaugurated by Governor ESL Narsimhan in June last year. Although the school building was established in 1953, it was in a dilapidated condition. However, the governor took the initiative and turned it into a swanky building at a cost of ?4.50 crore with 24 CCTV cameras, 20 book shelfs, RO plant, laboratory equipment, computer laboratory with 25 systems, digital library with 15 computers, LCD projectors, 21 classrooms and a dining hall.
 
 When TOI contacted school headmistress Manju Latha Narre, she clarified that there are insufficient classrooms and teachers to accommodate additional students. “Although the capacity for each classroom is 42, we have 55 students in each class. The school has already given admission to100 students in Class 1. There were no more vacancies. Even in higher classes, there are 60 students in each class, much higher than the capacity,” said Narre.
 
 Following the nuisance, the school management had to call in Punjagutta police to control law and order situation.
