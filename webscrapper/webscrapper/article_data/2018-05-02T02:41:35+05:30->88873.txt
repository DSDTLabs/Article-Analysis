MUMBAI: Two law tests, for  , have been scheduled on the same day, adding to the chaos in the law faculty. 

 While   commences on May 15 and ends on May 23, semester I exams, according to the time table released by the  , commences on May 23 and ends on May 31. "One paper each from semester I and II falls on May 23 and at the same time. Students who did not give the semester I exam in January and are appearing for the exams in May along with semester II exams are in a fix. They will be unable to appear for one of the May 23 papers. Students who appeared for semester I in January and have a KT in the paper scheduled on May 23 will also lose one opportunity," said Sachin Pawar, president of Law Students' Council that has written to the university. 
 
 An LLM student said, "The MU cannot even prepare exam schedules carefully. It is callous and irresponsible behaviour."
 
 The   in January allowed LLM students to take semester I exam in January or in May, as they had very little time to prepare as admissions were delayed and concluded only on January 10. While the university scheduled the exam on January 17, it was later postponed to January 23. Students moved court seeking postponement of exams as the mandatory 90-day semester was not attained. The HC, however, directed the MU to allow the stude- nts to choose either the January exams, or May one along with semester II exams in May.
 
 An official from the university's exam section said that the section will hold a meeting to discuss this in a day or two and fix the problem.
