Indore: In absence of DNA test facility, MY hospital administration contemplates to approach All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS), Delhi in its bid to cure seven members of a same family possibly suffering from spinocerebeller ataxia disease.

 Five days ago a 21-year-old woman from Barwani district reached the hospital for treatment against difficulties in swallowing foods, speaking, walking and standing.
 
 The doctors including Dr Sanjay Dubey and Dr Paridhi Shivde studied the case and came to know that apart from the woman, other six members of her family were suffering from the same ailment.
 
 Thereafter, all of them including three women- Kali Bai, Jhimali Bai and Bhanturi Bai and four men- Sakharam, Khubsingh, Sadhusingh and Rupsingh, all between 21 and 55 years of age, got admitted in the hospital.
 
 “We first suspected it to be a case of chikungunya, but after the medical test, family history and magnetic resonance imaging of the patients we established that it is a rare genetic disorder and probably a case of spinocerebeller ataxia,” Dr Dubey told TOI.
 
 It is not infectious but is a more rare chronic disease that can even cause death, he added.
 
 “We are seeking information about such cases in the central registry of rare disease, if there is any. There are 20 types of spinocerebeller ataxia and to confirm the same, DNA test of the patients is need to be performed. As the facility is not available here, we have planned to send some of patients to AIIMS, Delhi,” said Dr Dubey.
 
  superintendent Dr VS Pal said that the administration is availing all the resources available to help the patients in getting the treatment and have planned to send the patients to AIIMS Delhi.
 
 Meanwhile, the doctors have started providing supporting-treatment, including physiotherapy and muscles strengthening medicines to the patients.
