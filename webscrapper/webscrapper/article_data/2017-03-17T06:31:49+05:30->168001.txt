 However, the formation of a registered body for squash has brought cheers for the budding squash players in the city. The players that earlier had to only settle for school level tournaments here will now be able to take part in open tournaments. 
 
 “This is a positive sign for the sport and under this registered association the players will be able to take part in various state and national level tournaments that couldn’t happen earlier,” said Nitin Singh, a squash player from the city.
