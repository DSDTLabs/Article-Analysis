DHARAMSHALA:   of   Captain Saurabh Kalia, who was martyred in Kargil and his  , was moved by another incident of   that came to light on Monday. During Kargil war on May 15, 1999, Captain Saurabh and five other soldiers of 4 Jat Regiment were captured by Pakistan and their bodies were returned gruesomely pierced.

 N K Kalia, a retired scientist, condemned the act of Pakistan and raised the demand from the Indian government to come clear with its policies on such inhuman act of the neighbouring country.
 
 “We are requesting again from the Indian government to form a strict policy. At least, such inhuman acts should be barred and our government should act fast in such serious issues,” said Kalia, adding that silence of the government de-motivates the families of soldiers.
 
 Kalia was fighting a battle, moving pillar to post from last 17 years to seek justice for his elder son, Saurabh, who sacrificed his life for his country in the prime age of 22 years. Martyr Kalia had succumbed to the barbaric and inhuman torture of Pakistani army during the Kargil war. He was kept in captivity for over 23 days.
 
 On June 9, 1999, N K Kalia had received the body of his son. He had moved the Supreme Court in 2012 seeking a direction to the ministry of external affairs of India to approach the ICJ (international court of justice) for action against Pakistani army men who killed his son in violation of ‘Geneva Convention on treatment of war prisoners’.
 
 He said the way Sri Lanka has ended up fighting against LTTE (Liberation tigers of Tamil Eelam), India should also start a campaign against terrorists hidden in and around Jammu and Kashmir which is the only solution for the increasing terror incidents in the region.
