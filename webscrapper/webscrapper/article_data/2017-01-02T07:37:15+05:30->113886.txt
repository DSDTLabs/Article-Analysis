 However, the civic body has denied any action or enquiry against officials of the town planning department who gave the sanction.
 
 Municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar passed an order in the regard on Friday. “The cancellation order has been given as multiple persons, including   (NIT), claimed ownership of the land. The question of enquiry or action against town planning department officials does not arise as documents submitted for sanction were proper according to norms,” he said.
 
 Claiming ownership of the land admeasuring 16,140 sq ft, Nalini Bute had got sanctioned flat scheme of basement+11 floors. On behalf of Bute, Prayag Developers and Builders started constructing the flat scheme and did work up to the first floor.
 
 NIT raised objection and claimed that the land was for public utility and reserved for veterinary hospital.
 
 Process Server   too opposed the sanction citing land owned by the NIT and reserved for veterinary hospital. Following the objections, Hardikar imposed stay on the construction and asked Bute to approach Superintendent of Land Record (SLR) and clear the demarcation.
 
 TOI highlighted the irregularity in its report on December 17. Referring to TOI’s report, activist Ankita Shah demanded Hardikar to cancel the building plan sanction and take action against the officials concerned.
 
 Now, NIT will approach SLR and get the land demarcates. The NMC’s Laxmi Nagar zone office will have to issue notice under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act directing Bute to demolish the structure.
 
 Bute has the option to challenge Hardikar’s order in the high court or with the state urban development department.
