SURAT: The traffic police’s experiment to test vehicle flow on the flyover at Athwa Gate turned out be a huge disaster on Tuesday as it caused sheer madness on the road with thousands stuck in a jam for hours.

 The police closed one side of the flyover bridge at Athwa Gate going towards Sardar Bridge from Old RTO circle to check the traffic flow. The intention was to see if the situation if this bridge is not available and the resulting load at Athwa Gate crossroads. The traffic was diverted directly to Athwa Gate crossroad. 
 
 Thousands of cars, two-wheelers, ambulances, city buses school buses and other vehicles were stranded in the traffic snarls and the situation remained frustrating till late night at Athwa Gate and Majura Gate. All stretches connecting Athwa Gate as well as Old RTO Cricle were thrown into complete chaos since afternoon.
 
 Police also closed the intersection under the flyover bridge and did not allow vehicles coming from   to take a turn towards Athwa Lines. The vehicles coming from   or T&TV School in Nanpura had to take the turn from Old RTO circle. 
 
 “We are testing the flow of vehicles if we keep one side of flyover closed. There was traffic jam but it is temporary and I think we will have to discontinue it,” said B R  , deputy commissioner of police, traffic.
