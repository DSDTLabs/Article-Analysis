NEW DELHI: A 32-year-old man died after being allegedly beaten by the staff of a government hospital in southwest Delhi’s Jaffarpur Kalan on Monday. 

 Family members of the victim, Sonu, alleged that he was beaten up when he objected to the line of treatment given to his physically challenged wife, who was admitted in the hospital. 
 
 Sonu’s wife Radhika said that she had taken medicines that did not suit her because of which her health deteriorated and she had to be hospitalised. “My husband was not satisfied with my treatment at the hospital and he told that to the doctors present there. They, in turn, shouted at him and dragged him to another room that was adjacent to the one where I was admitted,” she said. 
 
 She said that her brother-in-law and nephew were present outside her room and saw Sonu being taken inside another room. He was allegedly thrashed there as his relatives heard his screams for help.
 
 “We went to Radhika and told her Sonu was being beaten, soon after which she rushed to check on him. He was lying unconscious,” said Vivek, Sonu’s nephew.
 
 Radhika said that she, along with Sonu, returned home. But as the pain started aggravating, Sonu was rushed to the same hospital again. The doctors, however, refused to treat him and referred him to DDU hospital in west Delhi, where the doctors declared him dead on arrival.
 
 
  
 
 Addition DCP (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said that they have registered a case. He said that postmortem has been conducted and they are waiting for the reports.
 
 Another police officer, meanwhile, said that Sonu was an alcoholic and that could possibly be one of the reasons his health deteriorated. He said that Sonu was heavily drunk when he came to the hospital and started arguing with the hospital staff. 
 
 “My husband was the only earning member of our family. Now there is no one to take care of me and my one-year-old twins,” sad Radhika.
