Pune: With work on the   rail route over   set to begin in right earnest, officials have announced the measures that will be taken on the stretch.

 For traffic, two lanes will be set aside on both sides of the road, with the central portion being taken up for the Metro rail work. The central portion will be around 9 metres wide, official said. 
 
 On either side of this section, a 7m-wide carriageway, split into two lanes, will be available for vehicular use. 
 
 This was done in consultation with the traffic police department, in a bid to minimize congestion in peak hours. 
 
 MahaMetro has started reducing the width of footpaths and shifting the electric poles on Karve Road. The work is expected to get over in the next 20 days, following which the traffic department will also impose one-way traffic restrictions near Nal Stop and Paud Phata.
 
 MahaMetro officials regard Karve Road as the most challenging stretch on the Vanaz-Civil Court corridor. The route along this entire stretch is elevated and has been planned either on the middle of the road or alongside. A portion will run along the riverside road.
 
 “We are discussing traffic management with the traffic police. Steps are being planned to complete the work in the shortest time. We will also begin the work on double decker flyover, along with the work of building a viaduct. This will help us complete the work in a short time,” a MahaMetro official said. 
 
 The added that there was no need to cut the width of footpaths on the entire Karve Road stretch, and that it will be done only where needed.
