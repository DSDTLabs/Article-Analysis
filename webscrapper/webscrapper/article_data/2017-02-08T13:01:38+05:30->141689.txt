NAGPUR: Dreaded wildlife poacher Mohammed Shamim Hasan, wanted in neighbouring state of Madhya Pradesh, was arrested at Anwarganj in Kanpur on Sunday.

 The special task force (STF) of MP had sought cooperation of UP STF to nab Shamim, who is wanted in a wildlife offence registered in Narsinghgad division in Rajgarh. Accordingly, the UP STF senior police superintendent Amit Pathak asked additional SP Dr Arvind Chaturvedi to trace Shamim. 
 
 On February 5, the Kanpur STF cell got a tip-off that Shamim was to meet a person at Anwarganj. The STF teams of both the states, headed by Ritesh Sirothia, laid a trap and nabbed Shamim.
 
 Shamim is a notorious poacher engaged in the illegal business for over two decades. In 2001, police had seized huge consignment of nails and skins of  , leopard and other animal from his house. In 2013, his brother Shakil too was arrested with   scales and skin from Kanpur.
 
 According to Chaturvedi, in 2007, he nabbed Shamim’s brother Shabbir Hasan Qureshi and his two sons Sarfaraz and Sartaj along with 13 others from Kareli in UP and seized three tiger skins and75kg bones.
 
 All the 16 accused were sentenced to seven years imprisonment in this case which was later taken over by the CBI. Chaturvedi said Khaga (Fatehpur) in UP is infamous hub of tannery industry since the British period.
 
 Later differences cropped up between Shamim and Shabbir. Shabbir settled in Kareli and Shamim in Kanpur. Both had deep rooted contacts with Pardhis and Bahelia poachers in MP besides Nepali traders like Tamang Tsiring.
 
 Kareli case was the first wildlife case in UP in which Narco test was conducted on three accused. Enforcement Directorate too had filed a case under Prevention of   Act.
 
 Recently, Shamim and Shakeel had been key players in pangolin scale trade. They used to ‘encourage’ poachers in   and Itarsi for target pangolin and supplied it to one ‘Chacha’ in Kolkata who forwarded the kill to the North-East.
