LUCKNOW: From one florist's shop to another, Ritesh hopped in search of an attractive, reasonably priced bouquet for his beloved but the high price forced him to settle for a smaller bunch.

 Though a hike in price of flowers ahead of Valentine's Day is not unusual, this year, elections have made them costlier. Owing to high demand in rallies and political events prior to the elections, the wholesale as well as retail price of flowers has risen. “Because of steep rise in demand, cost of Indian as well as imported flowers has soared to 30% in wholesale markets and its impact is witnessed on market price. This season, customers will have to shell out at least Rs 300 for abouquet of 10 roses that usually cost around Rs 150,“ said  , a wholesale dealer.
 
 student Rahul rued, “I planned to get my girlfriend a bouquet of roses of different colours or orchids but the price hike has ruined my plans.“
 
 Government employee As hutosh   said, “I had plans to decorate our garden for my wife on Valentine's but my budget exceeded significantly.“
 
 “Quintals of (desi) flowers are sent for a campaign or a rally so an impact is seen on their cost too. Roses and marigolds that were sold for Rs 30 and Rs 20 per kg now cost no less than Rs 50 and Rs 30, respectively,“ said  , a florist from Chowk market. The increased demand of flowers has also led to unavailability of proper delivery options. “There are few dealers who offer midnight delivery but even those are heavily booked this time,“ said  , a businessman.
