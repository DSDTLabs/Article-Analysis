PATNA: With   just around the corner, ‘tilkut’ traders are working 24X7 to cater to the demands of their customers.

 The price of ‘tilkuts’ made of sesame and sugar or jaggery ranges from Rs 200 to Rs 400 per kg. While ‘khoya tilkuts’, ‘til laddoos’ and special jaggery ‘tilkuts’ are in demand, sugar-free ‘tilkuts’ have also become popular.
 
 ‘Tilkut’ is a traditional sweet which is painstakingly made by a group of three to five workers. Sugar syrup is prepared and kneaded with ‘til’ in a utensil. Later the dough is flattened with the help of a heavy pestle. It is a labour-intensive process which requires patience and caution.
 
 “More than six workers have been engaged in ‘tilkut’ making for the last 15 days. Every day they prepare over 35kg of the sweet,” said  , a ‘tilkut’ trader near Patna Museum. He added, “We have introduced sugar-free ‘tilkuts’ keeping in mind our health conscious customers.”
 
 Another trader  , who has been selling ‘tilkuts’ on Boring Road for 10 years, expects better business this year. He said, “I have sold over 40kg of ‘tilkuts’ in 15 days. Last year we suffered losses due to note ban.”
 
 According to city-based doctor  , people should consume ‘til’ owing to its medicinal properties. “It keeps the body warm in winter and has a high content of vitamins and minerals. ‘Til’ reduces blood pressure, lowers cholesterol, prevents cancer and is also good for digestion,” he told this reporter and advised diabetics to refrain from eating too many ‘tilkuts’.
 
 Apart from their unique taste and the health benefits they offer, ‘tilkuts’ packed in colourful boxes are also attracting Patnaites. Homemaker Swati Ranjan, who was buying jaggery ‘tilkuts’ from a store near Boring Road roundabout on Wednesday, said her family members had been eagerly waiting for   because “everyone loves eating ‘tilkuts’ on the day”.
