COLVA: While erosion of sand along the coast is a regular monsoon phenomenon, this year the erosion is more severe and has started well before the onslaught of the rainy season. Large sections of shore have been swallowed up by the turbulent sea. 

  Over 40km of the coastal belt in Salcete and Mormugao talukas, right from   beach to Baina beach has eroded, raising concern among locals. The last time such a phenomenon was experienced was in 2014 said Mario Fernandes, a traditional fisherman from Benaulim. 
 
 Cansaulim-based fisherman Jose Caitan who lives close to the beach said that unlike earlier, the erosion has been unusually severe this season.
 
 In Benaulim and Sernabatim, there has been a sharp drop in the shore level due to large chunks of sand being washed off due to strong wave activity. Another victim of the turbulent sea has been watersports activities. These have ground to a halt. 
 
 A scientist said turbulence increases during monsoon. The wind and wave action eat into the sand due to lack of vegetation and it is a normal phenomenon.
