KOLKATA: It was a post from her niece that alerted Las Vegas resident Anna Azabi about the   back home. The writer, who is currently in Kolkata visiting homes run by the   , spent all day glued to the TV, watching the news and witnessing the toll gradually mount.

 “I had landed in Kolkata amid the festivity and was marvelling at the sheer grandeur of Durga Puja and the installations on the streets and how similar it is to Las Vegas, which is a city on a perpetual celebration mode, when this terrible incident happened. I have been down with fever. So when Iheard about the firing, I grew extremely anxious,“ she said.
 
 Anna lives at Henderson Neveda, a 15-minute drive from the Mandalaya Bay hotel in the Strip area where the firing left 50 dead and over 200 injured. “The first thing I did was get in touch with my niece who visits the Strip area of ten with friends. Thankfully , she was in Los Angeles at the time. But my heart goes out to the families who have lost their loved ones,“ she said.
 
 The Strip is the main attraction of Las Vegas. Both sides of the Strip are dotted with beautiful hotels, casinos and restaurants. People from all over the world visit the place to enjoy the night life, food, shows and activities in the world's best hotels like MGM, Pa ris Tropicana, Cosmopolitan and Bel lagio. “Las Vegas is nothing without the Strip, an area 3-4 miles long. It is al ways buzzing with activity and never sleeps. But on Monday night, I believe there was deathly silence. It was as though Strip had gone to sleep,“ she said.
 
 Anna has been able to contact her sister Tracy Johnson, who too lives in Vegas, and was glad to learn she was safe. There are many others whom she hasn't heard from. “I am trying to advance my return from October 12 to October 5. I need to be home and with everyone,“ she said.
