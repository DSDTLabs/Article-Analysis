CHANDIGARH: Though the process for selection of director principal at   and hospital (GMCH)-32 has started, first time there is a growing demand by the   for segregation of this post. On the pattern of  ,   faculty are demanding separate posts for principal and director. 

 
 Recently a new faculty association has been formed that has placed a demand for the same. Sources inform that the faculty had reasoned that as Punjab recruitment rules are followed by the medical college, segregation of the post must be applicable too. However there are others who contest. "We have only one medical college in the city unlike Punjab. So how can we have a separate post ?" said a faculty member. 
 
 However, officiating director-principal Dr BS Chavan expressed his unawareness about any such demand by the faculty. "I have not received any such communication till now on this." 
 
 The demand by the faculty is based on offering opportunity to senior doctors to apply for two posts. "The director cannot give time for the college and also carry on with administrative work. This reason is that there are separate posts in Punjab. Similarly, with the enhancement of   and postgraduation seats, burden on principal increases," said a senior faculty.
