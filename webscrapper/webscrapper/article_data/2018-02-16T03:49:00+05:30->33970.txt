Ponda: The Goa State Agricultural Marketing Board has constructed a sophisticated ‘Agri Bazar’ at Marketyard, Ponda, on the Nirankal road. 

 The facility is equipped with all modern facilities, from grading to ripening of fruits and spices, under one roof, and will also have a retail bazaar, auctioning mandi, etc, so that farmers can auction their produce at the market yard without any middleman, board director, Sunil Desai, said.
 
 While the facility of a fumigation chamber would be made available to farmers in the first phase, two cold storage rooms of 10 tonnes each and ripening chambers of 10-tonne capacity would be added in the second phase. The bazaar already has a 20-tonne cold storage room.
 
 The project has been constructed at a cost of Rs 29 crore, of which 75% of this share —Rs 21 crore— has been contributed by the Union government through its Rashtriya Krishi Vyapar Yojana (RKVY), while 25% of the cost (around Rs 7 crore) has been borne by the board.
