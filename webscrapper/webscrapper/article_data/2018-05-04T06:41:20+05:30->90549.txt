BENGALURU: The newly formed   (BCU) has proposed to the   to bring under its ambit three colleges with an aim to develop a  .

 They are Ramnarayan Chellaram College of Commerce on Race Course Road, Government Science College on Nrupathunga Road and Government Arts College on Old Post Office Road.
 
 “We’ve sent a proposal to include these colleges which are adjacent to the  , and the higher education department is considering it. These neighbouring colleges are now constituent colleges affiliated to BCU and if they become a part of the Central College campus, we can build a centre of excellence. The Central College can become a research centre then. There will be faculty, sharing of knowledge and infrastructure. Some departments in these colleges are good and we need not replicate the same infrastructure or hire faculty in neighbouring colleges,” vice-chancellor S Japhet said. 
 
 According to him, administration will also be hassle-free. At present, permission is needed from the university as well as the directorate of collegiate education for faculty sharing. “Curriculum, faculty, infrastructure like libraries, canteen and sporting facilities for 15,000-20,000 students in all these four colleges can be shared. Central College alone has three or four blocks divided by roads. We want to build skywalks to link them,” he added.
 
 Japhet also expressed interest to bring Maharani College on Seshadri Road under BCU’s jurisdiction. BCU now has 239 colleges and another 15 have applied for affiliation.
