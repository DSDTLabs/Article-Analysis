AHMEDABAD: To speed up ‘non-agricultural’ land use permissions for areas around major cities and nagar palikas and to open up land for development, the state revenue department has nearly eliminated much of the procedural delays. The department has heavily relied on ‘self declarations’ by the applicant to speed up the NA permission process. The collector in each district is the nodal authority for  .

 On Tuesday, a notification from the revenue department stated that applicants need not submit maps or layout plans for NA permission. If the said land is under a nagarpalika and was incorporated within a town planning scheme, the applicant will only need to submit an application stating clearly the purpose for which the NA permissions is being sought. The rider here is that the applicant will have to submit a ‘self declaration’ before the collector stating that the “applicant has full knowledge of the reason why NA permission was sought and that if authorities come across any discrepancy the said permissions can be withdrawn and penal action can be taken against the applicant.” 
 
 In case of areas partially under nagarpalikas and not incorporated in TP schemes, the applicant will have to file a ‘self-declaration’ that there is a provision for a 12-metre approach road to the property. Only then will NA permission be granted, the revenue department notification says.
