 Pink schooled a troll when he called her 'so old' on social media. 

 The 38-year-old hit back at the abuser after he tagged her in a tweet which read "wow   looks so old she should be named Purple instead". 
 
  
  "You must be from LA, well, there are a few people left in the world that choose to age naturally. And I've earned every f***** minute of my 38 years. How you lookin' though?, Cause I never heard of ya 'til you put my name in your mouth. I shall call you little purple troll. (sic)" Pink replied. 
 
  
  The   singer later said she is proud to be   and believes in embracing the signs of ageing as that means she has lived the life to the fullest. 
 
  "I am of the mindset that it's a blessing to grow old - that if your face has lines around your eyes and mouth it means you've laughed a lot, I pray I look older in 10 years, 'cause that will mean I'm alive," she said.
