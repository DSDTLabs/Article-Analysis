PANAJI: Residents of   and   will soon have access to better transport facilities as a mini-depot is being set up in these locations by the   state transport corporation limited (KTCL). Each of the depots will run 35 buses from the existing   fleet.

 “It will take two months for these depots to be fully operational. The bus fare will not change for these routes,” said KTCL general manager, Sanjay Ghate.
 
 The existing staff from the Panaji depot along with buses from Panaji,   and Vasco depots will be deployed at the two new depots. Long buses and mini-buses (also called shuttles) will run from these depots. Buses may also be sourced from KTCL’s Porvorim depot, sources said.
 
 Besides coming as a relief to residents of Ponda and Valpoi, it will also reduce the pressure of housing the fleet of buses at the existing bus terminuses, a KTCL official told TOI. “There is very less space at our Margao and Vasco depots, while the Panaji depot is getting increasingly crowded every year. By diverting buses to new depots, the burden on existing depots will reduce,” the official said.
 
 Land has been acquired in Ponda by the KTCL authorities near the Kadamba bus stand for the construction of the new depot. In Valpoi the depot will come up near the existing bus stand.
 
 There are also plans of starting a new depot in  , and though the location has not been decided yet, KTCL is hopeful that given the expanse of the taluka, they will find a substantial amount of space for a new depot.
 
 “Starting a depot for residents of these areas may motivate them to take up public transport, which in turn can curtail the flow of private vehicles from these places,” a KTCL official said.
