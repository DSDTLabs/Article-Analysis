BHUBANESWAR: Suspected   virus allegedly attacked   of Berhampur   in Ganjam district on Tuesday, first of its kind reported so far in the state.

 "We found something wrong in the hospital's data system. We are in touch with the experts of national informatics centre. It appears to be a WannaCry cyber attack. But we may be wrong. There could have been some technical snag in the system. A clear picture will emerge on Wednesday morning," Berhampur sub-collector Sidhartha Swain told TOI. Swain didn't confirm whether the computers were hacked or the hackers demanded any ransom. 
 
 A day after state Crime Branch issued an advisory to prevent spread of WannaCry, the state electronics and information technology department on Tuesday asked secretaries of all departments and district collectors to remain alert. “We uploaded an advisory on the state government’s official website (http://odisha.gov.in). Adequate steps are being taken to protect the government data system in computers,” said electronics and IT secretary Ashok Meena.
