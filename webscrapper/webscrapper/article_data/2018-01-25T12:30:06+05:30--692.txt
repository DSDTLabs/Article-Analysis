VADODARA: After the goof ups made ahead of the state assembly elections last year, the district election authorities have continued making more mistakes ahead of the gram panchayat polls too. 

 In the latest round, a lecturer of M S University’s   on Wednesday morning was shocked when he received an order served by the district election officials to join the election duties as a peon. 
 
 Chirayu Pandit, who presently works as a lecturer at the civil engineering department of the college received the order which was signed by the mamlatdar (rural) of Vadodara. The order stated that Pandit should report at Narmada Bhavan on Thursday as he will be assigned the duty of peon at an election booth during the polls on February 4. 
 
 Shocked by such an order, Pandit has written a letter informing the government official of the error. In his letter, Pandit has stated that he is not just working as lecturer but is also pursuing his PhD and serving as deputy director of communication cell at  . 
 
 “As per MSU rules, deans, directors and deputy directors cannot be assigned such poll duties,” his letter states. 
 
 But apart from the goof up, concerns are being raised in the campus on the consecutive poll assignments that university staffers are being given by the district administration. 
 
 While 29 peons of Polytechnic College in all have been assigned poll duties for the forthcoming elections, six teachers of Faculty of Performing Arts have also received orders to join poll duties. 
 
 “With back to back semester exams and a shorter semester ahead, we are finding it difficult to complete our course given that many a teachers were already assigned poll duties during the assembly elections,” said a teacher.
