Vadodara: Concerned over the possibility of water scarcity hitting the city, functionaries of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) approached deputy chief minister Nitin Patel during his visit to the city on Monday with a demand that the state government should release Narmada water into the Ajwa reservoir. 

 Patel assured the functionaries that this would be done within the next few days.
 
 Elected representatives including VMC mayor Bharat Dangar, Vadodara MP Ranjan Bhatt, MLAs and others raised the issue of a possible water crisis with Patel at a meeting. The elected representatives pointed out that nearly one-third of the city received water from Ajwa Reservoir where water level was depleting consistently.
 
 A BJP city unit communique stated that when Patel was requested to ensure release of water from a Narmada branch canal near Ajwa reservoir, he called up officials and gave them necessary instructions. The release stated that Patel told the representatives that water supply from the canal would begin in two or three days. Dangar had also written a letter to Patel last week in which he had pointed out that some areas of the city were dependent on water from the reservoir.
