PATNA: A group of about 30 people, who have come all the way from Amritsar, were busy preparing ‘karah prasad’ or ‘halwa’ in a small room near the   on Monday even as devotees were queuing up at the gurdwara to offer obeisance to tenth Sikh Guru Gobind Singh.

 Members of the group, all sewadaars, prepare the ‘karah prasad’ at   in Amritsar too under the aegis of  . “These sewadaars have expertise in preparing ‘karah prasad’ in large quantity as they work at Golden Temple. From January 3, footfall of devotees would increase manifold. Hence, we decided to rope in these sewadaars to prepare the ‘prasad’ for the large number of devotees,” said SGPC secretary Dr Roop Singh.
 
 Sarvanjeet Singh, who is leading the volunteers in the noon shift, took this TOI reporter to the room where the ‘prasad’ is prepared. “Ghee, wheat flour and sugar are used in the ratio of 1:1:1 to make ‘karah prasad’ at Golden Temple. However, here we are using 600kg each of wheat and sugar and 400kg of ghee everyday,” he said. Asked why the 1:1:1 ratio is not followed here, he said, “This is what the Patna Saheb committee has asked us to do. While they are providing all resources, we are providing manpower,” he said.
 
 The   gurdwara is also famous for ‘pinni’ or ‘ladoo’ prasad. The same set of volunteers is preparing ‘pinni’ too. A machine is being used to mix flour and sugar. After the mixture is prepared, it takes the shape of ‘peda’. The ‘peda’ is then roasted in ample amount of ghee to make ‘pinni’.
 
 “All the sewadaars working here have to do a prayer before entering the room. No eatable is allowed because it’s a matter of devotion,” Singh said.
 
 Three ‘prasad’ counters have also been set up. “One can get a receipt ranging from Rs 20 to Rs 500. The prasads purchased from these counters go to darbar hall where the priests give the ‘bhog’. Though the ‘karigars’ preparing the prasad are from Amritsar, the prices differ here,” Singh added.
