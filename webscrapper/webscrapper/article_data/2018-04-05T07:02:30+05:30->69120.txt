PATNA: The Patna high court on Wednesday quashed the Patna University VC’s March 13 order that cancelled the election of Patna University Students’ Union ( ) president Divyanshu Bhardwaj.

 A bench of Justice Chakrdhari Sharan Singh, while declaring the PUSU president’s election valid, ruled that the VC’s action was one-sided and violated natural justice. It, however, said the PU inquiry against Bhardwaj would continue.
 
 Independent candidate Bhardwaj fetched 1862 votes to win the president’s post in the PUSU election held after a gap of five years on February 17. 
 
 However, the PU administration later received a complaint challenging his election on the ground that he had hidden information in the affidavit filed with his nomination paper. An inquiry found his candidature was not tenable because he took admission in the Himalayan University-Itanagar for the academic session 2014-17 during which he was also a student of PU’s B N College in Patna.
 
 The inquiry committee recommended cancellation of his PU admission and also took initiative to seek information from the Itanagar varsity to know how the university admitted him in 2014-17 session while he was given the college leaving certificate by B N College in 2016. Following the inquiry committee’s findings, the   issued a notification cancelling Bhardwaj’s election. He subsequently moved the Patna HC.
