Agra: A day after a UGC report picked out AMU for “inbreeding” and said the varsity didn’t have a national character, AMU authorities said the panel has said the same thing for the past 33 years and other universities like BHU and JNU too had been included in the list earlier. Maintaining that the upcoming UGC audit report of universities this year will include almost all big varsities in their list of those "lacking national character", the university’s VC, Prof Tariq Mansoor, disputed the UGC’s claim and said that students from 29 states study in AMU then “how anyone can say that there is no diversity here.”  He said the university has a 60:40 ratio of Muslim and non-Muslim students and “this was not a designed pattern but due to the fact that a large number of courses like Arabic, Urdu and Farsi for which only Muslim students apply.”  The VC also denied that the university’s medical college had its own system of admission and doesn’t follow the NEET. He said, “Ever since NEET had started, admissions were being conducted through it.”  Stating that there was nothing new in findings of the latest UGC audit report, former AMUTA general secretary and retired faculty Mustafa Zaidi said that there was nothing wrong with it. Referring to a 1984 UGC report, Zaidi said it clearly stated that “none of the central universities have maintained an all-India character”. “They said it then and they are saying it now, there is nothing new in this, “ he said.   This report was prepared 33 years ago by a five-member panel headed by then UGC chairperson and it looked into the working of Delhi University, JNU, AMU, BHU, North-Eastern Hill University, Hyderabad University, and Vishwa Bharati.  Incidentally, the report had castigated all the universities for losing their “national character” by admitting only local students, often under “duress”.
