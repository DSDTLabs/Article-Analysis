PATNA: CPI (ML) state secretary Kunal on Sunday said the state government should immediately intervene and talk to the bankers to resolve the acute   in rural areas, as it has already resulted in the death of one Noorjahan (74) while in queue before a bank in Rupauli block of Purnia district four days ago.

 Kunal said two CPI (ML) functionaries of Purnia district unit, Vijay Kumar and Hareram Gupta, inquired into the cause of death of Noorjahan who belonged to Maini village in Rampur Parihat panchayat of Rupauli block. She had Rs17,000 in her account in the Central Bank branch.
 
 For three days, she stood in the queue at the bank branch, but failed to withdraw her money which she needed for treatment of her illness. On the fourth day, she fell and died while standing in the queue again, Kunal said.
 
 The enraged locals blocked road and Dhamdaha SDO had to announce an ex gratia payment of Rs20,000 to her next kin, but the money has not yet been paid yet, Kunal added. He said the cash crunch has hit several other districts.
 
 Kunal also said CM Nitish Kumar has for the first time admitted after several years that the land problem is the biggest challenge facing the government and instructed the officials to expeditiously solve the land-related problems.
 
 The irony, however, is that the district administrations concerned have been evicting the poor from the land in their possession in West Champaran, Kunal said, adding the erstwhile Bettiah Raj and sugar mill owners have thousands of acres of land under them, but no action was being taken by the administration against them to free the land.
 
 Kunal said the CM should implement the land reform measures in the backdrop of the recommendations of the D Bandyopadhyay committee that he himself had constituted.
