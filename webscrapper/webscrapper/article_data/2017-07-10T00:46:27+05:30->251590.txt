Madurai : The city corporation has decided to give away awards to the best performing residents’ association, sanitation employee and sanitation inspector with regard to waste segregation at source. This is part of the civic body’s plan to turn Madurai, which has been selected for smart city scheme, into a city with 100 per cent waste segregation. 

 Though the segregation of waste was started last month many areas were yet to follow it. Sanitation employees had started collecting it from the households. City corporation commissioner Aneesh Sekhar said that they had already started segregating waste at the source level into biodegradable and non-biodegradable in many parts of the city. They would enforce it throughout the city in the days to come. He sought the cooperation of the public, while addressing residents at Happy Sunday, to make the mission a success. 
 
 Officials have been reaching out to the residential associations and localities and sensitising them on the need to go for segregation. Aneesh Sekhar said that there was “nothing called waste” and everything could be used up if properly segregated. The awards have been announced to encourage the stakeholders. 
 
 “Separate awards would be given to the residents’ association which tops in waste segregation. Similarly, the sanitation employees and sanitation inspectors who supervise the segregation would also be awarded in the Happy Street event from next month,” he said.
