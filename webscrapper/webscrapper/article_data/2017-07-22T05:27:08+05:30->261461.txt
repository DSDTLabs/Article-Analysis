MUMBAI: In what will be the biggest   in the country,   (RIL) has announced a 1:1 bonus for its shareholders on the 40th anniversary of its initial public offer (IPO). 

 This will be the energy-to-telecom conglomerate’s first bonus share issuance in eight years and fourth in its listing history. The last time it had given bonus shares was in 2009, which, too, was in the same 1:1 ratio. It was in 1983 that RIL had for the first time issued bonus shares to shareholders. 
 
 The latest bonus share issuance will double RIL’s share capital from Rs 3,250 crore to Rs 6,500 crore. The Mumbai-based corporate joins more than two dozen other companies that have announced bonus shares in recent months. In October 2016, its peer Indian Oil Corp (IOC) had declared 1:1 bonus shares and, last month, technology major   had also given a bonus issue in the same ratio.
 
 Announcing the bonus shares at RIL’s shareholder meet, its chairman   said, “On such an occasion (40th IPO anniversary) and in keeping with our founder’s vision to share prosperity with all shareholders, the board has decided to recommend a bonus issue in the ratio of 1:1.” He added that it will be the country’s biggest such offer. The   means that every shareholder of RIL will get one free share for every one held.
 
 The bonus issue and other announcements spurted RIL’s stock price to a 52-week high, touching Rs 1,592 during Friday’s trading. The scrip finally closed at Rs 1,585 in a strong market, giving it a market cap of Rs 5.2 lakh crore. This makes RIL the most valued company in India.
 
 Ambani also pointed out that if one had invested Rs 1,000 in the company’s shares in 1977 — the year it was listed — the same would be currently worth Rs 16.5 lakh. “In simple terms, this means that your money has doubled every 2.5 years over the past 40 years.” The company’s market cap has also jumped 50,000 times in the last 40 years, from just Rs 10 crore when it was listed to a tad over Rs 5 lakh crore now, he said.
 
 Over the years, RIL, which has grown from a startup to become one of the largest companies in the world, has also paid regular dividend to its shareholders. Since 2001, the company has paid a cumulative dividend of Rs 147.25 per share, BSE data showed.
 
 In 2027, when it completes 50 years, Ambani said his aspiration is to make RIL one of the top 50 companies around the world.
