BENGALURU: The JD(S) had all reasons to cheer on Tuesday with its candidate Ramesh Babu wresting the south-east teachers' constituency legislative council seat from the   with a margin of 2,000 odd votes. The Congress, on the other, hand lost the deposit. 

 Former CM H D   said the victory was an indication of the party's prospects in the upcoming assembly polls. The JD(S) victory is an embarrassment for both the BJP and Congress. The BJP had fielded former HR manager of a soft drink company, P R Basavaraju. The Congress had fielded T S  , who forfeited his deposit by polling just 501 votes. 
 
 Babu, 51, an OBC, has been a long-time loyalist of the party and a close associate of former PM H D Deve Gowda; he is an advocate.
