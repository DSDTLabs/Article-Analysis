NEW DELHI: Even as   president   sharpened his attack on the Pinarayi Vijayan-led Left Front government in  ,   returned fire on social media with jibes and taunts.

 Claiming that Kerala’s performance on the development index was high because BJP was firmly rejected, CPM released a set of posters and tweets against the BJP leadership. In one, senior CPM member and Kerala home minister   is quoted as having said, “Amit Shah has imported BJP workers from other states for his Kerala yatra. They can finally get to use actual toilets in Kerala, instead of taking a dump on roadsides.”
 
 Apart from the hastag ‘AlavalathiReturns’, roughly translated as ‘troublemaker returns’, CPM took to Twitter with a poster highlighting alleged charges against Shah, referring to investigations dating back to his tenure as a minister in Gujarat.
 
 The concerted reactions did, however, indicate that CPM was not treating the latest BJP foray as the action of a fringe player not relevant to the state, as it has consistently claimed. The effort to run down BJP was clearly apparent from social media posts and comments of Left leaders.
 
 While barbs against Shah formed the bulk of CPM’s campaign material, the party also attacked UP chief minister Yogi Aditya Nath ahead of his visit to Kerala, along with a series of other senior BJP members who will join Shah on his threeday tour of the state.
 
 A tweet from the party’s official handle said, “We invite UP CM Yogi to visit Kerala Hospitals to learn how to run Hospitals effectively.” The reference was to recent deaths of children at Baba Raghav Das Medical College in Gorkahpur. Neither the CM nor BJP responded.
 
 CPM general secretary   too joined the attacks. Quoting the tweet, Yechury said, “He can bring other BJP leaders and CMs along who can learn from a state which has always rejected BJP.”
