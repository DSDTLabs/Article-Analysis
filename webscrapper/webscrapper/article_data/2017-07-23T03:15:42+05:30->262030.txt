KOLKATA: India is on the brink of a revolution in   when it takes on hosts England in the World Cup final and everyone — from former women cricketers to greenhorns — knows that a win on Sunday will catapult the ladies game to a different league.

 “A World Cup win can change people’s perception about our game and it would be a fitting farewell to legends like Mithali Raj and Jhulan  , who have carried this game on their shoulders for several years,” said Priyanka Roy, the Bengal all-rounder who had last played for India in 2011.
 
 This would be India’s second final in 12 years and the team will have at least two players — Raj and Goswami — who had played in the 2005 match when Australia proved far too strong in the decider in South Africa. However, back in 2005, hardly anybody knew that India had qualified for the final. “People were all too involved with men’s cricket, nobody really paid attention to the Indian women’s team. The match wasn’t even televised and had very little media attention,” said former Bengal captain Mithu Mukherjee.
 
 For pacer  , who was also a part of the 2005 team, said it was a day when they actually choked under pressure. “We had crumbled under pressure. We had bowled pretty well, restricting them to 215 but when it came to batting, we went nervous and goofed up the chase,” said Dhar.
 
 However, the new breed of cricketers, like Bengal’s Saiqa Ishaaq and Paromita Roy, thinks that this current team is not the one that would crumble under pressure. 
 
 “Earlier, anything over 200 was considered a very good score in women’s cricket. But now, we are taught to play attacking   and hence power hitters like Harmanpreet Kaur, Deepti Sharma and Smriti Mandhana have taken the game to the next level. In the last match too, we lost three quick wickets but bounced back too well to throw a team like Australia out of the game,” said Saiqa, the Bengal all-rounder.
