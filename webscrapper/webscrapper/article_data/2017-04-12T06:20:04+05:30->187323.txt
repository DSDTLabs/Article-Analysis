KENDRAPADA: The state government should move   to include the  , Udaygiri and Ratnagiri in   in the World  , said Arvind Alok, chairman of   and director of Buddhist Academy, New Delhi. 

 Speaking at the 4th Kalinga International Buddhist Conclave at Udayagiri, he said many stupas, monasteries and images continue to be buried under the earth as the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has excavated only 10% at the famous Buddhist sites. The excavations are not only historically significant but also reveal the artistic excellence and iconographic knowledge of the Buddhist era, he added. "It is high time that the ASI restarts the excavation work to unearth more beautiful Buddha images, viharas and stupas," he added. 
 
 At present, India has 35 World Heritage Sites listed by Unesco, including three Buddhist sites of Nalanda in Bihar, Mahabodhi Temple Complex at Bodh Gaya, Bihar and Buddhist monuments at Sanchi, Madhya Pradesh. He pointed out that lack of a direct flight from Varanasi to Bhubaneswar is the main reason behind the dwindling numbers of overseas Buddhist tourists coming to the state.
