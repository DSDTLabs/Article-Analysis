JAGATPUR (NAWANSHAHR): Sixty-year-old Krishna Devi almost lost her eyesight crying on Monday, as her son   Kumar’s body arrived from Iraq. 

 Parvinder, 35, was working as a carpenter in   when he was abducted by the IS in June 2014. “My son was kidnapped by the IS in June 2014 and the last time we talked to him was when he was being taken away by them. After hearing the news about the kidnapping of my son, there has not been a day when my wife has not cried. For four years, we all have died every moment waiting for him. But now we were told that he has been killed by the IS after being kidnapped by them,” said 70-year-old Jeet Ram. “As my wife has been crying all these years for our son, she faced problem in seeing after which we got a lens installed in her eyes.”
 
 Parvinder’s brother   said his mother cannot see properly even now. He added that she suffered damage to eyes because she had been crying for his brother all these years.
 
 Though Krishna Devi couldn’t talk as she was in a state of shock, tears continued to drop from her eyes on Monday. She had high blood pressure because of the trauma, her husband added.
 
 Anju, wife of the deceased, was in a state of shock and had to be administered glucose. A villager said Pravinder’s son, who studies in a private school, will turn six on April 13, just days after his father’s funeral.
