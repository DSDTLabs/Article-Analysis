MUMBAI: Until Tuesday evening, the BCCI was at wits end trying to resist  's plan in bring about a flurry of reforms at the   (ICC). On Thursday morning, the cricket board woke up to a fresh headache -whether to propose a name from India for the top job at the   or not.

  (CoA) won't mind proposing a name. However, if they do propose, it will have to be of an individual who is willing to provide an undertaking that his state association will implement the   reforms. “Take it or leave it,“ is the  's line.
 
 The three potential candidates for the post, in that order, are  ,   and  .
 
 Outside of India, Sri Lanka Cricket chairman Thilanga Sumathipala has thrown his hat in the ring to replace Manohar.Elsewhere, old hands Giles Clarke (England) and Wally Edwards (Australia) are aspirants too. In faraway New Zealand, former ICC president Alan Issacs may want to walk out of the woodwork once again.
 
 The CoA doesn't seem to be overly worried. Their logic: “Why should the CoA propose a name? SC mandate is to make state associations implement Lodha reforms, not propose names for ICC.“
 
 There's time until June to propose names, when the ICC will host its annual conference. Until then, the least CoA can do is hear out professionals who understand how things work.
