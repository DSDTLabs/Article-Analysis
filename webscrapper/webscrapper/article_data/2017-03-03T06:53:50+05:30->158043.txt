GORAKHPUR: Tapping public anger against the land mafia that’s running riot in   city in the main, all parties are promising to bust the ‘bhu’ (land) mafia-neta nexus. Land-grabbing by powerful goons connected with police and local netas has emerged a major poll plank in east UP.

 The parties are locked in a blame game, accusing each other of patronage to the bhu-mafi a, promising redress in right earnest. BJP’s advertised in local papers that it will form an anti-bhu mafi a task force. On the other hand,   district chief Suresh Bharti claims that “land grabbers are getting nervous as BSP is set to form the government.” SP district head Prahlad Yadav asserts that “all bhu-mafi as in the area are connected with BJP”, a charge roundly rejected by BJP’s Janardan Tiwari. “In SP’s regime, goondas capture land by hoisting the SP flag. Not only in Gorakhpur, this is happening in every part of the state,” Tiwari said. But voters say they have little hope from politicians.
 
 “As land prices saw a quantum leap in tier 3 and 4 cities like Gorakhpur, Deoria, Kushinagar and Maharajganj, local strongmen and criminals, all with links to the political parties, jumped into the picture,” says Ashwini Mall, who runs a private school in Gorakhpur.
