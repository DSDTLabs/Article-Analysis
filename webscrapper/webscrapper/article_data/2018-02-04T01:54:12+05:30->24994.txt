NEW DELHI: Delhi Commission for Women chief   has written a letter to   Narendra Modi raising concern over women safety and increasing cases involving rape of children in the capital. She reiterated her demand for giving capital punishment to a person accused of raping a minor. She sought that the punishment should be time-bound, within 6 months.

 Citing the recent cases of the rape of an eight-month-old infant and a six-year old child, she asserted the need for urgent action. She wrote, “It is not only the rape of these children but it is my rape. I have written to you many times earlier but you choose not to reply... You have the responsibility for providing safety and security to women and girls.”
 
 Jaihind writes that rapes are increasing in the country because there is no deterrence. She also asked the Centre fulfill the demand of Delhi Police and providing 66,000 personnel for better policing in Delhi. The   chief sought that the number of fast track courts should be increased.
 
 The DCW chief also said that she is on a 30-day Satyagrah that started four days back. “I will not go home during these days but will work in office in the day time and in night I will go to different places for inspection,” Jaihind said. 
 
 “I also request you to call for a high level committee meeting where Union home minister, Delhi LG, Delhi CM, commissioner of Delhi Police and DCW would take part. I request you to take a strong decision for safety of women,” she said.
