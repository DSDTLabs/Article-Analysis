Palanpur: Actor, producer and director Aamir Khan was the chief guest at the platinum jubilee celebration of education trust Vidhya Mandir Trust in Palanpur on Sunday and asked students of the institute to focus on hard work rather than chasing success.

 During his address, Khan interacted with the audience through questions and answers. He answered questions raised by people who are native of Palanpur but settled in Mumbai and Antwerp, including Russell Mehta chairman of Vidhya Mandir Trust, Ashish Mehta managing trustee, and Satyavatiben Zaveri, senior trustee. On if he believed in luck or hard work he quoted a dialogue from his film Three Idiots “Don’t go after success, but chase hard work.” 
 
 “Don’t ask the pupil about the marks he or she has acquired, but ask about how much care he has taken of the needy. Real peace is in pleasing others,” added the Tare Zamin Pe actor. “Vidhya Mandir has inspired me.” He had also interacted with the students from the institution. Khan stressed on the need on sports in students life. “It (sports) keeps one healthy both physically and mentally.” Earlier, on Saturday the trust had inaugurated 14 new institutions as a part of its 70th year of inception.
