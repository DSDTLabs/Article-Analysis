Ludhiana: The announcement of the Punjab government to provide ex gratia of Rs 5 lakh, a job and monthly assistance of Rs 20,000 till the job is given has come as a relief for the family of Mosul victim Balbir Chand of Selkiana village. His family had been living in penury as Balbir was the sole breadwinner. 

 The announcement has made the family hopeful, though there is no written assurance and ambiguity prevails over the rules for a job. Balbir Chand, 51, was one of the hostages killed in Iraq, where he had gone after taking a debt of Rs 1.5 lakh on 5% interest. His family sells milk to eke out a living and also takes help of Balbir’s brothers. 
 
 Balbir’s wife Babli, 50, said, “I have three daughters and a son, and none of us earns. Balbir and I had dreamt of giving our daughters better future. All dreams came crashing down with his death. The announcement of the state government to give relief and job has made me hopeful. I can think of a better future for my children. But so far there is no written assurance and the district administration has also not conveyed anything to us. We only heard it on news.”
 
 Balbir is survived by his wife Babli, 50, daughters, Kamaljeet Kaur, 23, Amandeep Kaur, 21, Paramjeet Kaur, 16, and son Hansraj Singh, 18. 
 
 The family said they would soon meet deputy commissioner Pradeep Agarwal.
 
 The deputy commissioner was not available for comments.
 
 Daughter suffers depression 
 
 Balbir’s wife Babli said, “After his call and news of civil war in Mosul, our elder daughter Kamaljeet Kaur, 23, developed mental illness and slipped into depression. She is undergoing treatment.”
