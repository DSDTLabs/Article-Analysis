NEW DELHI: The fastest way to address the recruitment issue of government school teachers is to   guest teachers, deputy chief minister Manish   on Friday. A Bill to this effect will soon be sent to Baijal. 

 Making fresh recruitments will be detrimental as it would need the government to train new teachers, pointed out Sisodia, adding that   teachers, on the other hand, have already attended several government training camps and are as equipped as regular teachers. New recruitment will also take a few years, he said. 
 
 In a letter submitted to the LG,   said the LG had put the recruitment process on hold, he was never informed of the decision or of any request from Baijal for a new proposal “to consider the policy for weightage for guest teachers”. 
 
 On Thursday, the LG urged the government to fast-track the recruitment process as it had been six weeks since the recruitment was put on hold and two reminders had been sent for another proposal. 
 
 The deputy CM, who is also the education minister, said he had got to know about the process being put on hold from a media advertisement of Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board. “If I had been informed of either of these two developments by the office of the LG, I would have personally supervised and expedited this process,” Sisodia said.
 
 On receiving a file from the law department, Sisodia added, he saw an erroneous opinion on the issue which was based on high court judgements overturned or stayed by the Supreme Court. This, he said, forced him to return the file. 
 
 He claimed he was told by officers of “clear instructions from the LG’s office” that they were not to follow any instruction from the minister in-charge on service matters of the department. “Maybe this is the reason why they did not start formulating a policy, and there is such a delay.”
