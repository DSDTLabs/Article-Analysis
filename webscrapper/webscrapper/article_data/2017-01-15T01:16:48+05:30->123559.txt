NEW DELHI: In a bid to ensure last-mile connectivity in the city, the   has issued directions to “rationalise” all   of RTVs and mini buses plying on city roads.

 Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS) has been asked to conduct a study on route rationalisation and submit its report within three months. 
 
 The decision was taken at a recent board meeting of the   (STA). There are about 800 RTVs and mini buses that have been allowed to run on the city roads by the transport department under stage carriage permits.
 
 “The STA has asked DIMTS to rationalise all routes of such vehicles. It will also be ensured that RTVs and mini buses cover all the areas that lack good bus connectivity,” said an official.
 
 The decision is likely to benefit STA bus operators who rue that they do not get many passengers since e-rickshaws have come in. “The study will also focus on whether RTVs and mini buses should be allowed in areas where the presence of e-rickshaws is not sufficient,” added the official.
 
 Apart from RTVs and mini bus routes, the STA board has also given its nod to make changes in the courses of   feeder buses. “The board has approved a proposal for increasing and decreasing some routes of Metro feeder buses,” the official said.
