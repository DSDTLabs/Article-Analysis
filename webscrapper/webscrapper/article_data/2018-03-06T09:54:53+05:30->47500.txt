GORAKHPUR : There was a buzz in   on Monday that   would declare support for   candidate   in fray for   Congress, however, quickly scotched the ‘rumours’ and slamming the support extended by BSP for SP candidates.

 UP Congress chief   said that BSP had extended support to SP so that both parties could help each other secure a Rajya Sabha seat and a Vidhan Parishad seat, respectively.
 
 Former Congress MP Jitendra Singh went on to allege that in fact Prime Minister Narendra Modi had threatened both SP and BSP with CBI cases if they did not come together to ensure the defeat of Congress in the bypolls.
 
 Campaigning in Gorakhpur on Monday, Babbar said that the alliance between BSP and SP had not been forged for the good of people and claimed that both parties had ulterior motives.
 
 “This coming together of SP and BSP is not for the people. It is an exchange between the two parties, as one will get support for a Rajya Sabha seat while the other has been assured support for Vidhan Parishad. However, the society cannot be built on barter,” he said.
 
 Other Congress leaders also denied the rumours which they said were ‘malicious’.
 
 On Sunday, Praveen Nishad’s father and president of NISHAD Party, Sanjay Nishad told TOI that Congress was supporting his son, though not directly. “Candidates were selected in a way that those unhappy with SP would vote for Congress so that BJP doesn’t benefit,” he had claimed. Reacting strongly, a senior Congress member said that it was preposterous to suggest that there was any such strategy in play.
