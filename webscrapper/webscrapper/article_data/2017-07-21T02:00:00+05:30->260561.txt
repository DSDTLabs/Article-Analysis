PATNA: A team of the Anti-Terrorism Squad ( ) of   left for   (NSG) centre in Kolkata recently to undergo   for almost a month under the command of NSG instructors.

 Though established in November 2013 after the Bodh Gaya and Gandhi Maidan serial bomb blasts, the Bihar ATS has no expertise in   by deploying its personnel on top of a building through choppers. The ATS personnel will learn this technique in course of their rigorous training in Kolkata, sources said.
 
 ADG (headquarters) S K Singhal said four sub-inspectors and 16 constables are being trained under a capacity building programme at NSG centre in Kolkata. Several types of training would be imparted to the Bihar ATS personnel, including the ‘top-down’ deployment skill.
 
 “Bihar ATS commandos only knew the techniques of ground operations. They had not received any training on deployment of troops on top of a building through choppers. This training is imparted only after the commandos learn other basic drills,” said a senior police officer on the condition of anonymity.
 
 Sources said the ATS had conducted a two-day mock drill of hostage situation at Gaya international airport with NSG commandos recently. After completion of the drill, officers of NSG had lauded the Bihar ATS, saying it has come a long way since its inception. “Such forces take time to get established. Officers and commandos are regularly sent to different locations for rigorous training. Some officers have gained expertise in defusing improvised explosive devices (IEDs). They have received training at several government institutes, including Institute of IED Management of Central Reserve Police Force, Pune,” sources said.
