GURUGRAM: A 29-year-old woman who got her tubes tied at General Hospital in Sector 10 last year, was in for a shock when she found out recently she was nearly four months pregnant. Government doctors say failed   is normal. Notably, 168 cases of failed sterilisation have been reported in Gurugram in the past three years.

 The woman, a resident of Devi Lal Colony and mother of four, said she started feeling pain in her back and occasionally nauseatic some four months back. She kept ignoring it, but her abdomen continued to grow.
 
 “On Saturday, I visited Civil Hospital for a routine check-up of my elder son. I too decided to consult a doctor there, only to find out that I am 15 weeks pregnant,” she told TOI on Tuesday.
 
 The woman , who works as a maid, said she was already struggling to feed her four children — two daughters, aged three and five, and two sons, aged one and two. 
 
 “A month after the birth of my youngest son, I underwent sterilisation at General Hospital on February 3, 2017. How will I feed this baby? Now I feel so betrayed,” she said. 
 
 But her’s is not an isolated case in Gurugram. In the past three years, 168 cases of failed sterilisation — both men and woman — have been reported in the district. These patients are given a compensation of Rs 30,000.
 
 Dr Saryu Sharma, deputy chief medical officer, Gurugram, said, “There are chances of failure in up to 5% cases. And this happens in case the rings around the fallopian tube slip allowing an entrance for sperm. After sterilisation, the men are issued a card after 90 days and women after 30 days. This card is given only after it has been verified that the procedure was successful. However, in this case, the patient never approached us or came for a follow-up. We will now contact her and provide the necessary medical treatment,” said Dr Sharma.
