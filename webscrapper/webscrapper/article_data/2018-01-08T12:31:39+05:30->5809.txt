 At an event in the city, where a   minister was the chief guest, a speaker addressed the minister as ‘doctor’ in his welcome speech.

 Recently, a family group from another country was here to perform at a concert. The band comprised a male vocalist and pianist, female vocalist and pianist and two children who played the violin, danced and sang. Everyone assumed the male and female singers were married and those children were theirs. The bubble burst when a reporter asked the lead singer about his children’s education. In broken English he said that when he gets married he will think. But weren’t the children his, surprised people asked. To which he replied with a laugh that the female singer was his sister and those children were hers.
