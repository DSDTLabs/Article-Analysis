 was recently in the capital for an event where he shared the story of his first visit to Delhi. The actor said that though all his visits to the city now are quite regular – meeting friends, working, eating out – his first visit to Delhi, at the age of 13, was the most exciting trip of his life. 

  He said, "I would frequently fall ill as a child, and when I was 13, I was suffering from a rare disease. Some doctors said that it was like leukemia, and obviously, my mother was very stressed about it. I was crying when I was hospitalised because I was supposed to visit Delhi for the first time – to march in the Republic Day parade! But the docs would not even let me move."
 
  Getting to the "exciting" part, he added, "For a month and a half, I was in the hospital and the day I got discharged, I rushed to get the details about when my group was supposed to leave for Delhi. I was informed that they had already left by the early morning train, and I wept at the railway station. But guess what? I then came to Delhi in an aeroplane! It was the most exciting trip of my life. I travelled alone and it was a big thing for me. I think the tickets were for about Rs40. When I finally reached Delhi, I stayed in a tent near the airport with the other students and marched in the Republic Day parade. That is my first memory of coming to Delhi."
 
  
  
 
  The actor was in Delhi to attend the National Awards ceremony and a programme by the FICCI Ladies Organisation (FLO), where he shared his journey from being Boman Seth, who used to sell chips in an old bakery shop set by his father in Mumbai, to being an actor.
