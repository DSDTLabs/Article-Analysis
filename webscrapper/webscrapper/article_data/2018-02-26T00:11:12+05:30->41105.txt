Jodhpur: A new fodder crop of beetroot is all set to revolutionise livestock-based economy of the Western Rajasthan.

 Introduced by the Central Arid Zone Research Institute (CAZRI), this crop is claimed to be way cheaper and nutrient rich for the cattle.
 
 A principal fodder of cattle in cold countries like the Netherlands and New Zealand, the scientists have successfully adapted this crop to the arid and warm environment of Rajasthan. Having researched on this new crop of beetroot in 2010, the CAZRI has passed it on to the livestock holders in the desert districts and has found the demand growing.
 
 Director of CAZRI Dr O P Yadav said that if seeds are made available on time and extension activities are undertaken by the state agriculture and animal husbandry departments, this can be a game changer for dairy industry of this region.
 
 Principal Investigator of the project, SPS Tanwar said that a stake-holders’ visit is being organized on February 19 for the demonstration of the crop.
 
 Veterinarian of the CAZRI Subhash Kachhawaha, who has been experimenting on the indigenous breed of cows with this beet root fodder, said that the results were quite impressive with regard to the acceptability by the milch animal, nutritional value, decline in the cost of feed and quality of the milk.
 
 “Now we have been working on the aspect, where this fodder could either do away with or reduce the need of concentrate (mix of cereals and grains)”, Kachhawaha said.
 
 Tanwar said that since fodder availability is the biggest issue in livestock dominated Western Rajasthan, this crop showed the yield potential of 1,000 q/ha in a short period of less than four months which is probably the highest for any crop of similar age and that too during the lean period of January end to April when availability of other fodder crop decreases.
 
 The important feature of this crop is that this crop can be grown well with poor quality water and cost less than a rupee for 1kg biomass.
