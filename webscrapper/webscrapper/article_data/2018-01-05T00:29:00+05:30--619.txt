Kanyakumari: Secretary of the Tamil Nadu Congress Legal and Human Rights A John Soundar has petitioned the DIG of Tirunelveli range requesting withdrawal of police protection provided to leaders of a few religious outfits who are misusing it for ideological motives.  Identifying a few persons by name in the petition, Soundar said that they are targeting minorities organising prayers in their houses and places of worship and trying to disturb communal harmony. “People are afraid to talk against them as there are armed policemen personnel by their side. Moreover there is a framework on the dos and don’ts by persons availing police protection, which they take for a ride,” he alleged. According to him, one of the persons whom he has named in the petition was once a Goondas Act detainee. “He torched his autorickshaw and lodged a complaint against three persons, for which he was arrested. Withdrawing police protection for such persons will bring down incidents of trouble created by them,” he said. Copy of the petition was also sent to the CM, home secretary, IGP for south zone and district collector and SP of Kanyakumari district. Soundar said that the legal unit of the Congress is in the process of collecting details pertaining to persons with criminal background in the communal aspect, across the state, who are availing personal police protection. “With those details we are planning to file a writ petition before the HC seeking directions to not provide protection for them,” he added.
