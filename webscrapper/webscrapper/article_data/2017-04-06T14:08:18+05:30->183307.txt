Girl   band TLC have announced the release date of their final album and it will be released on June 30. 

 The duo -   and Rozonda 'Chilli' Thomas - announced in January 2015 that they were financing through a   campaign and set a target of USD 150,000. 
 The announcement comes ahead of their show at London's Koko on May 9, after TLC declared the date of their fifth and final outing. 
 
 However, the 'No  ' hitmakers' manager Bill Diggins has revealed they will come up with the album in June and will shoot for a music video this month. 
 
 The upcoming set will be their first studio LP since the death of founding member Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes in 2002.
