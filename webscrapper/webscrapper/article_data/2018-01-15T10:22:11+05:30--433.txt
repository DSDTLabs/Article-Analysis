NAGPUR: Having scored a tournament-high 25 goals in the four matches she played in the first  , city forward   made a name for herself and did the city proud.

 Representing UP Challengers in the Women's Power Cup, a three-day handball league, at   in Delhi, the city-based international player played a key role to help her team lift the glittering trophy.
 
 In the summit clash, the UP Challengers made most of the heroic goal-scoring effort from   to get the better of   19-17 and win the trophy on Sunday. Earlier in the semifinals against Himachal Snatchers, Poonam emerged as the highest scorer and was duly awarded as the player of the match. She was the only player from Maharashtra to play in the first handball league.
 
 Though she was made to bear all the travelling expenses for the league, Poonam is not complaining as she learned a few important lessons playing alongside more established players in Indian handball. "I felt really good to become the first and only player from across Maharashtra to play in the first handball league. Though the matches in the league were like our state and national championships but here I got a chance to learn a few important lessons on teamwork as we played alongside the seniors," Poonam told TOI from Delhi.
 
 Sharing her experience of playing in the league, she added, "Playing with and against the seniors and scoring goals will help me become more mature as a player. After becoming the highest scorer for my team, that too scoring against the senior players, gave me more confidence for the future tournaments."
 
 Poonam, who recently represented India in the U-25 Asian Handball Championship, wants more such leagues to happen. "Leagues like these help us gain confidence and I look forward to many such tournaments which the organizers have promised to conduct on a regular basis. They have also said that this was on an experimental basis and they are planning to conduct a bigger and better league in future."
