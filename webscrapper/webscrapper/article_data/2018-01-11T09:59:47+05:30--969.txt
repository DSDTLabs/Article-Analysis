CHARMINAR: The dilapidated condition of the  's entrance kaman poses a serious threat to visitors. While the matter was brought to the notice of concerned authorities several times, no initiatives were taken to renovate the Nizam's era structure. People coming from different localities to the nearby market pass through the kaman to purchase vegetable every day, unaware of the threat from above. 

 Recounted that Mir Alam Mandi is a historical market in the  , President of the Shia Youth Conference   lamented that the entrance has been lying in ruins for the last few years. .
 
 "The entrance has been neglected by officials. Though I have personally complained to GHMC commissioner and zonal commissioner about the pathetic condition of this kaman, I received no replies from the officials. Many vehicles pass through the kaman, which causes vibration inside the structure,''   told TOI. 
 
  "It is a very worrying issue. During rain, the mud falls from the wall and roof. Earlier, the kaman was inspected by local leaders, but no one came again to work out a solution. I sincerely appeal to Chief Minister   and archaeology department officials to take note of the structure's condition seriously,'' said  , a shopkeeper, adding that the piles of garbage in the vicinity only add to the issue.
