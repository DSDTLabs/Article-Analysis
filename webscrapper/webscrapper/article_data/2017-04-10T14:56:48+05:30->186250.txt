Actor   says his father, veteran actor-filmmaker  , does not help him in getting roles in films. The 31-year-old actor, who will be seen in 'Fate of the Furious', says he had to go through an audition like any other   to bag the part in the F Gary Gray-directed movie.

  
  
 "It doesn't work like that. He (Clint) can't just pick up the phone and say 'cast my son'. It's not like I didn't have to audition for 'Fast & Furious' because of who my father is," said Scott. 
 
 The actor says he even had to audition for roles in his Clint's films and was eventually cast in smaller parts in movie like 'Flags of Our Fathers' (2006) and 'Gran Torino' (2008). 
 
 "He was hard on me on set... We're actually looking to do something. We're just trying to find the time," said Scott. The eight installment of the 'Fast & Furious' franchise opens on April 12.
