INDORE: To clear the confusion on whether   operators will be seen on streets like before selling fresh vegetables and fruits or no,   commissioner   clarified that pushcarts will be back on roads on the condition they stay on the move and do not restrict themselves to one location.

 He said pushcarts will be allowed on streets and main roads but they should not be ‘fixed’ to a particular location for a long time. Many pushcart operators maintain a definite location and remain there all day long which is not permissible.
 
 His comments came in light of recent citywide protests by pushcart operators who have alleged that small time vendors’ property have been damaged and pushcarts destroyed without prior notices being served about it.
 
 Pushcart operators alleged the civic body has not only destroyed their carts but the move against them has also affected their sole source of income. 
 
 Singh said   will be allowed to do business but their illegal structures and encroachments will not be permitted.
 
 Pushcarts not only leave piles of garbage behind but they also obstruct vehicles on roads. Chaat vendors and small eateries top this list.
 
 Authorities have plans to permit these vendors to continue their business within the city by registering them with the civic body to keep them away from IMC’s wrath. Sources said there will be a committee for these registrations. It will comprise a combination of civic body officials and activists of the vendors’ association. As soon as the state government regulates the notification, registrations will be initiated.
