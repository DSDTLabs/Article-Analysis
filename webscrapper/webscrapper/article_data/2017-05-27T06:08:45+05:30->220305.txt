KOLKATA: The  , one of the oldest in the city that brings   to the   (CBD) and south Kolkata, will close down for at least three days once the   (TBM) starts moving under it to put in place the East-West Metro shaft. 

 The TBM, which has already travelled under the river to touch the eastern bank, has slowed down since to give time to the administration to remove bottlenecks above ground. 
 
 The machine will pick up speed once the Union government passes a proposed ordinance allowing infrastructure projects within 100m of protected monuments — there are three of these on the East-West Metro route.
 
 According to KMRC, the implementing agency for the East-West Metro project, the move to suspend traffic on the   flyover is merely a “a precautionary measure” and there is no “possibility of a subsidence”. The TBM will take a maximum of three days to cross the flyover stretch.
 
 Kolkata traffic police has gone back to the drawing board to come up with an alternative traffic movement plan.
 
 The 1.2km flyover from the Burrabazar to Brabourne Road is one of the busiest in the city, carrying a load of over five lakh vehicles every day.
 
 “We will request KMRC to finish work along the flyover stretch during weekend when diversion will be easier to implement,” said Solomon V Nesakumar, DC (traffic). However, there won’t be a bar on using the flyover as a pedestrian walkway, police said.
 
 The traffic cops are are weighing two options. First, to run both-way traffic along Strand Road and second, diverting central- and south-bound traffic along MG Road and CR Avenue. The problem is, all these roads are over-saturated and may lead to major traffic snarls. Encroachments under the flyover will also have to be cleared.
 
 The closure, however, will give the KMDA a chance to carry out some emergency repairs on the flyover.
