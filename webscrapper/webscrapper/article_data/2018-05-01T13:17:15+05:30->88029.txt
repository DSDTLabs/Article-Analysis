 According to the police, a locked house with newspapers piling up at the door, absence of a car in the parking lot and no response to the doorbell are some of the signs criminals look for. The police have advised that citizens should discontinue newspaper delivery before they go on vacation.
 
 People are advised to install siren, CCTV cameras in their homes. They should hide the drive in the house so that the   do not find it. People living in societies can deploy a security personal to serve the purpose.
 
 “One should not keep excess cash and jewellery in home. They should rather deposit the money in the bank or in locker before leaving on vacation. Emphasis should be on using latches instead of traditional locks. Lights should be put on at home while going out at night,” he said. 
 
 Police said that citizens can also use their smart phones and new gadgets to keep their homes safer. Lights can be switched on and off using a smartphone app.
