Himachal Pradesh Horticulture Produce Marketing and Processing Corporation Limited (HPMC), vice-chairman, Prakash Thakur said that considering the impact of inclement weather conditions apple production would not even touch the 2 crore boxes this time. “Production would remain less than last year,’ he said.
 
  Thakur said that apple production is good in the areas above 7000 feet but it is severely affected in the belt falling between 5500 feet to 7000 feet where maximum production takes place.
 
  Ashutosh Chauhan, a resident of Ratnari village in Shimla district said that hailstorm and rain has left the crop damage due to which production has remained low. He said that at the time of flowering itself gusty winds and storms had affected the crop. “Later hailstorm had damaged around 30 to 40% crop,” he added.
