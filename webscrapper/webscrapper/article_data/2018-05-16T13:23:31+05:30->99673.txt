Rapper-actor Ludacris' wife Eudoxie Mbouguiengue said she suffered a miscarriage earlier in 2018. According to a report, Mbouguiengue, who tied the knot with the rapper in 2014, shared the news with her Instagram followers on Monday. "Lord, I thank you for the gift of life," Mbouguiengue captioned a photograph of herself standing next to Ludacris, whose given name is Chris Bridges. 
  
  
  
  
   










 "This year did not necessarily start off right for us. I had a miscarriage and needed to have surgery. It was very easy to complain and self pity but I refused to let the enemy win. I stayed faithful and prayed up. I spent hours focusing on the many ways the Lord has blessed me. "How could I complain when God has blessed me with the opportunity to already experience motherhood?" wrote Mbouguiengue, who shares three-year-old daughter Cadence GaÃ«lle with Ludacris.  "I'm sharing this with you all to remind you to live in gratitude," she added.  Mbouguiengue said that her "faith has been tested many times throughout my life but I'm only getting stronger." She concluded, "Thank you God for your favour over my life. Thank you for my beautiful family and friends who have been so supportive. Thank you for another year!" Ludacris posted the same image on Instagram that was taken during his wife's birthday party on Monday, in a gaming parlour, which he hired out for the occasion. He captioned the photo of the couple, "Of course I let her win. That is what loving husbands do."
