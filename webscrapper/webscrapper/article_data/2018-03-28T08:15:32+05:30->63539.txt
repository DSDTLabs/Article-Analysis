SANGRUR: The court of additional district and sessions judge A K Singla has acquitted father-son duo of all charges in the infamous Sullar Gharat cracker warehouse blast in which seven persons were killed on September 18, 2017.

 While pronouncing the verdict on Tuesday, the court said that there wasn't enough evidence on record to prove the guilt of   and his son Pradeep Kumar in the case. During the trial all prime witnesses of the case had turned hostile due to which the prosecution could not establish guilt of the owners of the Gandhi warehouse where the blast had occurred.
 
 Following the incident, CM   had ordered a magisterial probe which was conducted by additional deputy commissioner of  . In his report, the ADC had established that the warehouse was being used to make crackers even as the owners did not have any licence for the same.
 
 The district police had arrested Gandhi and his son Pradeep soon after the incident. While Gandhi was granted bail in December last year Pradeep walked out of the jail after being acquitted by the court.
 
 A case under Sections 304, 308 and 472 of the IPC and Section 9B of the Explosive Act of 1884, Section 3/4 of Explosive Substances Act of 1908 had also been registered against the father-son duo, owners of the godown where the explosion had occurred.
 
 The ADC’s report has concluded that the owners did not have a licence to store crackers in the factory. “The use of highly vulnerable explosives to manufacture crackers by untrained workers caused the blast, killing seven persons,” it said.
 
 The accused had five licences in the names of their family members to store crackers. But they had stored crackers illegally on Gujran road (the blast site) and in Maura village. Before that a report of   (FSL), Mohali, had confirmed the presence of pressure-sensitive explosive material at the blast site.
