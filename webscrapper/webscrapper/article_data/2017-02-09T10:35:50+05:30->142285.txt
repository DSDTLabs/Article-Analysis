LUCKNOW: Once a hot issue to lure voters, division of Uttar Pradesh no longer finds favour with key political parties this time round.

 Promises to carve out Harit Pradesh (western UP),   (eastern UP),   and Awadh have been pushed to the back burner with no party pushing for division of the state.
 
 Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), headed by Mayawati, was once a strong supporter of the demand to corner ruling Samajwadi Party on development and law and order issues, maintaining that smaller states could be governed better.
 
 Dalit icon BR Ambedkar, the architect of the Constitution, by whose name Mayawati swears, had recommended division of Uttar Pradesh in his book "Bhashayi Rajya".
 
 As the chief minister, Mayawati had first raised the issue way back in 2007 and her government had even adopted a resolution in the state Assembly seeking division of the state into four parts.
 
 Not only BSP has dropped the demand this time, even ruling Samajwadi Party is silent on the issue fearing that such a development might harm its electoral prospects while giving an edge to Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) headed by Ajit Singh, BJP and Congress.
 
 Both BJP and Congress had supported the resolution brought by Mayawati in the House.
 
 But, as Mayawati lost power in 2012 and ended up with just 80 seats against 206 seats in 2007, her demand lost steam and the issue surprisingly finds no mention in manifestos of other parties or in speeches made by their leaders.
