NEW DELHI:   on Monday sealed over 57 properties, with the bulk of activity taking place in   and Rohini. Despite directions from the monitoring committee to not let the sealing drive slow down, the south and east civic body, citing unavailability of police force, failed to carry out any major sealing activity in their jurisdiction.

 “Teams had gone to carry out sealing drive in west Delhi’s Sagarpur, but had to abandon it as there was heavy resistance from locals. In west zone’s Hari Nagar, four stilt parkings in residential area were sealed for misuse, but since the force provided to us was minimal and the crowd huge, we had to leave the drive mid-way,” a south   official said.
 
 Spokesperson for the east corporation said that they had planned sealing activity in Usmanpur and Seelampur area, but police force was not made available to them. “We have made a detailed sealing plan for the next five days in   south zone. The drive will soon regain its pace,” said an official from the east corporation.
 
 North corporation, where the bulk of sealing activity took place on Monday, saw 24 units being sealed in Civil Lines zone’s areas, including Malka Gan, Vijay Nagar, Adarsh Nagar and BD Estate.
