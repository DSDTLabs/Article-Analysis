RACHOL: In line with prime minister Narendra Modi’s dream of open defecation-free village,   village in Salcete taluka of South Goa district could probably be the first village to do so under the Sansad Adharsh Gram Yojana scheme of the state tribal welfare department.

 Stating that ‘the construction of these community toilets has reduced open defecation and provided tremendous relief to the tribal community residing at Rachol,’ Rachol sarpanch   told STOI that, “on New Year’s day, the chaplain of Our Lady of Gloria chapel, Ilha-de-Rachol, Fr   inaugurated these community toilets, that will vastly benefit the local residents who hail from the scheduled tribe (ST) community. These toilets were re-constructed, utilising adivasi (tribal) funds to the tune of Rs 20 lakh, which include septic tank and soak pit, besides a provision made for solar electricity and water pump facilities to avoid unnecessary expenditure on electricity and water bills. These toilets will serve 80 families covering 40 residencies in the locality. The re-construction of these toilets was urgently required as some miscreants had damaged the doors and commodes of the existing toilets constructed in 1992 by the Rachol village panchayat under the   (JRY) scheme.”
