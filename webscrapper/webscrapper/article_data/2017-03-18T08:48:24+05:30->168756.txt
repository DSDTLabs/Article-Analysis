PUNE: Rainfall in Marathwada is expected to cease at least for the next four days. The   (IMD) has forecast dry weather for Maharashtra, including Marathwada, till March 21. But there are possibilities of isolated rain and thundershowers over Vidarbha on Saturday, Met officials told TOI.

 During the last 24 hours till Friday, rain was reported at isolated places in Marathwada. Reports of rain were received from central Maharashtra and Marathwada on Thursday too. As per IMD, thunderstorm accompanied by squall and hail had occurred at isolated places over central Maharashtra, Beed and Latur districts.
 
 According to   officials, during the 24 hours from 8.30am on Thursday to 8.30pm on Friday, Budhana received 11mm rainfall, Chandrapur recorded 2.2mm, Akola 0.7 mm, and Yavatmal 0.4 mm.
 
 The next few days will, however, be dry as IMD has forecast mainly sunny weather for central Maharashtra, Marathwada, Konkan and Goa. “Light showers occurred in parts of Maharashtra due to cyclonic circulation over north interior Karnataka and wind discontinuity from Lakshadweep to south Vidarbha region across Karnataka. The confluence of warm moist winds from the   and relatively dry, cool winds from Maharashtra and Gujarat also contributed to the development of thunderclouds towards late afternoon and evening, leading to rain,” a Skymet Weather Services official said.
 
 Some rain is expected in Vidharbha on Saturday, said an IMD official. Meanwhile, mercury is set to soar further in Pune in the next few days. City’s maximum temperature may rise to 38 degrees C by March 22, according to met officials.
