CHENNAI: Rebel   leader and independent MLA from RK Nagar, T T V   on Friday questioned the ruling AIADMK’s inaction and silence over   exams, scheduled to take place in the first of May this year.

 The state government has neither taken any steps to abolish NEET nor got an exemption to students from Tamil Nadu from appearing for NEET. It has also failed in not taking any concrete steps to help the students to prepare for NEET.
 
 “Until Amma (Jayalalithaa) was around, she safeguarded the students of the state from such adversities. However, the present rulers, who rush to Delhi to solve and fulfill their own personal needs, have not cared to prevent the students from such a trouble,” Dhinakaran said in a statement on Friday.
 
 It’s been just a few months since a medical aspirant,   ended her life unable to pursue her dream of studying medicine in spite of scoring 1,176 marks in her higher secondary exams and believing in the false promises of the state government, he pointed out.
 
 “As for Tamil Nadu, NEET is a big obstacle preventing poor students from the state in pursuing their medical education dreams. Either they should be exempted from appearing for NEET or the questions should be based on state-syllabus, instead of CBSE,” Dhinakaran said.
 
 However, while the Union minister for Human Resources,   had made such a promise, the recent official announcement on NEET makes it clear that the questions will be based on the CBSE syllabus.
