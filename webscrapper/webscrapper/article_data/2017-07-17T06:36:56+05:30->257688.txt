CHENNAI: A resident initiative to develop   in Kottur as a green space has been defeated by local businessmen who have taken over the space for  . At a cost of nearly Rs 1 lakh, residents fenced a 150m stretch of unused land along the Buckingham Canal at South Lock Street, Kottur, for planting trees. However, the fence has since been torn down, allegedly by a resident who uses the space to run his car dealership business.

 Wembley Apartments resident Amit Tomar, who is alleged to have torn down the fence on South Lock Street to park his cars, denied using the space. Tomar said, “I own only one car and it is parked in the designated spot. The allegations about illegal parking are false.” Locals however said that at least a dozen vehicles belonging to the car dealer are regularly parked on the narrow street.
 
 After fencing the PWD land with the help of corporation officials in April, residents have been trying to plant trees in the enclosed space. However, illegal parking has stonewalled the green initiative. Exnora International vice-president and Kottur resident  , who is spearheading the initiative, said, “The city corporation provided us with excavators for levelling the unused piece of land, following which we cordoned off the area with metal wire fencing.”
 
 Several senior police officials have inspected the violations in the past but have not put an end to illegal parking. When informed about the violations, a police official said, “We will look into the matter.” More than 50% of cars parked on the street do not even belong to residents, said a local, requesting anonymity.
 
 A corporation official said, “We are planning to develop the vacant land into a park. We have sought permission from PWD for the same.”
