Nagpur: RTI activist Kamlesh Shah has lodged a complaint with the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB), demanding registration of an offence and inquiry against collector Sachin Kurve, commissioner of police K Venkatesham, Vidarbha Cricket Association (VCA), and its members Prakash Dixit and Vijay Pitale. Shah has alleged that the collector and CP went against norms to provide security at   Jamtha stadium for the recent India vs Australia One-Day International match only to extend financial benefits to VCA.

 Referring to information obtained under RTI Act, and various bylaws, Shah on Tuesday submitted the complaint to ACB superintendent of police. “VCA had obtained permissions from collector and CP for holding matches at Jamtha stadium in the past, even though it did not have required permissions/clearances. I had lodged a complaint with police requesting registration of offence against Dixit and Pitale on February 6. No action was taken against the two persons. However, police personnel were provided for the match on October 1 at Jamtha stadium. Thus, collector, CP, Pitale and Dixit jointly committed offences under Prevention of Corruption Act 1988,” he said.
 
 Accusing VCA of violating norms since purchase of land for Jamtha stadium in 2005, Shah alleged that VCA did not have sanctioned building plan, building permit, environment clearance, consent to establish and operate from MPCB, completion certificate, occupancy certificate, NOC for coal bearing area, fire NOC etc.
 
 Shah added the ACB does not require permission from the state government to register FIR and conduct an inquiry under the Prevention of Corruption Act. “Therefore, FIR followed by inquiry should be conducted against all these persons,” he said.
 
 ACB superintendent of police S Patil said the compliant was yet to come before him. “We also need to verify whether the subject matter comes under the Prevention of Corruption Act,” he said.
