COLVA: Thousands of tourists and locals ushered in the New Year with a bang in Goa. As the sky was lit with fireworks, the beaches were full of revellers celebrating with food and beverage. And the following day, Drishti staff collected about 690kg of dry waste from the Benaulim-  stretch.

 The first day of the year revealed how merrymakers left behind boxes of burnt firecrackers, sky lamps, beer bottles and plastic glasses, bags and packets.
 
 “It is a bleak reminder that people have no civic sense. They use the beach to welcome the New Year, but leave it dirty despite the fact that the beach-cleaning company has provided plenty of bins to dispose of the waste,” said a local.
 
 Kevin Abraham, a youth from Mumbai, who came to   for a swim, said, “My friend and I collected so many bottles and plastic glasses from the beach and sea on a stretch of about 15m. It is unfortunate how people mindlessly litter the beach.” 
 
 The entire length and breadth of the beach from   and Colva was littered with garbage.
 
 A shack owner said they also indulged in burning crackers as part of New Year festivities, but the leftovers were collected and disposed of properly. It’s the tourists and individuals who brought their own crackers, burst them and left the burnt stuff there.
 
 He said while some customers buy alcohol from shacks and discard the empty bottles on the beach, there are many tourists as well as locals who bring their food and beverage with them and leave the remnants on the beach.
