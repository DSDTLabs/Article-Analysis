'Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi' actress   posted an adorable picture of herself with her song   on Instagram and we must say that the mother-son duo look just so adorable.
 
  Smriti reminds us of Tulsi from Ekta Kapoor's hit sitcom 'Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi' in the picture and we are sure the fans were also missing their favourite on screen bahu.
  
  She shared the pic on Instagram and wrote, "#tbt #blastfromthepast #mamasboy 😘💝👩👦#mybabystrongest."
  
  
  
  Earlier, Smriti had shared a picture of her step-daughter on Isntagram, whose name had been kept by none other than Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan. The Bollywood actor himself revealed this information on the social networking site.
  
  
 
  
  Smriti Irani is often spotted having fun with her friend and popular TV producer Ekta Kapoor. The two, who once had a major tiff during the show 'Kyunki' have buried the hatchet and have become best friends again.
  
  Smriti was the lead actress on the show for years until she had a fallout with producer Ekta Kapoor and walked out of the show. It was then that Gautami Kapoor came on board, but the show didn't garner much TRP's as during the time of Smriti.
  
  After pursuing her career on TV, Smriti Irani has now become a popular politician and is currently appointed as the Textile Minister of India.
