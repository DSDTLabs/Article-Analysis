For the first time in Hyderabad, members of the city’s   community took part in   celebrations with much gusto, at an open cultural space in   on Saturday. Soaked in the spirit of Holi, nearly 40 members from the community gathered to celebrate the festival of colours. They were brimming with enthusiasm as they put colour on each other, sang and danced to Bollywood chartbusters. 
Organised by MIST, a Bengaluru-based LGBT collective, the event gave the LGBTQ members a unique platform to showcase their skills and talents without any inhibitions.
 
 “It was just fun and frolic. Since it was an open event, it was a mix of both members of the LGBTQ community as well as others. We splashed colours on each other and played kabbadi as well. We used only natural colours. Though there were no cultural programmes scheduled for the evening, many members voluntarily entered the stage and entertained the audience,” said Meghavardhan Reddy, who works in the hospitality industry.
 
 Citizens felt that the event was an eye opener that succeeded in dispelling the myths and prejudices of the society about LGBTQ community. “I am a straight person and an ally of the LGBTQ community. We played Holi together, and it was a great experience as we shared the joy of the festival of colours, which is all about bringing people together,” quipped  , an engineering graduate. The event’s organisers were delighted to see the turnout and said it was an encouraging step towards including members of the queer community into the mainstream society.
 
 “This is the first time we celebrated Holi in a prominent location in the city. Normally, we would play Holi at home due to safety concerns and perception of the society. But this time, with the help of allies, we have organised it after reaching out to people through social media. We are delighted that so many people have turned up for the event,” said Sandi, one of the organisers.
