MUMBAI: Following a complaint made to the   (NHRC) about 2,234 people reportedly contracting   due to blood transfusions between October 2014 and March 2016, the union health ministry has set up a 21-member committee to review the working and manpower norms of blood banks.

 This follows a complaint made by city-based RTI activist Chetan Kothari with the NHRC in early 2016.
 
 Acknowledging the complaint, a letter written on April 24 by National Blood Transfusion Council Dr Shobini Rajan said the committee will submit its report within three months of constitution. Vinay Shetty from Think Foundation, which works with thalassemia patients, is one of the members.
 
 In the NHRC complaint, Kothari had written, “It is a lame excuse to blame outdated and obsolete blood testing facilities for people getting HIV-infected blood. I believe   of   is responsible for the same.” His complaint detailed that blood banks are short staffed. 
 
 “Blood banks are supposed to have a doctor round the clock, but this is hardly followed. Moreover, during blood camps, donors are needed to be screened properly and asked to answer a detailed questionnaire. All this requires adequate staff including doctors, but blood banks with a skeleton staff fail to fulfil this condition,” he added.
