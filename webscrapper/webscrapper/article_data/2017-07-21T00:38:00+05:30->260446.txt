Trichy: The   is all set for yet another round of renovation in a month as a four-member team from Highways Research Station, Chennai analszed its condition on Thursday morning.

 While minor cracks have been witnessed on two of its pillars, the bridge renovation will be carried out based on a report submitted by the team. State highways officials in Trichy said that work would start in a month.
 
 Apart from analysing the quality of the retaining walls on either side of the bridge, the team also checked the stability of the walls and the pillars underneath. 
 
 “While the cracks have been there for several years, the expert team has been called for suggestions on carrying out the repair work,” said a senior official from the highway department.
 
 The bridge was strong enough to cater to the city for at least next two decades, said the official. The parapet walls will be replaced with new walls with gaps so that wind can pass through it. 
 
 “Earlier questions were raised on the stability of the retaining wall for having been raised with no proper foundation. After the wall developed cracks, the SH has now decided to replace it,” he said. 
 
 The official said that the state highway department should consider the possibility of raising a new bridge replacing the existing one considering its age. 
 
 “This is the second renovation that the state highways department is going to carry out within a couple of years. While it reflects the poor condition of the bridge, a new bridge can be planned on the old British-era bridge along the existing bridge,” he said.
