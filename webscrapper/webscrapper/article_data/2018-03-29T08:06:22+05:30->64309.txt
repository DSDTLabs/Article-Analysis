HYDERABAD: A British national of Indian origin,   (name changed), was caught driving under the influence of alcohol on Road Number 36, Jubilee Hills, two days ago. With his wife and parents based in London, he had to literally beg his acquaintances to submit an affidavit, claiming to be his bonafide guardian, and attend counselling with him. To crackdown on impersonators in drunk driving cases, affidavits have been made mandatory if spouse or parents are not able to accompany the erring driver to counselling session.

 Ever since the affidavit was made mandatory to negate impersonation, 15 cases were reported.
 
 In the past, foreigners/ non-locals used to take some person along with them for the mandatory counselling, claiming their family members were unavailable and declare some relationship with the tagged person. Now, it is mandatory for a married motorist to get spouse or unmarried motorists to get his/her parents to accompany them for counselling. Also, they should furnish ID proofs to establish their identity and relationship with the drunk driver.
 
 As large number of nonlocals, including foreigners, were producing impersonators as genuine known local persons by exploiting lacunae in the system, traffic police have made it mandatory for a local guardian to give an undertaking on Rs 20 bond paper to prove his/her credentials before police initiate mandatory counselling for both the erring driver and the guardian.
 
 Just like in the case of Smith, a 25-year-old girl from  , working for an   in the city, was caught driving in an inebriated state a few days ago. Instead of complying with rules, she picked up an argument with police for asking her to bring her parents. She claimed it was her choice to drink and traffic police cannot drag her parents to attend the counselling or insist on an affidavit. However, she was explained about the procedure and asked to contact her employer or local guardian to submit an affidavit and then attend counselling.
