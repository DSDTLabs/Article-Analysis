GURUGRAM: More than two hundred residents blocked   in Sohna on Wednesday morning as they protested after a teenager had gone missing from the area.

 The 17-year-old girl, who lived with her family in Sohna’s Friends Colony area, left home on Sunday for some work and has been missing since then. An FIR has been registered under section 346 (wrongful confinement) of IPC the same day. 
 
 According to police, the girl was last spotted while riding her scooter outside KDM school in the area. The missing girl’s phone call records since April revealed that she was in touch with a Muslim boy and they were planning to elope. The boy too is missing and both their mobile phones are switched off. But, since the girl is a minor, new sections 363 (kidnapping) and 366a (procuration of minor girl) of IPC were added to the FIR on Tuesday. As the girl remained untraceble, the family and neighbours lost patience and blocked the road, demanding speedy action in the matter. The girl’s father threatened to immolate himself. Over 70 cops and tehsildar rushed to the spot and requested the residents to end their protest. 
 
 “It was a peaceful protest. They ended it around 11:30am. We are probing the matter ,” said ACP Manish Sehgal.
