NEW DELHI: Apart from PM Narendra Modi’s popularity,   leaders attributed the recent electoral victories to the effort put in by booth-level workers and asked the panch-parmeshwars — the group of five given charge of the booths for Delhi’s municipal   — to similarly strive hard. At the party rally in Ramlila Maidan on Saturday, BJP chief   said the “Vikas Yagya started by the party should continue in Delhi too”.

 BJP national organising secretary Ramlal asked party workers to keep the momentum going and instructed each panch-parmeshwar “to visit a household at least three times, identify BJP voters and ensure they vote” on April 23.
 
 The party’s victories in various states had enthused the party workers. With AAP’s defeat in Punjab and the no-show in Goa, they felt BJP stood a strong chance of securing a third successive term in the corporations despite its poor performance in the past decade.
 
 “It is only BJP that can give decisive leadership,” asserted Union urban development minister M Venkaiah Naidu, pointing out that members of most other parties, including AAP, had been deserting them.
 
 The decision to deny nominations to incumbent councillors or their relatives has sent a positive signal to the cadres in Delhi, said Shyam Jaju, Delhi BJP in-charge. The strategy may have dismayed the sitting councillors, but workers are happy that “the party wants to promote young and fresh faces”, he said. 
 
 Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari said he spent time with slum dwellers and realised that Delhi’s people were not getting basic necessities like water. “We have to tell the people about how the AAP government has failed to deliver on its promises,” said Tiwari.
 
 Saturday’s rally was attended, among other, by all seven Delhi MPs as well as union sports minister Vijay Goel, commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman and MOS, PMO, Jitender Singh.
