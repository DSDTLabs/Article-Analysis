SHIMLA: Translocating monkeys to north-eastern states has become a challenge for   as after Nagaland, now   too has refused to accept these simians. The  , which it claimed was a result of poor planning by the state government, leaving farmers of the state high and dry.

 In a letter,   has informed princi pal chief conservator of forests, Himachal Pradesh, that it will not be possible to relocate the monkeys from Himachal Pradesh as Mizoram has its own thriving population.
 
 Earlier, through a letter Nagaland's chief wildlife warden Satya Prakash Tripathi had refused to accept them, claiming that there were no appropriate habitats for these in the state. He had said that introduction of translocated monkeys in the forests of Nagaland may disturb the habit and behaviour pattern of certain local species.
 
 After sterilization and declaring them vermin did not help and failed to bring any immediate respite to residents, the state government had come up with the idea of transporting them to northeastern states.
 
 Kuldeep Singh Tanwar, CPM leader, said that the state government had failed in curbing the monkey menace.He said that impractical ideas were being floated to control it. He said monkeys had been declared vermin in the state for the past one year but despite this, not even a single monkey had been killed.
 
 He further said the idea of translocation of monkeys to north-eastern states was not feasible but the state government kept on misleading the people on the issue. He said the government was exposed after Nagaland and Mizoram refused to accept members of the growing simian population from Himachal Pradesh. He further claimed that farmers were giving up farming as the government was not doing anything to tackle the situation.
