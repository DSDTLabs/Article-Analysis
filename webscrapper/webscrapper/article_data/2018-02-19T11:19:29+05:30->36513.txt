MUMBAI: Bank unions have attacked industry body Assocham for recommending privatisation of public sector banks in the wake of the   scam. Stating that it is the equivalent of devil quoting scriptures, unions have accused industry of being responsible for bad loans and for bribing bank officials.

 In a press released issued on Monday, the   published a list of 36 private banks that had to be placed under moratorium by the   in public interest. “If private banks are really efficient, why these Banks were closed down and merged with others. Most of these banks were merged with public sector banks. PSBs have become the Neelakana Mahadev to swallow the poison of failure of many private banks and it is funny that Assocham is asking PSBs to be privatized now. We understand their greed but they cannot claim that private banks are more efficient,” said CH  , general secretary, All India Bank Employees Association.
 
 “The PNB’s fraudulent transactions worth Rs 11,300 crore should act as a strong trigger for the government for reducing its stake to less than 50 per cent in the banks which should then be allowed to work on the lines of private sector lenders with a full sense of accountability to their shareholders protecting interest of depositors,” Assocham had said in a statement following the scam.
 
 “Let them not forget that bulk of the loans given by public sector banks are to private corporate houses. If public sector banks are not efficient, why do they avail these loans from PSBs and why have not taken such loans from private banks,” Venkatachalam said.
 
 Stating that industry bodies should ask their members to pay up their loans, Venkatachalam said that bank employees in the   fraud have committed an `unpardonable sin’ but it was private corporate giants Nirav Modi who tempted them.
