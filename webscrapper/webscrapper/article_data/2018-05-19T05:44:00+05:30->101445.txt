Nagpur: National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and Wildlife Institute of India (WII) officials on Friday reviewed progress reports of All India   2018 in Maharashtra.

 TOI on Friday reported how tiger-bearing forest circles like Chandrapur, Yavatmal and Amravati were lax in compiling data despite estimation being done in their respective areas in February.
 
 As per official data, the estimation in Maharashtra was conducted in 2,124 beats in 151 ranges. Wildlife wing officials said those who did not submit the data have been asked to do the needful by month end.
 
 “There were some issues with uploading of data, hence the problems. At some places, boundaries were not marked properly,” said officials.
 
 According to sources, some problems also cropped up with estimation done by an NGO over grid size. Based on the tiger signs obtained during the carnivore sign survey, as per NTCA guidelines, camera traps were to be placed in 2 sqkm grid. But at several places, the NGO grid measured 3 sqkm and 4 sqkm.
 
 “Though the data has been collected scientifically, it is likely to differ and may not be comparable,” said officials.
