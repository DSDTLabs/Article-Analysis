LUCKNOW:   mangoes this year will truly be a fruit of labour. 

  While the Lucknow speciality will be sweeter and juicier, it will come at a higher cost than previous years due to lesser production. Being the first   crop of the state, the way Dussehri turns out would also determine the fate of late-maturing varieties such as Chausa, Langda and Safeda. 
 
 The weather pattern from February till now has both hit the mango crop as well as proved beneficial to it. 
 
 While the high temperatures of April and May will make the crop sweeter and juicier, the unusually hot weather of February and March, when the trees bore flowers and fruit had started setting, has made a lot of false fruit grow on trees. 
 
 False fruit, called jhumka, means three to four tiny fruits, no bigger than a grape, have sprouted very close to each other and are hanging with a tiny stalk, resembling an earring-hence the name.
 
 The fruit either totally lacks seed or has a very weak one. 
 
 "Jhumka has reduced the number of fruits on a tree," said mango grower from Maal Ramprakash. 
 
 Untimely rain has aided the phenomenon. Besides, because of the fluctuating temperature, pests like mites and thrips are attacking the crop. This might affect the appearance of the fruit but will not affect the taste.
 
 Growers in   said Dussehri would be tastier but less in quantity this year. The naturally ripened fruit would hit the market by the first week of June. 
 
 "At this time, in our orchards, it is still green. As it grows in size, it would also become sweet," said mango grower and orchard owner from Malihabad Naseeb Khan.
