New Delhi: BJP MLAs met lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Monday and demanded action against the Delhi government for its alleged involvement in “cases of corruption”.

 BJP is planning to corner the government in Tuesday’s assembly session over the water tanker scam as well as allegations of corruption levelled by  , who was removed from the state cabinet two days ago. 
 
 Vijender Gupta, leader of the opposition in the Delhi assembly, said that chief minister  , who promised to have a zero-tolerance approach towards corruption, was found to be backing   Jain despite several corruption cases against him.
 
 BJP also demanded that Jain be stripped of his portfolios. “The CM is shamelessly defending his corrupt minister. He (Jain) continues to hold the charge of urban development department despite   investigating the allegations of purchase of agricultural land, which he got declared as residential type. It is illegal and immoral on Jain’s part to misuse his position for personal benefit. The government should at least divest the department from Jain,” Gupta said. 
 
 He added he would raise the matter in the assembly session on Tuesday besides the Rs 400-crore water tanker scam. “Kejriwal was apprised of the irregularities in the scam on August 28, 2015, but he chose not to take any action for more than a year. The guilty firms have not even been blacklisted to date. This is resulting in revenue loss to the tune of Rs 6 crore per month to the exchequer. The AAP government should answer why no action has been taken against the firms,” said Gupta.
