NEW DELHI:  , an assistant professor with the   department of English, has accused the police of being a mute spectator while he was beaten up in front of   on Wednesday. Calling the incident a “perfect fascist movement”, Chakravarty believes that the violence was the final blow after which the “veneer of peace will be removed.”

 “We will now see a cycle of violence at DU as there is fear among students that they would be silenced forever,” the assistant professor added.
 
 Chakravarty had left Arts Faculty to join the ‘Silent March’ called by students of Ramjas college a day after a seminar on ‘Cultures of Protest’ was disrupted by DU Student’s Union members and ABVP on Tuesday.
 
 “I thought it would be like any other protest at DU. There was a huge crowd gathered near the college gate and students were shouting slogans and fighting with each other. As I tried to enter the campus, an older looking person from the ABVP camp rushed to stop me. He started punching me in the face. When I tried to push him back, 5-6 of his friends joined in the assault,” said Chakravarty.
 
 He said one of the attackers tried to strangle him with his scarf after which he lost consciousness. He was resuscitated by the teachers who came to his aid. “I was escorted by the police to the University Health Centre where a medico-legal test was done. They then took me to   for treatment,” Chakravarty added.
 
 “The doctors have given me medicines, but said that the injuries will affect me in the long run. No one wants to be beaten up, but that doesn’t mean we should remain silent,” he added. The teacher said that his wife and daughter chided him for attending the event and getting himself involved in the ruckus. However, he said that he is “definitely scared but will not stop attending any such events in the future.” Chakravarty had joined DU on his return from the US in 2009.
