VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister Chandrababu   on Friday expressed resentment over the ‘financial formula’ being proposed by Union finance minister Arun  . Interacting with party MPs on the strategy to be adopted by the party in parliament, the CM fauled the government’s contention that it has come out with a formula for filling up the revenue deficit. 

 “What formula are they taking about? Isn’t it fair to ask us as to how much has been given and how much needs to be given. What is the formula they are taking about,” he wondered.
 
 Training his guns on the BJP state unit, Naidu made no bones about his displeasure at BJP for taking up the ‘Rayalaseema declaration’. “They are trying to mislead the people. Without taking the Union government into confidence, will the state unit ask for a separate north coastal Andhra also,” he sought to know.
