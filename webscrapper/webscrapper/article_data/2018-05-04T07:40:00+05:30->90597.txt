CHANDIGARH: The police booked seven members of a family on the charge of   death on Thursday. While three of them have been arrested, a manhunt has been launched for the other four. 

 The arrests came after the family of Kiran Bala, 20, staged a protest and blocked the road to Government Multi-specialty Hospital, Sector 16, seeking action against her in-laws. 
 
 Kiran’s brother Ajay Kumar said, “My sister has been killed by her in-laws for dowry.”
 
  “She had tied the knot with Gulshan Kumar seven months ago. Theirs was a love marriage. But immediately thereafter, Gulshan and his family started harassing Kiran for dowry. When Kiran brought the matter to our notice, we discussed it with her in-laws. But they again started harassing her. We had never thought that they would kill her,” said her father Kailash Chand. 
 
 After sub-divisional magistrate (east) Arjun Sharma assured action, the protesters lifted the blockade and took her body home.
 
 On Wednesday, Kiran was found dead under mysterious circumstances at her house in Bapu Dham Colony, Sector 26, Chandigarh.
 
 DSP (east) Satish Kumar said a case under sections 304-B and 34 of the IPC has been registered against her father-in-law Babbi, brother-in-law Bunty, husband Gulshan and four women at Sector 26 police station. “Babbi, Bunty and Gulshan have been arrested. Gulshan, a Class X dropout, is jobless. The remaining arrests will be made soon,” the DSP added.
