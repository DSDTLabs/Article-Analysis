GURUGRAM: Despite making tall claims, MCG is unlikely to complete  , going on in different parts of the city, before this monsoon.

 Under the Rs 102.499-crore project, which was launched by the chief minister on February 1, the civic body is expected to mend all roads both in MCG wards and   sectors. Though the official deadline is February 2018, MCG, at the time of the launch, had promised to complete the repairing by June-end.
 
 However, going by the current pace of work, MCG is unlikely to meet its own deadline. Sources claimed only 60 % of the work had been completed so far. “The thickness of most of the roads in the city is 30mm. Before laying bitumen, the roads have to be free from all sorts of trash. The contractor says as per the contract, MCG has to ensure that the roads are clean, because only then bitumen cover will last,” said a source.
 
 “The road repair in our sector was to start on May 15. But, it has not started yet,” said  , a Sector 23-A resident.
 
 Anuj Sharma of Sector 23 complained that the repair work in the area was stopped midway. “The internal roads were repaired last month, but for some strange reasons, the contractor did not repair a small patch that connects the main road with an internal road,” he said.
 
  “It is a major project. We are trying to get maximum work done before monsoon, but the deadline is February 2018,” said an MCG official.
