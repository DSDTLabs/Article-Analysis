PUNE: The cyber crime cell on Monday arrested three persons from   for cheating a Warje-based man to the tune of Rs2.40 lakh in December. The accused allegedly claimed that the victim had won a lottery after ordering a cellphone from a tele-marketing show.

 A team from the city policeâ€™s cybercrime cell arrested the suspects identified as   (22), Jitendrakumar Raut (27) and Subodhkumar Chaudhari (20), all residents of Jharkhand. After obtaining bank account details and internet protocol addresses in the transaction, a police team from Pune had visited Jharkhand.
 
 The complainant Vishan Chavan (28), a labourer, had ordered a cell phone after watching a tele-marketing show. He received the device but he had also shared his telephone number and other details with the organizers of the show.
 
 When the suspects accessed the information, they called Chavan and told him that they would be sending him scratch cards through which he may win a lottery. The suspects then sent him the said cards and later informed him that he had won a lottery worth Rs13.17 lakh, the complaint said.
 
 However, the suspects asked him to pay a fee in order to get the promised amount. They shared a bank account number with Chavan, who promptly deposited his life savings of Rs2.40 lakh. Once the transaction was successful, the suspects stopped entertaining Chavan and he realized that he had been duped.
 
 Inspector Radhika Phadke of the cybercrime cell confirmed that the police recovered 32 cell phones, 33 SIM cards, seven debit cards, rubber stamps and other important documents from the possession of the suspects.
