NAGPUR: The   ( ) has started the process to convert two playgrounds into residential areas, at Samata Layout in mouza Ambazari, and Friends Colony in mouza   in West Nagpur. Total area of the two playgrounds is 3,990 sq m (42,932.40 sq ft), almost as large as   garden.

 The NMC general body will discuss and take a decision on the proposal for the playground at Friends Colony on Saturday. The proposal says NMC town planning department had sanctioned building plan for commercial purpose on this playground measuring 1,289.48 sq m on March 31, 1984, though reservation was for play ground in city’s development plan.
 
 Friends Sahakari Gruh Nirman Sanstha had got sanction for the layout in 1,21,856.60 sq m. Residential use was approved in 70,000 sq m, roads on 30,585 sq m and open space 21,280.60 sq m on December 7, 1981. Open spaces were marked at six places in the layout. One of the open spaces with reservation of playground was 1,289.48 sq m land. After getting sanction of building plan for commercial purpose, the society sold the land to Tekchand Waswani on December 2, 1989.
 
 Waswani had submitted revision in building plan on August 24, 2007. NMC town planning department rejected the application citing land was reserved for playground on September 21, 2007. Claiming the same department had sanctioned building plan in 1981, Waswani submitted an appeal to the state’s urban development department. In its order dated April 24, 2015, minister of state for urban development   stressed the need for an inquiry for sanction given to commercial building on land reserved for playground. He also asked for change in the reservation.
 
 NMC records show no inquiry was conducted done into the case. However, the town planning department started the process, including public suggestions and objections, on proposal to change reservation. NMC said there were no suggestions or objections received. Then, the department tabled a proposal before the general body, which will be submitted to the government for consent, if approved by the general body.
 
 In Samata Society case, the land measuring 2,700 sq m is reserved as existing open space. NMC has issued notification on January 24 inviting suggestions and objections on the proposal to change reservation to residential.
 
 The proposal says Dr Ambedkar Housing Sahakari Gruh Nirman Sanstha had got approved layout from   (NIT) on 12,828 sq m land in 1973. The society had complained that NIT reserved 5,224 sq m (40.72%) as open space instead of 25% as per norms. The society had filed an appeal with the UDD, requesting permission to bring into residential use 2,700 sq m land. UDD order dated September 10, 2001 had asked NMC to begin process to change reservation.
 
 An NMC official told TOI the UDD order with map was not found in the records with NIT or UDD, so the process was delayed. “The society had filed writ petition in the HC that directed NMC to follow the UDD order. Therefore, we invited suggestions and objections. We will submit the proposal before the general body and then UDD after completing the process. It is up to UDD to take a final decision on changing reservation or not,” he said.
