A ladies club in Kanpur recently organised an   theme party for its members. Organised at a city hotel, the ladies came wearing kaftans and veils to match the theme.
"Themes surely make parties more interesting. This time we thought of organising an Arabian theme party so that the excitement among the members goes to another level," said  , the hostess for the evening.

 The DJ at the party took it a notch higher by playing Arabian tunes like ' ' and 'I Love You Mama', on which the ladies danced. We also spotted Dimple, Preeti and   dancing while Tara, Sweety, Tina and   caught up with each other. Shagun, who came dressed in harem pants and a golden shimmery top, received a lot of compliments for dressing perfectly for the party.
 Also present were Kitty, Paramjeet, Pramod, Sippy, Amrita, and Ritu.
