  Tulsi called students on stage to click a selfie with them, and even asked some of them to sing with her. Preksha, one of the students who was invited on stage, said, "It was an amazing experience. Tulsi ma'am is such a great singer and yet so humble. I'm a big fan of her voice. I'm so happy I got a chance to sing with her."
 
  As the girls started leaving due to their hostel timings, Kumar sang ' ' and requested them to stay a little longer. Preeti Malhotra, a faculty member, said, "The event was really nice. Though it would have been better if the event had started early (Tulsi's gig was scheduled at 6pm, but started at 8pm), since the girls' hostel's deadline is 7.30pm. But we stretched it till 9pm for the students."
