HYDERABAD: Traffic cops have found that nearly 70% riders driving vehicles sporting stickers like 'Press', 'Judge' and 'Army' fail to provide identity proof and try to fool authorities claiming that the vehicle belongs to their friend or a sibling. Police fear criminals may carry out illegal activities under the garb of these  . 

 "I come across over 20 such vehicles on any day," a traffic cop posted at Khairatabad junction confessed. When such vehicles are caught, motorists make all sorts of excuses for not providing valid identity proofs. 
 
 "Nearly 70% of people who put up stickers on the registration plate fail to provide valid identity proofs from their organisations. They usually make up an excuse stating that the vehicle belongs to their relative or siblings, who are from Army or police or media organisation," Abids traffic inspector,   said.
 
 With more and more such cases coming to light, traffic police and road safety experts worry that criminals could easily dodge law-enforcing authorities using such stickers. 
 
 "Many motorists put up stickers to dodge cops at signals. Similarly, criminals could resort to such tactics and carry illegal things in a vehicle and dodge cops,"  , founder of  , said.
 
 "It is difficult to ascertain whether the person driving is a genuine cop or media person or judge. According to the Motor Vehicle (MV) Act, nothing should be written on the number plate other than the registration number. A vehicle's number plate cannot sport a fancy font or experiment with the design," road safety expert, K Sundeep, said.
