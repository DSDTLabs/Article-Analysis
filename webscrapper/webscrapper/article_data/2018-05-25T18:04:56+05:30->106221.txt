 Leading lady Alia is happy with the positive response to the film as she said at a press conference, “Since the beginning, we thought that we were making a small film, so we didn’t feel we would get so much attention and love from the audience. We were proud of the film but the kind of unanimous reaction we are getting for the film is amazing. We all are pleasantly shocked. I am really happy, especially for Meghna Gulzar because I think she hasn’t slept for God knows how many months,” she added.
 “She was so nervous before the release of the film but the audience has given so much love that we are so grateful. Some people were crying after watching the film and I feel really happy when I make people cry through my films. Then I feel we have done our job,” the actress said.
 
 Also starring Jaideep Ahlawat, Shishir Sharma, Rajit Kapoor, Soni Razdan, Arif Zakaria and Amruta Khanvilkar in pivotal roles, ‘Raazi’ has been produced by Vineet Jain, Karan Johar, Hiroo Johar and Apoorva Mehta and co-produced by Priti Shahani.
