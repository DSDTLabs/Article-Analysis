Porbandar:   

 Addressing the second phase of Gujarat Gaurav Yatra in the coastal town, Shah told the crowd: “Elections in Gujarat will be held in the first week of December. Will you overwhelmingly vote for the BJP? Will you ensure BJP forms the government again?” The crowd responded ‘Yes’ in chorus/
 
 Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi continued to come under fire from the BJP leader who slammed him for questioning the Gujarat model of development.
 
 Hitting out at should remove ‘Italian glasses’ and put on ‘Gujarati spectacles’ to see the development that has taken place in Gujarat under the BJP rule.
 
 “Congress is asking us what the Narendra Modi government at the Centre has given Gujarat in the last three years. I want to remind them that the Modi government approved AIIMS for Gujarat, an international airport for Rajkot, approved raising the height of Narmada dam and allocated homes to 6 lakh urban poor,” Shah said.
 
 “However, Rahul could not see any of this. He still asks what we have done in these three years. Rahul can’t see it because he is wearing Italian glasses. To be able to see the development, he needs to remove those spectacles and wear Gujarati glasses,” Shah added.
 
 Taking a jibe at the Gandhi scion’s recent US visit, Shah said that the Congress dreamt of winning Gujarat elections but that is not possible if their party men go on vacation to the US. “The Congress is still dreaming about winning the polls. Everyone has the right to see dreams. But if you are dreaming about winning the polls, you cannot go for vacation in the US. To win the polls, you need to do some hard work. You need to remain with the people of Gujarat for their development,” he said.
 
 Continuing his tirade against the Congress for ignoring Gujarati stalwarts like Sardar Patel and Morarji Desai, Shah said that people in the state won’t vote for a party that had only inflicted injustice on Gujarat for three generations.
