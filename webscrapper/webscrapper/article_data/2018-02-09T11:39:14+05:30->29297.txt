Aami. Kamala Das. Madhavi Kutty. Different names of an independent spirit who celebrated her independence. She wrote poetry, her own tell-all story, stood for elections, converted to a different religion, in short lived a complete life. Anyone who aspires to capture that life, even one slice of it, is a brave soul. And that soul happens to be  , who has a strong body work tp boast of. The entire intelligentia of Kerala waits with bated breath to watch   the movie.

 1) The most important reason to watch Aami is, without doubt, that it takes up the challenge to capture the life of Kamala Das, one of the most talented and controversial poets of our times, on screen. While alive, both through her writings as well as her life itself, she used to create ripples in the largely conservative society and at the same time emboldened a generation of women to question the accepted norms of the society.
 
 2) Kamal, who has established himself as one of the leading lights of mainstream Malayalam cinema, is attempting yet another biopic after he tasted success with Celluloid, on the life of J C Daniel, the father of Malayalam cinema.
 
 3) After Vidya Balan pulled out of the project citing creative differences, and   was drafted in as the leading lady, there was a lot of discussion about the movie in mainstream as well as social media.
 
 4) A recent interview by the filmmaker in which he said that Manju was able to capture the Malayaliness of Kamala Das better and that had Vidya played the lead, the sensual aspect would have got undue prominence led to a lot of criticism and speculation in the media on what kind of a film this is going to be.
 
 5) It is well known that Kamala Das fell in love with a Muslim gentleman and converted to Islam. The entire cultural world is sure to look forward to how the filmmaker captures this episode in his film.
