NEW DELHI: The   on Monday stayed a March 28 order of the  , which had put a four-month ban on mining in the state saying no fresh lease or prospective licence could be issued during this period.

 After hearing senior advocate Nidesh Gupta challenging the decision on the ground that it put to naught the existing mining policy and laws while affecting business of mining lease holders, a bench headed by Chief Justice   ordered a stay on the HC decision.
 
 The petitioners pointed out that   had been dealing with sand mining on the Ganga river bed and had allowed mining subject to stringent conditions.
 
 “When the specialised body has already examined the matter and issued directions, the HC was not justified in imposing a blanket ban on mining on the river bed,” they said.
 
 The HC had ordered the constitution of a committee which would find out whether mining should be permitted at all and would chart out suggestions for the next five decades.
 
 The court had ordered Rs 50 lakh be released for the committee’s expenses.
