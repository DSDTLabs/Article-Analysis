NEW DELHI:   in the capital may soon be equipped with more disabled-friendly features though cleanliness and passenger safety will be given top priority. 

 According to the   presented on Wednesday, all coaches will be equipped with bio-toilets by 2019 and a pilot project will be implemented at the New Delhi   station. Under this project, municipal solid waste and biodegradable trash will be converted to energy. For the first time, the railway   has been merged with the Union Budget.
 
 Last year, the idea of strengthening Delhi’s iconic ring railway system was mooted. The government now plans to analyse its revival. “We were already analysing the feasibility plans to see how it can be implemented efficiently,” said a Northern Railway official.
 
 In the Budget 2017-18, the total outlay for Delhi was Rs 444 crore as compared to Rs 208 crore in the previous financial year. The government also proposed to make 500 railway stations disabled-friendly. Officials said more escalators and lifts might be added to some stations in Delhi in the next few months. The idea is to give the disabled passengers easy access to foot overbridges. The Delhi division of Northern Railway had earlier signed an MoU with Container Corporation of India Ltd (CONCOR) in this regard.
 
 Better seating facilities may be added for passengers with physical disabilities. According to an NR official, details of these plans will be available soon. “The timeline for executing these plans will be cleared in the coming days,” the official added.
