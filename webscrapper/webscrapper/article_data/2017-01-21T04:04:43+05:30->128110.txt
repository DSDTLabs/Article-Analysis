CHENNAI: It took more than three hours for   to get to Guindy from Washermenpet. "Even while returning home, I had to hitch a ride with someone till   and then flag an auto for hiked rates. Commute was a nightmare for us office-goers," said the 24-year-old. 

 With pro-jallikattu chants echoing throughout the city on Friday, normal life seemed to have slipped into a further state of disarray. Public transport was scarce, shops remained shut and several schools closed early. 
 
 The rail roko protest by DMK members, said Zubaida, affected the one mode of transport that had been plying without hiccups this week. 
 
 Autorickshaw drivers too wrapped up early - some looking to get home, and others joining the swelling crowd of protesters on the Marina. "One regular called from Dubai and asked me to drop his parents at   safely. After ferrying my regulars, I'm heading to the protest arena with my friends," said Selva, an auto driver from Thiruvanmiyur.
 
 The MTC management operated skeletal bus services, while the crew of inter-state SETC buses continued their strike.
