NEW DELHI: India skipper   notched up his 21st Test century on the third day of the second Test between India and South Africa at Centurion on Monday. Kohli was unbeaten on 85 when he resumed proceedings on Day 3 and took just 16 balls to get there, taking India past the 200-run margin.

 
 
 
 
 
 Kohli began the 65th over with consecutive boundaries off Lungi Ngidi, and a quick single off Kagiso Rabada took him to his 21st three-digit score in Tests. This was Kohli's second century in South Africa. He had scores of 119 and 96 in Johannesburg in December 2013.
 
 
 
 However, Kohli's bid to strengthen India's grip over the Test took a severe hit when his partner Hardik Pandya was run out. Pandya took off for a single but Kohli refused, and while returning to the crease, the allrounder put in a casual effort. His feet and bat were found to be in the air even though he had crossed the line. R Ashwin came out and played some brazen strokes to reach 25 off 25 balls.
 
 Last year, Kohli had equalled Ricky Ponting and Sachin Tendulkar’s record of 11 international hundreds in a year. As a skipper, he also had surpassed Brian Lara’s record of five Test double tons last year.
