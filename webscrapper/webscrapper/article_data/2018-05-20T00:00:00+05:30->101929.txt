Young actor   is the leading man of director Yogaraj Bhat’s next,  . For the two-film-old actor, the movie holds a lot of promise, what with him playing a young racer, who also specialises in refurbishing race cars, pitted against Rangayana Raghu, an old-timer who owns a nearby building and objects to the activities in the garage. “The conflict between Vihan and Raghu is heightened owing to the generation gap. One of the turning points in the film involves a race they undertake to solve an issue. Earlier this week, we shot portions involving practice for the race. The highlight here is that we are using actual   cars in an authentic   setting, which we are working on in tandem with a company that conducts rallies,” says   from Yogaraj’s team. 
In the film, the race takes place between Bengaluru and Mysuru and back, and the team is looking at canning this in areas like Ramnagara, Pandavpura, Mysuru, Srirangapatna and Kanakpura. “Vihan is a good driver and will do most of the driving himself. He will, of course, be assisted by Manish and Chandan from the firm that is helping us with the rally details,” adds Hariprasad.
