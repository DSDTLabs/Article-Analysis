Vadodara: Founder and former president of Waghodiya-based Parul University Jayesh Patel, who is currently in jail for raping a nursing student of the university, has applied for bail in sessions court. The police submitted an affidavit before the court on Tuesday opposing Patelâ€™s bail application.

 Even as the trial in the case is on, Patel filed for bail on January 6. The local crime branch (LCB) of Vadodara rural police which had filed the chargesheet against Patel and his co-accused Bhavana Chauahan, filed an affidavit on Tuesday opposing his bail. However, the details of the affidavit were not known.
 
 Patel had filed for bail in the past as well on health grounds, but his request was turned down by the court.
