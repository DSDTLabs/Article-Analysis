HYDERABAD: As the much awaited inauguration of   in Shaikpet took place amid much fanfare on Monday, a defunct swimming pool and fountain caught everyone's attention. Municipal administration and urban development (MA&UD) minister KT Rama Rao inaugurated the park. But, officials were questioned as to why they hurriedly opened the park sans a functional pool and fountain.

 The defunct pool and fountain were an eyesore for people who visited the park on Monday as authorities had advertised that all the amenities could be used. “We are inspecting the park. After that, a proposal will be made including all amenities that need to be renovated,“ said K Kishan, secretary,  .
 
 But, many curious onlookers present there didn't seem happy with the answers.
 
 Later, KTR said that 108 acres covering the Qutb Shahi Tombs and Golconda Fort will be developed as a tourist circuit by the QQSUDA. He also said that tourist flow into Hyde rabad has steadily increased over the past few years. “ All measures are being taken up to make Hyderabad a safe and smart tourist destination,“ he said. Union minister   and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi also attended the inauguration.“The central government had allocated Rs 500 crore for tourist circuits at Akkana caves, Mahbubnagar and Adilabad,“ Dattatreya said.
 
 Asaduddin Owaisi stressed on the need to increase the green cover at the park by at least 12 per cent and asked KTR to renovate and take up beautification works at   near Golconda Fort. He also asked the state government to fight for Hyderabad's heritage city status similar to the one achieved by Ahmedabad this week. KTR agreed and said that all efforts will be made to win the world heritage city award for Hyderabad.
 
 “The procedure to get the award is lengthy. The state government has to send a requisition that has to be approved by the central government.This will be followed with inspections by   representatives,“ the minister said.ations will lead to positive outcomes.
