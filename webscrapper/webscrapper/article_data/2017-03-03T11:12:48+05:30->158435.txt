GUWAHATI: The defacement of a road's foundation stone laid by former state   president, the late Anjan Dutta, came to chief minister  's attention after Dutta's youngest daughter posted a video on Facebook, seeking restoration of the stone. The chief minister has ordered a probe into the incident. 

 Dutta, who represented the Amguri constituency in   district, had laid the foundation of the   in February 2016. The work could not begin as the model code of conduct for the assembly election came into effect soon after. Last month, the plaque bearing Dutta's name was found defaced. His youngest daughter, Arpita, a Class XI student, took to social media with a video accusing supporters of Amguri legislator   of AGP of being responsible. The video went viral.
 
 The three daughters of the late Congress leader - Angkita, Amrita and Arpita - met Sonowal at his office on Thursday. Sonowal told them that he was aware of the incident and has asked the DC to conduct an inquiry and give him a report. Angkita, who was fielded by Congress in place of Dutta in the last assembly election, had been defeated by Hazarika. Hazarika was not available for his comments on Thursday but a few days ago when the FB video was posted, he had expressed ignorance about the occurrence of any such incident in his constituency. "Even after my sister's video went viral, the miscreants applied black paint on another plaque containing my father's name at the   hall," Angkita told TOI.
