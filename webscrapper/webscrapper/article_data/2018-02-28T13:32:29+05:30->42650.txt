NEW DELHI: Students protesting the Delhi   fare   were   near Central Secretariat station after the situation turned chaotic.

 However, while they were being taken in a police bus they broke the hydraulic pipe, which opened the gates. They then got down at the Raisina Road roundabout and blocked the traffic leading to Press Club for 10 minutes. The #MailtoPresident campaign for collecting postcards was initiated by members of the Left-oriented AISA. They had gone to different areas of the city with requests for the President to intervene in the issue as it affects students the most.
 
 The students claimed that they collected over 30,000 postcards over the past one month and wanted to give them personally to the President.
 
 AISA Delhi University president Kawalpreet Kaur said that they have been protesting against the hike for weeks. They had met DMRC authorities, CM and even the PMO, but their voices were not heard. This is when they decided to personally submit their request to the President.
