Veteran stars   and   have always displayed crackling chemistry when they got together onscreen – be it in Azhagiya Ravanan or their previous venture Pathemari. The duo will now once again team up for the upcoming political thriller directed by  , who had previously helmed Chirakondinja Kinavukal. 
 
 The movie, which is scripted by Bobby-Sanjay duo, will have Mammootty playing Kerala   for the first time. However, Sreenivasan, who is known for scripting political satires and starring as political activist in films such as Sandesham and Arabikkatha, has a diametrically opposite role in the yet-to-be-titled movie. “He will be playing a politically ignorant individual. He doesn’t know a thing about the politics in the State,” says Santhosh.
  
 The movie also has Renji Panicker in a prominent role, playing Mammootty’s best friend. Santhosh had earlier told us that Mammootty’s character is shown as a role model in terms of how a chief minister should in contemporary Kerala.
  
 Another important thread of the film is the discussions that happen between the Kerala CM and a youth played by Vishnu Unnikrishnan. The movie is currently scheduled to go on floors by the end of this year.
  
 Incidentally, the film would also mark a landmark trifecta for the megastar of essaying the role of chief ministers of three Southern states on screen. Mammootty had played Tamil Nadu CM in Makkal Aatchi in 1995, and will be seen as former Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Rajasekhara Reddy in his upcoming Telugu biopic Yatra.
