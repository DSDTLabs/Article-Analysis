Coimbatore: More than 125 taxi drivers were detained by the city police on Wednesday for blocking road outside the regional transport office protesting against the recent regulations brought in by the state government over their working hours. 

 As per the new norms released by the road safety commissioner of the transport department, the operators were asked to restrict working hours to 48 hours a week not exceeding 8 hours per day. This was brought under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and Motor Transport Workers Act, 1961.
 
 The joint secretary of Tourist Taxi Drivers And Owners Welfare Association, Coimbatore, A Prakash, said it was impossible to implement the norms as tourists often book for long distance journeys. “If a tourist wants to travel to Chennai or to Kerala, we enter the time and kilometre details in our trip sheet. These details are checked by RTOs and police officials at various check posts. If the time exceeds, they cancel our licenses. This is unfair,” he said. “Why aren’t other drivers, especially government bus and omni bus drivers, brought under this norm,” he asked.
 
 “We understand that our health aspects are taken into account but this is not practical as far as our profession is concerned. So far, 10,000 licenses have been cancelled across Tamil Nadu. Most of our drivers are experienced and haven’t indulged in any accidents. Yet we are the ones who are forced to follow such rules,” said Prakash.
 
 The taxi drivers belonging to five different associations blocked the road and stalled traffic for nearly an hour. The officials held talks with them and promised that their suggestions and demands will be informed to the government. The taxi drivers said that they will stage a state-wide protest if the government did not respond to their demands.
