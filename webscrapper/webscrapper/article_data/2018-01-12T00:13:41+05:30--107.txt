MUMBAI: Observing that there has to be a balance between the rights of an accused and that of the victim’s family, the Bombay high   on Thursday continued the stay on the trial in the killing of   leader Govind Pansare.

 Justice Revati Mohite-Dere heard a plea by the special investigation team, which is probing the killings of Pansare and rationalist Narendra Dabholkar, to defer the trial as the investigation is on. In 2016, the HC in an interim order stayed the trial to enable CBI to obtain ballistics reports from Scotland Yard of the bullets used in the killings of Pansare, Dabholkar and Kannada writer M M Kalburgi. 
 
 Quizzed by the judge about this, senior advocate Ashok Mundargi said “forensic reports of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka have established some links in respect of the bullets and weapon.” He said two shooters were identified and are at large. 
 
 The judge questioned why the state government had never applied for transfer of probe to the CBI. Mundargi said a division bench of the court, which is monitoring the probe, has said on December 7 that both agencies come join together to complete the investigation.
 
 Advocate  , appearing for accused   who was arrested in 2016, questioned whether “the ends of justice can be met by keeping the accused (Tawade) in jail?” He said Tawade’s plea for bail was rejected by the sessions court. “The trial must start. His rights have to be protected,” he added. This is when Justice Mohite-Dere said “there are rights both the ways” for the accused and the victim’s family and there has to be a balance.
