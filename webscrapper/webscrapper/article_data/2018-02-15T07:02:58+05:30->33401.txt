AMRITSAR: “Look, as promised we have met on the Valentines’ day” this is what Indian and Pakistani lovebirds who fulfilled their dream of meeting each other on Valentines Day in India believed to have told the investigating agencies here.

 Though both married, Vicky, a resident of Gwadar in Balochistan province of Pakistan and Geeta (name changed) from Baroda in   who had met on Facebook managed to meet on Valentines Day at Amritsar.
 
 As soon as Vicky arrived from Pakistan as part of Hindu Jatha on February 12th, he disappeared which created panic among rest of Hindu jatha members who rushed to police.
 
 “One of his relatives had taken him along with him to a hotel near Golden Temple, but now police have found him and he is back with us,” said Mukesh   President Shri Guru Seva Welfare Trust, Karachi while talking to TOI on Wednesday. 
 
 He, however, said that there was a misunderstanding and Vicky was back with them now.
 
 The sudden ‘disappearance’ of one of Pak Hindu pilgrim especially at a time when both nations are at loggerheads sent the security apparatus into a tizzy.
 
 Deputy commissioner police Lakhbir Singh told that following the complaint, they traced Vicky from a hotel in the vicinity of Golden Temple. He informed that Vicky and the lady had met on Facebook and had planned to meet in Amritsar.
 
 He informed that Vicky had joined rest of Jatha members adding that police was investigating the incident and if any anti-India activity was found they would take action accordingly.
 
 Meanwhile, Rana informed that Vicky was back with the rest of Jatha members.
