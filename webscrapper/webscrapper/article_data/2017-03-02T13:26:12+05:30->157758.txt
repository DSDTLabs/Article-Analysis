VARANASI: Union finance minister   said that had it been the regime of late   and late Indira Gandhi Congress could never think to extend support to separatists, who loud anti-national slogans at institutions like JNU in Delhi. Jaitley held two regional parties   and Bahujan Samaj Party responsible for the plight of Uttar Pradesh.

 While addressing a gathering of industrialists and traders Jaitley said, “When I was studying the news that economic activities were not impacted by demonetization and Indian economy expanded by 7% in third quarter, with the reactions of Congress leaders it seemed that latter felt why this havoc came. The reason for this feeling of Congress is that following the decision of demonetization the voters of country came with BJP. Even a community that never favoured BJP in past, supported the party in 47 slum areas in Mumbai corporation polls.“
 
 Without understanding the need of hour and mood of people Congress has taken a stand for cash-based economy while entire world is going for cashless economy, said Jaitley.
