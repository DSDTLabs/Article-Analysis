MUMBAI: One of the transformers in   that had tripped early on Friday, inconveniencing score of residents living in  , was restored on Sunday. Government officials said there will be no more "rotational loadshedding" from Monday. However, a source at a utility firm said that monsoon is about to begin and waterlogging coupled with increased demand could lead to power cuts. 

 A massive fire had burnt the cables of two Maharashtra   (MSETCL) transformers in Kalwa. Teams from state electricity transmission and distribution companies replaced the burnt wires of one of the transformers and restored the system by Sunday evening. 
 
 "If there is peak load consumption-which means maximum use of air-conditioners and other electrical appliances, it may lead to demand being more than supply," said an official.
 
 In a media statement, a spokesperson from Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) said, "If the demand rises, there will be extra burden on the system and the system can fail. Hence,   will execute a plan so that there is very less power interruption. We appeal to consumers to cooperate."
 
 Another official said that in case of massive water-logging, cables get damaged or are at a risk of short-circuit. On Saturday evening, when the pre-monsoon showers, accompanied by gusty winds, hit the city, authorities shut down the feeders supplying power as a precautionary measures in Kalyan, Ulhasnagar, Shahapur , Murbad, Dombivali, Titwala, Ambaranath area. Supply was restored within one to two hours, said an official. 
 
 The fire at the transformers is being probed by a high-level MSETCL team. "We will ascertain the cause of the fire which led to the breakdown and inconvenienced scores of citizens. We first restored the system in three days as against the scheduled seven-day period. Now, we will investigate," a senior official from MSETCL added.
