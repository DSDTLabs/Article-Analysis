CHENNAI: Gayathri R, 25, an avid   user, describes the statewide jallikattu movement as a “user powered” campaign which “everyone contributed to”. 

 The success of pro-jallikattu social media campaign, which documented and spurred thousands to support the movement, is in stark contrast to the apathy towards the massive social media campaigns of the   and political parties last year in the run-up to the assembly election.
 
 The poll panel roped in actors, sportspersons, posted memes and dubsmash videos on social media platforms. The posters had catchy one-liners which the youth could relate to. Though the memes were shared on social media, voter turnout in Chenani was among the lowest in the state.
 
 The IT wings of political parties, on overdrive, circulated posters, memes and videos on WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook. The memes that mocked and parodied politicians went viral.
 
 Though the jallikattu campaign also has its share of acerbic memes, many of the messages and videos reflected a more passionate involvement in state politics and the causes the protesters are batting for.
 
 Prasanna, 26, a volunteer on the Marina, said social media helped organise food and resources and helped them get to know what was happening in other parts of the state. “The messages reflected the overall anger against the government,” he said.
 
 Mohammed Jailani, 40, a film director, who helped arrange for food for the protesters, describes the movement as “unprecedented”. “The youth rejected politics and filmstars and there were no political messages,” he said. While there were satirical memes, the majority of the messages were serious, reflecting pent-up frustrations of young people, he said.
 
 According to social media consultant  , the movement evolved “from within”. “The uprising happened from the grassroots level. Students had a sense of ownership and felt empowered,” he said. Higher mobile ownership and better Internet access also contributed, he said.
