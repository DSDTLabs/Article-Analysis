Simbu has recently recorded the intro song for Adhik’s Anbanavan Adangathavan Asarathavan. He has crooned a folk number, Raththam En Raththam, written by Vairamuthu. Interestingly, this is the first time Vairamuthu has written a song for Simbu’s film. This is expected to be a fresh combo in Kollywood.   A source confirms, “When the director approached Vairamuthu for the song, he agreed to work on it. This was recorded last week. Simbu as usual recorded the song within a few minutes. The folk number, which is the introduction song of Simbu in the film, will be shot in a grand manner next week in the city.”
