AHMEDABAD: With testing procedure already in the final phase, the work on installing smart fencing will soon begin in three states of Gujarat, Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir. The smart fencing will ensure the detection of infiltration from Pakistan in   of  . 

 The smart fencing project aims to install similar multi-tier security system on the 3,323-km-long Indo-Pak border. The government aims to seal the Indo-Pak border by 2018.
 
 According to   (BSF) officials, the new multi-tier security system including sensors, cameras and radars will be installed to detect movement on the border where setting up of fencing is impossible.
 
 The Sir Creek area is a 56-km long stretch comprising several water channels and 40 small islands, said the BSF officials. “The swampy area—right from the   of Pakistan to Kutch in Gujarat—is hard to navigate and setting up of fencing is impossible. We have a BSF patrol battalion in the area with all-terrain vehicles. However, patrolling becomes extremely hard in the marshy area. Hence, to prevent infiltration, most of the time by Pakistani fishermen, the smart multi-tier security system is essential,” said a senior BSF official.
 
 According to the BSF officials, the sensors and cameras placed at specific locations notorious for infiltration by Pakistani fishermen will detect movement and pass the signals on to the control room. “Once located the infiltrators could be easily apprehended. A technical committee of the BSF is working on obtaining the best of devices available. Apart from the Sir Creek area, the multi-tier security system will also be installed in some areas of Rann of Kutch. The installation will start soon,” added the official.
 
 The state and central intelligence agencies suspect that the Sir Creek area can become a hot spot for terror operatives or smugglers.
