CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder on Thursday ruled out enhancing his security with additional cover from the Centre in the wake of threats from Canada-based pro-Khalistanis.

 Amarinder took on the Canadian government again, saying, “I regret that organizations like Sikhs for Justice, which was purportedly behind some of the video threats doing the social media rounds, were being supported, overtly or covertly, by certain Indian origin members of the Canadian parliament.”
 
 “There is no question of approaching the central government for increased security. State cops are more than capable of providing protection to the people,” Amarinder said on Thursday
 
 At least three Canada-based men belonging to the human rights advocacy group had issued threats in a social media-circulated video, saying “our men are already in India and they will give answer to Amarinder and Congress   MP   for dubbing Canadian defence minister   ahead of his trip to India last month.”
 
 Amarinder also dared the men, seen in the video, to “come to state and face government’s wrath”.
 
 Despite repeated attempts over texts and calls, Punjab Police ADGP (intelligence)   did not respond to queries if he had any leads or has shared any inputs on involvement of pro-Khalistani men in the January 30 Maur blast that had left seven dead in the middle of assembly elections, assassinations of several Hindu leaders or Sirsa dera followers in Februrary this year. Gupta also did not respond to queries on any attempt to cops to identify the men seen in the videos.
 
 Amarinder, however, agreed it was a concern that elements like those seen in the video are trying hard to disrupt the peace and harmony of Punjab. “If they have the guts, they should come to Punjab, and my government will take suitable action to ensure that they do not get away with their cowardly threats and attempts to revive terrorism in the state,” he added.
