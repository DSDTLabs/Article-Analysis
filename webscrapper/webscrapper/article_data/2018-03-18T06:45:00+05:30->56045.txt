Kolkata: Changing names of central   is likely to turn out to be a hot topic for debate in the upcoming panchayat polls. 

 While BJP points fingers at the Mamata Banerjee government for changing names of central government schemes, Trinamool leaders dish out a list of central schemes that the Bengal government has been running with its own funds. “The Mamata Banerjee government has changed names of several Centre-sponsored projects because the state is sharing 40% cost of such projects. As a matter of fact, we have decided that changing of names of our central government projects would be our prime focus in the panchayat polls,” BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said after a party meeting on Saturday. 
 
 Trinamool, however, gave a strong rebuttal to Ghosh’s statement. “The Centre has stopped giving money to their schemes. The state government has kept the projects alive in the state at its own cost,” said Trinamool secretary general Partha Chatterjee.
 
 “There is nothing wrong in changing names as we are putting almost the same amount of money as the central government. I have to give Rs 1,500 crore every month for rice... Will they give the money? In fact, the central government also changed the names of many projects given by the previous government.” state food minister Jyotipriya Mullick said.
