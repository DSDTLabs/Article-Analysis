BENGALURU: Taking exception to Goa water resources minister   that Karnataka is ‘playing dirty tricks’ in the  , the state government on Friday said it will seek Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention following the   to explore an out-of-court settlement.

 Speaking to TOI, Karnataka’s water resources minister M B Patil said: “We are not playing any dirty tricks. In fact, the   Water Disputes Tribunal has suggested the three riparian states – Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra – to reach an amicable settlement outside the court. Legal counsels of the three states had agreed to the suggestion, and it was in this backdrop that chief minister Siddaramaiah invited Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis and Goa CM Manohar Parrikar for a meeting.” 
 
 Karnataka has been seeking 7.56 tmcft of water from the Mahadayi river basin to Malaprabha in order to meet the drinking water requirements of Hubballi-Dharwad and adjoining villages.
 
 While the Maharashtra CM agreed to the meeting, Goa’s water resources minister Vinod Palyekar announced on Thursday night: “There will be no compromise or out-of-court settlement on the Mahadayi case with Karnataka. This is the official stand of the Goa government. Karnataka, on one hand, is asking for a settlement and writing to our CM and, on the other hand, it is playing dirty tricks from behind (sic). Karnataka’s witness has been well-exposed in the tribunal at New Delhi and our legal team is doing a wonderful job.”
 
 Reacting to Palyekar’s statement, Patil stated: “Goa is our neighbouring state. We have respect for the tribunal’s suggestion and we will try to solve the issue through mediation. We hope the Goa CM and water resources minister will change their mind and the issue will be amicably solved.”
