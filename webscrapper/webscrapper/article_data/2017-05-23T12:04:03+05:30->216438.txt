NEW DELHI: Among the admission seekers who turned up for the DU ‘Open Day’ on Monday was 66-year-old Nagesh Chadda, who came to enquire about whether the university offers an MA course in  .

 “I came to the university to collect a certificate. I though it would be better to attend the event and get my queries sorted out,” said Chadda, a resident of Roop Nagar, close to North Campus. He revealed he had been an admirer of the language. “My father was an avid Urdu reader and would often encourage us to learn the language,” he said.
 
 Chadda’s father was an employee of the   (LIC) in Fiji. He passed away early and Chadda landed a job in the company on compassionate grounds. “I lived with my father in Fiji and did my engineering from there. When I returned to India, I wanted to study further. However, I had to start working because of my father’s untimely demise.”
 
 Chadda attained a BCom degree while continuing his job at LIC. He then changed his profession and moved to   where he spent 20 years of his life before retiring as its PRO in 2011.
 
 “When I retired, my two sons told me that I had done enough and I should enjoy myself and do whatever my heart desired. Then I realised that I should pursue my love for the Urdu language and I enrolled myself in DU’s diploma course.”
 
 He is awaiting his Urdu advanced diploma results and was hoping that he could apply for an MA course. “However, the university does not offer this course,” he said. “Since I wanted to study further and I have decided to opt for subjects like German or even photography as someone in the university suggested it to me.”
 
 Chadda, however, rues that there isn’t any special provision for senior citizens like him. He said that he might also opt for an English MA course though he did not take any decision yet.
