AHMEDABAD: Nirmesh Kapoor, a 43-year-old businessman, took an IndiGo airline flight from Ahmedabad to Delhi with his mother early on Monday. He was to take a cab to Ramnagar for a wedding in the family after reaching Delhi. As soon as he landed, he realized his luggage hadn’t arrived at the Delhi airport by the same flight. Kapoor wasn’t alone; there were various passengers who travelled by different airlines who did not get their luggage.

 Airline officials said that the baggage conveyor belt at the city airport, which helps move luggage from the airport to the flight, malfunctioned on Monday morning. Due to this, the luggage of several outgoing passengers, especially those to Delhi, was not sent by the same flight. This left several passengers in a fix, as some had planned an onward journey from Delhi.
 
 “We don’t have relatives in Delhi and it was an ordeal spending the day, especially for my aging mother, whose medicines were in the luggage. Even as the airline officials assured us that we’d get our luggage by the next flight, we are yet to receive any information despite repeated follow-ups,” said Kapoor.
 
 The passengers flying various airlines faced this issue. “Since there were no outgoing flights to Delhi after the 7.10am flight, the luggage would be sent by an evening flight and the passengers would receive it by night,” an official from IndiGo said.
 
 Some airlines did manage to rush the baggage to fliers. “A few passengers did face an issue however, we managed to send the luggage by the next flight and it has been dispatched to them,” confirmed a   spokesperson.
 
 Well-placed sources in   confirmed that the issue was faced by passengers travelling to Delhi and Mumbai-London. The airline arranged to send the luggage via Mumbai. Despite several attempts, the airport director could not be reached for comment.
