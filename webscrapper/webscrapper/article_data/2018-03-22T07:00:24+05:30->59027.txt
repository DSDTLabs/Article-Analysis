LUCKNOW: A history-sheeter accused of attacking a police officer in the past shot at a woman over a land dispute near   on Wednesday.

 According to the police, attacker Banwari Lal Yadav has been detained and interrogation is under way.
 
 The victim,   (40) of   village, was overseeing construction work on a disputed plot of land when Banwari reached there. He allegedly thrashed labourers, threatening to shoot them, said the police. When Leelawati intervened, Banwari opened fire at her.
 
 Shot in the stomach, a bleeding Leelawati slumped and labourers fled in fear. When her family got to know, they took Leelawati to a hospital.
 
 “As she was critical, we first took her to CHC Mohanlalganj and then to   hospital, from where doctors referred her to KGMU,” said Cantonment circle officer Tanu Upadhayay.
 
 FIRs under attempt to murder and   Act have been registered against Banwari. A report on Leelawati’s condition is awaited.
 
 “The woman is conscious and doctors are examining her. We will take her statement once she is fit to talk,” said the officer.
 
 According to the police, the bloody battle is three years old.
 
 Banwari, said to be close to some influential politicians, tried to usurp the highvalue land which Leelawati’s family claimed as parental.
 
 The victim’s family alleged that Banwari had applied all tactics to grab the land.
 
 He is also accused of opening fire at then-CO Maharajganj Prabhat Kumar in 2015, for which he had served a jail term.
