KOCHI: Though the authorities granted sanction to build sea walls at   coastal areas in   around three months ago, the residents are concerned over the delay in implementing the project. 

 "We have been demanding the construction of the sea walls for more than 20 years as the sea turns rough and washes away the land quite frequently. When the Ockhi Cyclone wreaked havoc elected representatives from our area said they would expedite the works. But the promise is yet to be fulfilled," said A V Falgunan, a resident of Edavanakkad and secretary of the Matsya Thozhilali Congress.
 
 "Ockhi almost destroyed our homes and took away whatever we had. It all happened because there were no strong sea walls. So, if authorities delay the project, we will be forced to protest. We have just begun picking up the pieces of our shattered lives and we won't be able to survive one more tragedy," said Falgunan.
 
 During Ockhi, furious waves swept across the beach stretches in Edavanakkad,   and Veliyathparambu. According to official figures, three houses were completely destroyed and more than 30 houses were partially destroyed. 
 
 Deepan, a resident of Nayarambalam said the reconstruction of sea walls at Cherayi, Kuzhipally, and Nayarambalam is also in limbo.
 
 Meanwhile Edavanakkad panchayat president   said the construction activities will begin soon. The delay occurred after the authorities faced some issues while inviting tenders. Now, they have been resolved, he said.
