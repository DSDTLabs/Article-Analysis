AHMEDABAD: Ahead of the official inauguration of the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit ( ), on Monday evening, city cops detained dalit leader Jignesh Mevani, farmer rights activist Sagar Desai and PAAS leader Atul Patel from Usmanpura - where they had gathered along with their supporters. Mevani was scheduled to hold a media briefing over grievances about land allotment to dalits. Mevani was released later on Tuesday. 

 Mevani had made headlines when he led the dalit protests in Gujarat, after four dalits were brutally flogged by cow vigilantes in Una sparking national outrage. “We were not allowed to hold peaceful demonstrations. If we question why fertile land is being handed over to industrialists, we are dubbed anti-development. We get no answers when we ask them how many jobs will VGGS create,” said Mevani.
 
  According to police sources, Mevani and other leaders were planning to hold protests against VGGS and had raised slogans against education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama. Mevani said police had arrested them as he had threatened to disrupt VGGS.
 
 The police complaint lodged against the leaders mentions they didn’t have police permission to hold a protest, and thus they were detained and brought to   police station.
 
 Around noon, on Tuesday, OBC leader   and one his supporters rushed to Gujarat University police station to meet Mevani. “We met Thakor and assured him about releasing Mevani and two others detained for violating Section 144,” said a police official.
