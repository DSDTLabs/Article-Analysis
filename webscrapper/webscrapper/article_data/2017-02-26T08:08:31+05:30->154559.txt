 During its stay in the city, the ship will be training oil handling agencies regarding marine pollution and oil spill response.
 
 “There are only a few countries in south Asia having such special ships dedicated to pollution response. We have three in our fleet. The ICGS Samudra Paheredar was deployed off the coast of Chennai in January 2017, following a massive oil spill caused by the collision of two ships. The ship was on duty there for many days and removed close to 60 tonnes of oil from the sea,” said Deputy Commandant Avinandan Mitra of the ICG (Region North East).
 
 The equipment on board the ship is used for containment, recovery, separation and dispersal of pollutants. An advanced computing software on board assists in predicting the spread of an oil spill pattern. It is also equipped with a CRN 91 naval gun, a light helicopter, five high-speed boats and four water scooters. Accompanying the ship is the ICGS Anmol that was instrumental in saving more than 300 lives of stranded Bangladeshi and Indian fishermen in August 2016 and has been awarded the best Search and Rescue Ship of the Coast Guard Fleet.
