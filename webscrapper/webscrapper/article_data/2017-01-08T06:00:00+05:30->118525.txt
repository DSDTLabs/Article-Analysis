A group of eleven students travelled to   forests to light up the lives of a tribal village community, quite literally. The contingent, that is part of a student-run non-profit organisation, HYA- Street Cause, brightened up the 20-odd households in  ,  , by installing LED lamps and setting up solar panels. “The 110 villagers here have been living without electricity. This makes them prone to attacks from wild animals like elephants, leopards and tigers during night as they live in the heart of the forest. To help improve their quality of life, we conceptualised the project ‘Tropical Enlightenment’,” said  , the director of the student group. 
Elaborating further on the execution of the project, she added, “We went inside the  , also known as  , and travelled for about an hour in the forest jeeps which are usually used for safaris. We got help from the sarpanch and the forest range officer to reach this remote village. Once there, we installed 20 LED lamps with solar panels in their houses. We also gave them a few kilograms of briquettes which could be used instead of firewood for cooking purposes, as this would reduce the amount of smoke being released and make it easier for the women. ”
