BENGALURU: The   snubbed overtures — and pressure — of forming an alliance with the Janata Dal (S) and announced three candidates for the   polls, slated for March 23. The Congress picked Dalit poet L Hanumanthaiah, Vokkaliga leader GC  , and   spokesperson Syed Naseer Hussain as its candidates.

  
 None of the three are chief minister Siddaramaiah’s pick. Hussain’s name was nominated by Mallikarjun M Kharge, the party’s leader in the Lok Sabha; Hanumanthaiah and Chandrashekar were nominated by G Parameshwara,   president.
 
 
 All three are Kannadigas, a win of sorts for the state unit since it refused to give in to pressure from the party high command to field outsiders — Sam Pitroda and Janardhan Dwivedi.
 
 After dilly-dallying, the   nominated businessman and MP, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, as its candidate. BJP chief BS   suffered a setback since he had favoured N Shankarappa, former chairperson of the  , and  , president of the party’s Shivamogga district unit.
 
 The Congress’ decision to field a third candidate — a Muslim — has turned an otherwise-dour election into an interesting battle. The JD (S) had fielded BM Farook in the hope that the Congress would support their candidate. “We’ve no problem with Congress’ decision to field three candidates,” said state JD(S) president HD Kumaraswamy.
