MUMBAI: A day after Raj Thackeray attacked the NDA government and called for a ‘Modi-mukt’ India,   (MNS) workers vandalized   put up at six hotels in Vasai and one at a ‘dhokla’ shop in   West. While four MNS workers have been arrested for the Kandivli attack, no arrests have been made in Vasai so far.

 Raj had, on Sunday, said at arally at Shivaji Park that Modi had been nursing an old wound that Mumbai could not be part of Gujarat even after Sardar Patel had put pressure on Jawaharlal Nehru.
 
 MNS workers returning from the rally early on Monday morning reportedly spotted Gujarati signboards at Sativali in Vasai along the Mumbai-Ahmedabad highway, and MNS functionary from Boisar in Palghar district Kundan Sankhe, along with other workers attacked six hotels serving Kathiawadi food which had these signboards. They pulled down the signboards and told the restaurant owners to put up new ones in Marathi. They also shouted slogans saying only Marathi would be allowed in Maharashtra. Vasai police have registered a case of rioting against six persons.
 
 Later in the morning, MNS workers in Kandivli attacked the Gujarati signboard at the ‘Rajubhai Dhoklawala’ shop on MG Road. MNS activists said they had warned the shop-owner to get the signboard changed, but he paid no heed to them. They have been booked for rioting, police said. The attacks come soon after an open-house interview conducted by Raj with Sharad Pawar in which the NCP chief spoke of how Gujarati entrepreneurs were set to infiltrate Mumbai and Pune, the country’s financial hubs. Pawar had then almost sounded like the late Bal Thackeray when he said Vasai and Mira-Bhayander were choc-a-bloc with Gujaratis. “I hardly see a Marathi signboard in the two bustling cities... They are more in Gujarati,” he had said.
