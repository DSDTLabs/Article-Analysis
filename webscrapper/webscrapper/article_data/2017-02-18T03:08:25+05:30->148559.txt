 The initiative is currently focused on on   between   and Ghata Chowk, with 750 trees up for adoption. 
 
 “The idea behind the initiative was to increase people’s participation in conservation of the green cover,” said MD Sinha, conservator of forests (Gurgaon circle). 
 
 Sinha said the trees have been chosen for the stretch keeping in mind the weather conditions. “We are trying to plant flowering trees to go with the colours of our national flag,” he said. 
 
 “The stretch is beautiful and some years down the line when the flowers start blooming, the stretch would turn more picturesque,” he added.
 
 Some of the saplings that are being planted include Gulmohar, Kuchnar and Dhal, also known as Butea monosperma. 
 
 Sanjay Kaushik of Uthaango, the NGO, claimed a lot of residents have taken interest in the scheme.
 
 “Over the last couple of months, 190 people have already adopted trees on the stretch. We assign a number to each sapling that helps the residents to identify them. A resident can also name them. All they have to do is water the plant, approximately 5 litres, a few times a week, and we will take care of the rest. Two schools have also contacted us as they want their students to adopt a tree,” said Kaushik.
 
 Seema Sahai, one of the people who adopted a tree, said, “I got to know about this initiative from friends and relatives. Though this stretch doesn’t fall on my daily route, I thought being a part of the initiative wouldn’t do any harm. Hence, I decided to adopt a tree,” said Sahai.
