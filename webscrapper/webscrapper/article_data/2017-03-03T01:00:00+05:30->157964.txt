Nee by   is a likeable melody, rendered well by the composer. The strings and the EDM beats (which are mild) make this one an earworm. The beats are peppy yet pleasant. This one’s our pick of the album. Solli Tholaiyen Ma immediately sinks in, thanks to the song being released as a single. Sung by Dhanush, the song has youthful lyrics by Vignesh ShivN. The lyrics are sing-along and the song is a sure-shot hit among youngsters. The flute and techno beats merge in, without sounding awkward. Yet another good listen by Yuvan. 

 This is followed by a beautiful melody, Naan Ini Kaatril by   Shankar Raja and Chinmayi. The orchestration is quite different from the usual ones we hear. The tune and the manner in which the song is executed are phenomenal. The only drawback, though, is Yuvan’s vocals, which do not sync in some portions. On the other hand, Chinamyi’s melodious voice enhances this number. The poetic lyrics of Pa Vijay’s lyrics elevate the beauty of the song. This is followed by Ennulae by   Shah is a haunting solo. The lyrics by  , again, are the highlight of the song. The keys, strings and other interludes make it interesting. However, Tanvi’s voice texture doesn’t suit this song. Yuvan Shankar Raja has found his groove and how! This four-song album is worth a listen.
