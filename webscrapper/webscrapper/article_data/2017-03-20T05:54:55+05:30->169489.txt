JAIPUR: After witnessing continuous   in the second year of its operations, the Jaipur   Rail Corporation (JMRC) is now exploring other ways to  .

 The corporation has drafted a proposal to lease out space at all nine stations to open 50 retail shops. The proposal has been forwarded to the state government for final approval. The JMRC is expecting to earn revenue of Rs 9 crore per annum after leasing out space for these shops.
 
  “We have fixed rates between Rs 700 and Rs 2,000 per sqm to lease out the space to retail shops. The maximum lease would be given for 20 years. The JMRC is hoping to earn Rs 72 lakh per month,” said a JMRC officials.
 
 At three stations - Ram Nagar, Civil Lines and Railway Station - the JMRC has earmarked bigger spaces for lease. According to the officials, establishments such as banks could come up at these stations. 
 
 “The highest rate for lease, Rs 2,000 per sqm has been fixed for Railway Station. Following this, Rs 1,500 per sqm has been fixed for Ram Nagar. The rates for Civil Lines station is Rs 1,000 per sqm,” added the official.
 
 These shops are expected to come up within four months. This would give a boost to JMRC as its past attempts to earn revenue had entirely failed. 
 
 The JMRC had invited tenders in the past to sell space for advertisements. However, not many firms participated and rates received were below expectations.
 
 The JMRC is struggling to earn revenue as average ridership in   dropped from 49,774 per day in the first month (June 2015) of its operations to just 19,390 per day in December 2016.
 
 This has also resulted in revenue loss for JMRC as it could earn Rs 70.44 lakh per month after spending approximately Rs 3.5 crore per month on its operations. The route of phase-I (Mansarovar to Chandpole) has already been criticized by the BJP government several times as it is financially not viable.
