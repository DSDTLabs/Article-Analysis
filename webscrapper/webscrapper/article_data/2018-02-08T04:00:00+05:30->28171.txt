 “Cognizant is one of many firms which is driving hard into the new digital market place and this effort is showing results both in their increased growth and the improved revenue per person and falling head count. One of the aspects of these new digital business is that it requires new skills and more emphasis on onshore skills. This is one of two reasons why Cognizant has increased its onshore hiring. The other is that they are less able to transfer people from India into the US and EU countries as immigration laws and policies are adjusted to make these practices more difficult and expensive. These two factors combined are the factors driving Cognizant and other service providers such as Infosys in accelerating there onshore hiring,” said Peter Bendor-Samuel, CEO Everest Group. 
 
 CTS has ended the year with a headcount of 2,60,000, approximately the same as it was in December 2016, ending with an addition of 3,900 employees this quarter.
