GREATER NOIDA: Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) has cancelled the allotment of a 3.6-acre   to  , located in Greater Noida’s  .   on Tuesday said the developer owes the Authority Rs 14 crore, which is due for almost four years.

 GNIDA officials said the builder has not sold any residential flats yet, as it had not submitted a building plan for the project. No construction has been carried out by the developer for nearly seven years, officials said. 
 
 Officials said the allotment was made to Gayatri Group, the original builder, for constructing residential units in 2010. 
 
 “The builder was allotted 17 acres of land. This land was later subdivided into two divisions in 2013. The cancelled plot, GH-11B in Sector 1, belongs to Comely Buildtech India Pvt Ltd,” GNIDA additional CEO (ACEO) Janardan told TOI.
 
 “The builder has defaulted on his instalments. Fortunately, no third party rights have been created as the builder did not submit its building plans,” he said.
 
 “The developer has failed to pay the instalments due since February 2014, despite several reminders. We sent the builder many notices warning of the impending cancellation but the developer has not paid heed to our warnings,” Janardan said.
 
 Comely Buildtech India Pvt Ltd officials could not be contacted for comments, despite repeated attempts. This is the second group housing plot   by GNIDA. 
 
 In February this year, GNIDA had cancelled the allotment of a 3.7-acre group housing plot in Greater Noida (west).
