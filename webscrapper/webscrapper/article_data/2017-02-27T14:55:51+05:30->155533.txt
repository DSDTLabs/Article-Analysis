NEW DELHI: Prime Minister   on Monday said "definite defeat" was staring at both the ruling   (SP) in   and the opposition   (BSP) and predicted the BJP would win with "huge majority".

 "Seeing their definite defeat after third phase of polls, SP and BSP evolved a new idea that even if they lose the elections, no one should get majority in Uttar Pradesh so that they could have an opportunity of horse trading," Modi said while addressing an election rally in Mau.
 
 Terming the SP-Congress alliance a sinking ship, Modi asked people to punish Congress, SP and BSP for neglecting the state for years.
 
 "Our alliance partners will be made part of BJP government in UP when our party comes to power," he said.
 
 The Prime Minister also claimed that Nehru had set up a committee for eastern UP's development but the report kept lying for 50 years and we have started work on it.
 
 Modi said the wish of SP and BSP will not be fulfilled.
 
 "Do whatever you want to but don't play with the future of Uttar Pradesh to defeat BJP. It has already suffered a lot. It is not going to be a hung assembly. We are going to win this election with huge majority," Modi said.
 
 Modi said after the poll results on March 11 BJP would celebrate "Vijayi Holi" and then after forming the government in the first cabinet meet it would waive off the loans of the farmers.
