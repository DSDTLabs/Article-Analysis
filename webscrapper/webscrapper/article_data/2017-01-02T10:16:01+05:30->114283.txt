RAJKOT: As has been the norm in   this season, the match ball has been changed at least once in almost all matches. On Day 1 of the semi-final between   and Mumbai being played at the   ground, here, the ball had to be changed thrice.

 The first change happened in the first session and in the second session the ball was changed twice.
 
 Tamil Nadu bowling coach and former India seamer   wasn't too happy with the frequent change of ball "It affects the rhythm of a team. All balls are different from the other. Some are light some are heavy, some swing, some don't. Batsmen just don't have to adapt according to wickets and conditions, the ball is an important factor also," he added.
 
 Mumbai coach   too was not pleased. "Quality of balls has continued to be an issue in the Ranji Trophy. Not much has changed since the last season. A change in ball has a lot of repercussions on the batting and bowling sides' strategies and at times, a team might end up losing its grip on the match due to a sudden change in ball. This has to be taken seriously," the former India stumper said.
