A sessions court on Thursday granted bail to right-wing leader   in the January 1 Koregaon Bhima case, observing that there was no evidence to show that he committed any overt act that caused the violence.

 “Denying bail solely on the grounds of criminal antecedents would not be proper,” additional sessions judge S M Menjoge said in his order.
 
 “Ekbote may walk out of Yerawada jail on Friday,” his lawyer Amol Dange told TOI.
 
 On April 4, a special court had granted bail to Ekbote in the case under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act registered by a victim of the violence. Ekbote was arrested the same day by the Shikrapur   in another case registered for unlawful assembly, rioting, damage to public property and other offences and was produced before the trial court in Shirur. He was later sent to judicial custody in Yerawada jail.
 
 The prosecution said a pamphlet released by Ekbote on December 27, 2017, eventually caused the violence in Koregaon Bhima.
 
 Judge Menjoge ruled out the “divisive” pamphlet argument by referring to statements recorded by the journalists that they never circulated the pamphlet due to the “tense atmosphere” at Vadhu Budruk. “This prima facie shows that the said pamphlet was not circulated in the village, though it was given by accused (Ekbote). Admittedly, applicant-accused was not present on the spot on January 1,” the court said.
 
 The court also dismissed the prosecution’s argument that Ekbote was in touch with others on phone and observed that call data record cannot be proof of actual conversation.
