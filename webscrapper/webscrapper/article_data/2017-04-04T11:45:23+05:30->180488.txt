PUNE: Kids below the age of 10 years and adults in the productive age bracket of 31-50 years have emerged as most vulnerable to   in the city, a latest report of the   ( ) has revealed.

 As many as 163 people have tested positive for   in the city this year, so far. Of these, 26 have succumbed to the contagion till date. Currently, 24 patients are critically ill and have been put on ventilator.
 
 “A total of 29 children below the age of 10 years have been diagnosed with swine flu this year, so far. Among them, three have succumbed to the virus. A two-and-a -half-year-old girl, who has tested positive for the infection, is currently undergoing intensive treatment at KEM hospital,” a civic health official told TOI. 
 
 So, what makes these children so vulnerable to the swine flu virus? When asked, senior paediatrician Jayant Navarange said, “Children mainly below five years of age are not exposed to H1N1 or any other influenza virus. This is the reason that their natural immunity is yet to be developed. Also, children in the 5-10 years age group have close contact with other kids in their schools, increasing their chances of catching the infection.”
 
 Adults in the age group of 31- 50 years fall in the vulnerable zone since they comprise the working class and are most mobile. “We need to find out how many of them have underlying medical conditions like diabetes, hypertension and obesity that makes them more at risk of contracting the infection,” said an office-bearer of the Indian Medical Association.
