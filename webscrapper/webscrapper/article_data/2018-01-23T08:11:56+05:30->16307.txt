It was a Sunday ride challenge for bikers – but the task was not to drive fast, but stay within the speed limit. It was a rally conducted by several biker groups and superbike community RPM (roaring power machines) in collaboration with the Delhi Police, and was aimed at sensitizing people about road safety. As the rally, which was titled Turtle Ride, started from the Gurgaon toll, the bikers had only one thing on their mind – to drive slow.

 A biker said, "There’s a huge community of bikers in Delhi, Noida and Gurgaon – there are professional bikers as well as those who create nuisance on the roads. People don't understand that roads of Delhi are not meant for speeding. I know many who bought a bike just for the thrill of speed. This rally is to spread the message loud and clear that a bike is not a licence to break rules."

 Atul Singh, the lead rider of RPM-India, said, "We want to spread awareness about road safety and speeding. We got the idea of a turtle ride from the tortoise and rabbit story – it’s basically about the slow and steady winning the race of life on the road. We usually get together for bike rides on Sunday mornings, but this ride was to promote road safety and to give the message that just because you have a bike doesn’t mean you should do stunts on the road or disrespect the law."
