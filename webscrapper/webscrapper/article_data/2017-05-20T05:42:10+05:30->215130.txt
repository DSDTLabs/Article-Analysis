LUCKNOW: More than 48 hours after the   was found on the road at   police were yet to record the statements of IAS, IPS and IRS officers who were with Tewari the night before. 

 CCTV footage of a Hazratganj restaurant where Anurag had dinner with a batchmate and LDA vice-chairman PN Singh on Tuesday shows that they left the restaurant at 10pm after 40 minutes. 
 
  Singh was staying in the same room as Anurag. Though he told police that when he woke up around 6.30am, Anurag was not in the room, an official statement has not been taken. 
 
 SSP Deepak Kumar said that by Sunday night, investigation will be concluded. Meanwhile,   said that they want an independent agency to take over the case. “We cannot expect to get justice from UP Police and forensic laboratory. They have meddled a lot of cases. They seem predetermined to prove Anurag’s death as a natural one despite the postmortem report saying he died of asphyxiation. We are pressing for a thorough probe by CBI,” said Mayank, Tewari’s brother. 
 
 No one has come forward to help the police in the case, increasing the difficulty of the SIT. Statements of eight people have been recorded so far. These include four staffers at the VIP guest house on Meerabai Marg and four vendors. However, none among them saw Anurag on the fateful day.
