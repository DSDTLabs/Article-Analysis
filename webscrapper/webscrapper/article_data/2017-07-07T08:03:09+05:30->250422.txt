CHENNAI: A Metrowater tanker ran over a 22-year-old IT employee near   on Thursday evening. The deceased was identified as Anirudh Amarnath of Nanganallur.

 The accident took place when he was returning home from work. Anirudh was riding pillion on the bike with his friend Raghavendra when they met with the accident near Alphonsa ground in Mandaveli.
 
 The accident took place when Raghavendra was passing through the South Canal Bank Road and attempted to overtake the Metrowater tanker.
 
 In the impact, he lost balance and Anirudh slipped and fell on the road. The tanker driver was unable to halt his vehicle and ran over Anirudh, killing him on the spot.
 
 "The rider of the bike survived without any injuries. The bike was also not damaged as the rider did not fall," said an investigating officer. A few passersby who witnessed the accident alerted the police. They moved Anirudh to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital where he was declared brought dead. His body was sent for autopsy.
 
 Adyar Traffic Investigation wing registered a case against the driver under section 304(A) IPC (causing death by negligence). The driver, Mathiyalagan, 35, of Thirukkovilur in Villupuram district has been arrested. Further interrogations are on.
 
 It may be recalled that three girl students studying at Chellammal College, Guindy, had lost their lives last year after a tanker lorry mowed them to death while they were walking on the pavement. Subsequently, Metrowater conducted safety awareness programmes for lorry owners, drivers and cleaners. 
 
 Area engineers, the   city traffic police and motor vehicle inspectors met water tanker union members at all 15 Metrowater zonal offices to conduct awareness programmes on road safety and proper documentation. Officials also met tanker owners to discuss steps to be taken to ensure accountability by them and drivers.
