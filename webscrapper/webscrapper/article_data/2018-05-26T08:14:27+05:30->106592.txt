KOLKATA: Some prominent professionals are set to join Sikkim’s new political outfit, Hamro Sikkim Party, during its launch in West Sikkim on May 31.

 “I am not going to name them right now. But there will be men from the ruling Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF) and the opposition  . Our main thrust is on youth,” said party chief patron  , the former India football captain. The party will take on the ruling SDF in the 2019 assembly polls.
 
 The purpose is to float Sikkim’s own (Hamro means ours) party that can take on the ruling SDF led by CM  . “We are here to regain our motherland steeped in corruption and unemployment. Sikkim ranks second in the country’s unemployment list, a gift of the Chamling government,”   said.
 
 According to Bhaichung, his party will work in tandem with those whom the people of Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong in   elect as their representatives.
