Vadodara: A Madhya Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (MPSRTC) bus which was on its way to Vadodara was attacked by locals at Chisadiya village in Chhota Udepur on Thursday morning. The mob also beat up the driver and conductor of the bus after breaking the windshield of the bus.

 Police have registered a complaint of robbery against four unidentified persons following the incident at Rangpur police station.
 
 According to sources, the bus going to Vadodara from Manawar in Dhar district in Madhya Pradesh was stopped by villagers at Chisadiya village. Seeing the mob with weapons and sticks in their hands, the passengers of the bus got out and fled. The villagers then broke the windshield of the bus and dragged the driver Rakesh Sitaram and conductor Shantilal out of the bus and beat them up. Police said that they also robbed the duo of their luggage.
 
 Sources said that the mob was angered by a road accident which took place near the village on January 16. An MPSRTC bus had mowed down two motorcyclists of the village – Bhikha Rathwa (22) and Suresh Rathwa (26) – killing them on the spot. Following the incident, villagers had pelted stones on the bus.
 
 Buses coming from MP were then asked to take another route to avoid any untoward incident, but on Thursday when the bus from Manawar was passing by Chisadiya, villagers targeted it.
 
 Sitaram and Shantilal were taken to Chhota Udepur general hospital for treatment.
