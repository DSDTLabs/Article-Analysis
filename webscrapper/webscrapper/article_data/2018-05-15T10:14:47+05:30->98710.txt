BATHINDA: Even as the Union road transport and highways minister Nitin   cancelled his scheduled visit to   on late Sunday night, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) went ahead with the thanks giving rallies on Monday in his honour in his absence.

 Gadkari was to inaugurate the Bathinda-Zirakpur and Bathinda-Amritsar national highways on Monday at Bathinda in the company of Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh and MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal.
 
 The Union minister had to cancel his visit on late Sunday night due to unexpected inclement weather and the   government cancelled the inauguration and a rally.
 
 Meanwhile, going ahead with their plan, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal and Union food processing industry minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal addressed rallies at Bathinda and in Bhikhi town of Mansa. They praised Gadkari for approving several national highway projects for Punjab.
 
 Both claimed that the highway projects had been provided to Punjab with the persistent efforts of the previous SAD-BJP government. Sukhbir said, “The Congress government only wanted to take credit for the projects but even ran away from it by cancelling the public meeting in honour of the Union minister who has been very generous and kind to Punjab.”
