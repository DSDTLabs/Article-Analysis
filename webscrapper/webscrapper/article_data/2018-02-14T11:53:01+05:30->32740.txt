NEW DELHI: India’s   and   have broken the record for most wickets by an overseas spinner in a bilateral ODI series in South Africa, surpassing former West Indies allrounder Keith Arthurton’s mark of 12 wickets taken across seven ODIs during the 1998-99 season. 

 
 During the fifth ODI at Port Elizabeth on Tuesday which India won by 73 runs to secure their first ODI series win in South Africa Chahal was the first to break Arthurton's mark, when he claimed his 13th wicket in the form of David Miller. Not long after, Kuldeep surpassed him witha haul of 4 for 57 to lead the race with 16 wickets in the series so far. 
 
 
 
 
 Chahal, 27, has enjoyed a stunning run of success during the ongoing six-match series against South Africa. He started off with 2/45, then grabbed a career-best 5/22, followed by 4/46 as India went up 3-0. During the fifth ODI, he removed David Miller lbw to take his 13th wicket of the series. In tandem with Kuldeep, he has repeatedly flummoxed South Africa’s batsmen. Kuldeep overtook Chahal with Tuesday's four-wicket haul. 
 
 
 
 Arthurton, an offspinner and middle-order batsman, took 12 wickets in a seven-ODI series which West Indies lost 1-6. Next best is Shane Warne, who took 11 wickets in Australia’s eight-game series against South Africa in 1993-94, and then 10 in six matches in 1996-97. 
 
 Before Chahal and Kuldeep during the ongoing series, which Virat Kohli’s wrapped up with a game to spare on Tuesday, the best series returns by an Indian spinner in South Africa were Anil Kumble’s five wickets in seven ODIs back in 1992-93. 
 
 For any kind of bowler in a bilateral ODI series against South Africa at home, pacer or spinner, the record is shared between England’s Kabir Ali, who took 13 wickets in seven ODIs in 2004-05, and Australian Mitchell Johnson who took 13 in five matches in 2008-09. Jason Gillespie claimed 12 in six matches in 2001-02 and England fast bowler Darren Gough managed 11 on three occasions - in 1995-96, 1999-00 and 2004-05.
