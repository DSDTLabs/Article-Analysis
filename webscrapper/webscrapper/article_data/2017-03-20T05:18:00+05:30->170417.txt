LUCKNOW/NEW DELHI: Adityanath’s swearing-in ceremony in Lucknow led to a mad scramble of seats on all commercial flights to Lucknow on Sunday. To ensure that no one was left out, state-owned Air India deployed its biggest aircraft, the 423-seater   747, on this route. But it went with little less than half its seats full. Former Congressman N D   was the closest to a VIP on that flight. Air India normally uses its 160-seater   A-320 to Lucknow every morning. A senior AI official told  , “We had a huge demand for tickets to Lucknow on Sunday. It was decided not to say no to any fare-paying passenger who wanted to fly to Lucknow as our 7.10 am flight on the A-320 was full. We then opted to use a bigger plane.” With no B-777 available at such a short notice, the   operated the less-used Jumbo Jet to Lucknow at 9 am with 200 people on board.
