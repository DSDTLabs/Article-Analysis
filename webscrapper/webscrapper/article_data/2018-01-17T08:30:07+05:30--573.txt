CHANDIGARH: Former   chief minister   on Tuesday took on chief minister   and the BJP government while saying that the increased incidents of crime, especially the recent rapes and murders, had made the state number one in crime.

 Saying this, Hooda announced that a   team would submit a memorandum to the Haryana governor on Wednesday. The president of the women wing of the Congress will also accompany it.
 
 “These incidents show that the police and official machinery are totally non-existent or working as supporting staff for event management of the BJP. Instead of misusing power in framing youths in false cases, the CM should allow cops to do real policing,” said Hooda. He further said, “It really pains us when people ask us about the crime rate in Haryana instead of reckoning us in our achievements in health, education and sports.”
 
 Intensifying the attack on the Khattar government, he elaborated on how farmers were being forced to pay 18% GST on farm implements. “Haryana never charged for sprinkler and drip irrigation system. Now, this government has forced the farmers to pay 18% GST on these. Similarly, the government has increased the tax from 5% to 18% on certain other implements. Sugarcane producers are forced to sell their produce in Uttar Pradesh at much lower rates as they don’t get payment for their crop on time,” the former CM said.
 
 Hooda announces ‘rath yatra’
 
 Hooda also announced to start ‘rath yatra’ from   in Faridabad in the last week of February. “For the past three years, we have been giving wake-up calls to the state government. Through our yatra we will give the call ‘weed out BJP from the state’ to our voters in Haryana,” he said.
