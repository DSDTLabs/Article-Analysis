MUMBAI: Sion police are looking out for a youth who barged into a housing society in Sion Koliwada and forcibly kissed a 50-year-old woman and bit a chunk off her lip. 

 On Tuesday, when the woman went for a walk in the afternoon, the man, smeared with Holi colours, entered the building and forced himself on her. The woman is being treated at a private hospital.
 
 In her complaint she said that she got hold of him, but the suspect, who was drunk, slipped away. “We have registered an offence against an unknown person. Based on CCTV footage our team is working to arrest him,“ said DCP (Zone 4) N Ambika.
