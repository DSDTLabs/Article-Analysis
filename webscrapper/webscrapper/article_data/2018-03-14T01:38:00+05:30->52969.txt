Amaravati: The   assembly adopted a resolution on Tuesday, seeking   (SCS) to the state as promised by former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh at the time of bifurcation. 

 After a gap of two years, this was the third resolution adopted by the state assembly in the last four years for the SCS and other benefits. Earlier in 2014 and 2015 the assembly had passed similar resolutions.
 
 Chief miister N  , speaking in the Assembly on implementation of the AP Reorganisation Act 2014, moved the resolution,asking the Centre to grant the SCS without further delay. The resolution also strongly condemned the inordinate delay and neglect in granting the SCS to the state even after four years.
 
 The chief minister, in the resolution preceded by his two-hour long speech, reiterated that a lot of injustice was done to the state at the time of bifurcation. Terming the bifurcation as unscientific and unjust, he said that people have punished the Congress, which was responsible for the bifurcation. He cautioned the BJP, which was also a party in the bifurcation, that it would also face the same fate if it neglects or denies the promises.
 
 Chandrababu Naidu listed out the promises made to the state and the support mentioned in the Reorganisation Act.
