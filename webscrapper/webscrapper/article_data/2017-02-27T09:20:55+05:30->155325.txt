BHUBANESWAR: The  , probing the Rs 1000-crore Green   Limited (GRIL) chit fund scam, on Sunday said the firm was running a pharmaceutical business illegally. The central investigating agency has sought some documents from the state health department to find out the credentials of the firm. 

 It is pertinent to note that senior   leader and former health minister Prasanna Acharya had inaugurated the   unit in Balasore in 2011. The CBI said though the firm had earlier obtained a licence from the directorate of drugs controller, it did not renew the same after some years.
 
 "We have come to know that the company CMD Mir Sahiruddin did not possess valid documents to operate the pharmaceutical unit in which he invested around Rs 80 crore. We also suspect he was engaged in manufacturing of spurious drugs, mostly sedatives," a CBI official told TOI. The probe agency kept mum on whether the directorate of drugs controller took any action against Green Ray. The drugs controller officers too could not recollect any punitive action taken against the company. 
 
 "The CBI has seized documents related to Green Ray's financial dealings with some pharma companies in Maharashtra, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh. We are examining the credentials of those companies as well," the official said.
