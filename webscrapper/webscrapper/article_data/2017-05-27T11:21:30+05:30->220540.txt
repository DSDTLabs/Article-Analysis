 said she is flattered when others like   copy her sense of style. The 'Simple Life' star was thrilled when she saw Kendall in a similar outfit to what she wore to her 21st birthday and said she loved being the style inspiration for others.

  
  
 "It makes me feel happy when I see somebody wearing something I'd already worn before. I was actually at her birthday and when she walked in, I immediately was like, 'OMG that dress. That's my 21st birthday dress!' 
 
 "And I was like, 'Where did you get that,' and she said, 'I saw the pictures of your birthday dress and I told this designer to make it because I thought it was amazing.' It's the perfect 21st birthday dress. She looked like a sparkling diamond. I loved that dress on her, and it brought back such good memories from my amazing 21st birthday," Hilton said.
