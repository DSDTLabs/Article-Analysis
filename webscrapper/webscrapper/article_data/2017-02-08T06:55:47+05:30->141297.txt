GANDHINAGAR: After the   (AAP) cornered the state   over the Kutch sex scandal in which half-a-dozen BJP leaders are allegedly involved,   on Tuesday demanded   of the police investigation, alleging that the BJP is trying to scuttle the probe.

 Shaktisinh Gohil, all-India Congress spokesperson and MLA from Kutch, said that an investigation directly monitored by the judiciary is needed to provide justice and safety to the young girls who fell victim allegedly to the BJP's sex racket.
 
 “For long, the BJP refused to act against its leaders who had been blackmailing women and allegedly using them to please their political bosses. After pressure built up, BJP was forced to expel these leaders,“ Gohil said.
 
 The Congress leader further alleged that the police are still trying to cover up the scandal as there is a possibility of the involvement of top BJP leaders.
 
 “All these women must get justice. All 65 BJP leaders named by the victim and others involved in the crime must be punished,“ Gohil said.
