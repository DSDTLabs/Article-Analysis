CHENNAI: Eight years after a teenager died in a fall from a  , a   directed the transport utility to pay a compensation of Rs 14.12 lakh to the victim’s family.

 M Sakthivel, then 19, was a house painter. On July 17, 2010 around 7.45pm, he and his friends had boarded M11 at Keelkattalai to return home in Medavakkam, said the petition filed by his family members seeking a compensation of Rs 20 lakh. At a bus stop on the  , the driver, without noticing that passengers were struggling to get inside the vehicle, closed the automatic door causing Sakthivel to fall down from the bus. The rear wheels of the vehicle ran over him killing the teen on the spot, the petition said.
 
 The MTC, in its counter petition, contended that the victim was responsible for the accident and the corporation was not liable to pay compensation. However,   K Ayyappan observed that there was no evidence to prove that the   vehicle was in normal speed and that the driver was not responsible except for his testimony. “Since the bus is owned by the MTC, it is liable to pay compensation,” the order said adding that the loss of a 19-year-old son cannot be compensated by money. The court arrived at the compensation amount by calculating the loss of love and affection, and loss of dependency to the family. Sakthivel was earning Rs 8,000 per month at the time of his death.
 
 The judge accepted the family’s contention that the death was caused by negligent handling of the automatic door by the driver. He ruled that the victim’s family be paid Rs 14.12 lakh by the MTC with interest of 7.5% per annum. The judge ruled that the family was entitled to withdraw 50% of the amount soon after the deposit and the balance 50% shall be deposited in a nationalised bank in the city for a period of three years.
