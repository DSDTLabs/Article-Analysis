NASHIK: Unseasonal rain in Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha and other pockets of Maharashtra wrapped Nashik in a cloud cover and brought down the Friday morning temperature to a winter-like 12 degrees celsius. 

 The minimum temperature was a sharp 3-notch below normal, while the maximum temperature was also down to 30 degrees celsius. 
 
 “It was a cloudy day and unusually cool in the morning. Nashik city and its surrounding areas, however, did not receive any rain,” said R B Mankar, a senior official in the India Meteorolgical Department’s (IMD)   observatory here. 
 
 The wind speed was also a big factor leading to the cooler-than-usual early morning and evening. The highest wind speed on Friday was 29 km/hr as compared to 14 km/hr on March 7. “The two-fold increase in the wind speed made the day cooler,” Mankar said. 
 
 The IMD has forecast similar weather condition for the city on Sunday as well. “The highest temperature will be around 30 degrees celsius and the lowest will be around 13 degree celsius. The weather will be cool and the sky will be cloudy,” said Mankar. 
 
 Private weather forecaster   stated that the western disturbance is affecting the hills of  , creating an induced cyclonic circulation. Apart from snowfall in Himachal Pradesh, rain was reported from New Delhi and Jaipur witnessed hails. 
 
 The combined effect of the weather features is triggering rain in some regions. ‘As an after-effect of the weather condition in Northern region, the temperature in central and northern Maharashtra is also expected to witness a dip. Residents in these areas will feel the cool condition for at least some time,” stated a notification on the website. 
 
 The weather condition will prevail for the next 24 hours, after which the summer heat will make a comeback.
