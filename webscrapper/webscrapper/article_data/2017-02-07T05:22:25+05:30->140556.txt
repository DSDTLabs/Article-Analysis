MUMBAI: When winning margins are slender, it is all the more important that people who complain come out and exercise your franchise.

 The Examiner, a weekly magazine popular among the   , has taken the lead in urging the 2.5 lakh voters of the community to vote on February 21. 
 
 The article points out that if the community were to be a persuasive force and get neighbours, professional contacts to come out and vote, it could be a decisive force in 25 constituencies in Bandra, Santacruz, Khar, Mahim, Orlem and Borivli. Father  , editor of The Examiner, said the BMC is the richest in the country . “In 2012, several corporators won with wafer-thin majorities of 21votes, 58, 82 and 128 votes. A single lane or building or colony can tilt the scales. Coalitions to cobble a majority are the order of the day . It is the responsibility of every citizen to ensure that the funds are proper ly utilized and so they must come out and vote,“ he said.
 
 The magazine will carry another article next week by Gerson D'Cunha, convenor, Action for Good Governance and Networking in India (AGNI) on the need for people to come out and vote. “Gerson recently addressed church deans and we whole-heartedly support AGNI's campaign that citizens vote and choose who they think is the best candidate. Our magazine has a huge following online as well as in colleges and legal libraries and we decided to support AGNI in encouraging people to vote,“ he said.
 
 The article further urges citizens to be part of AGNI's school campaign. “AGNI is pushing formation of clusters of voters. These will use as a nucleus a society or a parish, therefore citizens who think alike, could want the same improvements and are likely to vote the same way for good candidates,“ states the article.
