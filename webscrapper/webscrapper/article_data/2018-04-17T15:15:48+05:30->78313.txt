Actor   said his day is planned according to his son  , who will turn 2 in two months.

  
  
 "My child is my focus and I plan my day according to his timetable," Tusshar said. "I am 41 now. At around 35, 37 I started getting paternal instincts for my pets. I also began to wonder then how would it feel like to hold your child?" he said.
 
 Tusshar said he was expecting a lot of different reactions when he took the decision of having a child through IVF and surrogacy. "I wanted to be a father and I wanted to start a family, so I did it. People then messaged me that I am inspiring them," he said.
 
 Tusshar said he is a 'hands-on parent'. "I spend most of the day with my child and I don't want to miss out on any experience with my child. For   shooting, I took him along with me since I didn't want to stay away from him for long. He had fun on the sets," he said.
 
 He said he has learnt parenting skills along the way. "I feel it is not hard work, but rather just a lot of work that goes into raising a child. At the same time, I also read about healthy habits and the happy child book, which was really helpful." 
 
 The 41-year-old actor said all parents have the same worries. "No matter you are a celebrity or not, it just depends on how involved you are," he added.
 
 On celebrity parents, he said, "In the industry,   spends a majority of his time with his kids."
