KOCHI:   rural police will now have women special branch officers who will help the department in collecting secret information. Ernakulam rural SP A V   has decided to appoint three women police officers to work with the branch.

 “I feel that women will be able to bring in more information in connection with various incidents. The three officers we are appointing have driving skills and are trained in self-defence. If the experiment proves fruitful, we will think of appointing more   into the special branch department,” said the rural SP.
 
 The district police chief had interviewed several women police officers who had expressed interest in working with the special branch.
 
 Special branch officers have to alert superior officers about all incidents happening in the police station limits allotted to them through secret information collection.
 
 The special branch of   police has two divisions, namely, intelligence and security.
 
 The security division is responsible for the protection of VIPs. It monitors and coordinates the security arrangements with the district police units when VIPs visit this state.
