NEW DELHI: Thirteen staffers, including three nurses, of   were booked on Wednesday under criminal conspiracy charges for failing to inform the police about former armyman Naresh Dhankar’s attack. 

 Dhankar went on a bludgeoning spree on Tuesday, killing six people, including a patient’s attendant at the private hospital. The other murders, however, took place a few metres away from a police station. 
 
 The FIR was registered on the basis of a complaint by the family members of Anjum, who was Dhankar’s first victim. 
 
 Anjum’s family members have alleged that if the hospital authorities had acted promptly, the other people could have been saved. They have also claimed that Anjum died due to lack of treatment as no doctor was present at the hospital.
 
 Anjum’s brother-in-law, Shaukat Ali, said his brother Mohammad Tasleem had tried to call the police but couldn’t contact the control room. 
 
 After hearing Anjum’s call for help, Tasleem rushed upstairs, said sources. Dhankar was then hiding in a bathroom near the ICU. When he stepped out, Tasleem tried to stop the accused but nobody from the hospital came forward to help him.
