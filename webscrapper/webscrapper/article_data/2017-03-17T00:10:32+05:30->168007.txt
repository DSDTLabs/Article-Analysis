Pune: Earth moving and construction equipment maker, JCB India said it’s 2016 revenue and volumes grew 40% over 2015, as the government stepped up spending on roads and highways.

 The company sold about 26,500 machines in 2016, a level it last attained in 2011, when it sold 27,000 such machines.
 
 The Union government emphasized on infrastructure funding in two successive budgets and it’s effect seems to be trickling down to companies like JCB.
 
 Initially, the government had earmarked Rs 57,976 crore for construction and maintenance of roads and highways in the 2016-17 fiscal, up 24% over the actual spend in the previous financial year. This was revised down to Rs 52,447 crore. For the next fiscal, the government has set aside Rs 64,900 crore for construction of roads and highways.
 
 “Our India revenues in 2016 grew almost 40% to about Rs 8,000 crore over 2015. Exports contributed to around 20%,” managing director and CEO of JCB India, Vipin Sondhi, said.
 
 Sondhi said estimates indicate infrastructure growth will be 10-11% in the current quarter. “This is a bit of a concern. Given the scope of the infrastructure sector in the country, it should have grown more,” he said.
 
 Much of the growth for JCB India seems to be coming from only the roads and highways sectors. Sondhi said not much of infrastructure growth is happening on ground in real estate, railways, urban rejunuvation and irrigation.
 
 “Policies are there, but execution is very important,” he said.
 
 Infrastructure companies continue to account for a bulk of the non-performing assets of the banking system. So the growth in road construction activity has also not translated into companies repaying their instalments to banks in time.
 
 About a fifth of all infrastructure loans are stressed and this sector accounts for over a third of the total bank credit to the industry, as per RBI data.
 
 JCB India is now re-aligning its marketing and outreach efforts to brand itself as a “road solutions” company to take advantage of the growth in the sector. 
 
 The company will also add 50 new outlets by the end of 2017 to the existing 650 outlets it has across the country.
 
 JCB has five plants in India — one in Ballabgarh, two in Pune and two in Jaipur — where it has invested Rs 2,000 crore and employs about 5,000 people. Four of theses plants, Sondhi said, are currently operating at about 85% of their respective capacities. The Jaipur plant has just gone on-steam.
