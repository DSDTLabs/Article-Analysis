GURUGRAM: A 35-year-old man was robbed of his   at gunpoint by three men near Dwarka expressway on Thursday.

 According to the complainant, Sanjay Tyagi, he had gone there for some personal work and the crime took place around 3pm when he was returning home to Mohammad Heri village, near Daultabad. 
 
 Tyagi claimed that as he took the Sector 103 road, near the expressway to reach his home, three men riding a white scooter blocked his way. As he halted and rolled down the window to question the riders, two of them forcibly entered his car, pushed him from the driver’s seat and started driving the car after holding him hostage at gunpoint. Sanjay alleged that the third accused was following them on his scooter. 
 
 Fearing for his life, Sanjay didn’t raise an alarm. Apparently after driving for a kilometre, the accused took a wrong turn and the car wheels got trapped in a ditch. A few locals of a neighbouring village gathered there and enquired if they need some help. Sanjay didn’t speak a word as he thought that a minor hint from his side would lead to the accused killing him. The accused told the villagers that they cops from the crime branch and were taking Sanjay for investigation into a case. After driving for another 500 metres, the accused stopped the car and asked Sanjay to get down. They then fled with the car. 
 
 Inspector Ajaybir of the Rajender Park police station said that an FIR has been registered under sections 392 ( ), 34 (common intent) of the IPC and Section 25 of the Arms Act. “We are trying to identify the robbers and will soon arrest them,” he said.
