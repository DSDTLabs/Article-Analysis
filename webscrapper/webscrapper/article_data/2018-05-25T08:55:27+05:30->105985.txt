CHANDIGARH: Facing acute shortage of land, Chandigarh administration has increased floor area ratio (FAR) for the employees’ housing scheme, 2008. The idea is to enable   (CHB) to construct more flats on the allocated land.

 The development is significant as the board has not been able to implement the scheme due to non-availability of required land. FAR refers to limits imposed on constructed area of buildings. The FAR, which is the ratio of total floor area of a building to the area of land it is built upon, has been increased from 1.50 to 2. 
 
 On FAR 1.55, a total of 55 flats can be constructed on one acre of land. With the administration increasing the FAR, CHB will now be able to construct 75 flats, 20 more on one acre of land. The administration took the decision to increase the FAR on the request of the board.
 
 Confirming the development, CHB secretary Virat said the administration has increased the FAR on their request and they will now be able to construct more flats. “Chandigarh is a land-locked city and the decision comes as a major relief to the board and employees,” said Virat.
 
 Dharamender Shastri, general secretary of the society, lauded the decision of the administration to enhance the FAR. “They will now be able to construct more flats on the same chunk of land allotted for the housing scheme,” said Shastri.
 
 The administration had proposed to allot land measuring 61.5 acres to CHB for construction of flats for employees under a self-financing scheme. Nearly 7,000 employees working in different departments of the administration applied for houses under the scheme and 3,930 were allotted flats after a draw of lots in November, 2010. CHB allotted land for the project in Sector 53. The board collected 25% of the price, which amounted to Rs 57 crore. But in 2012, the administration expressed its inability to allot land, since the terms of land acquisition had changed.
