Surat: Contractors of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) empanelled for construction of cement concrete (CC) roads have resorted to arm-twisting. They are demanding higher rates than those quoted and approved in contract. In Varachha zone, SMC has asked contractors to work on old approved rates or they would be issued notices. 

 “There was an issue from July 1 after Goods and Service Tax (GST) came in force. However, we had brought about a solution and wherever in terms of tenders it was not mentioned, we decided to pay the difference. After that any other demand is not justified,” SMC municipal commissioner M Thennarasan said. At present, a ring of contractors have demanded price hike on approved rates claiming increase in the rate of cement and other material. Although they have not stopped the work, but have continued to demand higher rates than approved, sighting number of other reasons too.
 
 An official in Varachha zone on condition of anonymity said, “Things are a little different in Varachha zone. Here, starting from local councillors to everyone has some motive or the other. In such situations may be a few of the contractors are finding it difficult to complete work in stipulated time.”
 
 In a year, SMC with its 3,200 km road network adds nearly 100-125 km of new roads and spends Rs 250 on an average on yearly basis for roads repair and new road laying. 
 
 “Presently, contractors are working, but if SMC doesn’t heed to their demands, they may stop work altogether,” a source from SMC said.
