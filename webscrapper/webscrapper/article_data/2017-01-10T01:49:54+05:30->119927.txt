JAMMU: Terrorists killed three labourers when they attacked a   camp two kilometres from the Line of Control (LoC) in   sector in the early hours of Monday.

 The terrorists — believed to be three in number — may have sneaked in from the other side of the LoC, official sources said. They entered the camp in Battal in Khour Jourian around 2am, opened fire and fled in the darkness. “Search operations are on,”   IG Danish Rana said. 
 
 An alert has been sounded in   camps in Khour, Jourian and Akhnoor.
 
 The last major terror attack in Akhnoor was in 2003 when a brigadier and seven jawans were killed in an Army camp.
