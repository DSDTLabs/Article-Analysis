CHENNAI: The   is typical of the city’s suburbs. Expanding and attracting a growing number of women and men who work late, but often lacking in amenities and security — so lax, in fact, that a man can appear out of nowhere in the dark, attack and rob a woman riding a scooter, and vanish into thin air.

 P  , who had left her office in   around 2am on Tuesday, was assaulted on a poorly-lit stretch near   twenty minutes into her journey towards Sithalapakkam, with only a rock spattered with blood stains bearing mute testimony to the attack. 
 
 Even during the day, the stretch fills passersby with a sense of insecurity. The road is dotted with newly built apartment complexes and several under-construction buildings separated by stretches of vacant land between them.
 
 Moreover, street lights are few and far between here. “Even if the victim had raised an alarm, it would have been difficult for me to rush to her help, as we can only see darkness around,” said  , who guards an apartment complex located 500m from the scene of the crime.
 
 People in the locality say few patrol vehicles ply along the stretch. “Only after the incident did we see policemen passing through the area and a woman constable standing there for a while,” says  , who runs a grocery shop on the road. “It is unsafe for any woman to cross the stretch during odd hours. I don’t see many women passing by,” she said. 
 
 Even tea shops, which are usually open late into the night, down their shutters early here. “We do not want to take any chance, with many strangers frequenting the area, especially at the buildings under construction,” says  , who runs a tea stall 200 metres from the area. Right opposite the spot of the attack is one such building, which turns into a den for anti-social elements at night, say locals. 
 
 “We try to ensure that no area is left untouched without patrolling. It is advisible for women to avoid taking this stretch late in the night,” said a senior police officer.
