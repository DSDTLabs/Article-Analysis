GURUGRAM: The district administration has instructed all banks in the city to complete the linking of   with all savings accounts by the end of February. As of now, 71% of   have been linked with Aadhaar and 88% bank accounts with mobile phones.

 The order has been issued by deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh as per the instructions of the Union government. Earlier this week, Singh had analysed the operative savings bank account scheme in the district and its linking with Aadhaar and also with mobile phones.
 
 Gurgaon has around 45 lakhs bank accounts. And it currently has the largest number of bank accounts linked with Aadhaar and mobile phones.
 
 Besides, efforts are being made to promote Jan Dhan scheme across the district. So far, only 88% Jan Dhan account holders have activated RuPay debit cards. Singh has issued instructions to activate cards for the remaining accounts too.
 
 “We want to encourage people to do more digital transactions. Most government and private establishments now have POS (point of sales) machines where people can swipe cards for payments. They can use mobile wallet and online banking too,” said the deputy commissioner.
 
 Bankers have also been asked to spread awareness about the insurance schemes by the government, especially in the rural areas. 
 
 Gurgaon has a large floating population. As a result, many people, especially the labourers, keep changing cities. So there are a number of many dormant bank accounts in Gurgaon. Besides, linking the operative accounts with Aadhar, the banks will also focus on KYC compliance of the dormant accounts and making them operative too.
