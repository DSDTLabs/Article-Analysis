MUMBAI: Attorney general   told Times Now on Wednesday that Punjab minister   cannot work as a government minister in the day and be on a part-time comedy show at night.

 Rohatgi said being a minister was a 24x7 job with no room for any other employment. He said the Salary and Alliances of Ministers Act of 1952 did not allow any minister to have any remuneration other than the emoluments paid by the government.
 
 “If that were so, then a judge could finish his work at 4pm and run a restaurant at night,” the attorney general said, saying what Sidhu was saying was untenable.
 
 In an exclusive interview to the news channel, Rohatgi also said the fact that Sidhu was the culture minister and wanted to work in a television show “aggravated” the issue, making it easier for chief minister   to take whatever action he deems fit.
 
 The Attorney General also said that there was a code of conduct applicable to ministers in the Centre and states, which disallowed any minister from taking any emoluments from any business.
 
 Amarinder told reporters on Wednesday that he is waiting for legal advice on whether Sidhu’s sticking to his TV shows “is constitutionally permissible”.
