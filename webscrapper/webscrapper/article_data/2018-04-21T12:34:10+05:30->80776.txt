COIMBATORE: The predicted  , if not mitigated, will affect the lower income population, the most, said experts. The localities that do not have sufficient infrastructure and adequate measures will suffer more as it will not just cause higher demand for water and other basic amenities but also impact the health of the citizens.

 Soumya Chaturvedula, regional manager of southern centre,  , said that temperature rise will cause huge heat stress. “The adaption capacity of the vulnerable population such as the poor and the animals will be very less. Their access to water, transport and health facilities will be a major concern,” she said.
 
  will also be worst affected as not all species can survive in higher temperatures. “Due to reduction in ground water and increase in diseases, plant species may not be able to adapt. Rainfall will also play a huge role as high intensity rains in short durations will completely damage the crops,” said experts.
 
 S Mohan from IIT-Madras, who conducted the study, said as the temperature rises, several existing microbes will die but new ones that can cope with higher temperatures will emerge. “A lot of interventions will be required to reduce the impacts of climate change. As the temperatures in the city increase by 3.3 degree Celsius by 2100, urban areas will be the most vulnerable due to the vehicular pollution and real estate development. A holistic development plan and a climate action plan is the need of the hour,” he said.
 
 Professor   of   said that worldwide awareness is required if climate risk mitigation measures need to be adopted.
 
 Rains will cause overflow of drainages and sewage lines, and dilution of waste water will impact the treatment process of waste water. Changes in the green cover of the city will completely change the micro climate of the place that will affect cattle, food and impact health of people. Industries dependent on water and energy will have to find ways to cope to these changes.
