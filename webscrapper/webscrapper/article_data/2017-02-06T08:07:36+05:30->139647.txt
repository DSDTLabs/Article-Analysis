LUCKNOW: With no breakthrough in the   death case yet, police are now relying on the set of four   reports for leads. 

 A chest specialist, Dr Sircar was found dead at the terrace of his house in Sector C,  , on February 2 (Thursday evening). Though, initially it appeared to be a case of suicide, the case took a turn after the post-mortem reports were out. As the two bullets, fired from different angels, were found in Sircar’s skull, police started probing the homicide theory.
 
 Additional superintendent of trans-Gomti, Durgesh Kumar said, “Gunshot injuries have left us confused. Though we have no evidence to prove that the doctor was murdered, things will be ascertained only after the forensic investigations.”
 
 A team of Mahanagar-based forensic experts is checking if it was possible for Sircar to shoot self twice or whether tandem bullet (more than one bullet fired simultaneously) led to the accident. Police are also awaiting the opinion of handwriting analysts, who will confirm whether the suicide note left behind at the scene was written by Sircar or had been planted. The other two reports relate to reconstruction of the crime scene and fingerprint examination.
