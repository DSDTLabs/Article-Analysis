AHMEDABAD: To facilitate and boost student exchange between India and France, the consul-general of France, Yves  , inaugurated ‘Future Tour’ – a multi-city initiative across multiple disciplines and universities – in Ahmedabad on Saturday. The tour event in Ahmedabad has been organized at Institute of Architecture, Nirma University, with a conference on Smart Cities – Urban Planning and Architecture Design.

 The conference was aimed at facilitating exchange between students and faculty members between Indian and French universities.
 
 Sharing his views, Perrin said, “Currently, some 5,000 Indian students come to France every year. The number is significantly less than the humongous number of tourists that visit our country. ‘Future Tour’, therefore, is focusing on strengthening partnership through education, research and training in various arenas.”
 
 “We are also looking at facilitating Indian entrepreneurs to bring their startups across all the sectors to France, where we can provide excellent incubation programmes. Paris alone is home to some 12,000 startups,” he added.
 
 Experts present at the conference discussed issues pertaining to urban planning such as multi-modal mobility, heritage and architecture and sustainable planning, among others. Dr Sandrine Maximilien, Scientific and Academic Attache –  , who was present at the conference, said, “As part of Future Tour, we’ve focussed on seven Indian states for exploring Indo-French cooperation in areas such as aeronautics, information technology and mathematics, among others. This will further define recommendations for upcoming Indo-French collaborations when French president,   will be visiting India for Indo-French Knowledge Summit.”
