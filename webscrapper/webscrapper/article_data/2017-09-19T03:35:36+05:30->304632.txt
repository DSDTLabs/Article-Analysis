NEW DELHI: Two   of jailed “spiritual leader”   were   while   at   in outer Delhi’s Mundka area. Police said a few others were injured when they tried to pull the men out of the sewer tank. A case of causing death due to negligence has been registered.

 DCP (outer) Pankaj Singh said the incident occurred around 3pm when the devotees, Amarjeet (30) and Makhan Lal (27), climbed into the tank but started to choke on toxic gas. Another devotee keeping a watch on them told police the youths stopped responding when he called out to them. He decided to descend into the sewer linked to the septic tank to check but soon climbed out gasping for air and fell unconscious. The police and the fire department were informed.
 
 A disaster management team and additional Delhi Fire Service personnel rushed to the spot. The two cleaners were pulled into the open by fire service personnel by 5pm. However, they died by the time they reached hospital.
 
 Makhan, a resident of Nepal, worked as a cleaner at the ashram for 15 years. Other devotees told the police he and his sons stayed at the ashram voluntarily and helped with security. Amarjeet lived in a nearby village. Police said the manager was being questioned about why the men were not provided any safety equipment to enter the manhole to clear the plastic blocking the drain. Legal action is also likely to be taken against a mall.
 
 Police said the two men were, in all probability, exposed to toxic gases and asphyxiated. Makhan had entered the drain first and did not respond when his father called out to him a few minutes later. The manager then instructed Amarjeet to follow Makhan down the manhole. The bodies of Amarjeet and Makhan will be handed over to their families after an autopsy. 
 
 Police officers say the ashram is managed by devotees since the arrest of Rampal.
