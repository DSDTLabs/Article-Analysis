Chennai/Madurai: The death toll in the Kurangani forest fire has gone up to 22 with the death of M Sivasankari, 26, at the Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai on Tuesday. Twenty-two days after the tragedy, neither the Theni nor the Chennai police have traced the whereabouts of Peter Van Geit, founder of the Chennai Trekking Club (CTC).

 “Initially, a police team from Theni visited Neelankarai in Chennai to nab the suspect. Neighbours told them that Peter vacated the residence a few months ago,” said an officer in the Chennai police, adding that their role ended there. “If the Theni police seek our help, we will try to trace Peter,” he said.
 
 Theni police personnel said they have initiated the process to issue a lookout circular (LoC) against Peter through the court.
 
 Meanwhile, Peter has moved the Madurai bench of the Madras high court to grant him anticipatory bail. He said in his petition that he is innocent.
 
 Principal secretary, revenue and disaster management department, Atulya Misra, who is investigating the forest fire, said he would visit Erode on Wednesday to interact with a group of trekkers who escaped from the fire.
 
 Misra said that after this interaction, he will prepare a report which will be submitted to the government. The report will recommend regulation of trekking clubs, identification of trekking routes and classification according to the location and other rules to be formulated for regularising trekking.
 
 While 10 people were declared dead the day after the fire incident, the injured who were hospitalised with various degrees of burns have been dying one after the other. Sources from the hospital said most of those who were admitted there have died. Two persons were shifted to hospitals in their native places, while one woman is still under treatment in a private hospital in Madurai. She was admitted with 30% burns and is recovering fast.
