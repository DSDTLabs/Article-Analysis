PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Chief minister   on Wednesday announced that the government has approved the development plan for Tathawade in Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation ( ) limits. 

 The approval has come three years after the general body of PCMC approved the draft DP and sent it to the state government for its consent in 2014. 
 
 When contacted, PCMC officials said they have received information through reliable sources that the publication of   notification for DP approval is expected in next few days. “The details of the DP will be known after the gazette notification is published,” they said. 
 
 Tathawade was merged in PCMC limits through a gazette notification in August 2009. The general body of PCMC approved a resolution on August 21, 2009, expressing its intent to prepare the draft DP. While a gazette notification was published in January 2010, the then deputy director of the town planning department was given the responsibility to prepare the draft DP in March 2011.
 
 The draft DP prepared by PCMC was published in March 2013. Thereafter, the civic body invited public suggestions and objections on it. A six member committee, comprising three members of standing committee and three government members, conducted the hearing on public views in August 2013.
 
 In January 2014, the draft DP was sent to the state government for approval, which contained a list of 48 reservations spread over a total area of 43.49 hectare. “This list comprised reservations for construction of playgrounds, gardens, a hospital, a vegetable market, a crematorium, a fire station, a sewage treatment plant, primary schools, parking areas and an elevated storage reservoir,” a   said.
