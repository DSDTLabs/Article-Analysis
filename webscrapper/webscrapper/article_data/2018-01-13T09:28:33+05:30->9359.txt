GUWAHATI: Chief minister   on Friday launched a programme to distribute free scootys to 1000 girl students who excelled in the Class XII state board exams. One of the budget promises of the BJP-led government had been that   would be handed over to meritorious girl students. 

 Sonowal handed over the allotment certificates and the keys to the two-wheelers at a function in the city in the presence of education minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. The CM expressed happiness that the day coincided with National Youth Day, the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.
 
 "Our government has been striving to sustain an academic atmosphere and make quality the only attribute to select beneficiaries into the fold of government programmes. We are committed to quality higher education and it through this that qualitative changes will be brought about in the state," said the CM.
 
 Education minister Sarma said the idea of giving free two-wheelers in recognition to meritorious girl students is a small gesture of the state's government's efforts to accelerate women empowerment. "Though the state government has decided to give free motorbikes to 1000 students this year, next year the number of beneficiaries will be increased to 5000," said Sarma.
 
 Students who opted not to take ownership of the vehicles were handed a sum of Rs 35,000.
