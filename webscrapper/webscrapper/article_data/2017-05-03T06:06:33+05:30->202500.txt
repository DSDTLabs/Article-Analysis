BENGALURU: As over one lakh engineering aspirants appeared for Day 1 of the   (CET) on Tuesday, the mood ranged from nervousness to relief. Many are happy that mathematics, which was easier than the previous years’ papers , didn’t ruin the day.

 Janasri Raj, who appeared for the maths paper on Tuesday afternoon, said: “The paper was better than I thought it would be. After going through the papers of the past years, I thought this one would be difficult too. But I guess the paper was easier when compared to previous years.”
 
 Biology was the easiest paper. Students will take physics and chemistry test at 10.30am and 2.30pm, respectively, on Wednesday.
 
 Taking both CET, NEET
 
 To ensure that they do not lose out, students are appearing for both the Common Entrance Test (CET) as well as the   (NEET), adding to the hectic study regiment.
 
 Unable to decide on engineering or medicine, many of these students are writing both the tests so there’s a chance of clearing one of them. 
 
 “With NEET becoming the only entrance test, I’m worried that my chances of getting through a medical seat is very bleak. I will be writing NEET as well, but CET is also a must if I do not get a medical seat,” said Amir, a student.
 
 But preparing for the two has been fun for some of the students as well. “CET allows only a minute for each question and the paper is just one hour 20 minutes long. But, NEET on the other hand is a three-hour test which gives us enough time ,” said Abhishek Murali, a student of Presidency PU College.
 
 Many students boycotted NEET at the last minute as they found it hard to cope with the stress of preparing for both. “I think studying for NEET will simultaneously prepare you for CET as well. It’s also an important learning experience which will be useful in the future,” Nanda V, who took up the challenge, said.
