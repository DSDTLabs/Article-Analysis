LUCKNOW: Joining the   in a show of solidarity with the meat sellers’ strike is the famous sheermaal seller,   who closed his shop on Monday.

 The owner of the outlet, Md Umar, said his business has been hit by the chain of events. Earlier he sold 100-130 kg of sheermaal everyday because the bread goes well with both nahari and kababs. High sales of Raheem’s, Mubeens’ and Tunday’s delicacies meant good business for sheermaal sellers as well. 
 
 But after the strike, eateries have downed their shutters due to the unavailability of buffalo, mutton and chicken meat. So customers stopped buying his roti too, he said.
 
 The owner of Ali Hussain Sheermaal, another shop started in 1830, Mohd Junaid, said he suffered losses of over 75% in the past few days. The outlet was established at the time of Nawab Haider. Junaid said earlier they sold sheermaal of over 50-kg maida. After the strike, they cannot sell bread made out of even 10-kg maida. Though he hasn’t shut shop yet but, he said, it won’t be long before he joined the strike too.
