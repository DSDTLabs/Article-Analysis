HYDERABAD:   ( ) seems to have learnt no lessons from past mistakes as it has once again scheduled two exams on one single day, angering candidates.

 According to the latest circular, the commission has scheduled both Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) and recruitment test to fill 546 veterinary posts on July 23.
 
 This has forced candidates to once again protest and demand rescheduling of the exams on different dates.
 
 “This year along with polytechnic candidates, students who have done their vocational courses in poultry, sheep and goat, dairy science are also allowed to apply for these posts. Obviously, these candidates would try their hands at teacher recruitment test too. Scheduling both exams on the same day will deprive hundreds of candidates a chance to get a government job,“ said   K, a veterinary final-year student.
 
 Another candidate   M, who wants to try his hands at both the exams, said, “The government should immediately reschedule one of the exams so that candidates can appear for both the tests.“
 
 The student leaders, meanwhile, said that they are planning to launch a protest against this move of the go vernment soon.
 
 “We are getting messages from several aspirants saying that they would be affected because of this move. So, we will soon launch a protest demanding the state roll back their decision,“ said   K, a student leader.
 
 An official from TSPSC, which has issued recruitment notification, said that no such issue was brought to their notice. “No one has approached us with this issue. If we get any representation, we will look into the matter,“ said the official.
 
 Earlier too, the TSPSC scheduled Gurukul teachers recruitment exam and staff selection commission (SSC) test on the same day -May 28. They changed their decision, only after the candidates launched a protest and gave a representation.
