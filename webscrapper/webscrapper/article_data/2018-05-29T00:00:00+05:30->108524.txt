Raman Bala, who played a minor role in  , as a CRPF soldier, is currently shooting a Tamil-Hindi bilingual titled Bypass. Bala has also co-written the story of the film with  , who has assisted  , the writer of   2. Akshay is also the director of this film. “The story is about a criminal who absconds from the city after committing a crime. He ends up travelling with a few sadhus, who are walking from Ujjain to Kapilavastu. How this conman traverses through many phases towards self-realisation during the course of this journey forms the plot,” elaborates the actor, who has lost 16kg to play this role. 

 Talking about the title, he explains, “People talk about all individuals taking two journeys — the one we take externally, and the one we take on the inside. This guy, who is on a road to hell, because of his deeds, manages to bypass that through his journey of self-realisation. So, we felt it would be an apt title, even more so because we have shot it like a road movie.”The film will have actors from both the Tamil and Hindi film industries, says the actor. “From Tamil cinema, we have actors like  , who was seen in films like Thuppakki and Theeran Adhigaaram Ondru, and Pradeep, who acted in Sangu Chakkaram. Bollywood actors like, Murari Kumar, who has acted in Black Friday, Ugly and Gangs Of Wasseypur, and Sagayaraj, who has worked in Peddlers, and Raman Raghav, are also part of the cast,” he informs.
 
 The team has completed shooting the journey portions last week. “We have shot love in towns Dehradun, Rishikesh, and the other places that the hero travels to in the film. We have one more schedule, which we are planning to shoot in July, in Mumbai, as that is where the story begins,” saya Bala.
