Navi Mumbai: After persistent demand by public, the   traffic unit has blocked the illegal   between   highway junction and   in Kharghar on Friday, to ease snarls.

 According to cops, the barricade just before Hiranandani signal is a temporary arrangement for a week-long dry run to check the traffic movement before shutting down the u-turn permanently. Residents are all praise for the traffic department’s move.
 
 The signal-less u-turn would cause snarls regularly but putting up the divider has had a positive effect. “In the last two days, we have received positive feedback from motorists and residents,” said Pravin Pandey, Kharghar traffic in-charge. He added that they have also amended the signal timing to see that there’s no jam due to blocking the illegal access.
 
 “I appreciate shutting down the unnecessary u-turn, which would create commotion with random right turn at a non-designated access,” said Subodh Rao, a resident.
 
 Pandey added that they have written a letter to   urging the nodal agency to block the access permanently by installing divider along this free space.
