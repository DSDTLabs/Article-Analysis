Vadodara: A group of people from upper caste   community were booked for allegedly pelting stones at marriage procession of a Dalit groom at   village near the city on Wednesday midnight.

 Five persons – Manilal Jadav, Rakesh alias Bhopo, Ramesh Shantilal, Mahesh Jadav and Piyush Vitthalbhai – were booked for assault, rioting, criminal conspiracy and violation of various sections of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act at   police station on Thursday.
 
 Complainant   told the police that on April 21 leaders of Kshatriya community wrote on the notice board of a local dairy that “Only Kshatriyas can hold marriage procession and Dalits cannot. If Dalits will hold marriage procession…” However, ignoring the notice a groom who was to wed Parmar’s niece took out a procession in the village on Wednesday night.
 
 Police said that when the procession was to start, the accused reached Vankar Vaas in the village and started making abusive comments over the complainant’s caste. Parmar’s complaint stated that the accused said that in spite of warning the procession was taken out and then started to pelt stones at the procession.
 
 Parmar told the police that many guests received minor injuries during the attack. Meanwhile, as the city police learnt about the melee they quickly reached there and controlled the situation. On Thursday too, extra force was deployed in the village so that no untoward incident which could aggravate the situation can take place.
