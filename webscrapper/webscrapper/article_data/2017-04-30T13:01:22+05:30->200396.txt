SALIGAO: The garbage treatment plant on the   plateau may have found many admirers including   chief minister   lately, but, ironically, the approach road is littered with garbage on either side. 

 The road, which also leads to the   seminary and the Pilerne industrial estate, is strewn with garbage and has become an eyesore to commuters as well as those working in the industrial estate.
 
 A local resident, Mario Dâ€™Souza, said that the Saligao panchayat should take immediate action to get rid of the garbage dumped on the road. Locals further said that the Saligao panchayat has not fulfilled its responsibility in collecting the garbage.
 
 When STOI contacted Saligao sarpanch Eknath Oraskar, he blamed the state government for not providing sufficient manpower and funds for undertaking the collection of garbage. Union minister for environment, forests and climate change, Anil Madhav Dave also visited the facility in September 2016.
