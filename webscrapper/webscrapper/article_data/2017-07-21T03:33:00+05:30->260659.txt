Panaji: Suggesting that it will take some time for the benefits of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) to create an impact, officials from the department of commercial taxes affirmed that they are taking measures to increase public awareness about the new tax regime. Speaking at a GST workshop, assistant commissioner, commercial tax department, Vishant Gaunekar said that the department has created multiple teams that are going out on a daily basis to educate people about the new tax laws.  “It is a big change in the tax laws of the country and it will take time for the real benefits to be visible. We have 10 teams in eight wards in the state and each of them is going out daily for three hours to create awareness among the people,” Gaunekar said, adding that the commercial taxes department is looking just at matters related to tax violations.  “We are not directly dealing with consumer problems. If a trader has overcharged his customer, the commercial tax will check if he has paid due tax with it. The department of consumer affairs and civil supplies is the one where people can address their consumer-related problems. Also, the GST has several balancing acts to make sure that tax defaulters do not escape. The ultimate aim is to bring everyone into the tax chain,” Gaunekar said. Officials also informed that despite the GST coming in, there are still some local taxes in place which can confuse customers.  “We are now creating basic awareness regarding taxation, specifically to GST. We have created helplines and websites. There is also a dedicated mobile application where customers can check the GST rate for any commodity they are purchasing,” he said.
