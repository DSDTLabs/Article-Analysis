NEW DELHI: The Delhi government is planning to propose over 50%   in the   who are currently paid around Rs 5,000 per month.

 Chief minister   on Saturday confirmed that a hike was on the cards and workers can hope for an announcement in a week. 
 
 The proposal would be tabled in the cabinet soon, sources said. “Wait for a week or so, you are going to get a salary hike and that too a handsome one. We are here for you and will take care of everything,” Kejriwal told delegations of   workers.
 
 Over a month or so, deputy chief minister   has spruced up the anganwadi system through inspections and an open letter to the workers in which he recognised their role in child development. Kejriwal too had joined him in one of the visits. 
 
 Meanwhile, anganwadi workers in five different batches met Kerjiwal at his residence on Saturday. Speaking on the attacks at several centres and workers in the past few days, Kejriwal said, “Your security is our responsibility. I will talk to the LG and will also meet him to apprise of the situation. I will ask him to direct the Delhi Police to do the needful.”
 
 The workers told the chief minister about the threats they have been receiving from a union which wants them to stop work.
 
 On the complaint of the quality of food at the centres, Kejriwal said it would change in consultation with the workers. 
 
 “We have started our model centres, the first one is in Pitampura where there are four of them. We will come up with similar centres across Delhi soon,” the CM added.
