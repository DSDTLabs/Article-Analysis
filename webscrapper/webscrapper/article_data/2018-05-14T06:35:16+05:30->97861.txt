 This year, the Escoms had proposed a hike between 83 paise and Rs 1.62 per unit; Bescom sought a hike of 83 paise per unit. In 2017-18, the commission effected a steep hike of 48 paise per unit, as against the proposal of Rs 1.48 (the average of all Escoms).
 
 It was the highest tariff hike passed on to   in the previous five financial years and slammed by consumers. Even during the public hearing in February, consumers complained of poor quality of power supply.
