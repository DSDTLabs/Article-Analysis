 This was the second time in the day that traffic came to a standstill on the same stretch. Around 8.30am, a speeding egg-laden truck rammed into a crane near Kamshet tunnel and fell on its side. As the highway patrol police halted traffic on one lane on the Mumbai corridor to wash away the smashed eggs that had made the road slippery, vehicles lined up.
