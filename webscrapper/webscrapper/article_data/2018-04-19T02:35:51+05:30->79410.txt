NEW DELHI: Chief Minister Arvind   demanded that the   make public the   of a February 2 meeting during which he had   with New Delhi MP   over the   of  , recruitment of dependents of deceased employees on compassionate grounds, and payment of employees according on the  , which offers higher salaries than the 7th Pay Commission.

 The minutes of the meeting were sent to Kejriwal but he apparently found discrepancies in it and, so sought the video recordings. In a letter to NDMC chairman Naresh Kumar on Wednesday, the CM wrote, “Refusal to provide recordings of the meeting on flimsy grounds raises doubts about the intentions of the secretary and the chairman.” The letter quoted the NDMC Act, 1994, to point out that recordings of the meetings are available to the members free of cost and to the general public on payment of a certain fee.
 
 Kumar did not respond to several calls and SMS messages sent by TOI.
 
 According to sources, Kejriwal backed the three demands at the meeting, while BJP allegedly "opposed" them. Leaders of the employee unions claimed that Kejriwal told them that BJP members in the NDMC Council had opposed the measures.
 
 Asked about this, BJP MP Lekhi claimed, “It is a lie that I opposed the appointments of the dependents. I only suggested cases of recent deaths.” Lekhi said that under the law only 5% of vacancies could be filled with appointments on compassionate grounds. “Recruiting more people than the vacancies will create a financial imbalance and affect infrastructure development,” said Lekhi. She also argued that the Delhi Transco scale was meant for people holding high-risk jobs, not for posts like that of a teacher.
