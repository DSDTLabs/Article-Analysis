FEROZEPUR: The revocation of the suspension of a government school’s principal, two teachers and a clerk, accused of “indecency” with some students, has met with opposition from locals of Kehar Singh Wala village, Ferozepur. 

 Principal Sukhdev Singh Bhatti, teachers   and  , and clerk Nisha Bala were posted at a school in Guru Harsahai town when they were suspended on orders by education minister   in May last year. The action was taken after a school employee recorded a video of the alleged indecent act and reported the matter to higher authorities. 
 
 Kehar Singh Wala village residents Paul Singh, Malkit Singh and Amarjit Singh claimed on Friday that Punjab’s DPI of school education had on December 27 allotted new postings to the teachers and revoked their suspensions. “The suspended teachers were served charge sheets in July 2016, after a probe indicted them of indulging in indecent activities. We oppose the revocation of their suspensions. We would make the video public, and also protest in front on the school if the revocation orders aren’t rolled back,” they said. “The move comes as a surprise, as they were suspended on the directions of Punjab education minister after he went through the video recording of their act.”
 
 The teachers had allegedly indulged in indecent acts on the premises of the school with boy students. They said the education department, while revoking the suspensions, had not taken into account the video in which the teachers were seen indulging in indecent activities.
 
 When contacted, Ferozepur district education officer (secondary) Jagsir Singh said the whole issue was in the notice of higher officials and said that he could not interfere or challenge their authority. “I am just following the directions of my seniors,” he said.
