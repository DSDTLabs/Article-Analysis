AHMEDABAD: The   of the   (AMC) on Friday approved a Rs 6990-crore budget for the   for the year 2018-19. The budget has increased the   levied on buildings but the hike will be applicable only on properties that have come up after 2008. The tax for the remaining properties will remain unchanged.

 Standing committee chairman Pravin Patel said that the 50% rebate on jantri rate — one of the factors in calculation of property tax — had been withdrawn by the municipal commissioner. “But the standing committee decided to go in for partial withdrawal. Hence 25% rebate on the jantri rate will continue,” Patel said.
 
 This means if you have a 150-square metre three BHK flat and were paying Rs 3855 as property tax, this will increase to Rs 4212 after the latest hike in property taxes.
 
 Sources in the AMC said that the civic body had announced a 50% rebate in property tax for buildings that were included within AMC limits in 2008. These are mainly in the new west zone and eastern parts of the city. 
 
 The commissioner had proposed to withdraw this rebate but the standing committee decided to go in for partial withdrawal resulting in a hike ranging from Rs 200 to Rs 600. The withdrawal of the 25% rebate will put an additional burden of Rs 35 crore on people, especially in eastern parts and the new west zone of the city.
 
 If the entire 50% rebate was withdrawn, it would have put an additional burden of Rs 150 crore on property owners in these two zones, said officials.
 
 In order to promote electric vehicles, the standing committee has also decided to give 50% rebate on vehicle tax for those electric vehicles that need RTO registration. For example, if an electrical autorickshaw cost Rs 1.12 lakh, its owner was required to pay one percent (Rs 1120) of the base price as vehicle tax. Now, after the rebate, the owner will only have to pay Rs 560 as vehicle tax.
