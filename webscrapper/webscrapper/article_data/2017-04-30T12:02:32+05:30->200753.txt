THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government move to ward off the evils in internal assessment system, especially in private colleges, has started inviting criticism from the most unexpected corners.

 Hardly a couple of days after the vice-chancellors’ committee suggested that  , both internal and external would be the best available option to imbue transparency and efficiency in internal assessment in higher education institutions, pro-CPM teachers organization (All Kerala Private College Teachers’ Association) has come out against the suggestion.
 
 The association leaders termed the recommendation for academic auditing highly unfortunate. Implementation of the same has proven a failure in engineering institutions under  . “It is unfortunate that all VCs in the committee have agreed with KTU vice-chancellor’s suggestion in this regard,” AKPCTA general secretary   and state president A G Oleena said.
 
 “Such meaningless activities have been taking place in self-financing engineering colleges for the last two years. These activities have only created Jishnu Pranoys. Academic auditing is just a practice aimed at gifting hefty sum to the dear ones of the vice-chancellor. The government should take immediate steps to suspend ongoing academic auditing in self-financing engineering colleges and carry out detailed studies on its effects,” the association leaders said.
 
 The vice-chancellors’ committee had recommended that internal auditing mechanism should be set up in every college and university to monitor and provide academic justice to students in terms of internal assessment by teachers.
