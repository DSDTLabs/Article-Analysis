KOCHI: The Kerala high court on Tuesday sought the views of the CBI in taking over the probe into the alleged custodial torture of   who died at   on May 21, 2014, after being arrested by   police.

 A petition filed by Sreejeev’s mother Ramani Prameela said that CBI is unwilling to take up the investigation despite a recommendation by the state government citing heavy workload. Police officers under the state government will not conduct a fair probe in the case as the accused persons are mainly police officers, the mother has contended.
 
 According to Sreejeev’s mother, her son, who was aged 27 years, was in love with a girl whose father was a close relative of assistant sub-inspector Philipose. At the instance of the girl’s father, through Philipose, Sreejeev was taken into custody by Parassala circle inspector   the night before the girl’s marriage. By agreeing to a CBI probe, the state government has expressed its willingness to have a fair and independent investigation by an external agency but this has not taken place due to the adamant stand of CBI, the mother’s petition stated.
