HYDERABAD: Illegal agents engaged in human trafficking to the Gulf and sell women as sex slaves will have to brace for an onslaught from police. 

  (NRI) department has requested the Crime Investigation Department (CID) to investigate into a case of a woman from Bazar Ghat being sent to   by an illegal agent. The case pertains to   who was trafficked to Saudi Arabia via Dubai by a woman agent whose name has been given as  , a resident of Sher Gate.
 
 The additional director general of police, CID, the nodal officer for NRI affairs, has been requested to investigate the case with reference to section 10 and 24 of the Emigrant Act, 1983 'and other punishment laws of the land'. The CID has also been asked to send a report to the government for taking further action and treat the mater as 'most urgent'.
 
 The General Administration (NRI) Department has also written to the Embassy of India, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, requesting that the latter take up the Asra Begum's issue with the local authorities and get her released from her employer. "She should also be repatriated on an emergency certificate from Saudi Arabia to India as early as possible," the chief secretary of Telangana said in a letter to the embassy. 
 
 Asra Begum's issue was reported by The Times of India earlier. She was employed by Ayed Abdul Rahman Bashar in Shamri of Hail, a north central province of Saudi Arabia on November 11, 2016 and was smuggled into the kingdom via Dubai by the agent. 
 
 Asra Begum's travails began when the employer sent her to his sister's place. The sister's husband repeatedly tried to sexually exploit her. Unable to bear this, she ran to the nearest police station but the police handed her over to the kafil again.
 
 "She is being held captive and is being tortured mentally and physically due to which her health has deteriorated. The family members are worried about her safety," the chief secretary wrote to the embassy.
