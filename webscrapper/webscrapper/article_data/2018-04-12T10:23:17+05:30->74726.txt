HYDERABAD:   in   (Nampally), a state government facility which is funded by the Telanagana education department, has been occupied by officials of Telangana State Disaster Response & Fire services.

 The Jawahar Bal Bhavan is a one-stop facility set up for children to hone their talents. Children can enjoy recreational activities including indoor games and music. Various dance forms including kuchupudi, bharatanatya are also taught. There is also a library on the premise.
 
 
 It is free for children from Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) while others need to pay nominal fees of ?50 per annum. Around 3,000 children are enrolled.
 
 Activist demand that children should not be deprived of their rights. “Due to staffers living there the footfall of children has decreased. The education department is also not taking any steps to vacate the staff living in the bhavan,”said  , president, Balala Hakkula Sangham, a child rights body.
 
 Fire fighters living there are also not happy with the move. On condition of anonymity one of them said that they are going through hell. “We don’t even have the basic facilities such as drinking water, washrooms and a place to sleep. Two days back, we were not able to sleep as some snakes scared us,” said a constable at the Bal Bhavan.
 
 Another constable said they have to stuff all their equipment including uniforms in a room. “I request the government to set an exclusive fore station for us or relocate us,” he said.
 
 Officials are living there after the government decided to set a special fire safety station for assembly after a fire accident in 2012. Operations were earlier carried out in the Jubilee Hall inside  , but on March 7 the fire fighters were shifted to Bal Bhavan.
