NAVI MUMBAI: Nearly nine months after the   busted a racket and arrested six members of gang that allegedly cheated several courts by forging documents to help at least 500 accused  , eight more   were made in the case.

 Those arrested include agents Madhukar Baviskar (47) from Thane, Sriram Bind (44) from Kalyan, and Jiledar Sharma (51) from Sion-Dharavi, besides Ambernath Sachin Mote (36) and four others who would appear as surety for accused to help them secure bail.
 
 “The three agents were trapped on July 1 near Digha pond after approaching them through a decoy who sought fake surety to apply for bail in Vashi judicial magistrate of first class court,” said senior inspector Jagdish Kulkarni of crime branch central unit. “The decoy gave them a fake list of accused for whom bail was to be sought. The agents then arranged four men as surety and brought them for the meeting along with forged documents like Aadhaar card, ration card, election card and property tax receipts, besides rubber stamps of government officials for attesting the documents” 
 
 Kulkarni said the mastermind, who is an expert in using machinery and gadgets for printing the forged documents, is still at large.
