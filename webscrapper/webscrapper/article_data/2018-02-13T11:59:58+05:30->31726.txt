PATNA: Overweight and obese people are more susceptible to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which in turn, increases their chances of undergoing cardiovascular incident.

 Speaking on the sidelines of the foundation day function of   (IGIMS) on Monday, director of   ( ), Dr  , said the recent shift towards obesity has led to an increase in the prevalence of sleep apnea.
 
 “Usually, frequent snoring or snorting in sleep is an indication of OSA. In an obese person, sleep apnea is a multiple level collapse of upper airway obstruction during sleep, which is caused by elevations in upper airway collapsibility during sleep,” Dr Guleria said while delivering a lecture at IGIMS on ‘Obstructive sleep apnea and metabolic disorder’.
 
 “Community-based studies have shown that 9 to 20% of the country population suffer from OSA. If OSA is left without diagnosis and treatment, there are higher chances of cardiovascular mortality,” he said.
 
 Dr Guleria said data suggest a link between OSA and a number of diseases, with metabolic disorders being the most common. Metabolic disorder is linked to high blood sugar, good cholesterol being low, hypertension and obesity. Almost 45% of obese adults in the world have OSA.
 
 “In a study conducted in Delhi, it was found more prevalent in adult females (15.6%) as compared to males (13.3%) in urban northern India,” he said.
