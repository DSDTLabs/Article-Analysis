PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Capacity-building, sustainable development, automation of scheduling and planning, and safer access for passengers are some of the challenges faced by   ( ), said the transport utility chief   on Friday. 

 Mundhe, the chairman and managing director, spoke at a two-day event, ‘Knowledge and Experience Exchange Roundtable on BRTS’, being held at Pimpri.
 
 “Capacity building is the most important. Scheduling of buses is conducted manually now. We need technological intervention in scheduling and planning to prevent any malpractices. We have started automated allocation of duties to drivers and conductors which has improved services by 30%,” the transport utility chief said. 
 
 “PMPML has a monopoly in public bus transport service in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. Monopoly has its advantages and disadvantages, But I will take it as an advantage and work to give better bus services to passengers. Our challenge is to have a sustainable city, Transportation cannot be looked in isolation,” Mundhe added.
 
 During the inaugural session, Pimpri Chinchwad mayor Nitin said, “In absence of a good public transport system, people purchase private vehicles which leads to traffic congestion, pollution and accidents. “So there is a need to provide a better public transport service to citizens.”
 
 Seema Savale, chairperson, PCMC standing chairperson, meanwhile, said we need to talk about the failures in implementing BRTS in various cities, instead of only the success stories. “This is important, as we can learn more from failure than from success,” she said.
