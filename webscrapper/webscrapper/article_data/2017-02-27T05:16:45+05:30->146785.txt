Mirror (May 16, 2016) was the first to report that   has roped in   to play the lead in her next directorial, Gully Boy, which reportedly is about an underdog who rises from the Mumbai slums to become a rapper. The 31-year-old actor has started his prep for the film.

 Buzz is, his character is modelled on real-life rap artistes, Divine and Naezy, but while speaking to Mirror (January 28) earlier, Zoya while admitting that the rapper duo is consulting on the script, had asserted that Ranveer's songster isn't inspired by anyone in particular. However, a source close to the development revealed that the actor has been meeting   and Divine to crack their rapping styles which requires plenty of energy, a sense of rhythm and the ability to connect to street poetry.
 
 'Both love the fact that he will be playing this crucial role while he is trying to understand their body language and what drives their music. He wants to prep up extensively for the part so that he becomes the character by the time the film rolls in November,' says the source, adding that even while researching and scripting the film, Zoya had only Ranveer in her mind and even travelled all the way to Paris when he was shooting there for Befikre to give him the narration.
 
 The source further reveals that it is an edgy character, drawn partially from real life and unlike today's typical city-centric hero. 'That's why Ranveer immediately jumped on board,' says the source, pointing out that the director and actor had worked together in Zoya's earlier film,  , and forged a close bond, with Ranveer fondly calling her 'Bae' and saying he wants to feature in all her films. This will be his first film with Alia Bhatt though they have shot an ad campaign earlier.
