LUCKNOW: Reacting to the   blast judgement, BSP chief   said the BJP was using central investigation agencies for political gains and leading to a 'jungle raj' in the country. Under this policy of the government, BJP's various state governments, including in UP, were trying to take back cases against its own members, she said.

 Mayawati also demanded that the Centre brings an ordinance and restores the SC?ST Act in its original form, as was before March 20, 2018. Mayawatiâ€™s demand comes after three BJP-ruled states, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh issued directions to implement the   order 20 that forbids arrests under SC/ST Act without sanction.
