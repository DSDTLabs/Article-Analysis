PATNA: A day after the   (SC) revived the criminal conspiracy charges against RJD chief   in Rs 900-crore fodder scam cases, leader of opposition in Bihar legislative council   on Tuesday demanded a review of the conduct of the then CBI director   for allegedly hampering the legal procedure in the cases.
 
  Speaking on the sidelines of his weekly ‘janata darbar’ in Patna, Modi alleged Sinha was close to Lalu and unnecessarily delayed the progress in the cases by not putting the facts straight.
  
  Modi said erstwhile Samata Party (now JD-U) functionaries Shivanand Tiwari and   alias Lalan Singh, who were among the chief petitioners in the fodder scam case, are now either mum or are defending Lalu at CM Nitish Kumar’s behest.
  
  Modi urged the CBI to form special teams for ensuring fair trial in the remaining cases in the fodder scam. The trials have to be completed in the next nine months, according to the apex court order on Monday.
  
  Replying to questions on the issue of return of Nitish to the NDA fold, Modi said the CM should first break ties with the RJD. “The BJP’s central leadership will take a decision in case Nitish requests to come back to the NDA,” he said.
