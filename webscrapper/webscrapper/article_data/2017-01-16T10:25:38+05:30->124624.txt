HYDERABAD: Telangana law minister P   was embroiled in a controversy after his speeding vehicle mowed down a 15-year-old biker on Saturday noon. The minister was not in the car at the time of the accident. But what drove the minister in a spot was his brazen attempt to blame the victim for the tragedy. After his remarks triggered a storm, the minister announced he would actively take interest in ensuring road safety. 

 As the blame game got nasty, Reddy who is also minister for housing and endowments, retracted his statement after   footage clearly showed his Innova swerving at break-neck speed and ramming the bike and the boy tossing into the air and dropping 20 feet away.
 
 The victim,  , who suffered critical injuries died in hospital. The driver of his car, P Raju, was arrested by Nirmal police on Sunday. 
 
 Sources said, the driver had dropped the minister's family at a local Ayyappa temple and sped to refuel. While returning to pick the family at Shantinagar junction, the vehicle hit the teen, a resident of Khanapur. The driver hails from Warangal.
