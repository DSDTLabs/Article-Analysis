NEW DELHI: The   at  , in which a   stole goods worth Rs 40 lakh at a  , has been solved. The gang leaders, Kalu Ram (42) and Prithvi (22), were arrested from Rajgarh in Madhya Pradesh carrying stolen jewellery worth around Rs 8 lakh.

 On January 29, Dr Saif Hasan Naqvi reported that a brown trolley bag containing gold jewellery, diamond earrings and necklaces was stolen from a marriage function in the basement hall of the venue.
 
 “A team led by ACP (operations) Palvinder Singh and ACP Aditya Gautam started probing the gangs from Madhya Pradesh that had been busted in Vasant Kunj earlier,” said DCP (south) Ishwar Singh. They team zeroed in on the two accused and they were arrested from near the reservation counter at Sarojini Nagar railway station.
 
 The men told the police that they engaged minors to carry out the crime. They disclosed that juveniles aged between 10-12 years were auctioned in their area based on their intelligence. The bid sometimes crossed Rs 10 lakh for a child. Once the child was auctioned, a contract was signed and the money was handed over to his parents in two instalments.
 
 Such children were usually hired for one year. They were trained to commit thefts at marriage functions and how to behave with the people once they were inside the venue. They were also made tough mentally and physically to not divulge the identities of other gang members. “The gang usually stayed at railway platforms and bus stops and kept moving to avoid suspicion by the local police,” Singh said.
