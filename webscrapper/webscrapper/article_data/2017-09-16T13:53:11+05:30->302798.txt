" " creator Josh Schwartz has revealed that actor   wanted to play Serena van der Woodsen, which ended up being portrayed by Blake Lively, on the show.

 In a new interview with Vulture, Schwartz said Lawrence once auditioned for the show.
 
 "We did not realize this at the time, but Jennifer Lawrence really wanted to play Serena and auditioned," Schwartz said.
 
 "This story came to us secondhand, but we were told she definitely auditioned and was bummed to not get it."
 
 
 
 
 
 Schwartz didn't remember if he watched Lawrence's audition.
 
 "We can't remember if we saw it or not. It was ten years ago, and she would've been how old, 15?" he said.
 
 Lawrence didn't land the role, because Schwartz and co- creator Stephanie Savage had set their eyes on Lively, who was 19 at the time, to be the "It" girl on The CW's once-hit teen drama series.
