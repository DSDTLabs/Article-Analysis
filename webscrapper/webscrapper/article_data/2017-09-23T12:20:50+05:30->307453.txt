VADODARA: Persons who lost their houses in Kalyannagar after a razing drive there by   (VMC) will hold demonstrations at a place parallel to the event to lay the foundation stone of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Sankalpbhoomi Smarak. Chief minister   is to lay the foundation stone on Saturday.

 Activist and former M S University professor J S Bandukwala, who has been fighting for the oustees, said the protest will be held near the incomplete residential blocks. “The site is away from where the chief minister’s programme is to take place. We see this as our only chance to be heard,” he said.
 
 The VMC, in a settlement reached with those who were ousted from Kalyannagar, had promised that those who were not being allowed to settle in housing schemes at   and   by local residents would be given houses at Kalyannagar itself. The resettlement at Sayajipura and Kalali was objected to by locals as most of the residents of Kalyannagar were from minority community.
 
 The beneficiaries were also to be given a rent of Rs 3,000 a month by the civic body. But since last year, the VMC started defaulting on rent. Residents claim that they have not been given rent since the last couple of months.
 
 The issue was raised with the VMC, but the civic body seems to have made up its mind that it will no longer pay rent to the beneficiaries. Also, the civic body is insisting that the beneficiaries accept houses at a scheme in Tandalja. The residents and activists are averse to this idea.
 
 The civic body claims that it had to take the decision of giving the beneficiaries houses elsewhere as the funds for Kalyannagar project had exhausted. Unauthorized extra work was conducted on the project and payments were made leading to the situation. The contractor stopped work as his payments were stopped by the VMC.
