MUMBAI: The BMC has sealed seven premises across the city, including a car-lift and a theatre, in the past few days for nonpayment of pending property tax worth Rs 28 crore.

 The properties against which action was taken include a car-lift of Ashiana building at   for non-payment of Rs 8 crore dues, empty plots of Reliable Builders at Goregaon, Sunshine Housing & Infrastructure near  , an HDIL plot at  , besides plots at Deonar Industrial Premises Society and Twilight Society at   (West). Naaz Cinema at   was also sealed.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 BMC officials said after abolition of octroi, they are focusing on property tax which is the main source of revenue.
 
 Officials stated property tax must be paid within 90 days of receiving the bill. If property tax is not paid on time, the BMC issues notices. If the defaulter still fails to comply, water supply is disconnected and the property attached to recover dues.
 
 In the last financial year, the civic body failed to achieve its property tax target of Rs 5,200 crore. This prompted it to draw up a list of big defaulters and crack down on them.
 
 Civic officials stated more than Rs 10,000-crore property tax dues are pending, mainly from developers, housing societies and clubhouses. But many of them have disputed the BMC claims in court. Half of this amount is recoverable and BMCâ€™s target is to recover Rs 5,400 crore before March31, of which Rs 3,800 crore has already been collected.
