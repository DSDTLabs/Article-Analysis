NEW DELHI: With former cricketer   having joined Congress, Aam Aadmi Party, which had offered him the post of deputy chief minister (if voted to power), asked him if he still considered Congress a corrupt party.

 Senior   member HS Phoolka asked Sidhu whether Congress was any less notorious or less corrupt after he joined the party.
 
 “You used to say that Congress is highly notorious, is a party of killers and of corrupt people. We would like to ask you Sidhuji whether the party is any less infamous now, or whether corruption is less or if it is less of a killer now? You have had very strong opinions on this so far and we would expect you to raise this matter in the Congress as well,” he said.
 
 Phoolka further said that Sidhu had been demanding punishment for Congress leaders Sajjan Kumar, Kamal Nath and Jagdish Tytler, accused in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, and asked if he will push this agenda in the Congress. “Will you ask your friend   to apologise for the 1984 riots and accept that these people should be in jail and not hold any party positions?” he said.
 
 AAP has accused Congress of bypassing its senior leadership in Punjab to install an outsider in its top rungs. Phoolka said Congress’ move indicates that it had no local leadership and hence it had to bring in an outsider.
 
 “Sidhu said that when AAP offered him the post of deputy CM, it wanted to make him a showpiece. If the deputy CM looks like a showpiece then has the Congress offered him one which is better? People in Punjab do not know whether Captain   is the Congress face or Sidhu is,” Phoolka said.
 
 Taking on Punjab Congress chief Capt Amarinder Singh, Phoolka said the former was scared that’s he was contesting on two seats. “He is also contesting in Lambi to ensure that Badal wins. AAP’s candidate Jarnail Singh is clearly giving a tough fight to Badal and Singh wants to divide votes in favour of BJP,” Phoolka said.
