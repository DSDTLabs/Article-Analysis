COIMBATORE: Coimbatore (south)   on Sunday alleged that he received threatening and abusive calls before the trust vote that was held in the Assembly on Saturday. He said he plans to file a police complaint against the callers.

 A day after voting in favour of the   government in the assembly, Arjunan came to his residence in the city and met reporters. 
 
 “I am sure that these callers are not from the general public, but DMK party cadres. The callers abused not only me but my wife and mother as well. Some asked me whether I add salt in my food. I am extremely disappointed. I have noted these numbers and am aware that they are DMK cadres. I will file a police complaint very soon,” he said. 
 
 He said the new government will function on the footsteps of former chief ministers MGR and J Jayalalithaa. 
 
 “People are supporting us and we will continue to work for them. Even today, I met some engineers about the work to be carried out in my constituency,” said Arjunan.
 
 Deputy speaker in the assembly   met more than 500 AIADMK cadres in his native village on Sunday. Speaking to TOI, Jayaraman said that the Palanisawmi government is not a proxy and will complete its term. 
 
 “We will serve the people and ensure that the government functions smoothly. All those MLAs who have joined rival camps will soon come back to us,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, nearly 50 women gathered outside Salem (South) MLA Sakthivel’s residence at Ammapettai and raised slogans against him for not showing up in the constituency for the last 12 days. 
 
 “We don’t have even basic amenities in our area. We also don’t have councillors after the local body elections were cancelled. When we came to petition the MLA in the last few weeks, we found him missing,” said a resident. The MLA should come back to the constituency and answer our questions, added the resident.
