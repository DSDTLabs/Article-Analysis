AMRITSAR:   of late Gurdaspur MP   of the BJP have begun lobbying in favour of his wife   as party candidate  , the date of which is yet to be announced. Veteran actor and four-time MP Khanna (70) had died of bladder cancer on April 27.

 Sources close to Khanna’s family said that Kavita was the most favoured choice since she had already worked with the late MP in the constituency and was perfect to carry forward the political legacy of the ‘bridge man’ (as Khanna was known in the area). “No doubt she is well known in the constituency but it is too early to talk about politics,” said Khanna’s close aide Pawan Sharma while talking to TOI on Tuesday.
 
 The sources stated that a core group of the late MP’s friends had already held a meeting with the BJP top leadership as soon as names of another actor Akshay Kumar appeared in media as the party’s next choice for the Gurdaspur bypoll. “Yes, some efforts have already begun. After all, it is politics and nobody would want to miss the bus,” said sources.
 
 Khanna first won the   election from Gurdaspur by trouncing Congress party’s Sukhbans Kaur Bhinder by a margin of 1,06,833 votes. In 1999, he defeated Bhinder again by just 1,399 votes. In the 2004 general elections, Khanna once again defeated her by 24,983 votes. However, in 2009, Khanna lost to Congress’ Partap Singh Bajwa by 8,342 votes. In 2014, Khanna managed to defeat Bajwa by 1,36,065 votes to become the Gurdaspur MP for fourth time.
 
 Pathankot district BJP president Anil Rampal said that, “It is too early to talk about all such things. Even Khanna’s last rituals are yet to be completed but we will abide by any decision taken by the party high command.” However, he said Kavita used to work like a party worker in the constituency. “If she would find a drain blocked, she will take out gloves from her car and clean it herself,” he quipped.
