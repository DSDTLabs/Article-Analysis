COIMBATORE: Academicians have flayed the Bharathiar University’s decision to allow the principals of self-financing colleges to retire at the age of 65, even as the state government norms mandate the retirement age as 62.

 At the syndicate meeting held on Friday on the university premises, based on a board consensus it was decided to allow the principals of self-financing colleges to continue in the post till they turn 65 years old.
 
 Pointing out that more than 32 principals of self-financing colleges were aged over 62 years, T Thirunavukarasu of Association for University Teachers said the decision was completely against the state government order (GO 325).
 
 Though a case in this regard is being heard before the Madras high court, the syndicate, being the supreme body of a university, should not have violated the government norms, he said.
 
 “The move clearly shows the extend of influence that self-financing colleges have over the supreme body,” said an academician, who didn’t want to be named.
 
 Most affiliated self-financing colleges appoint retired government college principals as the principal citing the experience as the major reason, said Veeramani of Tamil Nadu Government College Teachers’ Association, expressing his shock over the decision. The retirement age for the government and government-aided college principals is 58.
