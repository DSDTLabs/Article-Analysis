NEW DELHI: In one of the biggest aircraft orders by an Indian airline,   on Friday announced it will buy up to 205   planes worth $22 billion (Rs 1.5 lakh crore).

 SpiceJet chairman  , who brought the airline back from the verge of closure two years back, said the order is a firm one for 155 Boeing 737-8 Max and 50 purchase rights for wide body long haul planes like Dreamliner and the B-737s.
 
 "Our turnaround story has been one which has very few parallels in the world today and we are proud of it. SpiceJet has achieved seven consecutive quarters of profit, highest on time performance and lowest cancellation and a record load factor of over 90% every month for 20 months in a row," said Singh.
 
 The agreement with SpiceJet is a much-needed boost for Boeing in India, as its rival Airbus has won record-sized orders with InterGlobe Aviation's IndiGo, India's biggest budget airline, as well as a recent deal with GoAir.
 
 India is the world's fastest growing aviation market and among the most attractive for planemakers seeking a new wave of growth. Indian passenger numbers are increasing by more than 20 percent annually thanks to low prices and rising disposable incomes.
 
 Under chairman Ajay Singh, SpiceJet has been rebuilding its business since almost collapsing after running out of cash in late 2014.
 
 The airline has grown its market share and returned to profitability but it remains far smaller than market leader IndiGo.
 
 Despite soaring passenger numbers, Indian carriers have struggled to achieve consistent profitability because of fierce competition, regular price wars and high operating costs.
