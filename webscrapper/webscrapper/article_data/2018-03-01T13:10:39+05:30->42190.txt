CHANDIGARH: Showing their love for Bollywood actor  , whose untimely death came as a shock for her fans and family, the Hindi department of Panjab University ( ) is going to start screening a series of her films at the department from Tuesday.

 
 
 “It was the suggestion of students that the finest works of Sridevi be screened. Since we screen films which are socially relevant and hold certain values, those done by Sridevi, like Sadma, Mom and English Vinglish, teach us so much. Her death came as a shock for the nation, but she is with us through her films,” said Prof   Singh, chairperson, Hindi department, PU.
 
 On starting the screening with “English Vinglish”, Gurmeet said the movie is relevant for the students of the department because it deals with inferiority complex that one has for not knowing English. “Students who study Hindi are often mocked by others for not knowing English. So, we decided to start the series with this movie,” he said, adding they have collaborated with the department of art history and visual arts for the screening.
