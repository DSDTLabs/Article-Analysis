Vadodara: A gang of four persons was booked by the Fatehgunj police for cheating a cooperative bank by producing forged documents to secure a loan. 
 
 This is the second such complaint registered against this gang in less than month. According to the police, the accused had applied for car loan in Pragati Sahkari Bank Ltd last year. They produced a letter on forged letter pad of Shivdhara Motors Pvt Ltd to convince the Devendra Patel who works with the bank. 
  
 The accused identified as Dhaval Purohit, Jayesh Gajjar, Manjeet Raju and Kalpesh Patel managed to get a loan of Rs 31.60 lakh from the bank. They also showed Patel a car claiming that they have purchased it. The police said that the car belonged to someone else but the accused produced forged bills and insurance copy to convince the bank that they had purchased the vehicle. 
  
 This gang was booked by the Manjalpur police last month for cheating another branch of the same bank. One of the accused, Manjeet Raju had approached the Manjalpur branch of Pragati Sahkar Bank Ltd in 2016 and applied for car loan. He and his accomplices produced fake bill, RC book and insurance copy to the bank. The bank suspected the RC book to be fake following which it approached the regional transport office (RTO) and learnt that no such car was registered with them. 
  
 “The complainant told us that there is no such car showroom called Shivdhara Motors in the city. The accused prepared forged documents and collected the cheque that they deposited in a bank,” said Fatehgunj police sub-inspector, M R Savseta.
