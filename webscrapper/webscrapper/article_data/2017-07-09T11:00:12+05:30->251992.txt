 "Tiger is a great dancer and it is difficult for me to do better than him. But I rehearsed a lot and ended up enjoying it," he said. Nawaz is known for his power packed performances in films such as ' ' and ' '. The actor said he tries to stay honest to his craft rather than thinking about what others say about him. 
 
 "I act for myself and not to impress people. Doing that would be corrupting my craft. I take it as a journey and I am trying to discover myself through different characters," he said. 
 
 Praising his co-star, Tiger said he too was nervous to face the camera with Nawaz. "I was nervous when I first faced the camera with Nawaz. He is a great performer. It was a learning experience for me to observe him on the sets," Tiger said.
