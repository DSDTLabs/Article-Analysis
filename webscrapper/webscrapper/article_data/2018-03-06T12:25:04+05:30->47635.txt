TRICHY: Ethernet co-founder   has said that human beings are now more connected than before and it is importants to make use of the trend in innovations and companies to achieve better results and performance. 

 He was speaking at the annual techno-managerial fest Pragyan 2018, which was conducted by theNational Institute of Technology - Trichy (NIT-T) that concluded here on Sunday. “Human beings are now more connected than ever before. Innovations and companies that use this will do better than those who don't,” Metcalfe, who was the chief guest on the day, said. 
 
 He spoke on the importance of promoting promising innovations, his opinion on startups and origin of Ethernet. As a student, said Metcalfe, he had invented a way to transfer data along a long cable. “This invention was instrumental to the foundations of what would become the Ethernet,” the renowned electrical engineer said.
 
 Ethernet is a computer networking technology that is commonly used in LAN, MAN and WAN. He elaborated on how he formulated the protocols for network file transfer Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), his subsequent "LAN wars" with other competing corporations and their respective proprietary network protocols.
 
 Metcalfe said that he had already laid the groundwork for what would become modern WiFi by using radio waves to transfer data. The engineer went on saying that it was necessary for a startup to innovate, promote and expose new technologies. “Innovation breeds prosperity and prosperity breeds freedom,” he asserted.
 
 The US-based professor shared the story of the company he had founded- 3com- and its journey from a one-man company to one of the leading players in networking. “My gamble with 3com took off because I relied on a single start-up:  . Start-ups are what is going to get your idea afloat,” he said.
