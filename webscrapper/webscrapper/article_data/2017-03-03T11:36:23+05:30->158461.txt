IMPHAL: Two days before the first phase of polls in Manipur, the newly set up Left Democratic Front   (LDFM) has extended support to rights crusader   who is taking on chief minister   in Thoubal. The constituency votes in the second phase on March 8.

 "Taking into account her struggle against the oppressive Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, we have decided to support her in her fight against the chief minister. The People's Resurgence and Justice Alliance is not a constituent unit of LDFM though," the front's convener M Nara Singh said on Thursday. Comprising CPI, CPM, JD(U), AAP, Manipur National Democratic Front and NCP, the LDFM has fielded 52 candidates for the polls. "With the support of LDFM, I have got new strength to fight the chief minister," Sharmila said.
