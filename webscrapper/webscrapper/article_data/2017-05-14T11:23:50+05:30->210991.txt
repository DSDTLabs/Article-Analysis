NEW DELHI: The Delhi government’s Delhi Development and Dialogue Commission’s vice chairman   on Saturday claimed that he had received a threat to his life. He has written to union home minister  , claiming that he received an anonymous   at his office which says that his (Khetan’s) “killing is imminent”. Khetan has sent a copy of his letter to Delhi police commissioner and union home secretary too.

 Khetan claimed that he had received a similar threat letter in July last year too. “I had then sent a complaint to the police commissioner. Unfortunately, I didn’t get a response,” he said. “The track record of the present NDA government suggests that if a similar incident had happened with a BJP leader or member of the larger RSS parivaar, the response of the police machinery would have been contrastingly different.”
 
 “The letter advocates the cause of terror accused Sadhvi Pragya and those who are accused of killing the noted rationalist, Dr. Narendra Dabholkar, the political activist from Maharashtra, Govind Pansare, the scholar, MM Kalburgi, and many other innocent Indians. It then pronounces my death sentence with the threat that it will be carried out soon,” Khetan has said in his letter to the home minister.
 
  came out in support of Khetan as AAP senior functionary Sanjay Singh joined him at a press conference at the AAP office in Delhi.
