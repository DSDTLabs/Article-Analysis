JAISALMER: Despite so many years of Independence, villages even today are under the influence of khap panchayats. There is legal system in the country but these khap panchayats have their own law and own arrangements and force their decisions on innocent villagers.

 One such incident came to light in   police station area in barmer district where a khap panchayat has socially boycotted a villager for not hosting ‘mrityu bhoj’ after death of his father and has imposed a heavy penalty. Disappointed with this decision,   of Bakhasar village has lodged a case at Bakhasar police station against 70-80 people including 46 panchs. The complainant has demanded legal action against these panchs and other people.
 
 The applicant in the case said that after his father’s unnatural death, he refused to host ‘mrityu bhoj’ and other instructions given by the khap on which the panchs issuing directions socially boycotted him and his family. The khap has even asked members of his caste and relatives to not keep any relations with his family.
 
 In the report he said that three years ago, his father died after which the society and khap panchayats threatened to socially boycott or impose penalty. He said the khap panchayat has imposed penalty of Rs 5 lakh, 25 quintals of bajra and 10 bighas from their land for pasture land. It has ordered to socially boycott till the penalty is not paid. The victim said that khap panchayat was requested to take Rs 5 lakh cash and 26 quintals of bajra but the khap was adamant on taking 10 bighas of land too and did not listen to his pleas.
