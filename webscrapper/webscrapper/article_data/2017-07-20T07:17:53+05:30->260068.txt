NEW DELHI: The   (NHAI) has agreed to build the 79-km urban extension road (UER)-2 which will connect   near Narela in northwest Delhi to NH-8 near Mahipalpur in south Delhi.   has also given the nod for construction of Delhi-Panipat and Delhi-Alwar Regional Rapid Transit Systems (RRTS) projects along NH-1and NH-8.

 According to sources, a feasibility report would be prepared in a month's time. The NHAI chief suggested that HUA ministry and DDA would have to share part of the costs involved in the project. UER-2 was originally planned along with similar stretch named UER-1 in Delhi Master Plan 2001. DDA has built major portion UER-2.
 
 The ministry also shared the details of RRTS. Officials said the ground survey for alignment of the two RRTS projects has been already done by NCR Transport Corporation (NCTRC) and building them along NHs will significantly reduce construction ti me by over three years besides bringing down costs substantially. “This is because there will be no need to acquire land for the RRTS lines,“ an official said.
