CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and   high court has issued   against director of Haryana panchayat department for not paying the dues to many women employees working as craft teachers for several years. Some of the employees were not even paid the dues as per the announcement made in 6th Pay Commission despite several directions of the court.

 Justice P B   of the HC issued the bailable warrants for director of the department for June 2, for his failure to comply the previous orders of the high court passed on October 13, 2014; July 27, 2015; and May 11, 2017.
 
 In this case, Sunder Devi of   district and others had joined the department as craft teacher from 1978 to 1980 and subsequently their services were regularized by the department after seven years. They were working in different villages and were under the Panchayat department.
 
 On December 27, 2012, they were granted pay scale by the government as per the recommendations of the 6th pay panel with effect from January 1, 2006. The petitioners retired in on December 30, 2012, but except GPF amount of Rs 1.5 lakh, they were not provided any benefit of the pay commission, including arrears of salary from January 1, 2006, till the date of retirement. They had approached the state government and the department several times to get their dues but in vain.
 
 Finally the aggrieved petitioners approached the court seeking directions to release their dues pending since 2006. Their main plea was that despite meritorious and clean service of around 32 years in the department, they have not been paid their dues.
 
 Hearing their pleas, the HC had directed the state government to release the dues in October 2014. Subsequent orders were also issued in July 2015, and May 11, 2017, but the orders of the court were not complied by the authorities.
 
 On Thursday, the HC issued warrants against the director panchayat department for defiance of the court orders. The case would now come up for further hearing on June 2.
