MUMBAI: Publishers here have decided not to register for licences proposed by  , the state government's textbook bureau. Registrations, which opened on Monday, require publishers of supplementary content to pay up to Rs 63,000 per subject per year. Coaching class-owners too plan to move court against the state. 

  Balbharati, from the upcoming academic year, told publishers of supplementary material (print, digital and notes) for tutorial classes to pay royalty for use of its textbooks.
 
  "Small businesses, especially publishers of vernacular content, will find it very difficult to survive. We sell a book for Rs 70. If we add the licence amount to production costs, students will have to pay double for each book and not all can afford that. Vernacular students do not have very good teachers and need guides," said   of the   and Distributors. The group is reaching out to the authorities and seeking legal opinion.
 
  Coaching classes are joining hands with publishers to oppose the move. "Even if tutorials don't make their own notes, they conduct tests which use content from textbooks. Why should we pay such high fees? We are studying the fine print and will move court," said  , president, Maharashtra Class Owners' Association.
 
 Tutorial classes have to pay Rs 35,000 a subject per year under the policy. They are worried students will be at loss without supporting study resources. "We depend on published notes to give class X students but we have nothing to give this year. How will students prepare for board exams as textbooks are not enough?" said  , a coaching class-owner.
