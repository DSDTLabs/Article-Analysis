GURGAON: From seeing no reason to file a case against ‘gau rakshaks’ who assaulted   transporters on the Jaipur-Delhi highway, police have made a complete turnaround in 72 hours.

 An FIR was registered on Saturday under sections of rioting and other penal provisions of the IPC against the self-styled cow vigilantes, who are yet to be identified. Police had initially cited a compromise between one of the victims and the ‘gau rakshaks’ to not file a case. Now, they say they decided to do so after a complaint was filed.
 
 It came from the contractor. Suvalal, a resident of Kothputli in Jaipur. Suvalal said he is a buffalo trader and was taking the animals to Delhi in four trucks to sell them when 8-10 people stopped their them near the Kherki Daula toll plaza, accused them of carrying cows and beat them up. 
 
 One of Suvalal’s aides, Rahul, had to be hospitalised. Police said Rahul had refused to file a complaint, so no case was initially filed. The attack happened on the night of January 18. 
 
 On the basis of his complaint, an FIR has been filed under sections 147, 149 (rioting), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint), 427(mischief) and 506 (criminal intimidation) at the Kherki Dhaula police station.
 
 The transporters — contractor Suvalal and the four truck drivers — had earlier been booked on charges of animal cruelty because of the way the buffalos and calves had been packed into the trucks. 
 
 Police found 135 buffaloes and calves in the four trucks, of which one buffalo and 3 calves had died.
