NEW DELHI: The Union government said on Monday, the seventh day of protests by candidates, that it had ordered a   investigation into the alleged leak of a   question paper. "We have accepted the demands of the protesting candidates and have given orders for a CBI inquiry. The protests should now stop," Union home minister   said.

 The  , too, said on Monday it would hear on March 12 the plea seeking an investigation into the alleged SSC exam scam. The protesters, however, said they would continue with the protest demanding a comprehensive investigation and not just a probe of the "service providers".
 
 Thousands of candidates staged protests and vented their anger on social media, alleging malpractice and that a paper of the Combined Graduate Level Examination (CGLE) Tier II had been leaked.
 
 Following the allegations of the leak of Paper I on February 21, the SSC cancelled the exam citing technical issues. The candidates, however, have been demanding a CBI probe into irregularities and mass cheating.
 
 The SSC is a Central government organisation that recruits staff at multiple levels for various ministries and central government departments, including subordinate offices. Every year the commission conducts a graduate level exam commonly known as SSC CGL.
