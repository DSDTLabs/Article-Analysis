 Speaking to TOI, Sudesh Raje, president of Pimpri Chinchwad housing federation said, “A sewage treatment plant needs to be built for Wakad along the Mula river. Recycled water must be supplied to residents for gardening and other non-drinking purposes. The civic body must also emphasise on garbage collection and disposal. Around 12-13 MLD drinking water must be supplied to mitigate the problems residents face.”
