Bengaluru: The forest department will realign the proposed 270-km   route from   to Castle Rock to bypass core areas, including Kali Tiger Reserve in Uttara Kannada district. 

 The project, where trekkers will be allowed to enjoy the beauty of the Ghats with a canopy walk, has been facing hurdles as conservationists objected to the original alignment passing through sensitive areas of the tiger reserve.
 
 Principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) Anur Reddy said they are planning to open the trail after September. “We will alter it for a distance of 15-20km, mostly in the Kali Tiger Reserve,” Reddy added.
 
 However, environmentalists feel the project will still be a threat to the forest. 
 
 “The department is trying to reroute the trail in the buffer zone of Kali Tiger Reserve. But what’s the guarantee that inflow of visitors won’t disturb wildlife? Also, any such tourism activity needs permission from the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) and the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA),” said a conservationist. 
 
 P S Somasekhar, inspector general, southern zone of NTCA, said they haven’t got any proposal on the trail from the forest department. 
 
 “Based on media reports that the project covers Kali Tiger Reserve, we had sought comments from the department. As per rules, any project or activity planned in tiger reserves needs to be vetted through NTCA,” added Somasekhar.
 
 However, Anur Reddy said there is no need for permission from NBWL for this project as most of the proposed trails are already among the existing ones. 
 
 Once completed, the Great Canara Trail will be the country’s longest forest trekking and canopy walk. 
 
 The department had promised to open the first leg of the trail — 108-km trek from Ulavi to Castle Rock near Dudhsagar waterfalls — by August, but the project got stuck due to opposition.
