KOZHIKODE: The four-member syndicate subcommittee constituted to prepare guidelines to monitor the functioning of autonomous colleges has submitted the draft guidelines. The guidelines will be taken up for discussion in the meeting of the syndicate to be held on March 18. 

 The panel has suggested a committee consisting of the director of college development council and principals of autonomous colleges to oversee the functioning of the institutions.
 
 The syndicate sub-committee however has turned down the demand by the autonomous colleges to prepare and issue provisional degree certificates on their own. The varsity will issue both the provisional certificate and original degree certificate. The varsity will take steps to issue degree certificates within seven days of publication of result.
 
 The varsity will, however, consider incorporating the name of the institution in the original degree certificate issued by the varsity. Also, the committee has recommended allowing students to obtain transfer from an autonomous college to other colleges.
 
 Though the colleges will have the power to prepare their own syllabus, it should be submitted to the varsity for approval.
 
 The autonomous colleges under the varsity are St Joseph's College, Devagiri; Farook College; Dr Gafoor Memorial MES College, Mampad; St Thomas College, Thrissur; Vimala College, Thrissur; St Joseph College, Irinjalakuda and Christ College, Irinjalakuda.
 
 The syndicate panel comprised P M Salahudheen, P  , C Abdul Majeed and K M Nazeer.
