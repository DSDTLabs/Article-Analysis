VADODARA: The   (VMC) is set to present its  . It will have to make provisions for the additional financial burden on the civic body due to the implementation of the  .

 The recommendations are likely to make VMC spend Rs 75 to Rs 80 crore more in the ensuing financial year. VMC officials are, however, hopeful that these will be ironed out without any major hikes in taxes or charges. Sources said that major hikes in taxes in the budget are also not likely in wake of the fact that the state assembly polls are scheduled to be held this year. Even if the VMC administration proposes any hikes, these may be turned down or reduced significantly by the elected wing when it discusses the budget.
 
 The budget may see an increasing number of   (PPP) projects being taken up by the civic body. Even the   encourages civic bodies to take up projects of this nature. Such projects ensure that private parties make investments even as the civic body earns revenues out of them.
 
 Housing for the urban poor and lower income group is expected to remain a priority. The thrust towards housing is being made both by the centre and the state. The recent list of memorandums of understanding signed at the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit by VMC includes a series of such projects.
 
 The budget presented by the administration on January 23 will be taken up by the standing committee that will clear it with changes, if any. This will then be taken up by the general board of the civic body that includes elected members of both the ruling BJP and opposition parties Congress and Rashtriya Samaj Paksha.
