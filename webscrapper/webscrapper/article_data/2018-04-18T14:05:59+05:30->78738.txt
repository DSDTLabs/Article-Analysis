PANAJI: With summer moving towards its peak and the maximum temperature rising to 34.5C on Monday, meteorologists expect a slight rise in temperatures in the next couple of days. “The maximum temperature may rise to 35C in a couple of days,” said M L Sahu, director, India meteorological department ( ), Altinho. 

 “At present, northerly winds from   are blowing and this is likely to add to the temperature,” Sahu said, explaining how wind patterns also play a part in weather conditions.
 
 On Tuesday, the westerly winds set in early, dissipating the heat slightly. The mercury dipped fractionally to 34.1C, but such fluctuations are usual.
 
 The southerly and westerly winds bring in some moisture and keep the mercury down. But northerly winds and slackening wind speed increases the effect of the sun’s radiation.
 
 The weather has largely been pleasant, within temperatures remaining within normal parameters this summer. 
 
 On Monday morning, the mercury was within the normal range of 25C, but rose to 26.7C on Tuesday morning. On March 1, the first day of summer, the mercury had risen to 35C and the spell continued for a week with temperatures escalating to 37C. 
 
 The weather is likely to be dry for the next five days, but overcast conditions are likely and local phenomenon can bring in light rain. The minimum temperatures are also likely to rise by a degree. On Tuesday, the IMD,   had anticipated light rain due to overcast conditions after localized heating, but the cloud dissipated before it could reach the coast.
