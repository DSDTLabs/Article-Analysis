PATNA: The Bihar building construction department (BCD) will construct an iconic ‘Bapu Minar’, or Bapu centenary tower, on the premises of   facing the magnificent Ganga in Patna.

 The tower is proposed to be a six to seven-storey structure with amenities, including temporary and permanent exhibition halls and a seminar hall on the top floor.
 
 The BCD has initiated the bidding process for preparation of design and architectural services for the tower. “The management of Bihar Vidyapeeth has given in-principle approval for it. The design of the tower will be readied in the next three to four months,” a senior BCD official said on Monday.
 
 Old-timers recall Mahatma Gandhi had laid the foundation of Bihar Vidyapeeth on February 6, 1921 as an initiative under the civil disobedience movement to boycott British-run government institutions. The vidyapeeth would impart education in the field of science and arts as well as small-scale industrial works like weaving and stitching.
 
 Gandhians in the city have welcomed the state government’s move. “The Bihar Vidyapeeth along with the neighbouring Sadaqat Ashram was an important centre during the freedom struggle. A multi-utility building on its premises will give a fresh lease of life to the premises,” said Razi Ahmad, secretary of the   in Patna.
 
 The tower will be the second building constructed by the Nitish Kumar-led government in Patna for paying homage to Mahatma Gandhi after an iconic seminar hall christened Bapu Sabhagar on the premises of Samrat Ashok International Convention Centre. 
 
 The Nitish government celebrated yearlong Champaran centenary from April 2016 to April, 2017 by organising a series of events across the state. Mahatma Gandhi led his first Satyagraha movement from Champaran in 1917.
