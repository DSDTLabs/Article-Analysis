  Tovino had earlier told us, “I play a chain-smoker in the movie. However, the entire story is narrated in a different way. It’s told as a political satire and the unique narration is what appealed to me to take up the character.” The film's scribe Vini Viswalal had revealed, "Bineesh hardly knows a thing even about himself. The story will be told through light humour and is devoid of anything fancy, like fight sequences." The plot also encompasses two time periods.
 
 Tovino is currently also working on Madhupal’s film Oru Kuprasidha Payyan.
