NEW DELHI: From Ahmedabad to Gurgaon, from Jaipur to Indore and from Jammu to Lucknow, incidents of violence over the screening of   have lacerated northern India. And it has left social scientists divided on the possible causes leading to the Rajput mobilisation.

 Udaipur-based sociologist Rajkumari Ahir says that the Rajputs as a community have been marginalized over the years. “Once they were leaders and rulers in  . Now a large chunk among them are struggling. They have been attempting to unite to assert their existence from time to time. But the Padmaavat protest is not just limited to the Rajput community or  . Since the characters belong to their community, they feel more connected,” says Ahir, who teaches at the  .
 
 In the book “Democratic Dynasties”, political scientist Kanchan Chandra demonstrates how most among the Rajput elites stumbled through the democratic process of post-Independence India. Since 1949, Rajasthan has seen 13 CMs; BJP’s   has been the only Rajput CM of the western state.

 When the Karni Sena was founded in 2006 in Rajasthan, the outfit was primarily viewed as a grouping of unemployed Rajput youth. In 2013,Shree Rajput Karni Sena threatened to sabotage the AICC chintan shivir in Jaipur. Their main demand was reservation for the community’s economically backward members. However, Singh does not view these developments as the growth of a common Rajput consciousness across north India.
