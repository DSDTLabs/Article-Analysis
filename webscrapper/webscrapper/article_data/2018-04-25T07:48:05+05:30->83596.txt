 This was revealed following a safety audit of the pools by the Rashtriya Life Saving Society-India (RLSSI). Seven of the swimming pools run by the   ( ) are not safe, while the safety level of nine facilities is average. 
 
 
  
  
 
 The audit report was tabled before the PMC standing committee on Tuesday. “We have screened the pools run by the civic body. The next phase of the audit will cover the private pools,” standing committee chairperson Yogesh Mulik said, adding that the civic administration will be instructed to carry out the audit twice a year.
 
 RLSSI director (finance) Kavita Sharma said of the 31 pools surveyed, 10 were closed and over 50% of the rest were found unsafe.
 
 “The operators of the unsafe pools will get a week to make necessary changes before a re-audit. If a pool still fails to comply with the safety parameters, the operators will be penalized or the facility blacklisted,” Sharma said. 
 
 A PMC official said the authorities concerned will be asked to rectify the flaws in the pools and make them safe for the users. 
 
 The elected representatives had raised the safety at the swimming pools during Monday’s general body meeting in the wake of the death of a 19-year old youth in a pool at Taljai Hill this month. 
 
 Mayor Mukta Tilak instructed the civic administration to inspect all municipal corporation-run swimming pools at least twice a year. 
 
 The corporators said the contractors appointed at the swimming pools were not managing the facilities effectively and there were major security lapses.
