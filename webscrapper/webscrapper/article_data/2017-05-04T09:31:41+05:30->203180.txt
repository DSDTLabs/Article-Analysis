Several online petitions, protests and demands were made by the   film industry and film aficionados for regulating the prices of tickets in theatres and multiplexes in  . The government has finally issued a directive that there will be a Rs 200 cap for ticket prices, but entertainment and other taxes will be added extra. A multiplex official tells us on the basis of anonymity, “This move definitely needs to be lauded in terms of supporting the local industry. We have seen other states doing so and it has helped increase footfall in cinema halls. For us multiplex chains, it might mean rethinking of strategies, but this is all part of our work.” The official did not choose to answer on whether this cap on ticket prices would mean multiplexes considering increasing their food and beverage pricing. 

 
 - With the uniform pricing, there are greater chances for shows during prime time
 - Regulated   also means first day first show rates remain less for Sandalwood fans
 - Since Kannada film shows are exempted from entertainment taxes, this   will encourage more people to go to the screens
 - The   believes this will reduce pressure from other language films
 
 
 
 Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce president   says, “This is a very nice move. We had requested the government to keep a cap at Rs 200 for cinema halls. While we had asked to include the taxes, the government has decided to charge extra for the taxes, but keep the capping rate the same. We are glad and plan to write to the Chief Minister and thank him for this. Kannada films are free of these taxes, so this will benefit us and we are hoping that the assurance of prime time shows, especially those around 1 pm, 4 pm and 7 pm will give people a greater chance to watch and support the local industry.”
 
 
 
  says, “This is a very welcome move from the state government. This is definitely going to support Kannada and help save the language. We do not always need to think in terms of business or profit. A move like this will ensure that the local industry will survive and the films will end up doing better business, with more screen options opening for us. Since the profit margins were higher earlier for other language films, where ticket prices were much more than Kannada films, there would be more shows for those. This capping will ensure equality and give an opportunity for all films to have a chance during prime-time shows, especially Kannada ones. Being a distributor, exhibitor and producer of other language films myself, I can see that there will be a reduction profit rates, but this will not mean losses as such.”
 
 
 
 Producer-exhibitor-distributor Rockline Venkatesh says, “Karnataka has always been a big centre for any language films outside their own markets. Right from Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and English, to Malayalam and Bengali now, we see a lot of these films releasing here and doing well. This cap on ticket prices will see a sizable chunk of profits being reduced, since the big releases have always seen staggering ticket prices in the state. But, at the same time, I do not see any big losses because of this decision to those films.”
