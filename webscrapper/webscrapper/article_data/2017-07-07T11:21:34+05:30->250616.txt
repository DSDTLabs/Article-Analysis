I shall resign from the post of leader of opposition as these cases are my first priority and are at a crucial stage,“ he told TOI over phone from Delhi.
 
 Phoolka said he had discussed the situation with Kejriwal, including his readiness to resign from the post of leader of ppposition. He said that as per the Bar council rules, a MP or a MLA could appear in court, but not a minister.
 
 The hearing in these cases resumed on July 4, and 11hearings are scheduled in just this month.
 
 Phoolka had earlier written to   seeking nod for appearing in cases of 1984 riot victims. He said he had suspended his practice after he was made leader of opposition, but he should be allowed to appear in the riot victims' cases as he was fighting these cases free from the very beginning. 
 
 He also gave an assurance that he would not appear in any other case. However, the council denied him permission, stating that the rules did not permit this as he held cabinet minister status by virtue of being the opposition leader.
 
 A minister gets salary and perks of around Rs 2 lakh as he holds an executive post.
