Puducherry: The incidence of cancer among children increases by 1.1% in India every year, said the head of the department (medical oncology) of Jawaharlal institute of postgraduate medical education and research (Jipmer) Biswajit Dubashi.

 India accounts for 20% of all childhood cancer in the world. In India, childhood cancer accounts for 1.6% to 4.8% of all cancers, he said in a statement.
 
 Leukemia, lymphoma and central nervous system tumours are the common childhood cancer patients treated at Jipmer. The survival rate of childhood cancer patients at Jipmer is around 50%, which is less when compared to the rate in western countries that stood at greater than 70%.
 
 Dubashi cited lack of awareness, difficulty in accessing healthcare and treatment, abandonment and non-centralization of treatment procedures as some of the major reasons for the poor outcome. Jipmer launched the pediatric cancer registry in 2010. “The rate of abandonment has decreased from 25% to 10% since the launch of the registry. The resident doctors and medical social workers play a significant role in reducing treatment abandonment with rigorous counselling, arranging financial and logistic support and regular follow up by phone,” he said.
 
 Jipmer director S C Parija said the institute observed the international childhood cancer day on Sunday in an effort to create awareness about the disease. The international theme for this year was ‘Mera Hag, Mera Bachpan, Mera Jeevan: I deserve my childhood, my life.’ He flagged off a rally, which commenced near the Gandhi Statue on the Beach Road and culminated at Ambedkar Manimandapam.
 
 The participants released golden colour balloons (gold is depicted as colour for childhood cancer as pink for breast cancer) as a part of their observation. The institute also organized a series of talks on creating awareness on childhood cancer at various schools in Puducherry.
