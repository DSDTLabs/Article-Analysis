HYDERABAD:   is clogging traffic near Metro stations in the city. Vehicles parked outside exit points of these stations trigger a nightmare for motorists as they are forced to navigate through crawling traffic, especially during peak hours.

 “At any given point of time, one can see a number of autos being parked near Metro stations. This is a major gridlock in vehicular movement at Miyapur and Kuktapally stations specifically, as there is more traffic in these areas,” said Harish K, a private employee.
 
 Motorists also blamed vehicles parked on the sides of the road near stations for being a   movement. “Right before   station, one can see vehicles parked on the side of the road, slowing down traffic movement,” said Majula P, a commuter. Traffic police, meanwhile, said that they are giving e-challans to motorists for parking vehicles in unauthorized areas and added that not all vehicles parked on the sideway are of Metro commuters and few belong to customers of nearby shops.
  
  
 
 “We have sent e-challans to a significant number of motorists and slowly the number of vehicles parked in the area is coming down. Right now it is not a major problem as not many passengers are taking the Metro,” said VVS  , station house officer, SR Nagar Police station.
 
 Police added that it would culminate into a major problem once malls near Metro stations become functional, as it will increase traffic on the roads. “Once the malls are functional near Panjagutta, it would be a major problem as although vehicles would enter at different times, all of them will exit the place at the same time,” said Santosh Kiran, station house officer,
