CHANDIGARH: The Chandigarh district court on Monday remanded   and   high court registrar   in judicial custody. Sharma was arrested by the special investigation team of the Chandigarh police on December 28 in connection with the Haryana   (judicial) paper leak case. 

 When produced before duty magistrate Geetanjali Goel, the defence counsel moved an application pleading for A class prisoner facility for Sharma. The counsel claimed that Sharma, being a senior judicial officer, was entitled to get more facilities in jail.
 
 Police had booked three persons — registrar (recruitment)   Sharma and two beneficiaries,   and Sushila in the paper leak case. A high court committee looking into the case had recommended scrapping of the examination after prima facie findings that some candidates had access to the question paper. The committee had said at least two candidates, Sunita and Sushila, had the question paper. It also stated that Sharma had unequivocally denied prior acquaintance with Sunita, the general category topper. However, phone call details furnished by the service provider revealed that 760 calls and SMSs were exchanged between Sharma and Sunita over the past one year.
 
 The entire scam was unearthed after  , a resident of Pinjore in Panchkula district, had filed a petition in the high court seeking registration of a criminal case into the question paper leak. She had produced an audio recording of some candidates claiming most of the seats for the selection of candidates had already been sold for Rs 1.5 crore. She had specifically named Sunita and Sushila in the scam. Later, the court had found both Sunita (general category) and Sushila (reserved category) topped the examination with exceptionally high marks in their respective categories. The high court’s internal probe had also found Balwinder responsible leaking the examination paper to Sunita and the committee had recommended registration of an FIR in the case.
