KANPUR: After a prolonged intra-party feud, followed by poll debacle,  's first family got assembled at its native village Saifai for Holi on Monday. However, the reunion picture was not as perfect as has been in the past. 

 While CM   and his family celebrated the festival at Saifai, his uncle   chose to give it a miss. He played Holi with his supporters about 20 km away at his Etawah residence. Mulayam Singh Yadav, though had reached Saifai on Saturday evening, but came back before the festival. 
 
 Akhilesh's other uncle Ram Gopal Yadav, who was behind him in the feud, didn't turn up at all. Apart from Shivpal and Ram Gopal, however, all other family members -- Badaun MP Dhararmendra Yadav, Mainpuri MP Tej Pratap and other cousins of the CM -- celebrated the festival together at Saifai. Amid celebrations, Akhilesh met party workers and leaders and asked them to strengthen the party's base. Interacting with media persons, Akhilesh said Samajwadi Party was not only a party, but an ideology, and that "our struggle will continue."
 
 "I am in the process of reviewing the party's performance. A meeting with the party candidates and legislators will be held soon where we will decide course of action," he said. When asked about his uncle Shivpal's absence from Holi celebrations in Saifai, Akhilesh said: "Now, I will not say anything that can become 'news' for you."
