Friday could be the last day in office for controversial   chairman   as his two-year   ends on the day and he is yet to receive any intimation of an extension.

 Chauhan, who was in the I&B ministry for meetings on financial clearance for some projects on Wednesday, said more work had taken place in his short tenure than ever before in the history of the institution. “My tenure of one year and seven months has been most successful than ever before. I have managed to take a lot of decisions and the result is a disciplined, academic environment,” he said.
 
 Asked if Thursday’s meeting would be his last, he said, “If I do not get an extension or any orders from the government, then tomorrow will be my last  . I have not heard from the government yet.”
 
 Chauhan’s appointment was met with strident opposition from students, faculty and many in the film fraternity. It led to a 139-day strike and forced Chauhan to delay his taking over.
 
 Sources in the I&B ministry indicated that Chauhan was unlikely to get an extension.
 
 Speaking extensively about his work, Chauhan said he had managed to introduce a system of granting masters degrees rather than diplomas, introduced credit system, changed the syllabus and brought the faculty and students together through open days and other initiatives.
 
 He added that work on projects like creation of a   and a new hostel building were underway. The Pune-based premier film institute has been mired in controversy and saw clashes between students and the management before the strike was finally called off. The strike was supported by Congress and Left leaders.
