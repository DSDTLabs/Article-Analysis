NEW DELHI: Ripples of the “infighting” in the   over the appointment of a new team was felt at party’s first state executive on Wednesday. Delhi BJP in-charge   expressed annoyance over members spreading negative reports about the party.

 Jaju reportedly said that BJP’s central leadership was unhappy with the recent media reports about the issue. “He said that Amit Shah (BJP chief) questioned him today about the media reports regarding the appointment of the state team. He said that party’s internal matters should be resolved internally and not discussed outside,” said a senior BJP member.
 
 Jaju is believed to have told party members that they should not bother about posts as all can’t be appointed. He asked them to work for the welfare of the party. The appointment of the state team had come as a surprise to many as the list comprised names of people who were reportedly close to Jaju and Union minister Vijay Goel. 
 
 Delhi BJP chief  , sources told TOI, had expressed his dissatisfaction to the BJP leadership as some of his aides were not considered. 
 
 A day later, BJP accommodated two of his close aides and appointed them as district in-charges.At the state executive, which was held at Mukhmailpur village in Burari, a resolution was passed, highlighting the failure of the AAP government in Delhi. Tiwari plans to hold similar meetings at the district, mandal and booth level in the days to come. 
 
 “Our focus is to strengthen the party at the booth level. ‘Ek booth, dus youth’ is our slogan. I have asked all district presidents to appoint 10 people per booth,” said Tiwari.
