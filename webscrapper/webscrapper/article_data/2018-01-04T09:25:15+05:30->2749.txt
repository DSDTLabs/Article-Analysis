PANAJI: The directorate of fire services is looking at clamping down on establishments, especially eateries, that haven’t obtained fire   clearance from the department. 

 Following the fire at Kamala Mills in Mumbai, the directorate has begun collecting and compiling information on the number of restaurants in the state with details of those who have acquired fire safety NOCs and those who haven’t approached the directorate for renewal of NOC over the past five years. 
 
 While most municipalities ensure that establishments obtain fire safety NOCs before they issue licences to them to operate, the directorate has seen a trend of panchayats not laying stress on fire safety. 
 
 They issue licences without any fire clearance from the directorate. This leaves the directorate in the dark on new establishments being set up, director of fire services Ashok Menon said.
 
 Once a no objection certificate is issued to an establishment, it is to be renewed annually. “Fire safety is a continuous process. Only when the owner approaches the directorate for renewal do the fire safety personnel conduct an inspection to ensure that fire safety provisions are in place,” he added. 
 
 The Goa,   and Diu Fire Force Act, 1986 states that whoever fails to comply with the fire safety precautions will be punishable with a fine which may extend to Rs 1,000.
 
 Menon said the directorate has written to the government to make amendments to the act to introduce strict penal provisions that can act as a deterrent to those flouting fire safety provisions. The amendment has been in the pipeline for some time now.
 
 The setting up of a separate fire prevention cell in the three zones—North, Central and South— that will only conduct inspections is another proposal of the directorate.
