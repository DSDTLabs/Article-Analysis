GREATER NOIDA: Two youths were arrested for allegedly stealing cows from a village in   area on Saturday afternoon. The cops, however, ruled out any cow smuggling angle saying the youths were poor and had stolen the cows thinking that they could earn a living by rearing them.

 According to police, two youths from Dadri, Navbahar (22) and Shiv (25), stole two cows belonging to Namauli residents Sarda and Pal on Saturday and were spotted taking them near   around 1.30pm.
 
 “Some villagers spotted the youths taking the cows with them on foot and asked whose cows they were taking. When they could not give a proper reply, they were roughed up and told to return the stolen cows to the owners,” Knowledge Park, SHO,   said.
 
 He said that the villagers brought the duo to the police station and complained about the theft.
 
 “They wanted to rear them to earn a living as they were out of money and were hence taking them to their village in Dadri. We have lodged a case against them under sections 379 (theft) and 411 (possession of stolen property) of IPC,” Tripathi said.
 
 He said that the youths were merely slapped by the villagers and there were no major injuries.
