PANCHKULA: Businessman  , who was arrested in connection with a Rs-19-crore fraud in Chandigarh in December 2015 and then a Rs-8-crore chit fund scam in 2016, has been booked again-this time on charges of holding three senior citizen women captive in his house for seven-plus hours. 

 Mittal, his wife, Chetna, and son, Arpit, failed to receive anticipatory bail from a Panchkula court on Thursday. The complainants-Shashi Bala of Narwana in Haryana along with Krishna Bansal and   of Panchkula-went to the Sector 5 police station to report that the Mittals had locked them up at their Sector 4 house here.   (SHO) concerned inspector   said the case was made out under Sections 342 (wrongful confinement) and 506 ( ) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The complainants say they are Mittal's relatives and in a property dispute with him.
 
 
 
 
 Shashi’s husband, Fakir Chand, and Krishna’s husband, DD Bansal, claim to have sold a showroom at NAC, Manimajra, to Ashok Mittal and say he owes them Rs 1.3 crore as part of the deal. “He paid up just Rs 50,000 and he owes Rs 32 lakh to Shashi Bala, Rs 11.5 lakh to Krishna Bansal, and Rs 86 lakh to Usha Rani Gupta, wife of Suresh Gupta,” Fakir Chand said. “We had come to collect the balance when he called up police, saying we had attempted suicide in his house. The cops found the complaint fake. Meanwhile, he also called Krishna and Usha. Cops came again and took three of us along with Mittal, leaving our wives behind, whom Chetna and Arpit locked up in a room, while we were kept at the police station till 4am. We found out and lodged a complaint.”
