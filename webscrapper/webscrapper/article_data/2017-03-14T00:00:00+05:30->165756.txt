Actress   recently flaunted her engagement ring on social media, and captioned the picture, ‘How can I not say yes’. She tells us that the reason for her happiness is her engagement with Mumbai-based businessman Sahil Timbadia. “We have been dating for three years now, and recently, we got engaged,” she says.

  The duo had recently been to Kashmir, where Sahil decided to take their relationship to the next level by proposing to her. “There couldn’t have been a better place than picturesque Kashmir. I was completely overwhelmed.” When asked about what the   actress thinks of marriage as such, she quickly says, “I consider marriage just a formality, and many opt for a wedding function to show off the grandeur or make their families happy. It’s like announcing that the couple will be together for the rest of their lives. If two people connect on an intellectual, emotional and physical level, that’s all you need.”
 
 Shruti plans to have a simple wedding and says that it would be a close knit affair, with only friends and family. On the wedding date, the actress says, “Since both of us have some prior commitments this year, the marriage will have to wait for a while. If things go well as expected, the wedding will take place early next year.” 
 However, Shruti is determined to continue acting, post marriage. “I have a wonderful fiancé to support my work. If I decide to quit it will be because I want to stop working, not because of marriage.”
 
 On the film front, her upcoming project is Chippy directed by Pradeep Chokli.
