GURUGRAM: The   is going all-out to ensure that all workers are paid salaries through online transfers or bank cheques, even though the unorganised sector, involving a large number of daily wagers, poses a serious hurdle to the ambitious move.

 The government has set March 31 as deadline for strict implementation of its Payment of Wages Bill (amendment) 2017, which was ratified by Parliament recently. The amendment makes cashless payment of salaries mandatory, removing a provision from the old Act that said a worker’s consent was required for non-cash payment. 
 
 Government officials claim that the move will not only promote transparency and curb corruption but also ensure timely payment of salaries.
 
 However, sources said the target was difficult to achieve with such a short deadline. In the aftermath of demonetisation, about 350 camps have been set up across Gurgaon, which have helped over 70,000 workers open bank accounts. Also, the district labour department has instructed all companies to pay salaries to all employees through bank accounts. 
 
 Still, according to labour officials, only around 60% workers in the organised sectors are drawing salaries in their bank accounts. This does not take into account the unorganised sector, where lakhs of workers, mostly unregistered, work as daily wagers. Also, these workers, like painters, masons, carpenters and casual labourers, are hired through contractors and are paid in cash, mostly on a daily basis.
 
  Jaibir Arya, additional labour commissioner, Gurgaon, said, “We realise that the new amendment will be a little difficult to impose on the unorganised sector. The government will have to decide what areas are to be included under the cashless payment mode. We have already asked all companies to transfer wages into bank accounts. Also, we have given instructions that only workers who have bank accounts can be hired. It may help implement the new rules in the unorganised sector.”
