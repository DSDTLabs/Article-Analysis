KOLKATA: The body of  , who died of brain haemorrhage in New York on Saturday, was flown to Kolkata on Monday morning and cremated at Nimtala Ghat Crematorium.

  “Debarpan passed away on Saturday, but his parents in Kolkata were informed on Sunday after all arrangements were made to fly his body back to Kolkata. His parents were already in shock after Debarpan’s sudden hospitalisation due to brain haemorrhage,” said Kaushik Munshi, Debarpan’s maternal uncle.
 
 A pall of gloom had descended on 13 Sukeas Street on Monday. Debarp-an’s mother Tinku was inconsolable while his father Debashish was shocked into silence. “The relatives started coming in from Sunday night itself. Everybody is shocked at Debarpan’s sudden death,” said Munshi.
 
 Debarpan had left for New York last September to pursue his Masters. After completing his studies he worked for Intel, Deutsche Bank and TCS. Last year he quit his job and went to New York University to pursue his Masters.
 
 “His mother wanted him to get married, but he wanted to go abroad for further studies. His parents supported his decision because they believed in his dreams. He was in regular touch with his mother. Even throughout last week he spoke to his mother everyday, but did not complain of any uneasiness. The news of his illness came out of the blue,” said Aparajita Chatterjee, Debarpan’s maternal aunt.
 
 Minister for external affairs Sushma Swaraj, in a series of tweets, had assured all help to Debarpan’s parents after some of his friends tweeted to her. Munshi, however, said that the family did face some minor issues in obtaining a no-objection certificate to transport the body back to Kolkata.
 
 “I contacted the personal assistant of Sushma Swaraj ji. He assured us that we will not face any problems in flying Debarpan’s body down. We did not face any problem after that,” said Munshi.
