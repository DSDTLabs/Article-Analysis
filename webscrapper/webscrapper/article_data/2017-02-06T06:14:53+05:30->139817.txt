HYDERABAD: Another Rs 10,000 crore will ease cash troubles of banks in the state, officials said on Sunday. They said that only when the gap between demand and supply is bridged will things improve. Telangana has received Rs 34,000 crore as against Rs 52,000 crore deposited in  .

 According to highly-placed sources in   (RBI), till December, the state received only Rs 19,000 crore currency, and the remittances improved with another Rs 15,000 crore supplied after this.
 
 Despite enhancing the cash withdrawal limit per day, bankers say the situation in the state is yet to return to normal.“Even after all ATMs are programmed to suit the new limits, only the first few customers may get available cash. It is once we have more cash, that the situation will normalise. You won't find any long queues then,“ Tyagarajan, convenor of   said. Enhanced withdrawal brought cheer to bankers who said if people took money and did not hoard it, more cash would come back to banks in form of business transactions, which in turn would help them put more money in ATMs. “If cash withdrawal limit is enhanced, some part of the money will always come back to us,“ a banker said.
 
 Several citizens have been complaining that they have not been able to withdraw more than Rs 12,000. “A person who was in the queue before me withdrew Rs 15,000. By the time my turn came the cash got exhausted. The guard told me that people who came earlier took how much they needed and that I have to come again,“ said R   said.
 
 A few banks have not completed programming the ATMs to the new limits.
