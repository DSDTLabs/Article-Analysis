VADODARA: The   has decided to be lenient on   who are caught copying during exams. 

 The   have approved a proposal recommended by unfair means committee through which the provision of issuing warning to a student caught copying or   has been introduced. 
 
 So far, any student caught even in any minor offence related to copying or cheating was debarred from the exam he or she was appearing for along with at least one additional term. 
 
 In extreme cases, a student is debarred for the current term along with three additional terms. 
 
 “But there were many cases in which the student would have mistakenly carried his or her mobile phone in the exam centre or would commit a minor mistake in anxiety which does not deserve a punishment which extends up to one and a half year of his academic career. Hence, we had recommended that the university should introduce the provision of issuing warning in such cases,” said professor Magan Parmar, convenor of the 16 member unfair means committee. 
 
 The decision was taken during Saturday’s syndicate meeting during which a proposal to take part in the   (NAD) project established by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) was also approved. 
 
 NAD has been established by MHRD to ensure that educational institutions across the country post their academic awards, degrees and certificates in this central database. Once the project is fully implemented the university will no longer issue degree certificates and mark sheets in physical forms.
 
 The university has also introduced a new policy for shooting. “For seeking permission to shoot film or documentary premises, the applicant will have to pay Rs one lakh as charge to the university. They will be provided permission subject to approval of the script which should be approved by a committee and also the dates of shooting should not clash with the examination schedule of students,” said syndicate member Satyen Kulabkar.
