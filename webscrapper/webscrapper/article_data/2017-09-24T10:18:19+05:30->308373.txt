INDORE:   Influenza on Saturday claimed another life taking the death toll up to 21.

 “A 58-year-old man died of  . The patient was a resident of Shajapur and had been undergoing treatment at MY Hospital,” Dr  , in-charge of integrated disease surveillance programme (IDSP), said.
 
 She added the laboratory reports confirmed six new cases of swine flu.
 
 The city is starting to bear an additional burden of patients who throng from nearby districts for treatment. But a delay in reporting these cases to city hospitals has caused problems as they miss the window period for treatment.
 
 “Detecting and treating H1N1 Influenza virus within the first 24 hours plays a vital role in saving lives. In many cases patients coming from other districts however seem to miss this opportunity,” Dr Pandit said.
 
 She added that the department has left no stone unturned to ensure best possible treatment for patients suffering from swine flu in different hospitals.
 
 As per the local health department’s data, about 25 out of 60 patients being treated in different hospitals are in critical condition.
 
 “Around 25 patients including five at MY Hospital are on ventilators. Their conditions are stated to be critical,” Dr Pandit said.
 
 The department has so far sent as many as 347 samples. Of these, 87 cases were positive and results of 13 cases were still awaited.
 
 “The deadly virus has claimed as many as 21 lives including 11 from Indore and 10 from other districts this season. Forty one positive cases are from Indore while 46 are from other districts,” Dr Pandit said.
 
 According to official data, Indore is the worst affected after Bhopal as the capital has recorded more than 25 deaths due to swine flu in the last couple of months.
