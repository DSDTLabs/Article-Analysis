HYDERABAD: A remark made by   chief minister Chandrababu   on   sentiment drew sharp criticism from Telangana IT minister  .

 In a tweet in Telugu, Naidu had said that Union finance minister Arun Jaitley had commented that money cannot be given (to AP) just on ‘sentiment’. “He should remember that it was because of sentiment for a separate Telangana that a new state was carved out,” Naidu said.
 
 Reacting to this tweet, Rama Rao said in his tweet: “Sir, with all due respect we, the people of Telangana, never flip-flopped in our demand for statehood. Never ever settled for any package even when many were offered. You can fight for your rights but do not belittle and undermine the struggle and sacrifices of people of Telangana.” However, Naidu did not respond to KTR’s tweet.
