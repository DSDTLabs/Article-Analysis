MANDYA: A two-year-old   after his mother erroneously administered a dose of   in the district's   on Wednesday morning. 

 Police said Manasa allegedly took the decision to administer oral drops to her son without medical advice. Sources said the syrup was long past its expiry date, and she allegedly picked the bottle when the boy's cough was persistent.
 
 Within minutes, the boy, Dikshit, lost consciousness. Frightened parents rushed the child to   where the only duty doctor was away conducting postmortem on a farmer, who committed suicide hours earlier. 
 
 Immediately, the parents took the child to a   where doctors allegedly refused to treat the boy saying he was brought dead. Controlling their grief, the parents brought their boy back to the taluk government hospital. By then, the doctor, Ravi, was back at work. Sources said Dr Ravi conducted a series of tests, including electrocardiogram, to ascertain whether child was alive. The results proved otherwise.
 
 The grief-stricken parents said if the doctor was present at the hospital and treated the child during their first visit, their child would have been alive. They accused the doctor of medical negligence.
 
 Denying the allegation, Dr Ravis said he was busy with another emergency and conducted all possible tests to revive the baby.
 
 District health officer Dr Mohan also rejected the family's allegation and said the issue of concern was the boy's parents keeping an expired drug at home and administering it without medical advice.
