LUDHIANA: Punjab  , a grouping of 472   in the state, has warned of letting 3.5 lakh cows loose on the streets and at government offices of Punjab if the state government did not restore the facility of free electricity to them.

 The body has also demanded that the state government must waive electricity bills amounting to Rs 7.2 crore issued to shelters. The grouping of cow shelters issued a 30-day ultimatum to the state government at a press conference it had called in Ludhiana on Tuesday.
 
 Punjab Gaushala Mahasangh has said it will call upon all 472 shelters registered with it to shut down operations if their demands were not met. “Punjab State Power Corporation Limited ( ) has collected Rs 8 crore on the pretext of cow cess from consumers,” said  , former chairperson of  . “Where is that money?” 
 
 Two years ago, the previous SAD-BJP government had introduced a free-power facility for the 472 cow shelters. “But ever since the   government came to power, free electricity has been withdrawn. This has been done at a time when cow shelters are already under pressure of rising costs,” said Bhagat.
 
 Bhagat said PSPCL had already cut power supply to 50 cow shelters and issued notices to another 100. “They are even asking for money for the time when electricity was free to cow shelters,” he said.
 
 The head of Gau Sewa Mission, Krishnand, said the government had collected crores in the name of cow cess, but it had not extended a single penny to the welfare of the animal.
 
 “If the state government fails to act now, we will launch a state-wide agitation and continue till we are given justice,” he said.
 
 Bhagat claimed that the government had committed a “fraud” by not giving even a single penny collected from cow cess to cow shelters. “We had even requested government to centralise all cow shelters and adjust our power bills, if it did not want to use the cow cess. But that too has not been done,” he said. “The government has a month to decide.”
