BENGALURU: The recent spate of   — 13 men in uniform were injured in a week — may have prompted city police commissioner   to order his personnel to shoot at their tormentors. But probe has revealed that at least seven of the   and mufflers of non-khaki colours at the time of the incident. 

 The attackers have told investigators that they did not realize that the men they were targeting were policemen and mistook them for miscreants ambushing them at night. The revelation has now sparked a debate in the department on lack of safety gears provided to night patrolling officials.
 
 Officials of the ranks of sub-inspectors and above use their official vehicles like bikes and jeeps during night patrol. Assistant sub-inspectors, head constables and constables, however, end up using their own two-wheelers or are on foot. They routinely use sweaters, jerkins and monkey caps to beat the chill and end up covering their uniform and insignia on shoulder, officials said. “The khaki sweater given to us by the department is not enough to brave the cold at night. We have no option but to use other sweaters and mufflers,” a constable said.
 
 Constables and head constables feel that they should be given pistols instead of the .303 rifles. “There are enough pistols stored in the armouries. At the time of emergency, rifles become a hindrance. Unfortunately, no government is keen on switching over from rifle to pistol,” they said.
