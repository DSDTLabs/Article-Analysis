PUNE: A 23-year-old MTech student injured her finger on Saturday night while resisting a couple of armed chain snatchers at the Patwardhanbaug locality in Erandawane. The chain snatchers, however, managed to flee with her gold chain worth about Rs 30,000.

 The student was taken to a private hospital by her friends. After preliminary treatment, she approached the Alankar police and lodged a complaint.

 “On Saturday, the complainant and her collegemate had gone to a mall in Kothrud. On their way back to the hostel, they had stopped at the Patwardhanbaug area to meet another friend at 10.30pm. While the three friends were chatting along the road, two men on a motorcycle stopped near them and enquired about an address,” Buwa said.
 
 While the male friend was busy giving directions, the pillion rider on the motorcycle walked towards the student. Before she could realise what was happening, the suspect snatched her gold chain and ran towards the waiting motorcycle. 
 
 “Shocked, the student started chasing the motorcycle and had almost caught hold of the chain snatcher,” Buwa said. “To stop her, the suspect took out a sharp weapon and tried to assault her. Her middle finger sustained a cut when she tried to save herself. The duo then fled the spot,” Buwa said.
