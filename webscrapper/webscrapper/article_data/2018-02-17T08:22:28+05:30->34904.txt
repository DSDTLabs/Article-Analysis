Chief minister  's parliamentary constituency   is set to receive some VIP treatment, thanks to a host of allocations in the  , presented on Friday. 

 The government has included Gorakhpur in its plan for improving medical facilities in select cities. The move comes months after the district grabbed headlines when over 30 children died due to disruption in oxygen supply at BRD Medical College in August 2017.
 
 As per the budgetary allocations, Gorakhpur medical college is among the four medical institutions in the state which would get a super-speciality department, under phase-III of Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana. 
 
 The government has allocated Rs 14 crore to open burn units in four government medical colleges in the state, including the one in Gorakhpur.
 
 A corpus of Rs 550 crore has been sanctioned for the Gorakhpur Link Expressway project, which is a 110-km-long four-lane expressway to link Gorakhpur with the 350-km Purvanchal Expressway, connecting Lucknow and Ghazipur. The link expressway will start from Gorakhpur and connect with   near Azamgarh.
 
 The government has also sanctioned Rs 30 crore for the construction of a modern auditorium in the city.
 
 The government has also allocated Rs 24 crore for more facilities at Gorakhpur Zoo. The project was approved under Mayawati-led BSP government in 2010 but was subsequently put on the backburner when Samajwadi Party came to power. The   government had sanctioned Rs 21 crore for the project in 2017 also.
 
 The budget drew mixed reactions. A professor at Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gorakhpur University, Sanjit Gupta said, "The allocation for Gorakhpur Link Expressway was a welcome step as better connectivity would bring more development. The budget has kept the needs of farmers, youth, artisans in mind and focuses on education and health. It will bring more employment opportunities to Poorvanchal."
