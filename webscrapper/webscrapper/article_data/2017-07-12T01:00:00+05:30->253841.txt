DARBHANGA: Medicare services were severely affected at Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital ( ) on Tuesday due to waterlogging in most of its wards due to heavy rain during the last two days.

 Sources said the hostels for junior doctors have also been flooded. Cooking in the hostels has been stopped due to water flowing in the kitchen. Junior doctors have to manage for their foods on their own. 
 
 “The doctors are unable to move on the campus for treatment. Patients admitted in different wards have started leaving the hospital,” said a source, adding only ready-made food like bread, fruits and eggs are being provided to the patients who are still in the hospital.
 
 Keeping in mind the flood-like situation, the medical college has been closed till Saturday. 
 
 DMCH principal R K Sinha said the college has been closed due to waterlogging on the campus. 
 
 “Every year after heavy rainfall, the college gets waterlogged. Drains on the campus have been encroached upon and buildings have been constructed on them. Unless the encroachment is removed and drains are cleared, such a situation will prevail,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, Darbhanga DM Chandrashekhar Singh on Tuesday held an emergency meeting to drain out rainwater accumulated in the town. It was decided to provide two big vehicles (high-floor) to the DMCH superintendent for movement of doctors in the hospital to attend the patients. The DM also requested the principal to make alternative arrangements for cooking in the junior doctors’ hostels. It was also decided to pump out the rainwater from the campus.
