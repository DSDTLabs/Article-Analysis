HYDERABAD: Supply of essential goods, including medicines, petrol, milk, vegetables and LPG, could come to a grinding halt after   with transporters vowing to intensify their ongoing strike. 

 The   (AIMTC) announced a nationwide ‘indefinite chakka jam’ from April 8 after a two-and-half hour marathon meeting between transport associations and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) failed on Monday. The strike call has been given jointly by  , South India Motor Transport Association (SIMTA) and All India Confederation of Goods Vehicles Owners’ Association . 
 
 The nationwide strike call was given after the IRDA refused to go back on its decision to increase insurance premium rates. The IRDA has proposed a 50-80% increase, which will affect over 3.5 lakh transporters in Telangana alone. 
 
 “While essential commodities have been exempted so far, we will lift the exemption in one or two days. The exemption up to Ram Navami is because a lot of people would be travelling for the festival and we don’t intend to inconvenience them. The decision has been taken since the talks with IRDA failed. We will continue the strike and escalate it to all-India level,” said N  , president, TS Lorry Owners Association and executive member of SIMTA.
 
 Currently transporters pay Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000 (depending on weight of vehicle) third party insurance premiums for each vehicle. The increased premium amounts will be Rs 23,000 to Rs 37,000 per year. The difference in premiums would run into crores in cases of transporters with over 100 vehicles, making it necessary for them to pass on the difference to their customers.
 
 With the transport strike entering the fifth day on Monday, the impact began to be felt in supplies of essential commodities. With the stir to be intensified, cost of vegetables and other commodities may skyrocket.
