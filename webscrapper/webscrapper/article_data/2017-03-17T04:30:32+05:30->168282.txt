NEW DELHI:   leader   has said though   may have been a smart political strategy, it had disastrous economic consequences as it was based on suspect reasoning.

 With BJP’s major electoral successes in UP and Uttarakhand being read as a popular endorsement of demonetisation Ramesh said, “It is beyond doubt that demonetisation was a psychological shock. It may well have been a smart political strategy but I still maintain that demonetisation is based on spurious and dubious economic logic.” 
 
 At a discussion in the   on Thursday, Ramesh said, “… I do not believe that the election results, in any way, negate the conclusion that demonetisation may have been a smart political move, but it has been a singularly disastrous economic move.” 
 
 He also said there is no country in the world barring Myanmar, North Korea and the former Soviet Union that adopted demonetisation as a strategy.
