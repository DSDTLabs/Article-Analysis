PUNE: Incidents of prolonged traffic jams have considerably reduced on the   expressway in the past six months since the state's traffic police implemented the   barring multi-axle vehicles and containers from plying on the stretch for certain hours, especially during the weekends.

 Introduced on September 21 last year, the objective of the 'golden hours' rule was to eliminate all chances of slowing down of e-way traffic because of big and overloaded trucks, containers and other multi-axle vehicles that commonly hold up traffic when they slow down at turns and change lanes.
 
 These golden hours had been identified on the basis of maximum usage of the e-way by passenger vehicles, typically on Friday evening and Saturday morning from Mumbai to Pune and then on Sunday evening and Monday morning in the opposite direction ­usually by citizens working in either of the two cities travelling to meet families and then getting back to work after the weekend.
 
 Records of the highway police, available with TOI, reveal a visible decline in number of prolonged traffic jams on the eway. While officials admit that slowdown of traffic continues to occur, there has not been any major case of traffic standstill since September last year.
 
 Analysis further reveals another critical insight that almost all traffic hold-ups are a result of accidents or breakdowns of big trucks, trailers and containers, which are beyond the control of the enforcement agency.
 
 Expressing satisfaction with the initiative,  , additional director general of police (traffic) said, “Multi-axle vehicles slow down traffic because of poor maneuverability. Now, passenger vehicles easily zip through the eway during the golden hours“.
