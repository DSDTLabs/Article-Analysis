MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena’s threat of resignation from the government if it failed to waive off loans was only a ploy to secure votes in the BMC, alleged the opposition in Maharashtra.

 On the eve of the state legislative session, the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party launched a scathing attack on the government for ignoring the plight of farmers.
 
 “Prime Minister   in his campaign for the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections has promised waiver of farmer loans if the Bharatiya Janata Party is elected to power. Chief minister   must do the same here now,” said Opposition leader in the legislative assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil adding that in the last two months over 100 farmers had committed suicide in Marathwada region alone and in the last two years 9,000 farmers had committed suicide across the state.
 
 Sena ministers on the eve of the legislative session had met Fadnavis demanding that farmers loans be waived. “Now that the issue of the mayor’s post has been settled they seem to have forgotten their demand,” he said. 
  
 The opposition will also raise the issue of government not being serious on providing reservation to Marathas, the Dhangar community and to Muslims in educational institutions. Besides, it will also raise the issue of corruption in the Jalyukta Shivar yojana.
 
 Dhananjay Munde, Opposition leader in the legislative council said they will launch a campaign “Do you remember” to remind chief minister Devendra Fadnavis of how he had highlighted the misdeeds of the Sena while campaigning for the  .
 
 “It is nothing but a breach of trust on the part of the Sena and BJP who had accused each other of being a goonda and mafia party."
 
 Opposition members met the Governor at his residence demanding that he direct the government to announce a loan waiver and also include it in his address to the joint session of the legislature on Monday.
