 actor and former parliamentarian Govinda appeared before the tax department today following a summons to him for not paying service tax dues of around Rs 70 lakh. 

 "Govinda appeared in person at our   office today and assured us of clearing his dues of around Rs 70 lakh over the next few days," a department official told here. 
 
 The   did not respond to phone calls and text messages. 
 
  
  
 The official said as per Govinda's balancesheet of the past three years, he has earned Rs 5 crore by endorsing products, or acting in TV commercials or movies. 
 
 He was supposed to pay service tax to the tune of Rs 70 lakh, but the actor did not do so despite intimation by the department. 
 
 As the actor didn't appear before the tax department despite summons issued last week, officials had visited his house in Juhu last week to record his statement. 
 
 But the actor was not present. 
 
 Finally, Govinda, who was a   MP from North Mumbai from 2004 to 2009, was traced to his office nearby where his statement was recorded by the department officials last Wednesday following which he was asked to appear at the Juhu office, the official added.
