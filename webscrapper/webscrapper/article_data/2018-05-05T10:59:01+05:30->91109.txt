NAGPUR: Men like EM   are rarely found in today’s greedy world as he worked selflessly for the betterment of the society while his poetry encouraged people to find a path in the darkest of times, said social worker  , on Friday. 

 Speaking at the felicitation ceremony organized to mark the 75th birthday of Narnavre at Ambedkar Sabhagruh, Deekshabhoomi, Ninsarkar, himself a poet and writer of repute, said, “The life that I lead today and my poetry has his influence. I have always looked up to him for poetry which has an outwardly charm to it. The magic of his poetry gets doubled when he recites them,” he said. 
 
 “Narnavre’s poetry always talked about the development of society and how we should return its debts, but the current generation is found lacking as it has lost touch with the roots,” he said. 
 
 The literary works of Narnavre were highlighted during the programme. He was felicitated with a bouquet and memento by social worker   and MLC Jogendra Kawade, chief of Peoples’ Republican Party.
 
 Replying to the felicitation, Narnavre spoke about his life and achievements. “It is important to maintain friends that you make in your life. I was fortunate enough to have found good friends throughout my life,” he said.
 
 Neurologist Chandrashekhar Meshram and social worker Takshasheela Waghdhare were present. The programme was conducted by Pallavi Jivantare.
