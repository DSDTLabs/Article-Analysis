HYDERABAD: The   has made it clear that there was no   in a family court ordering a father to undergo   to decide the   of his child. 

 Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy made this observation last week while dismissing a criminal petition challenging an order passed by the Family Court in Vijayawada in a matrimonial case directing the husband to give blood samples for DNA test.
 
 The family court ordered a DNA test for the husband following a petition filed by his wife and son when he denied maintenance to them on the alleged ground that the wife was leading an adulterous life and that the male child was not born to him.
 
 The counsel for the husband contended that his client should not be subjected to a DNA test as it would seriously affect the future of the child. 
 
 The counsel appearing for the wife and child contended that living in adultery was not a ground for disentitlement to maintenance. He said when there was any doubt about paternity, the DNA test would decide the issue. 
 
 While dismissing the petition, Justice Satyanarayana Murthy held that direction issued by the Family Court cannot be found fault with and confirmed the order.
