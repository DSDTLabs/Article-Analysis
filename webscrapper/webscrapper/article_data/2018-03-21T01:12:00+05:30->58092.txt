Jaipur: Opposition Congress on Tuesday demanded the arrest of the assailants involved in killing a businessman outside his house in next 36 hours else they will gherao the chief minister’s residence.

 Hundreds of party workers led by its spokesperson Pratap Singh Khachariawas and other senior leaders protested outside Jhotwara police station demanding the arrest on Tuesday. 
 
 Bhawani Singh, resident of Brajmandal colony, Jaipur, was shot dead at his home on March 8 when two assailants rang the doorbell at the house of the ill-fated businessman. As soon as Bhawani came out he was shot at by them. He sustained bullet injuries on his chest and succumbed to the injuries on the spot. 
 
 Since then police failed to make any single arrest in this connection. “Jaipur is no longer a safe city and crime rate is increasing day by day. Incidences of loot, murder, robbery and dacoity have generated fear. A man was murdered in a broad daylight; still his family has not been given security by the administration so far. Nobody from the government even visited grieved family,” Pratap Singh Khachariawas, PCC spokesperson and senior Congress leader said. 
 
 In order to ensure law and order senior police officers including DCP(West), Ashok Gupta were present at the police station. 
 
 Khachariawas has threatened the police administration to arrest the miscreants in next 36 hours else the PCC workers will not only protest outside the police station but they will also march towards CM house to register similar protest.
