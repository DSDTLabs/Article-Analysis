LUCKNOW: Cold wave and delayed trains left passengers cold and stranded on Tuesday. More than 65 trains, including Shatabdi and  , arrived 2-16 hours behind schedule at   station and Lucknow junction. Passengers said they had a tough time braving the cold on platforms as waiting halls were all full.

 Trains that were late included Shipra Express (by 16 hours), Amritsar-Howrah Express (by 14 hours),   (by 12 hours), Anand Vihar-Mau Express (by 10 hours), Kaifiyat Expres (by 10 hours), Sealdah Express (by 10 hours), Doon Express, Bagh Express and Chhapra Express (all by 8 hours) and   (by 7 hours).
 
 Passengers who came to board trains were forced to wait on platforms as the waiting halls were already occupied. “I came from   to board Amritsar-Howrah Express for Howrah. My train was over 13 hours late. I stayed at the platform with my luggage because there was no space in either the waiting rooms and or the cloak room,” said Paresh Agarwal.
 
 Similarly, 67-year-old Shantanu  , a resident of Balamau, came to board Kaifiyat Express for Delhi. He said, “My train was more than nine hours late. I was told that the train has been rescheduled. I decided to stay in the waiting hall. However, the hall was not clean and there were no arrangements to prevent the bitter cold.”
