LUCKNOW: A woman gave some real tough time to a traffic cop and a nagar nigam official on Tuesday evening and bullied them for trying to challan her car at   crossing. The woman pushed them back, hurled abuses and even managed to evade challan. She did not spare journalists even.

 When some mediapersons stopped at the spot on seeing a crowd and commotion and began shooting a video, the woman became further enraged and moved menacingly at them stating, “I have not committed a dacoity,” and pushed the journalists present on the spot.
 
 Her act was caught live on camera by journalists.
 
 The ruckus created by the woman created a flutter among other commuters many of whom paused to take a look.
 
 Passersby commented that the raging woman made traffic personnel and officials of nagar nigam look like pygmies in front of her.
 
 Nagar nigam official Mohammed Afzal, who was present on the spot told TOI, “We were only following our routine duty when a car bearing registration number UP32 EA6912 was found parked in a   near  . As per rules, we towed the vehicle and brought it to our booth near Samtamulak crossing.”
 
 He added, “The traffic personnel at the booth was about to challan the vehicle in the name of   of Madiaon when a boy came running and claimed that they had gone to the mall for a very brief period and their car should not be towed. In the meantime, a woman came and started yelling at us after seeing her car getting challaned. She said, “I am also a government official, and you cannot challan my vehicle.”
 
 CO (traffic)  , currently holding the charge of ASP (traffic), said that such acts and behavior with law enforcement staff is condemnable.
 
 “Efforts are on to rope in some women constables in traffic police in order to prevent such unsavory incidents,” said Tewari.
