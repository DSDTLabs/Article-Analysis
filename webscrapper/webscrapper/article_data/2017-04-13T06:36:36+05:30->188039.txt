AHMEDABAD:  ,  , recently proposed that   served at restaurants across India be fixed to curb wastage. He said he has called for a meeting of the hotel and restaurant industry stakeholders to discuss the matter and may soon issue instructions. However, restaurant owners and hoteliers across the city find the proposal impractical. “There is a huge variety of dishes and it is not possible to serve all of them in fixed quantities,” said Rushad Jinwala, the owner of an Ahmedabad restaurant chain. “Moreover, we’ve trained our staff to ask customers if they want leftovers in takeaway containers so that they can take the food home or donate it.”

 Restaurant owners feel that they will be forced to increase prices if they are told to fix portion sizes. “Besides, there are other ways of preventing wastage and restaurants are adopting them,” said Narendra Somani, president, Hotels and Restaurants Association-Gujarat. Some   customers often order more food than needed. “So, customers need to be sensitized,” said Piyush Shah, a hotelier based in Vadodara. Even some customers feel the proposal is unworkable. Salomi Gupte, a resident of Vastrapur, said: “Instead, restaurants could provide portion options — for one to four people or even a half portion.”
 
 Others feel no purpose will be served by the proposal. “Limiting portion sizes does not guarantee zero food wastage,” said Bhargav Goswami, a city-based professional. “Moreover, there is no appropriate channel that can ensure that extra food is given away to the needy.”
