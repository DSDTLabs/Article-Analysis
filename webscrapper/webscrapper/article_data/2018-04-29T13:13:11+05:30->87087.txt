SRINAGAR: Police on Saturday strongly rebutted the reports of an assault on Jammu and   (JKLF) chairman Mohammad  . A   spokesman had alleged that Malik was assaulted by the police before being detained while he was on his way to the   to lead a protest march. Quoting witnesses, the JKLF spokesman had claimed that police stopped Malik's vehicle near Gousia hospital Khanyar and straightaway a police officer started hurling abuses on him. 

 The JKLF chairman objected to the police officer's misbehaviour and asked him to show some restraint, the spokesman claimed. Policemen assaulted JKLF chairman, injured him and virtually dragged him to police station Khanyar, where from he, along with another JKLF leader  , was shifted to police station Kothibagh, the spokesman said. Refuting the charges of assault, a police spokesman said, "A team from Khanyar police station was on a routine check-post duty when at around 12:10 pm, a car was intercepted by the police party," the police spokesman said. "People travelling in the car were asked to show vehicle-related documents. But instead of showing the documents, the travellers onboard, including JKLF chief Malik and Bashir Kashmiri, created obstruction in the lawful duty," he said.
 
 "Allegations circulated in certain sections of media pertaining to alleged harassment to these individuals are strongly rebutted," the police spokesman said.
 
 Moderate Hurriyat Conference Mirwaiz Umar Farooq condemned the alleged police action.
 
 Strongly condemn police assault, manhandling and arrest of JKLF chief Yasin Malik by police when he was on way to Jamia Masjid to take part in a peaceful protest against unabated killings of youth, use of force on student and continuous illegal arrests of leaders by the NIA, Mirwaiz said on Twitter.
