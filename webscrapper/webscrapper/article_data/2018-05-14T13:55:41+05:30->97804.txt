VADODARA: After the massive response that it received last year, M S University’s   has decided to conduct Sanskrit teaching-learning program this academic year too.

 As part of the program, which is open to all, the Oriental Institute will conduct classes on every Friday and Saturday between 4 pm and 6 pm from May 20 onwards. The program does not have any fees for participants. 
 
 “It was last year that we had launched the program which is completely free of cost to the participants. We had around 200 participants including engineers, doctors, university colleagues and students from various disciplines including architecture and engineering streams,” said Oriental Institute’s director Dr  . 
 
 “Since the demand has increased, we will be conducting the program this year as well for a period of three months,” she said. 
 
 The institute has adopted unique methodology to teach Sanskrit. “Instead of starting from grammar, we used rhymes, animated movies, short stories, cartoons and games to teach Sanskrit. Our mode of teaching is interactive involving the participants,” she said, adding that the content is selected in such a way that grammar is weaved in during the sessions. The program will be inaugurated on May 20.
