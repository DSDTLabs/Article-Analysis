PATNA: Penchant for   has become a countrywide concern with most of the world’s selfie-related deaths occurring in India, but Bihar officials continue to sit on a central government’s advisory to the states in August last year to identify no-selfie zones.

 The state officials are yet to put up banners and posters at the tourist spots. No initiative has been taken even to comply with the Centre’s advice to sensitise tourists to the risks of selfies even as the state boasts of attracting a large number of tourists.
 
 The only exception is newly inaugurated Digha-Sonepur JP Setu, where hoardings were put up declaring it a no-selfie zone after three teenagers were crushed by a speeding vehicle while taking selfies on the day of Eid on June 26.
 
 The Patna district administration had in August last year said it would put up no-selfie zone banners along the Ganga. However, TOI could not see any such banner on the river bank on Tuesday.
 
 A study published by US-based Carnegie Mellon University and Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology-Delhi attributed at least 127 deaths to selfies across the world from March 2015 to September 2016. Of them, 76 deaths occurred in India alone. Nine such deaths were reported from Pakistan during the period.
 
 Asked about the lack of initiative to prevent selfie-related deaths in the state, Bihar State Tourism Development Corporation’s general manager Jai Nath Mahto said on Monday only two tourist spots, Rajgir ropeway and Gandhi ghat, were dangerous in this regard. He said the department would soon put up ‘no-selfie zone’ banners at these spots.
 
 It may be mentioned that two teenagers died while attempting a selfie before a moving train in Katihar in April this year.
