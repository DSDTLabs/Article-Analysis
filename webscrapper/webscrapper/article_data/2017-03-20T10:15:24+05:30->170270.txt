NASHIK: The district consumer court has ordered the   ( ) to pay Rs 5 lakh claim amount, along with 10% annual interest since March 2004 and Rs 12,000 costs, to two children of a deceased woman policy-holder for wrongfully repudiating their claim. 

 The interest component on the claim amount, so far, works out to over Rs 6.37 lakh and will continue to grow till actual payment is made to the two legal heirs. The total amount payable works out to more than Rs 11.49 lakh.
 
 The two children, Ruhi and  , were minors when their mother,  , a doctor, died on September 11, 2002. Their father, Satish, also a doctor, was named nominee in the policy held by Bharati. However, he was tried and sentenced by a court in August 2005 to eight years' imprisonment for cruelty and abetment in Bharati's suicide. He has since served the sentence.
 
 On attaining the age of majority, Ruhi and Parikshit sent a legal notice to the LIC on September 4, 2015 demanding the claim amount. However, the insurer issued them a letter on October 14, 2015 stating that their claim was not tenable. 
 
 The LIC rejected the claim, arguing that the nominee (Satish) stood disqualified from inheriting any property of the deceased policy-holder as per Section 25 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. The section bars a person convicted for committing or abetting murder from such inheritance. 
 
 The LIC also argued that the children's claim was time-barred as it was made after a lapse of 13 to 14 years as against the two years within which such claim ought to have been made.
