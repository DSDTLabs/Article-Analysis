MADHEPURA: A 95-year-old woman from a village in   district is running from pillar to post to prove that she is alive.

 According to district officials,   Khan, a resident of Daha village of Babhani panchayat under Gamhariya block in Madhepura, has complained that his elder brother Sitaram Khan declared their mother Kaushalya Devi alias   dead, got her fake death certificate made from panchayat and sold the 45 decimal of ancestral land to another person.
 
 Jagdish is now taking his mother from one government office to another to prove that she was still alive.
 
 Gamhariya block development officer Jyoti Gami has constituted a team of panchayat secretary and block statistical supervisor to probe into the matter. “The death certificate was issued by the former panchayat secretary and the matter is in the court,” Jyoti told TOI on Monday.
 
 Jagdish says acting on his complaint, the local sarpanch carried out an inquiry and issued a certificate stating that Kaushalya alias Baijantri, the widow of late Baldeo Khan, was alive. “My brother Sitaram produced a fake death certificate of our mother to grab her land. Even our panchayat secretary has recommended for cancellation of the certificate,” Jagdish said.
 
 Sitaram, on the other hand, claims Kaushalya died in 1996. “Jagdish is trying to grab the share of our ancestral property by claiming that Baijantri is Kaushalya,” Sitaram alleged.
