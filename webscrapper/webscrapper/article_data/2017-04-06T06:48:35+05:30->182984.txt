ALWAR: A man died on Monday of the beating he received from   last Sunday. The police have registered a murder case and made three arrests. But   home minister   believes the cow vigilantes did a good job but broke the law by beating up people. 

 Fifteen people were thrashed by a cow vigilantes group in Alwar district. One of them died late in the night on Monday.
 
 "The cow protectors have done a good job by protecting cows from smuggling (sic). But they have violated the law by beating people brutally," ANI quoted Kataria as saying in reaction to the incident that grabbed national headlines.
 
  TOI made several efforts to contact the home minister about his statement but his staff repeatedly said he was busy in meetings. 
 
 Last month, the home minister's "insensitive" statement about the alleged gang-rape of a minor in   had led to the   for Women issuing him a notice.
 
 Late on Wednesday night police arrested three people on the charges of murder.
