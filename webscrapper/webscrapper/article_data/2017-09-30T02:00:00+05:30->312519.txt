Checks and Dots was the theme of the bash hosted by Manya club recently. All the members came dressed according to the theme. In fact, the decor too was quite in sync with the theme. Several games marked the event but the most interesting turned out to be a puzzle game in which a team of ladies had to solve a puzzle.
The highlight of the do was a musical show in which all the ladies participated. A parody of songs created by  , president of the club, and   depicting the different qualities of a husband, turned out to be real fun. Another musical parody rendered by Hima Rastogi, Mandalsa Agarwal and Smriti compelled the ladies to step onto the dance floor.
