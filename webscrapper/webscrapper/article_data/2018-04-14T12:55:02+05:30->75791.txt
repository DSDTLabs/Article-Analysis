VADODARA: Advocates, it seems, are unhappy with the delay over sitting facilities for them in the new district court at Diwalipura. Advocate Shailesh Patel, who is one of the members of the representation committee (RC) formed to resolve the issue, on Friday shot off a letter to   ( ) president,   and the managing committee. 

 Shailesh has written in his letter that the managing committee is absolutely indifferent to the hardships faced by the legal fraternity of Vadodara. “Lawyers are still forced to sit on floor. Many aged   are facing problems but the managing committee is not bothered . The committee is not taking any action to resolve the issue of lack of sitting arrangements. They should expedite the process,” Shailesh said. 
 
 “Unless the managing committee takes concrete steps, it is not possible for the representation committee to approach the high court with any kind of proposal. Even BBA president, Nalin Patel, is busy with   elections. He doesn’t have time for the advocates’ issues,” Shailesh added. When contacted, Nalin instead blamed the representation committee. 
 
 “The representation committee was formed to resolve the sitting arrangement issue. They are supposed to approach the high court and suggest solutions. Why are they blaming me and the managing committee? It means they don’t want to do the job they have been assigned. Shailesh Patel should resign if he can’t resolve the issue,” Nalin told TOI. 
 
 The lack of sitting arrangements had caused unrest during inauguration of the district court. The advocates had staged protests, blocked roads and even gone on strike as they felt that they were not given proper sitting facilities inside the court premises.
