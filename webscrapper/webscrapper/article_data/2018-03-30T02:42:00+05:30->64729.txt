Visakhapatnam: The Indian Institute of Management-Visakhapatnam (IIM-V), for the first time, awarded MBA degrees to its outgoing students instead of post-graduate diplomas in business management, thanks to the   Act of 2017 which came into force from January 31 this year. The Act declared the IIMs as institutes of national importance (INI) for the purpose of conferring degree-granting powers and to provide complete autonomy to the institutions. 

 A total of 45 students of the 2016-18 batch graduated at an elegant and grand   ceremony on Thursday in the presence of who’s who of the state, and the students’ their parents and relatives. 
 
 While 43 students collected their degrees in person, two students were awarded their degrees in absentia.
 
 Hari S Bhartia, chairperson of the board of governors, IIM-V, said 2018 will remain a special year for the IIMs as the new Act came into force this year. 
 
 “The Act empowers the IIMs to attain global standards. The outgoing students were offered MBA degrees due to the same,” Bhartia said. He added that the permanent campus of IIM-V at Gambheeram would be a future-proof and best-in-class campus. “The selection of an architect is underway. We want to move to the state-of-the art campus in less than three years. Its ambience and aesthetics would be of global standards while also maintaining the heritage and culture of the region,” said Bhartia.
