Kolhapur: The district unit of Shiv Sena organized a ‘Dhol Bajao’ (beat the drum) agitation outside the Kolhapur District Central Co-operative Bank (KDCC) on Monday to demand the exact number of farmers that have benefited from the loan   scheme. 

 As part of the the party’s state-wide demonstration, Sena has threatened to start agitating if the KDCC fails to display the list on the notice board of the bank by Wednesday.
 
 On Monday, the party activists gathered in front of the KDCC bank around 11am with drums and protested against the state government by beating the drums. After the protest, the delegation of Sena leaders including district unit presidents Sanjay Pawar and Vijay Devane along with other party workers met the KDCC officials and demanded the list of farmers included in the   waiver scheme.
 
 During the demonstration, Pawar said, “State government has announced loan waiver to the farmers and compensation for those who have regularly paid the instalments of the loan. As per the government norms, there were 51,000 farmers from the district that were benefit from the loan waiver but when chief minister Devendra Fadnavis announced in a tweet about the loan waiver to the farmers, he stated that there are 80,000 farmers from Kolhapur district. We are wondering about how there is such a huge difference in the numbers.”
 
 He said, “We have asked the KDCC bank officials to declare the list of the beneficiaries so that the information comes in the public domain. We hope that the government will also realise the exact number of farmers that are the actual beneficiaries through the scheme.”
 
 Meanwhile, the KDCC bank officials have agreed to provide the details about the loan waiver beneficiary farmers by Wednesday. “We have stated that we will organise agitation against the KDCC bank and state government if the list of beneficiaries is not published,” Pawar added.
