NAGPUR: Giving in to the demand by several scholars,   (NU) has extended the Doctorate of Philosophy (PhD) registration date for one more time to May 20. However, officials refused to disclose the number of registrations done since April 2, when the window opened for PET-II qualified candidates. The original cut off was April 16, followed by submission of hard copies by April 20, which was later extended till May 5.

 Now, the last date for submission of hard copies is May 23. 
 
 NU has also “changed interpretation” of its direction for permitting guide or supervisors nearing superannuation to accept scholars till the age of 60. The condition laid down in the direction had created numerous problems for scholars, who were unable to attach undertakings issued by their allotted guides regarding their retirement age.
 
 The norm barred guides from admitting students if they had up to three years left for superannuation. In its latest notification, NU has clarified that such guides would be allowed to admit students following recommendation from Supervisor Allotment Committee.
