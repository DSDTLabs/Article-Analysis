MUMBAI: Top budding cricketers in the city may no longer have to scurry around during the   to search for tickets. On Wednesday,   (MSSA) cricket secretary Nadeem Memon wrote to the newly-appointed two-member   (CoA) of retired Justices Hemant Gokhale and VM Kanade, which is currently running the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA), requesting them to allot 12 IPL tickets each for the semifinalists of traditional inter-school competitions — Giles and Harris Shield.

 
 “School kids aren’t able to watch the IPL matches because the tickets are very costly and they don’t know from where they can buy them. They’re mostly with the franchise. I feel that the MCA can give a small portion of their quota of tickets to these kids, instead of obliging the policemen or BMC officials. Some of these kids will become India players in the future. They’re very enthusiastic about watching the match at the ground and deserve these tickets,” said Memon.
 
 “These four-five schools, who regularly make it to the Harris and Giles Shield semis, are the ‘cream’ of Mumbai cricket, as they produce around five-six players for the Mumbai Ranji Trophy team. We told them about past greats like Vijay Merchant, Sunil Gavaskar, Dilip Vengsakar and Sachin Tendulkar, who have all played in these tournaments before going on to represent India with distinction,” he added.
 
 The semifinalists in last season’s Harris Shield were Al Barkat (champions), Swami Vivekanand (Kandivali, runners-up), Rizvi Springfield and Don Bosco (Matunga).
 
 The four semifinalists in the Giles Shield were: Rizvi Springfield (champions), Don Bosco (runners-up), Swami Vivekanand (Kandivali, runners-up) and IES VN Sule.
