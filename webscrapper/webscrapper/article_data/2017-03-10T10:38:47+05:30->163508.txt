GURGAON: Before play was suspended temporarily because of lightning threat, it was a young, unassuming gentleman of Verona who took the tournament by storm with a 4-under 68 round and the clubhouse lead. Yet, you could call him experienced for   had already won four European titles, his last and most prestigious victory coming at the   in May 2013 at the age of 20.

 The youngest winner on the European Tour at 17 years and 188 days is having a barren run after a lot of soul and swing searching. But after a T-3 finish in the Scottish Open last year, the 23-year-old is slowly finding the road to redemption.
 
 “I just wanted to keep the good run going but I never really thought it would be so difficult to continue without ever experiencing a bad mo ment,“ said the current world No. 336. For the former Top-25 player, it was hard to accept it in the beginning. “When you mature, you understand it's normal and part of life. I don't think it was really the pressure of expectations. It was pressure only when I started to play badly.“
 
 A win at the $1.75m   would certainly set him back on his old ways and today was a start. At the much-discussed 17th hole of DLF GCC's Gary Player course, he hit an accurate second shot from the rough and the putter did the work from 6 metres. “I think that was important. I was two-over at that point over seven holes. I feel the front-nine here is scoreable so I was ready for a comeback.“ Another birdie on the par-5 18th, and four more after the turn did the trick.
 
 Calling the course a “really, really good test“, he said it would have been a better score in a different setting. “Even when there is not much wind, to shoot 4-under is great here and usually if I play like this with good putts and birdies, I would make seven under.
 
 “It's tight, and every time you miss, you lose not one but two shots so it is very severe.Placement is important, being on the correct side but easier said than done.“
