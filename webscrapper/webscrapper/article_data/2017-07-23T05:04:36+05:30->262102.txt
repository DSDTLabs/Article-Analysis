For instance, Sangli was deficient by about 65mm rainfall till July 22 whereas   by a significant 86mm.
 
 A Met department official said “normal rainfall“ at some stations was unusually high.“The deficit has emerged in some locations as quantum of rainfall there has not been as much as their normal quantum. Spatial variability in rainfall is seen each year despite ex cess rainfall in the region as a whole,“ the official said.
 
 JR Kulkarni, member of Indian Meteorological Society , said according to IMD data till July 20, close to 18 districts in the state had received less than normal rainfall.
 
 The weather bureau has predicated heavy rainfall in Thane and Navi Mumbai area over the next two days, however, the city will receive only intermittent showers.
