BENGALURU: An indigenous tribe, with a population of close to two lakhs according to the 2011 census, the Hallaki Vokkaliga is a community that is rapidly modernising, and losing its ethnicity. However, seven years after a proposal was made to include the community under the Scheduled Tribe (ST) category, it remains classified as an   (OBC) group.

 Two months ago, a report prepared by the   was sent to the government confirming the primitive characteristics of the  . “The matter is pending before the state government,” said  , the director of the institute.
 
 Officials in the social welfare department said that the government was looking into the matter. “There are a series of procedural concerns that need to be addressed. We will shortly send it to the Centre for clearance,” said a joint secretary in the department.
