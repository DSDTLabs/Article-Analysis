Vadodara:   and thieves are striking at will in the city. 

 A day after two motorcyclists fled with Rs 20.47 lakh from a cash collection van, two unidentified persons barged into a house on VIP Road in Karelibaug and robbed a woman of cash and ornaments worth Rs 12,000. The broad daylight robbery happened in Shripad Society. 
 
 The victim Veena Shah was cooking in the kitchen when two Hindi speaking men entered the house from backdoor and gagged her. One of them held her at knifepoint and another went inside the bedroom to get a dupatta. They forced Shah to tie up her legs.
 
 “They first took away the two gold earrings which Shah was wearing and asked her to open the safe,” said police. The robbers took away Rs 5,000 cash and six silver coins from the safe.
 
 The duo then locked Shah in her house and escaped on their bike. Neighbours heard her screams for help and rescued her. They also informed the police.
 
 Cops said that Shah’s husband who works in the sanitary department of Sankarda public health centre was at work while her son Dipen had gone to college.
 
 A police official said that it is very unlikely that the two robbers were professional. “If they would have been historysheeters or professionals, they would not have fled with such small amount of belongings,” said the police official.
 
 Karelibaug police inspector G P Patel said, “Our search is on for the two robbers. Nobody saw them escaping as there are several exit and entry gates of the residential society.”
