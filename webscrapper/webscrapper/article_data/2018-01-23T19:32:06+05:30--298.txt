Sunday morning marked for 30, 000 Indoreans gathering together to partake in a mega-Cyclothon. Enthusiasts from all age groups and different walks of life were seen swearing it out to spread the message of a green and clean environment. The massive cycle rally began from Sayaji Square and was organised jointly by   Cycling Association and Petroleum Conservation Research Association (PCRA). The city was given a green hue on Sunday morning as cyclists wearing green t-shirts and donning helmets cycled their way across the city. The   was divided into three categories- national cycling enthusiasts, amateur cyclists and new cyclists. While the national cyclists had to cycle for 94km (men) and 60km (women), the amateur had to ride 46km (men) and 26km (women). The ones who were new to cycling had a comfortable ride of only 13 km. There were drone cameras to monitor the event and screen the live footage at LED screens that were set up along the cycling route.
