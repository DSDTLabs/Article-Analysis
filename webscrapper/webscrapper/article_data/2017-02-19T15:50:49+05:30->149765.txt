 is all set to play the lead in   next, if reports are to go by. Sivaji Productions has not produced any film under their banner in the last few years. But, now we hear that they are not going to produce one but two films. 

 Looks like the production house will team up with director   and the film will have Vijay Sethupathi in the lead. The duo has delivered last year's super hit flick 'Sethupathi'. In the meantime,   might also be working in the sequel to the 2005 hit   under the banner. The official announcement is yet to be made.
