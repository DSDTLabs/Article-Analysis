NAGPUR: The Maharashtra Bamboo Development Board (MBDB) is coming up with a ‘Bamboo Setum’ on 5 hectare reserve forest at  .

 Bamboo Setum is a garden having a collection of bamboo plants. It will display bamboo clumps of 11 species recommended by   (NBM).
 
 “It will also be a tourist attraction on the lines of Wadali in Amravati and centre for bamboo information, training and extension and a useful facility for scientists, farmers, instructors and students for research and observation,” said managing director of MBDB TSK Reddy.
 
 On March 26, 2018, the MBDB had urged then PCCF (HoFF) Shree Bhagwan to transfer 5 hectares land opposite Balodyan at Seminary Hills to develop bamboo setum. The said land, which was in possession of Nagpur division, was handed over by deputy conservator G Mallikarjuna to MBDB on Monday.
 
 “The area was underutilized. It housed erstwhile deer park, which has been closed on the directions of Central Zoo Authority (CZA). Bamboo plantations will be done on forest land.” said Mallikarjuna. Reddy said, “We will make plots and plant bamboo clumps. There will be facility to train artisans. A bamboo shop has already been set up at Seminary Hills.”
 
 In the near future it will be a source of newly introduced species for bamboo diversification purposes in watershed protection schemes.
 
 The bamboo setum at Seminary Hills will promote bamboo-made articles like mats, baskets, fishing rods, broom handle, curtains, furniture, toys etc
 
 “It will also promote use of bamboo in construction of huts, motels, houses, and in agricultural and horticultural pursuits. The setum will constitute a facility for scientific and technical experimentation on bamboo species and propagate newly introduced species for distribution to upland farmers,” said Reddy.
 
 Reddy said Forest (Conservation) Act, clearance was not required as the entire activity of setum was for conservation and preservation of the reserve forest.
