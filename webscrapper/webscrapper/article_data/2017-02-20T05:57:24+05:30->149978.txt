SURAT: At least 40   workers were detained by police at Limbayat and Parvat Patia areas of the city for protesting against   president Bharatsinh Solanki, who was in the city on Sunday to participate in a rally organized by BJP councillor Ranvindra Patil to celebrate the birth anniversary of Chhatrapati Shivaji.

 Police detained at least 20 people, including women, at Parvat Patia who had gathered holding black flags to protest against Solanki en route to the rally. However, the police detained them to avert any clash with workers from the rival party. 
 
 Once the rally concluded, Solanki started to address people at Sanjay Nagar in Limbayat. It was then that a group of BJP supporters stood up and started shouting slogans against him and also waved black flags. They were soon detained and taken to the police station.
 
 Patil has some differences with the local BJP leaders and thus invited   leaders for the event, raising political temperature in the city. He had invited Solanki and former Union minister   for the function. 
 
 “BJP normally would not oppose Congress leaders attending public events. However, this protest was basically against Ravindra Patil’s move,” a party leader said.
