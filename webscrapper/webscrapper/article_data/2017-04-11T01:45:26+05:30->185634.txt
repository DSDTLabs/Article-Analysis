NEW DELHI: The ambiguity over the status and future of the   government’s ambitious plan of giving the city free Wi-Fi is over. The outcome budget document has the IT department setting an ‘output target’ of March 2018 to commission Wi-Fi hotspots and an ‘outcome target’ of 1,000 hotspots this fiscal. 

 The project has been under scrutiny every since AAP took oath of office in February 2015. While AAP’s manifesto promised free Wi-Fi, the last two years have shown that implementing it is fraught with challenges. The outcome budget document will now help the people to review the progress of the IT department every quarter. 
 
 The budgetary allocation this fiscal is Rs 25 crore. The expected date for request for proposal has been set for October while the date for tender issue has been set for December. This is mentioned in the ‘output’ category. 
 
 Another indicator has the expected date for commission of Wi-Fi hotspots on a pilot basis. Since this is a new project, there is no baseline data available. Nevertheless, the IT department has set a completion target of March 2018. 
 
 Another example is the Swachh Bharat Mission where an open defecation free Delhi has been envisaged by 2019 at a cost of Rs 152 crore. New toilet seats added in 2016-17 are 1,316 and the target for 2017-18 is 6,398.
 
 While this data figures in the output section, as far as outcome goes,   has provided toilet access to 39, 420 people by way of these new toilet seats. The target is to reach out to 1,91,940 people in the current fiscal. It is stated that 131 of 272 wards have been made open defecation free so far.
