Trichy: As per the announcement made by the Tamil Nadu government, the district administration has invited farmers from the Thanjavur district to sell their black grams at a Direct Procurement Centre established for this purpose. Farmers who have the cereal can approach Rajaraja Cholan Farmers Producers Company and sell their produce for Rs 54 per kg, the district collector has said.

 As per the initiative to bring the pulse-growing farmers under the cover of Union governmentâ€™s price support system, the Tamil Nadu government announced cereals procurement system recently.
 
 At present the market price of black gram is somewhere between Rs 40 to Rs 44 per kg which is lower than the minimum support price of Rs 54 per kg that the farmers can get from the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED), the district collector A Annathurai said.
 
 The NAFED has nominated Rajaraja Cholan Farmers Producers Company functioning from Thanjavur as an agency to procure black gram from the farmers on behalf of the federation, he added.
 
 Farmers who are willing to sell their produce through NAFED should approach Rajaraja Cholan Farmers Producers Company along with the documents such as chitta, adangal, Aadhar card and savings account book can be benefitted, the collector further said. 
 
 The officials said that compared to the market rate, the price being offered by the government is much better. Farmers should come forward to sell their produce through his agency only when the market price is lower than the support price. This year, there had been a fall in the market price. That is why the government intervention is more beneficial to farmers, officials said.
