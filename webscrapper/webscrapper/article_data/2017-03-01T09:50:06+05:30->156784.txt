THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Coming down heavily on   T P Senkumar, chief minister   has said that the former state police chief was `trying to tarnish the image of the government and he was not conducting himself in a way befitting of a government official'.   had submitted an affidavit in the Supreme Court criticizing the government.

 Provoked by an adjournment motion moved in the assembly on Tuesday by Congress MLA Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan on `a serious law and order situation in the state where even DGP Senkumar's life was at stake', the chief minister said the DGP was getting involved in a political game not for the   but for another political party .“The UDF should realize that Senkumar is no more in its camp. He has moved out and now is with another ally.“
 
 Before the entire opposition staged a walkout after the Speaker denied discussion on the adjournment motion against the `collapse of law and order in the state', Vijayan also clarified that the government has not deviated from the stipulated criteria while preparing the list of prisoners eligible for release. “I don't remember the list but it's obvious that those serving life sentence for killing T P Chandrasekharan, cannot figure in the list as they have not completed 14 years in jail,“ he said while replying to a specific question in this regard by Radhakrishnan.
 
 Citing completion of legal action against171goons during the last nine months, the chief minister said KAAPA was being invoked on `real goons', `which has put an end to allega tions of its misuse'. He also said the police were initiating speedy and strong measures against all crimes including moral policing, attack on women and political killings.
 
 Meanwhile, opposition leader   in his address before the walkout, said the chief minister was losing his grip on the police force.“The police stations have not been as people-friendly as he claims. Action has not been taken against moral policing and attacks on women and children continue,“ he alleged.Chennithala also said that exempting goons and `quotation' teams who work for political parties from the purview of KAAPA has led to a dangerous trend.
