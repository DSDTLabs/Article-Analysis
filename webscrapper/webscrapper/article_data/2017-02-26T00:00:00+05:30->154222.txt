Kollywood beauty   has just made inroads into Malayalam industry with the Prithviraj-starrer film   and she has made heads turn with her ghost-act in the film. 

 The sassy belle was spotted recently at an outing with Team Ezra in Kochi, and she dazzled in a yellow salwar suit that was teamed up with a thin, simple dupatta. Her innocent eyes and smile, and the cool hairdo complimented her look and the style was perfect for the occasion. Her co-stars Sudev Nair, Anu Seethal,   and director Jay K were also spotted at the event.
