CHANDIGARH :The students and staff of Boys’ Hostel 3 of Panjab University on Monday got hands-on training on how to extinguish fires and evacuate a building in case of a blaze.

 From students to mess workers and sweepers, all were trained in using fire extinguishers. “We trained the staff and students since everybody should know how to extinguish fires. This was not a fire mock drill, but training for all,” said Sanjeev Gautam, the warden of the hostel.
 
 The students and staff were also informed about the types of fires and ways to douse them. “Each one of them were told about the types of fires and how to identify extinguishers meant for them,” said the warden.
 
  dean (student welfare) Prof Emanual Nahar was also present during the training. The university is also planning to conduct mock fire drills at hostels as part of ensuring nobody is unprepared in case of a disaster. Last year in May, a major fire had engulfed a portion of the first floor at the administrative block of the university. Following this, the university had conducted a mock fire drill in big buildings, including the AC Joshi library. Fire extinguishers were also refilled after the incident.
 
 Earlier this year, fire broke out on two occasions at a girls’ hostel. A shop at the Student Centre also caught fire in March this year.
