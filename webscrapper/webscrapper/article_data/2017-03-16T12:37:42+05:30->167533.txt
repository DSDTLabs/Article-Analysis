NAGPUR: To ensure quick construction of Metro in the city, the traffic police have imposed certain diversions with regards to movement of traffic in Sita buldi.

 The road from   to   will be closed for traffic completely, with traffic from Anand Talkies diverted via Humpyard Road to Yashwant Stadium. Similarly, traffic from   will be diverted via Yashwant Stadium and Humpyard Road to reach Anand Talkies.
 
 No parking will be allowed till completion of Metro construction from   to Humpyard Road, via Dhantoli police station. Similarly, the road from Yashwant Stadium passing beside Patwardhan Ground and connecting to Ghat Road using the underbridge will be a one-way till completion of Metro works.
 
 City bus depot at Munje Square will also be shifted to Patwardhan Ground in front of Yashwant Stadium till completion of Metro works. Four-wheeler parking will also be banned all along Modi Lane No. 3 till the duration of Metro works.
 
 “My business has gone down by 20 to 25% as the road from Munje Square till Modi No. 3 has been blocked for four-wheelers. The executive class, who travel by four-wheelers, have stopped showing up. It is an injustice as our customers have reduced,” said Sanjeev Gharpure, a shopkeeper in Modi No. 3.
 
 The shopkeepers have together demanded that a part of the road should be kept open for regular traffic instead of closing it completely.
 
 Senior police inspector (traffic branch) Pradeep Lambat said, “We are trying our best to make sure that shopkeepers aren’t affected by this construction. We have even opened up a 3m road to facilitate movement of motorcycles. This construction will go on for probably a year more, so citizens will need to bear with us.”
