KOZHIKODE: The convention of the   city district committee slammed the state police complaints authority (SPCA) for its 'unnecessary' interventions. Assistant commissioner of police,  , K P Abdul Razaq, who addressed the convention, termed the intervention of   a 'nuisance'. 

 The officer also sought the attention of the Kerala Police Association and   into the issue. "SPCA's unnecessary interventions are affecting the morale of police personnel," he said, detailing the experience of many of his colleagues.
 
 The AC also sought removal of section 110 of the Kerala Police Act as it gives privilege to the SPCA to 'disgrace' the police persons by unnecessary interventions in various cases. Razaq termed SPCA as 'hyperactive' and accused the body of misusing its powers. The officer, while addressing the 34th district convention, also highlighted the need to raise voice against such a body. When people have many options to raise their complaints against the police, there is no need for a separate body, he said.
