CHENNAI: An assistant commissioner of police (ACP) in the   city police commissionerate has been booked by the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-corruption ( ) for allegedly demanding a bribe of Rs 1 lakh from a real estate developer to resolve a dispute with his partner. The FIR was booked last month.

 According to the FIR, the complainant C Rajeshkanna, a real estate businessman, had a fallout with his erstwhile business partner   over a real estate project as the latter owed him Rs 90 lakh. Lakshmikanthan filed a police complaint against   with the Tiruchirapalli police commissionerate on December 1, 2017. The complaint was being investigated by the Srirangam area assistant commissioner of police Sridhar. The FIR states that on December 12, when the complainant and his friend went to the ACPâ€™s office, Sridhar told them that it was a civil dispute and he was taking a lot of effort and risk to resolve a matter which involved a huge sum of money. 
 
 Then the ACP allegedly told them that he had spoken to Lakshmikanthan who was willing to settle a sum of Rs 80 lakh. The ACP allegedly demanded a cut of 5%, i.e Rs 4 lakh, if the deal went through, the FIR states.
 
 Rajeshkanna said that it would not be possible since he was already heavily in debt. Sridhar allegedly negotiated for an advance commission of Rs 1 lakh, saying the rest could be given after the sum was handed over. He allegedly told the complainant that if this was not done, the probe may not go in his favour.
 
 The complainant told DVAC that he was not willing to pay a bribe and filed the complaint. An FIR under Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act has been registered against Sridhar by DVAC inspector F   based on direction of officers in the Chennai headquarters.
