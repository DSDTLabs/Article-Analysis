MUMBAI: The Dindoshi sessions court on Wednesday granted bail to Amit   (28) who was arrested for the death of his friend, emcee  . Her partly covered body was found in the duct on the second floor of   in Malad on December 11, 2017. Hazra lived on the 15th floor of this building with his roommates and a house help. 

 
 Hazra was arrested after a polygraph test found discrepancies in his statements. "He was released on a Rs 20,000 bail surety. He refused to take a second polygraph test, which the police had requested. He was arrested based on the first polygraph test. But there is no evidence against him. Tiwari's autopsy report too does not show his role," said Hazra's lawyer B D Hatkar. The next hearing in the case will be in June.
 
 Initially a case of accidental death report was filed by the   police. Later, the police registered a case of murder and destruction of evidence on the basis of a complaint filed by Tiwari's mother Triveni on December 13, last year. On December 11 last year, Tiwari, a   resident, had gone to Hazra's home with her boyfriend  .
