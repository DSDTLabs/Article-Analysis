TIRUNELVELI: The district administration and the police, which are already taking steps to check the dumping of   and   from Kerala in rural Tirunelveli, are now planning to get help from their counterparts to put an end to the menace.

 Though no fresh incidents have been reported over the last three weeks, Tirunelveli collector   said they will be writing to the collectors of two neighbouring districts in Kerala –   and Thiruvananthapuram – to check their trucks from entering Tamil Nadu with waste.
 
 Tonnes of waste from Kerala are being dumped in rural areas near Valliyoor and other parts of the district for more than a year. Police and revenue department officials said that vigil has been stepped up at checkposts at the inter-state border and this has helped in preventing trucks carrying waste from entering the district.
 
 Focus has been given on checking trucks bearing Kerala registration numbers and the checks are being jointly conducted by the police and revenue officials across ranks. The district administration and police in Kanyakumari district too have been alerted to check for such trucks from Kerala as there are many entry points from Kerala to Kanyakumari district.
 
 On the other hand, revenue officials, local bodies and health authorities are also studying the possibility of safe disposal of the tonnes of wastes from Kerala that have been dumped in the district, as villagers have been complaining of foul smell and possible health hazards.
