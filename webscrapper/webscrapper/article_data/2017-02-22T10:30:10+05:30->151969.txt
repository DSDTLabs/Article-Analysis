LUCKNOW: Burglars swept clean a house in Indiranagar while the family was away on a break. After stealing jewellery, cash and other valuables, miscreants also finished a bottle of scotch whisky before leaving. 

 On Tuesday noon, retired engineer I M Lal returned to the city along with his wife and daughter from Mumbai after a gap of two months. The family stays in sector 19 of Indiranagar.
 
 One of the entrance doors was open and the lock was lying on the floor. Then they saw the bedroom had been ransacked. Hinting at the involvement of at least three people, an 80-kg almirah was found upside down while the second one had been broken open with the help of an iron rod.
 
 Working leisurely, burglars smashed down the locked wooden cupboards. "As blood stains have been found on the spot, we feel one of the miscreants was injured," said   officer Dinesh Puri. The family was busy jotting down the list of items which had been stolen to submit their complaint to police.
