PATNA: The Adhikar rally of CPI (ML) here on Sunday would highlight the “growing repression unleashed on common people” by the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre and the grand alliance government headed by CM   in Bihar. Close relatives of victims of “atrocities” would also address the rally.

 The CPI (ML) has sent invites to the other five Left parties to participate in the rally. Invitations have also been sent to socialists, organisers of progressive social movements and intellectuals. The rally would be held on the Veterinary College ground here.
 
 “The key speaker at the rally would be CPI (ML) general secretary  , who on Friday concluded his party’s week-long ‘Adhikar Yatra’. The ‘yatra’ had passed through 14 districts,” CPI (ML) state secretary Kunal said on Saturday.
 
 Others like JNU students’ union general secretary Rama Naga, Fatima Nafis, mother of traceless JNU student Najib, All India Progressive Women’s Association national secretary Kavita Krishnan and  , mother of the Dalit girl student   who was gang raped and killed in a Vaishali school hostel would also address the rally.
 
 The CPI (ML) functionaries said that there was palpable anger among people due to adverse impact of demonetisation. Similarly, the party felt that the state government had failed to prevent bootlegging in the state.
