MUMBAI: A committee set up by the   has recommended suspension of four officials who were responsible for irregularities and corruption in chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’ pet project   (water conservation scheme).

 Following the allegations of corruption, water conservation minister Ram Shinde had ordered an inquiry into the issue. 
 
 “Ratnagiri collector Pradeep Prabhakar had set up a committee which visited and inspected a few areas in Nilavane in Khed and some areas in Dapoli taluka. The committee found that in Dapoli, funds had been transferred to the account of deputy divisional agriculture officer but not paid to the contractor, while in Nilavane, payment was made to the contractor despite the work being of substandard quality,” said Ravindra Waikar, guardian minister of Ratnagiri district. 
 
 The committee, in its report, has recommended that agriculture assistant Pandurang Duble, agriculture supervisor Prakash Goriwale and two other officials—Gulabsing Vasave and Suresh Kamble—be suspended. On the basis of the inquiry report, Prabhakar has recommended the joint director of agriculture department to take action against the four officials.
 
 Last week, Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray had questioned the difference between the scam-riddled irrigation projects of the previous government and Fadnavis’ Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan. He had asked if there was corruption in the CM’s pet project as well. Recently, senior Shiv Sena environment Ramdas Kadam’s son Yogesh, who is Yuva Sena office-bearer, had alleged that there was Rs 10 crore corruption in the scheme in Konkan region. He alleged that bills were cleared despite no work being done on the the ground.
