PATNA:   chief Mohan Bhagwat would participate in the ‘millennium yagna’ at Chandwa, about 3km from Bhojpur district headquarters town Ara, on October 4 (Wednesday). The yagna is being held in the memory of Vaishnavite seer and theologian Ramanujacharya (1017AD-1137AD), who wrote ‘bhashya’ (commentary) on Brahma Sutras and the Bhagwad Gita. 

 Bhagwat would also open the ‘sangh’ office at Ramnagar near Chandwa and return to Delhi the same day. 
 
 “The state BJP MLAs and MLCs are not duty bound nor have they been asked to accompany Bhagwat. They would be part of his entourage in their separate vehicles,” said a party source, adding that state road construction department minister Nand Kishore Yadav would be part of Bhagwat’s entourage. 
 
 When contacted, Yadav said the yagna is neither the function of RSS nor BJP nor any of its affiliates. “It has been organized by the local monastic heads. The scale of celebration is big. Besides, it is a national programme. Lakhs of saints and seers, devotees and other interested persons from across the country are coming to Chandwa,” Yadav said.
 
 He also said the function is open to all political parties. “Even chief minister Nitish Kumar will participate in the yagna,” he added.
