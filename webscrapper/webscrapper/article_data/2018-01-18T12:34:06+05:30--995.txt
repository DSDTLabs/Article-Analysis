MADURAI: Though the Pongal bird counting exercise this year has turned out to be not so thrilling for bird enthusiasts in the hinterland, it turned out to be a delight for a team of bird watchers in coastal  . They were able to watch Crab-plover, a migrant bird found usually along   coast, and record its presence after almost five years.

 The bird watchers, N   from Madurai, Dr M   from Salem and Govindarajan from Chennai, found a flock of more than 80 birds at Kurusadai islet near Mandapam during the Pongal bird counting held from January 14 to 16. Raveendran said that there was no major sighting of the bird — which true to its name feeds on crabs along the coastal areas — in   in the last five years. “The last sighting was at Pulicat Lake in Thiruvallur district five years ago. This year a flock of 40 plus Crab-plovers was spotted in Kutch belt in  . Now we have spotted a larger flock of 80 plus birds”, he said.
 
 During Pongal bird counting, Raveendran along with his team concentrated on Ramanathapuram district which has five bird sanctuaries, namely Melaselvanur, Keelaselvanur, Kanchirankulam, Sakkarakottai and Theerthangal. “We have decided to take out bird counting along mangroves this year after forest department asked us to concentrate on that area, and the results were rewarding”, Raveendran added.
 
 The team covered mangrove forests around Kurusadai islet and Karangadu area near   in Ramanathapuram district. Other areas like Dhanushkodi, Arichalmunai and Valinokkam were also covered, where they spotted a lot of terns and gulls.
 
 However, as reported, the team felt that avian activity was comparatively lesser in the area for the season. There were not many birds in these five sanctuaries either. Even the flamingoes which used to flock Rameswaram Island after November were found less in number. Around 1,000 birds were seen at Valinokkam, which is very less when compared to hundreds flocking Ramanathapuram coastline, they said.
