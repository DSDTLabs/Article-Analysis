NAGPUR: A 60-year-old woman has accused her son (32) and his married girlfriend of stealing 160 gram gold valuables and Rs3.50lakh cash, totally worth Rs7.10lakh, from her hand bag. The theft took place at her residence on the second floor of   at Mangalwari, Sadar, some time between April 1 and May 20.

 Nutan Tiwari, who separated from her husband a few years back, informed Sadar police she heard a telephonic conversation of her son Prem with his paramour  , a resident of RP Nagar. Prem was alerting Anjali that Nutan had decided to approach the cops to lodge a FIR. Cops, after registering offence of theft against the duo, rounded up Prem for questioning and plan to bring Anjali too in for the same.
 
 Prem and Anjali, both unemployed, have filed divorce cases against her respective spouses around a year back, and have been in a romantic relationship since the last six months, said cops. Nutan owns a shop in   and runs her house on the rent. Her elder son shifted to the   a long time back. She was staying with Prem, who used to bring Anjali to her place many times, cops said.
 
 Nutan said she had kept her bag in the bedroom and didnâ€™t check it between April 1 and May 20. She first realized that Rs50,000 cash was missing from her bag. She asked Prem about it, but he ignored her. Later, on May 20, she again opened her bag while searching for her passport and was stunned to see all the valuables and cash had been stolen, so she filed a complaint.
