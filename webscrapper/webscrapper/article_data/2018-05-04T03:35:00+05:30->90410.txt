Panaji: In a month’s time, the process to get divergence, residence and caste certificates from both the district collectors could be simpler with the state   ministry deciding to do away with the requirement for talathis to certify documents and applications. 

 After an interactive public grievance meeting at the North Goa collectorate, revenue minister Rohan Khaunte said individuals whose documents were in order would not need   from a  .
 
 “One of the additional reforms that we are looking at is the role of the talathis. Very often the process to obtain certificates takes time. Over the next one month we will do away with the need for talathi’s role in the certification process,” Khaunte said.
 
 The minister said due to the verification and attestation process, the burden on the talathis is overwhelming and they often found it difficult to complete their other tasks. “The roles and responsibilities of the talathi have been identified in the department. But there are a lot of priorities that are at kept aside or other things have taken precedence,” Khaunte said.
 
 North Goa   Nila Mohanan and other officials were present for the meeting. 
 
 “Citizens who have got their proper documents will be allowed to self-attest those documents. This is as per the central government guidelines. The initiative will help the common man get his task processed faster,” Khaunte said.
 
 He said over the next four to five months, common service centres (CSC) for citizens would come up in each taluka. “Locations have been identified for the CSCs. After 30 days of its opening, we will view the operations of the CSC,” Khaunte said.
 
 The first CSC will come up in Margao by the end of May. It will be an interactive platform for availing all government services from various government departments under one roof, he said.
 
 Once all the towns are covered, CSCs will be set up in villages. The services will be free of cost, the minister said.
