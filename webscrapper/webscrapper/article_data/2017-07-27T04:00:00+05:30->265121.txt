Ahmedabad: The district collector office ordered all primary, secondary and higher secondary schools and colleges in the city to stay closed on Thursday in the wake of incessant rains. Heavy rains continued to lash the city late on Wednesday night leading to waterlogging in many areas. 

 “All schools and colleges in the city have been ordered closed due to heavy rains in Ahmedabad”, district collector Avantika Singh Aulakh said. 
 
 Schools in rural areas which have remained closed since past few days will be re-opened. However, schools in affected areas will continue to be closed, said the collector. 
 
 Meanwhile, despite orders from the district education officer (DEO) and district primary education officer (DPEO) Ahmedabad, many schools were found open on Wednesday. Official sources said these schools will soon be sent a show-cause.
 
 M M Rajyaguru, DEO-Ahmedabad, said that steps will be taken against school authorities who had ignored orders and remained open on Wednesday.
 
 However, principals of the schools clarified that they were not aware of the orders of the DEO and DEPO. The officials at DEO and DPEO offices stated that principals will have the prerogative of keeping schools open on Thursday. If heavy rains continue, then the schools can be shut, said the officials.
