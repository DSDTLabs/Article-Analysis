 Ali did not go to work on Monday and stayed home, said his landlord who was questioned by police. He left with some acquaintances in the evening to look for a shop as he wanted to start his own clinic. ASP, trans-Gomti,   said that it appears that Ali was attacked while he was riding the bike. 
 
 The doctors who conducted the autopsy stated that the victim was attacked with some sharp weapon. "The kind of cut in his wound is not detected when victim resists the attack. It suggests that Ali was attacked by someone who was riding pillion on his bike. Ali had a property dispute in Gonda and his rivals' involvement in the murder was also possible," said ASP Kumar.
 
 The doctors' association staged a protest and demanded immediate arrest of Ali's killers.
