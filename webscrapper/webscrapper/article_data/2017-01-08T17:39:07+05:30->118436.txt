PATNA: A joint team of   and special task force (STF) seized a truck carrying 469 cartons of   (IMFL) worth around Rs70 lakh from village Fatehpur under Deedarganj police station area in the district on Saturday. The truck was parked on the Patna-Gaya state highway.

 This is the third major seizure of smuggled liquor consignment in Patna. Earlier, excise officials had seized 1,100 cartons containing 10,500 litres of IMFL worth Rs1.5 crore from a locked godown in Fatuha industrial area on October 22 last year. It was the biggest seizure of liquor in the state since enforcing prohibition on April 5 last year. Later, Patna police seized 500 cartons of IMFL from the same area on October 29.
 
 The liquor seized on Saturday was manufactured and for sale in Punjab only. It was smuggled to Bihar via Jharkhand.
 
 Deedarganj police station   said truck driver Sarvesh Kumar (32) of Khurauna in Jaunpur district of   had been arrested. “The driver is being interrogated to get further details,” he said.
 
 The sources said the truck was taken to Jharkhand from Punjab and was then directed to Bihar. “Liquor smugglers have changed their tactics. Instead of directly smuggling big IMFL consignment from Haryana and Punjab into Bihar, they take trucks to Jharkhand first before coming to Bihar,” said a senior police officer, adding that the smugglers change vehicles to mislead the police.
 
 He said the consignment reached Patna on Thursday itself, but the smugglers were looking for a perfect timing to unload and distribute the liquor bottles among the retail distributors. 
 
 “Four smugglers from Jharkhand have reportedly sent the consignment to Bihar. Three suppliers of Haryana have also been identified. They will be arrested after further investigation,” the officer added.
