VISAKHAPATNAM: A 23-year old   posted in Kolkata was booked for   and other stringent IPC sections by Andhra Pradesh police after a minor girl with whom he had a sexual relationship in his native village became pregnant. The jawan is on the run after Vizag cops slapped cases against him.

 The jawan, Jonnapalli Jagannadham, is a Telugu native and resident of Gavaravaram in Chodavaram mandal of Vizag district.
 
 
 
 
 The 17-year-old girl, an Intermediate student, is the jawan’s neighbour, said Visakha (rural) SP Rahul Dev Sharma. “The jawan developed intimacy with the girl when he came to Vizag on leave in November and had a physical relationship with her,” said Sharma. Jagannadham also threatened her not to reveal their relationship, police said.
 
 After the girl took ill, she was taken to hospital and doctors said she was six months pregnant. The girl’s parents proposed marriage, but the jawan and his parents turned down the offer.
 
 On Wednesday, the victim lodged a complaint with Chodavaram police, who then booked Jagannadham under Sections 376, 417, 420 and 506 read with 34 of IPC and Section 6 of the POCSO Act. The matter came to light on Friday.
 
 Anakapalli sub-division DSP K V Ramana, who is the investigating officer, told TOI: “The accused and victim belong to the same community. We are speaking to   authorities to track posting details of Jagannadham and arrest him.”
