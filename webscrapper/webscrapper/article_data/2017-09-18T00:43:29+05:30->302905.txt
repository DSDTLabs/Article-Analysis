Trichy: Late chief minister J Jayalalithaa opposed Navodaya schools and hence did not allow them in the state while she was alive, said AIADMK leader and Lok Sabha deputy speaker M Thambidurai at a function here on Sunday. He also stated that his party would strive hard to shift education to the state list from concurrent list.

 “The late leader opposed the Navodaya system to be established in Tamil Nadu. She lent her voice to shifting education to the state list from the concurrent list at the chief minister's conference held in Delhi in July 2016. We are also keen on sticking to the same line and would strive hard to shift the same from concurrent list to state list,” he added.
 
 “It is impossible to upgrade the quality of education just by opening Navodaya schools. So, the Tamil Nadu government is finding all means to upgrade the present quality of education. It would be better for the union government to channelise the funds to the State,” he said.
 
 When asked about his removal as the party propaganda secretary by TTV Dhinakaran, he said that he did not know anything about that. State transport minister M R Vijayabhaskar and Krishnarayapuram MLA M Geetha Manivannan were also present.
 
 After attending the Periyar E V Ramasamy's birth anniversary function held at Karur, he told reporters, “The late leader MG Ramachandran floated AIADMK based on the policies charted out by great leaders Thanthai Periyar and former chief minister Annadurai. Late chief minister Jayalalithaa travelled in the footsteps of MGR, so is Edappadi K Palaniswami government. His government would complete its full term.”
 
 “As per the wishes of Jayalalithaa, AIADMK will definitely rule the State for 100 more years. That is the wishes of each and every cadre of the party. That is why not even a single cadre opted any other party, all are remaining united,” he added.
