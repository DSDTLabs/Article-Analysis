CHANDIGARH: Two drug addicts sitting on a wall at Manimajra’s Modern Housing Complex two days ago threw stones at resident R N   when he objected and told them to leave. He went to the police beat box to report it, but was told to revisit. “On second visit,” he says, “the cops asked me to dial 100.”

 
 
 The police personnel at100 kept him on hold for a while and then assured him that somebody will respond. Uppal did receive a call, later, from 100 but he says: “No action has been taken against those two boys.” He took the complaint to the station house officer concerned during his interaction with the residents of the   here on Sunday. Modern Housing Complex resident welfare association (RWA) president Colonel   said the purpose of the interaction was to raise issues related to traffic and security.
 
 SHO   promised to boost patrolling in the area to bring the drug activities under control in Manimajra. On the suggestion of another resident, Naveen Bajaj, for letting the locals render voluntary service to police, the SHO said that the RWA should provide him with the list of volunteers and he would place it before the higher authorities for approval.
 
 RWA general secretary S A   told the police officer that drug addicts and antisocial elements assembled in the disused garages of the area, which the cops should check. “The miscreants sit there all day, and eve-teasing and snatching have increased in that area,” he said. The police officer asked the RWA to sensitise the residents about parking correctly in the residential area in order to avoid traffic congestions that happens because of wrong parking. He asked the housing societies to hire more security guards for the assistance of police during night patrol.
