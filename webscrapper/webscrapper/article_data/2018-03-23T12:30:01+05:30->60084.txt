HYDERABAD: In a major relief to those from Telangana and the rest of the country seeking jobs in the   ( ), the Union ministry of external affairs (MEA) has announced that the Certificate of Good Conduct ( ) will no longer be required and they can instead submit a ‘Police Clearance Certificate’ (PCC) issued by the concerned Regional Passport Offices (RPOs).

 So far, for getting a visa, anyone looking for a job in the UAE had to submit the CGC, which is issued by the respective state government. According to MEA sources, securing the CGC was a lengthy process and in comparison, securing a PCC from the regional RPO is much easier.
 
 This was clinched during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to UAE in February this year. According to the new norm, the PCC will be treated as a CGC. In the normal course of things, a PCC can be obtained in three to four working days. According to MEA sources, who were present at an interactive session organised by the Telangana RPO here along with MEA personnel and regional media as part of an outreach programme, UAE will be introducing the new norm in the next three to four weeks and other   countries may follow suit if discussions of the MEA bear fruit.
