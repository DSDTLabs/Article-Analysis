In a steep escalation of tension between India and Pakistan on Friday, just a day ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to   and Kashmir, five Indians, including a BSF jawan, and seven Pakistanis were killed on both sides of the international border. 

 While four civilians and a BSF jawan were killed and 12 others injured in Pakistani mortar shelling on villages in R S Pura and Arnia sectors along the border in Jammu region, four Pakistanis were killed in retaliatory fire on Friday. Separately, three Pakistani infiltrators were killed by Indian security forces in north Kashmir, two days after the Centre's unilateral ceasefire against terrorists in Kashmir for Ramzan came into effect.
 
 BSF inspector general of Jammu frontier, Ram Avtar, said the situation along the border is "tense" and his troops caused heavy damage to Pakistan in retaliation. "Pakistan targeting civilians is not new but we are prepared and giving them a strong, befitting and appropriate response," Avtar told media on the sidelines of a wreath-laying ceremony for BSF constable Sita Ram Upadhyay, who was killed in Arnia sector in Pakistani shelling.
 
 The Pakistan army's media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), claimed that four people, including three children, were killed while 10 others injured in "unprovoked ceasefire violations" by India in Pukhlian, Cahprar, Harpal, Charwah and Shakargarh sectors on their side.
 
 However, BSF sources said Pakistani Rangers resorted to heavy firing and mortar shelling in civilian areas of Arnia, R S Pura and Bishnah sectors of Jammu district around 1am on Friday. "More than 15 border outposts and an equal number of villages are affected by the shelling, sources said. "The BSF troops guarding the border retaliated and the exchange of fire is still on," an official said.
