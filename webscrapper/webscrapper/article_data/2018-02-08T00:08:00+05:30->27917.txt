CHENNAI: Two Central Industrial Security Force ( ) women personnel, a police constable attached to the Chennai police and a pedestrian were injured when the police van in which they were travelling hit a median and overturned near Washermenpet on Tuesday night.

 Police said the two women police personnel were on their way to the Madras high court to assume charge of its security. Karthik, the constable, was driving the van.
 
 Police said when the vehicle reached Suryanarayana Street, Karthik tried to swerve the van and avoid hitting a man who was running across the road. The constable lost control of the van and hit the median. The pedestrian, Raja of Chezian Nagar near Washermenpet, was, however, hit by the van.
 
 Passers-by and shopkeepers rescued the four and took them to Stanley Medical College. While the two CISF personnel escaped with minor injuries, Karthik is undergoing treatment. Raja, who sustained head injuries, is in the ICU, said police.
 
 “It was not a pedestrian crossing and Raja wanted to cross the road through the gap between two medians,” said a police officer.
