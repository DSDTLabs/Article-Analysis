NAGPUR: It’s been three days but the fire at Bhandewadi dumping yard refuses to die down. Till now, around 2.16 lakh litres of water has been used to douse the fire, a quantity that could have been enough for a day’s use by 1600 people.

 The fire broke on Tuesday around 9.45am and since then, fire tenders of NMC’s fire and emergency services department have completed over 50 trips. “We carried out operations till 1.30am and resumed it again early Thursday morning,” firefighters said.
 
 Since last two days, two fire tenders have been deployed at the spot. “It takes about half an hour to complete each trip. There is a shortage of fire tenders,” said founder of Green Vigil   after a spot visit. Though officials from fire department said 75% of the fire has been extinguished, Chatterjee said there were fresh outbreaks. “In front of our eyes, a burning plastic wrapper came flying and landed on the garbage. It immediately caught fire,” he added. 
 
 Another problem is non-availability of water from a nearby source. “We tried connecting a pump with the Sewage Treatment Plant. But as the water is in motion, we are unable to draw it,” said an official from fire department.
 
 Members of   have proposed an alternative to NMC. “The treated sewage from the NMC’s 80 million litres per day Sewage Treatment Plant is being discharged nearby. Its pipeline flows through the dumping yard. There is a chamber inside the yard and if the treated sewage is blocked using an iron plate. it can be pumped up to douse the fire. Better to use treated sewage than drinking water to douse fire,” said Chatterjee. 
 
 As the fire is not on the surface, the firefighters are using excavators to first dig-out the solid waste and then spraying it with water.
 
 Fire has already destroyed two windrows and a part of scientific landfill site.
