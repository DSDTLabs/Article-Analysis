JALANDHAR: The trend of putting up congratulatory hoardings and posters by supporters of political parties became an embarrassment for Aam Aadmi Party. A man whose picture figured in one such poster of AAP was arrested by Jalandhar police on Wednesday with 100 grams of “narcotic powder” and 54 capsules of a psychotropic drug. AAP has said the man was never involved in campaigning for it and the poster had been put up by a volunteer. 

 Qazi Mandi resident   was arrested after a trap was laid with the help of a decoy customer. He was later sent to jail.   (central)   said they had received a tip off about Sonu’s activities and then arrested him red handed while selling the capsules. 
 
 Later, it came out that Sonu and his father Amar Singh’s picture had figured on AAP posters put in the area to congratulate people on New Year’s and Lohri. AAP chief   and the party’s Jalandhar Central candidate Dr Sanjiv Sharma’s pictures were also there. These posters had several other faces also.
 
 When contacted, AAP Jalandhar zone in charge   said while he could not be sure if Sonu had ever become a member of the party on his own, he was never seen actively working for the party. “Practically, he has nothing to do with the party and never worked for it. The poster was neither issued for the party nor by the candidate. A volunteer of the area apparently put up Sonu’s picture in the poster along with other residents of the area. I checked with Dr Sharma also. He has confirmed that he was not campaigning for the party,” he said.
