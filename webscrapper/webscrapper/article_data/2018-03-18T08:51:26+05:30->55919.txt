MARGAO: Town and country planning ( ) minister Vijai  , on Saturday said Siridao and Pilar are not a part of the proposed outline development plan (ODP) of the newly constituted   (GPPDA). “I have received a letter from   MLA Antonio ‘Tony’ Fernandes requesting that St Cruz be included in the   for planned development. He also spoke in the assembly on this. Similarly, St Andre MLA Francis Silveira, along with the sarpanchas, supported it. But after public pressure, they backed out. The sarpanchas have submitted memoranda and we will reconsider the decision,” he said.

 “I will consider genuine grievances at the TCP board meeting on Monday and try to find a solution, Sardesai said, adding, “I cannot take a decision as it is the board constituted by the PDA that does so. There is no political motive but as a minister I am responsible to the people.” NN
