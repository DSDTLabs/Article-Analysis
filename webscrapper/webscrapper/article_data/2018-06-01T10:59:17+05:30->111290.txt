GREATER NOIDA: With the improving standards of Indian coaches it’s just a matter of some years when local hoopsters will be playing alongside the World’s best basketball players in the  .

 
 President of the   and the director of Basketball without Border (BWB) Asia camp   said here at the   in Greater Noida on the sidelines of the four-day camp. He said “There will soon be a time where many Indian players will make it to the NBA. I think it’s a matter of growth, and it is happening.”
 
 Praising the Indian coaches, Hunt added these young trainers are getting better and this will help the game grow and eventually the players will reach the destination. “Basketball coaches in India are getting better. As the game expands there knowledge and understanding is getting better which is a good and positive sign,” the Australian said.
 
 Giving an example of NBA’s initiative in Australia, Hunt added, “Around 15 years ago, there was only one Australian in the NBA. Then with the initiative of all concerned the game grew in   and the coaches became better and now we can see nine or ten players in the NBA. This, I think is the same with India. Like Australia, players from India have to be patient and eventually we can see many of them in the NBA.”
 
 On what the basics the coaches are required to do, Hunt said, “We need to make sure the Indian coaches teach the kids to follow man-to-man defence at a very young age. That’s the most important thing these coaches should do and the result will be there to be seen.”
 
 On the 10th and India’s second BWB Asia Camp, Hunt said, “I think camps like these will help to improve the sport in several ways. The players will be exposed to the top level coaching and they will receive the guidance on the things to work on and things they do well at the end of the camp.”
