GANDHINAGAR: Students of   will have to take just two extra examinations, and by clearing them they can have certificates equivalent to matriculation or the higher secondary, said Union minister for state for Skill Development & Entrepreneurship,  .

 Speaking at a seminar on ‘Skilling & Human Capital’ at the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit on Thursday, Rudy said that the Centre has started a small bridge course exam to make 2.3 million   students have certificates equivalent to matriculation and higher secondary. There will be two more courses or subjects that these students would have to clear, and they do not have to roam around for certificates to qualify for further studies.
 
 Taking a dig at the concept of skill and education in India, Rudy said that those who run the system are ‘educated’ and they have strong bias against skill. “How can you run a system in which the aspiration of a child with skills is blocked, and he senses his future prospects are closed for ever?” asked Rudy.
 
 Explaining the need to bring in a certificate system, the minister said that millions of students who join ITI after class VIII and spend two years there, are not considered to have education equivalent to matriculation, and those who spend two years in ITI after clearing class X, are not considered to be equal to those who have passed higher secondary, and they cannot pursue their study further.
