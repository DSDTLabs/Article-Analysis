CHENNAI: The   ( ) has requested a reassessment of the runway bridge across   to extend the second runway after the ministry of environment and forests and climate change (MoEF&CC) said it was constructed in violation of the no objection certificate (NoC) given for the project.

 In November, a compliance report prepared by the ministry of environment and forests and climate change said the new terminals and the bridge for its second runway across the river were built in violation of environmental clearances. The measurements given to obtain the NoC was not followed, it added.
 
 A senior AAI official said, “We have asked for another inspection because the project has been completed and is being used for passenger services. Documents have been submitted and another round of inspection might be done to find out ways to resolve the issue.”
 
 The report said AAI deviated from the original dimensions of the bridge as approved by MoEF&CC. “In addition, the Adyar appears to fall within the   (CRZ). In view of this, CRZ classification of the area and status of land may be sought from the competent authority and an appropriate view taken.”
 
 AAI, rattled by the unexpected report on violations, has approached the ministry to find a solution.
 
 Residents and activists say the bridge should be demolished because it blocks the flow of the river, causing flooding in nearby Manapakkam. Also it has not served the purpose for which it was built: To handle widebody planes. AAI officials feel the environment ministry would not have allowed the project to proceed had there been violations. “We are not able to handle big planes because there is no land for safety buffer zone on the Manapakkam-end. We have asked for land. Trials have begun for simultaneous use of second and the main runway,” an official said.
 
 The second runway was extended from 2,300m to 3,400m by building the bridge across the river.
