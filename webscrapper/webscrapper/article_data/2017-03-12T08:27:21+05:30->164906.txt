PUNE: A day after the district administration decided to refuse permission for rain dance events at   parties, city clubs are in a fix. 

 With Holi just a day away and thousands of passes already sold, organisers are planning to seek permission from the Pune collector to use recycled water for rain dance.
 
 Officials from the collector's office, meanwhile, told TOI that they may consider this possibility. "We have told organizers to send an application to us if they wish to use recycled water and a decision on this will soon be taken," resident deputy collector Rajendra Muthe said. 
 
 The organiser of a Holi party in  , said, "We were planning to use sprinklers, which do not use much water. For about five hours, 3,000 litres for a five to eight square feet area is used. But since that option is now out, we would have to cover the entire area with a makeshift roof to keep the area cool." About 1,500 passes have been sold already, he said.
 
 He added that more water may be wasted as people will play with water at their homes since the option of rain dances are out.
 
 Jai Sharma, director of an event management company, said, "We have decent water storage capacity at the venue and recycling the water to be used in the rain dance is an option."
 
 Imran Mandal, director at  , recently applied to the collector for permission to use recycled water for a Holi pool party in a city-based resort.
