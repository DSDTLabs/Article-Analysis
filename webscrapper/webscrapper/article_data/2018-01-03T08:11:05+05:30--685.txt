LUCKNOW: Now you will have to buy a ticket for visiting   (JMP). While entry was free to  , touted to be UP's largest park spread across 376 acres in   extension, now the fee will be Rs 10 per day while children below 12 and senior citizens above 68 will be exempted. 

 When the project was launched on August 5, 2014, then SP government had decided to keep entry free but three years down the line,   realized that the crowd is constantly increasing in the park. The footfall on New Year was so high that LDA had to send out teams to control the crowd in the evening. And it often happens during festivals, vacations and weekends. During New Year, the daily crowd increases to a lakh. Even on regular days, JMP remains the biggest crowd-puller with around 8-10 thousand people visiting the park daily. 
 
 So besides keeping track of the footfall, LDA also wants to limit access to those who are genuine visitors of the park. Hence it has proposed charging visitors from this year. 
 
 An official said, "The proposal will soon be put before the committee supervising operation and maintenance of JMP for approval. The ticket value will be same as that of other LDA operated parks - which is revised to Rs 10 per day. Only children and senior citizens will be exempted from the fee." 
 
 LDA's board meeting on December 30 had proposed increasing ticket value for its other parks from Rs 5 to Rs 10. These include parks like Lohiya, Buddha, Smriti Upvan, Shanti Upvan (Aashiana), Begum Hazrat Mahal Park etc. JMP will also implement the same fee structure once ticketing starts. 
 
 LDA takes care of around 150 parks in the city of which most are colony parks on which tickets are not applicable. But there are around 8-10 parks where it charges for entry. These parks are generally open between 6am and 7-8 pm.
