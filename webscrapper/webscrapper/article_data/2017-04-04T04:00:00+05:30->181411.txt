Surat: Over 4,000 diamond traders at Mini Bazaar diamond market in Varachha have joined the stir against Gujarat government over the alleged inaction of police in recent rape and murder of a woman belonging to Patidar community at Mandvi in Bhavnagar and subsequent suicide of a witness in the case on Monday. 

 The diamond offices were shut and diamond traders stayed away from trading of diamonds, demanding justice for the family members of Patidar woman and the man who committed suicide. 
 
 The traders belonging to Mandvi gathered at Sardar Chowk at Mini Bazaar and took a round of the market, urging the traders to keep their offices shut to voice their anger over the development. Banners and posters have come up in Mini Bazaar criticizing the Gujarat government and the police for their inaction. Sources said the diamond market at Mini Bazaar has been observing a partial bandh since March 31. 
 
 A diamond trader belonging to Mandvi, Rakesh Mendpara, said, “Dhirubhai was the only witness in the rape and murder of Patidar woman in Mandvi. The witness committed suicide, but actually the story is different. We want the police to thoroughly investigate the suicide. The family members of Dhirubhai have threatened self-immolation.”
 
 Naresh Gajera said, “We are showing our solidarity towards the bereaved Patidar families in Mandvi by closing down our business. We are ready to bear losses, but we want justice for our community members.”
 
 Surat Diamond Association president Dinesh Navadiya said, “After demonetization, the industry had begun to recover. Therefore, closing down the trading activity is not the answer. The industry will have to bear heavy losses in the coming days, but we are with the people of Mandvi and the affected families.”
 
 Sources said the traders from Mandvi had contacted the traders in Mumbai and asked them to join their stir. The diamond market in Mumbai could remain shut on Tuesday.
