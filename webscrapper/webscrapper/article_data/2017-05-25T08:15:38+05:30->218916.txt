CHENNAI: Voluntarily in jail since April 3 in connection with a  , MDMK leader   was ordered to be released on bail by a Chennai sessions court on Wednesday.

 The 4th additional sessions court in Chennai granted Vaiko unconditional bail, with his own personal bond.
 
 Vaiko faced the case for his speech at the launch of his book ‘Nan Kutram Sattugiren’ (I accuse) in Chennai in 2009. Thousand Lights police had registered a case under Section 124(A) of IPC. 
 
 Since trial in the case could not commence, as the magistrate court had not completed the mandatory committal proceedings, wherein it formally hands over case bundles to the sessions court for trial, Vaiko appeared before the 14th metropolitan magistrate on April 3 and filed a surrender memo.
 
 After he declined to get released on bail on his own bond, the court remanded him in judicial custody.
