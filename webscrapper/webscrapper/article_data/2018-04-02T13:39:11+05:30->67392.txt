BENGALURU: The opposition   has brought out a 'chargesheet' against the ruling   government in   over various issues, including alleged failures on law and order front, atrocities against Dalits and women, farmers suicide, drug mafia among others.

 The other charges mentioned in it were killings of Hindutva activists and poor infrastructure in the city.
 
 Releasing three booklets, Union Minister for Law and Information and Technology,   said the Karnataka government has nothing to show to the public when it seeks votes from them for the May 12 Assembly elections.
 
 Speaking to reporters here yesterday, he noted, "Let me tell   that you have not even four-five outstanding areas of achievements which you can convey (to the public)... you go everywhere (portraying) a negative BJP and negative Yeddyurappa."
 
 The Union minister said the Congress was losing its base across India due to "mis-governance".
 
 "The record of the Congress is that it could not win a single seat in Tripura or a single seat in Nagaland - a traditional pro-Congress bastion for the last 70 years. "Congress could not perform in Nagaland and Meghalaya. Nagaland has 88 per cent Christian population," he said.
 
 On the other hand, BJP is in power in 15 states while its allies are chief ministers in seven states, Prasad said.
 
 State BJP chief B S Yeddyurappa said the Siddaramaiah government has pushed Karnataka behind by at least 20 years in terms of development due to "crumbling infrastructure" and "pathetic" law and order situation in the state.
