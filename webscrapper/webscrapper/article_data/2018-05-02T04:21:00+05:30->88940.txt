Vadodara: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) on Tuesday started receiving water for the Ajwa reservoir from a Narmada branch canal. The water was discharged from the canal after elected representatives from the city including VMC functionaries made representations to deputy chief minister Nitin Patel during his visit to the city on Monday. VMC functionaries had raised the issue with Patel stating that the water in the Ajwa reservoir was depleting consistently and the city would face difficult times if water from the canal was not released into the reservoir. The Rampura Narmada branch canal is located close to the reservoir. VMC officials said that on Tuesday water was released from a canal escape at the rate of 20 cubic feet per second (cusec). The canal escape, they said, had been made for discharging water from the canal to empty it for maintenance work or for maintaining its level. Sources said that the level of water in Ajwa reservoir was 204.8feet on Tuesday. It was depleting at a rate of 0.05feet every day. The walled city, eastern zone as well as parts of western zone of the city are heavily dependent on water supply from Ajwa reservoir.
