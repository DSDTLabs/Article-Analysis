 Sources said the heart lung machine had not been functional for some time at the institute. “The previous heart lung machine was an 18-year-old model. Due to this, the IGIC had stopped conducting open heart surgery. As a result, the government had stopped releasing money under the CM Medical Assistance Fund for open heart surgery at IGIC. The new machine has been procured and patients can avail the facility once again,” sources at the institute added.
