VISAKHAPATNAM: With   hardly a week away traders have taken the online route to sell trained roosters.

 Traders are targeting customers who desire to buy fighter roosters for cock fights, in East Godavari, Krishna, West Godavari, Guntur and Visakhapatnam.
 
 Demand for roosters is high during Sankranti. Traders have put two types of roosters for sale online. While one category is sold for its meat, the other category is meant for racing in cock fights.
 
 Demand for   meat is high on Kanuma, which is the day following Sankranti. People prepare all varieties of food items, sweets and non-veg dishes on Kanuma. The price of roosters meant for meat ranges from Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,500 each.
 
 On the other had, roosters meant for cock fights are fed cashews, almonds, millets, milk and even non-alcoholic wine to make them stronger, the sources said. 
 
 Each fighting rooster weighs around 2.5 kg to 3.5 kg. Variants are priced anywhere between Rs 2,000 and Rs 50,000. 
 
 Sources said the sale of roosters would go up to nearly Rs 45 lakh to Rs 50 lakh in the entire state and online portals would contribute nearly 15% to 20% to the sale.
 
 Based on the inputs from the online portals, traders fix the price of each rooster from Rs 2,500 to Rs 15,000 depending up on the size, nature, health and colour of the bird.
 
 For instance, a beige and black rooster is on sale online for Rs 9,000 from Nandampudi in Amalapuram, white and black rooster is going for Rs 15,000 in Guntur, white rooster Menaka for Rs 15,000 in Vijayawada, Parla Power rooster for Rs 15,000 in Bhimavaram, red and black rooster for Rs 12,000 in Machilipatnam, red and black rooster for Rs 6,000 in Peda Gantyada in Vizag, yellow and black rooster for Rs 2,500 from Simhachalam in Vizag and white and black Shamo rooster for Rs 7,500 at Vambay Colony in Rushikonda. 
 
 Online sale of roosters was introduced in 2014 and most of the online traders hail from the south coastal districts like Krishna, East Godavari, Visakhapatnam, West Godavari and Guntur. The biz picked up momentum this year after demonetisation, said a rooster trader from Simhachalam.
 
 Some of the popular rooster brands sold online for cock fights are Dega, Kodi Dega, Kaki Dega, Kaki Nemali, Kodi Kaki, Seetuva, Yerra Dega, Tella Nemali and Nemali Pingala.
 
 A regular rooster trader from Kurmannapalem said, “I sell nearly 10 to 15 roosters every Sankranti without posting ads online. This apart, I sell nearly 5 to 10 roosters by posting ads online. The response is good.” He sold roosters online priced between Rs 8,000 and Rs 10,000 earlier.
