TRICHY: Tension prevailed near the police commissioner’s office on the Trichy- Pudukottai highway, as more than 50 advocates staged a protest against the police on Tuesday for failing to act against two personnel who had allegedly manhandled an advocate on December 28, 2017. Due to the protest traffic came to a standstill on the stretch.

 It all began when two policemen, Kandasamy and Silver Stalin, attached to the Ariyamangalam police and advocate   picked up a quarrel, resulting in the alleged attack on the advocate near   stop on December 28.
 
 The advocate said that he had already submitted a petition to the commissioner of police A Amalraj insisting on filing an FIR against the two policemen for attacking him over a trivial issue. Since there was no action from the police, the advocates took to the streets on Tuesday.
 
 They blocked the entrance of the office of the commissioner of police. Prior to that, police closed the main gate after the advocates tried to enter the campus. Police also put up barricades nearly 50m before the gate to prevent the protesters from barging into the campus.
 
 Enraged by the denial to enter the campus and meet the commissioner, the advocates blocked the Trichy – Pudukottai highway. Police then pacified them and allowed the president of   advocate Panneerselvam and few others to meet the commissioner. 
 
 Only after an assurance was given by the police commissioner that necessary action would be taken against the policemen, the advocates withdrew their protest.
