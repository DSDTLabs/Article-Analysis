MANDYA: A   here between a woman and her elder daughter took an ugly turn when she accused the daughter and son-in-law of locking her inside the house with her younger daughter.

 Based on her complaint,   police lodged a case under IPC sections 342, 342 and 506 against the daughter and her husband. Ddistrict SP G Radhika has promised justice to the victim and her younger daughter with the help of the revenue department.
 
 On Sunday, Sunandamma and her younger daughter Ramya pleaded with locals to unlock the house door. Both stood at the window of the first floor of their duplex house and screamed for help. Locals alerted police who unlocked the door.
 
 Police said Sunandamma and Ramya were locked up inside on Saturday allegedly by elder daughter Githa and her husband Nagaraju. On Sunday, when Sunandamma and Ramya tried to come out, they found all doors locked from outside. On Monday morning, both victims were brought to the police station and a case was registered.
 
 Sunandamma’s husband Channegowda had built the house. Both the daughters were married. While Githa’s husband was a fruit vendor, Ramya continued to stay with her mother even after marriage. Githa and her husband wanted to sell the house, but Sunandamma opposed it.
 
 “The issue is civil in nature and we’ve registered a case,” the SP said.
