Bengaluru: Police are searching for the “mystery man”, who hurled a garland at AICC president Rahul Gandhi during his visit to Tumakuru on April 4, considering it as a security breach.

 Inspector General of Police (central range) B Dayananda said he had asked the Tumakuru SP to trace the person, learn about his background and the purpose of him throwing the garland.
 
 In a video that has gone viral, Rahul is seen travelling in an open bus waving out to people on the streets of Tumakuru. He was there to meet Shivakumara Swami of Siddaganga mutt, who turned 111 years on April 1. As the bus moved, a person whose face is not visible, threw a garland that landed exactly around the AICC president’s neck. A stunned Rahul looked around and quickly removed it. 
 
 The Special Protection Group has also asked the state police to trace the person.
