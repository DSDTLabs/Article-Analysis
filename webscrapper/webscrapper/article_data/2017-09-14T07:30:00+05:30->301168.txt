Chandigarh: City’s first multi-disciplinary college, which is set to come up in Manimajra has been stuck in the issue of land clearance from the UT administration. 

 According to sources, the college’s plan proposed by the higher education department on around a four-acre land in Manimajra was sent to the UT chief engineer department for a final nod. The proposal was sent last year to the UT chief engineer after getting the final nod from the state higher education council about the multi-disciplinary courses college in the month of May 2016. UT higher education liaison officer Bikram Rana said the proposal was sent to the UT chief engineer department but the approval is still awaited from the department.
 
 Sources said on September 16, 2017 Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) is going to have its meeting in which it is expected that the modalities of the college will be tabled and discussed by the members before finalising it. The members however await the land approval by the authorities.
 
 RUSA unanimously approved that college under multi-faculty category will be opened in Manimajra. 
 
 As per the proposal, the college would also impart skill and vocational-based education. 
 
 The task for working out the modalities for opening the proposed new college has already been given to Post Graduate Government College for Girls, Sector 42, Chandigarh.
