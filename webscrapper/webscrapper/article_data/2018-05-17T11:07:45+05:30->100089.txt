A delegation of Chandigarh Hindu Mahasabha submitted a representation to the   chief administrator for allowing provision of at least two small booths on the premises of each temple flowers and prayer items.
 
 President of the mahasabha BP   said in the absence of these provision, management committees/trusts of temples in the city created temporary counters for sale of flowers and other items, but the enforcement wing of estate office remove these temporary structures causing inconvenience to the devotees.
 
 He added that keeping in view religious sentiments, the delegation had requested the officials to give serious thought while planning a temple site and review for revision the existing zoning plan/control sheets of all existing temples in the city.
 
 The delegation also urged the administration for increasing floor area ratio (FAR). At present, the FAR for a religious site in Chandigarh is 0.5 ascompared to   and  , where it is 1.
