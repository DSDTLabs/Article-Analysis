'Har  ', an upcoming show on Life OK, revolves around a question that has challenged and haunted men for centuries — what do women think? As they say, auraton ko samajhna mushkil hi nahin, namumkin hai!
Actor-filmmaker   says, “No man can decode women. They say something, but mean something else. Of course, we poor men will be confused.”
 Parmeet Sethi, director-actor, agrees, “I have given up trying to understand my wife and what she wants. You see, God made man and gave him a powerful brain to rule over the other species. But when man got arrogant, God made woman. Since then, man’s brain is busy trying to understand women.”
 Noted author-columnist   jokingly adds, “Understanding women is the most complex thing in the world. No degree or formula can help us decode them. I have recently written a book in which I have interviewed 100 women. However, despite that, I feel I have a long way to go in understanding women.”
 Well, on today’s television, which is ruled by saas-bahu shows, it’ll be refreshing to see someone thinking about men.
