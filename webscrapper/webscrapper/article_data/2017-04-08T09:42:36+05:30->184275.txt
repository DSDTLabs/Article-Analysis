PANAJI: While sparing Panjimites from an increase in house-tax, the Corporation of the City of   ( ) on Friday delivered a pinch in its budget for 2017-18, with a raise in sanitation tax for residents to Rs 500 per year from the existing Rs 365. The civic body’s finances continue to languish in the doldrums, with mayor   announcing a deficit of Rs 5.67 crores.

 CCP has also increased the license renewal fees for hand carts from the existing Rs 1000 to Rs 2000 per year. The sanitation tax for hawkers has been increased from Rs 300 to Rs 500 per month. “Fees for renewal of mobile towers will see a uniform increase for all towers to Rs 1 lakh with a 10% increase every year,”   said.
 
 The issue of failure on part of the civic authorities to recover dues from various contractors rocked the meeting.
 
 For 2017-18, the civic body’s deficit shrank by 11.4% from the Rs 6.40 crore in 2016-17 with revenue income pegged at Rs 42.37 crore. Payment of salaries continues to account for a major chunk of CCP’s expenses at Rs 20.64 crore of the entire year’s expenditure. This does not include the Rs 5.12 crore CCP pays to daily wage workers and contract staff. Total expenditure for the year 2017-18 is estimated at Rs 48.04 crore.
 
 “The deficit has decreased a bit and Rs 9.11 crore is expected in the form of government grants which will wipe off the deficit,” Furtado, who presented the budget said.
 
 In 2017-18, CCP expects to realize Rs 15 crore through house tax while the revenue from construction licenses is estimated at Rs 5 crore.
