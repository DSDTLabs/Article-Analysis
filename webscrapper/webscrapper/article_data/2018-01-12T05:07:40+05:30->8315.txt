Actress Natalie   is reportedly in negotiations to replace Reese   as the lead in 'Pale Blue Dot', about a successful female astronaut.

  will now look to find Portman's male co-star, reports variety.com.
 
 Witherspoon had left the role in last November due to scheduling conflicts with season 2 of 'Big Little Lies'. However, she will continue to produce the project with Bruna Papandrea.
 
 It will be directed by 'Fargo' and 'Legion' creator Noah Hawley.
 
 Pale Blue Dota follows a successful female astronaut who, after coming back home from a mission in space, starts to unravel when confronted by her seemingly perfect American dream life. The film explores the theory that astronauts who spend long periods of time in space begin to lose their sense of reality when they return home.
