On his recent visit to the city, Jaipur boy  , who is currently playing the role of emperor Aurangzeb in  , looked upbeat, despite having lost 18kg due to health issues. The actor shared that he had to undergo a surgery for his stomach ulcers that left him with 18 stitches; but he has not let it come in the way of his shooting schedule, for which he often has to spend 12 hours at the sets.
 
  The actor, who was in the city to attend a friend's party, shared, “I believe in the saying, `the show must go on'. You can't say no to work. The show was already on air when I had to undergo the surgery , so I had no option but to resume shoot as soon as possible.“
  
  
 
  
  Last seen in The  , the actor ­ who has also been seen in films like Zubeidaa,   and   ­ was in severe pain due to which he was rushed to hospital in the last week of January .
  
  “It was a tough time and I was in lot of pain. But now I am back to work. In fact, I have been recuperating and working at the same time,“ said Rahul, adding, “Due to my health problems, I lost almost 18kg but it actually helped me pull off the character I am playing now ­ aged Aurangzeb. The current age of the emperor as portrayed on screen is almost 50 years more than my real age, so losing this weight actually helped me!“
