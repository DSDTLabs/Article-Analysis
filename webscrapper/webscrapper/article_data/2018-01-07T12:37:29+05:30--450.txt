Is Srijit losing his charm? With two heroines backing out of his   — first   Chakraborty and then   — I was worried about the director more than his film. Tonushree didn’t want to bare her back, but it’s a different story with Priyanka. The actress, who was also in Srijit’s  , had started prepping for the role of a courtesan by taking dance lessons. But when she asked for the script, there was none. With not many lines and limited screen time that mostly included a dance performance apart from one two scenes, Priyanka thought it wouldn’t do justice to the actor in her. She mostly did cameos last year and has decided to concentrate on full-blown roles in 2018. Sreenanda, the beautiful daughter of danseuse  , will now fill in for both and might even do a swell job.
