PANAJI: Five years after Manohar Parrikar approved grant-in-aid for Vikas Parishad’s   of Commerce, Economics and Management, the education ministry, which is headed by Parrikar, has moved to withdraw the  . The secretary of higher education, on July 5, issued a showcause notice to the chairman of the college saying that grant-in-aid to the college would add to the liabilities of the state government.

 The notice issued by the department, which has been signed by secretary of higher education  , suggests that continuation of the college would decrease the student intake at four other colleges that are in a 15-20 km radius of the college.
 
 Around 120 students from nearby villages are studying at the college.
 
 “Why does Parrikar want to close down an educational institution? Your government allows casinos, drugs, matka and prostitution. Is Mandre college a threat to the security of India?” Congressman  , who is the part of the college management, questioned.
 
 In July 2012, Parrikar had given approval for grant-in-aid to the college. While giving the approval, the finance department had said that care should be taken to ensure that no other college was operating in the vicinity of the Mandre college and that common courses should be avoided.
 
 However, the same approval was withdrawn in June 2013 and was subsequently challenged by the management of the college in a writ petition before the high court of Bombay at Goa. The court had granted relief and allowed the college to admit students to the institute.
 
 Just last year, the   had attempted to withdraw the affiliation granted to the college until a no-objection certificate (NOC) was issued by the state government.
 
 On April 2017, the HC had ordered that the Mandre College management be given an opportunity to present their views before the approval was withdrawn.
