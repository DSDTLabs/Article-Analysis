MORADABAD: Dozens of members of the Valmiki community took out a procession here on Saturday, carrying idols of Rama, Ganesha and other Hindu gods. They took the idols to the Ramganga and immersed them in the river in what they said was a symbolic farewell to Hinduism. 

 The Valmikis said that because of continuous atrocities against Dalits in the state, in places such as Saharanpur and elsewhere, more than 500 members of their community would be converting to Islam. The protesters also declared that they would re-build the Babri mosque in Ayodhya.
 
 Members of   led by the outfit's national president   shouted slogans against the ruling   and chief minister  , condemning his silence on the recent incidents of attacks on Dalits in western UP.
 
 The outfit's head, Dravid, said, "Incidents of attacks on Dalits have increased after Yogi Adityanath became UP CM . Dalits have been targeted in Saharanpur, Sambhal, Moradabad, Meerut and other parts of the state. The perpetrators of these attacks are being shielded by the state government."
