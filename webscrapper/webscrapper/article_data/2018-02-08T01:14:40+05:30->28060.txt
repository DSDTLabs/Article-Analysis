NEW DELHI: Warm conditions are likely to continue in the Capital for the next few days before light rain on Monday, due to a western disturbance, brings the   again. Delhi last saw rain on January 23.

 Delhi’s maximum temperature was recorded at 24.1 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, one notch above the normal for the season. The Safdarjung observatory, which is taken as the base for Delhi’s weather, recorded a minimum of 8.5 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal. Humidity oscillated between 23% and 83%, Met officials said. 
 
 Thursday’s forecast shows that the minimum may drop further, touching 7 degrees Celsius, while the maximum is likely to hover around 24 degrees.
 
 Officials from Regional Weather Forecasting Centre (RWFC) in Delhi said Monday’s rain might bring down the temperature by close to three degrees. “The light rain will send the temperature below normal once again. Before that, it will hover around 24 to 25 degrees Celsius, which is above normal,” said Kuldeep Shrivastav, scientist at RWFC.
 
 In terms of air quality, Wednesday was another relatively clean day with Air Quality Index, at 236, remaining in the lower half of the ‘poor’ category. An AQI above 300 is classified as ‘very poor’, according to   (CPCB). 
 
 The data available with CPCB’s central control room showed both PM2.5 and PM10 levels to be around two times the safe standard. The safe values for these components are 60 and 100 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively.
