GREATER NOIDA: Nearly 200  , who had gheraoed the collectorate on Saturday demanding the release of their 39 associates who were arrested for blocking a train in Bodaki and stalling work of Eastern Peripheral Expressway in Sirsa village, tried to meet the latter in jail on Sunday morning.

 While all the farmers wanted to meet those arrested, only three of them were allowed to meet them as per the jail manual. Later they returned to   where farmers are continuing with their indefinite sit-in.
 
 “We arrived at Luksar jail around 10am seeking a meeting with the fellow farmers who were arrested. At first, the jail officials dilly-dallied saying we could meet an hour after other people left. Later, they said we could only talk to them through the wire-mesh of the jail. However, despite waiting till around 1.30 pm, we were denied a special meeting and only three of us could meet our fellow farmers,” said Rann  , one of the farmers protesting against the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE).
 
 After waiting for over three hours, the rest of the farmers returned disappointed from the jail, he said.
 
 “We met the SDM, Sadar and the circle officer, Dadri, who said they could not allow a mass meeting with the ones confined,” Ait Singh, another farmer fighting for enhanced compensation, told TOI.
 
 SDM, Sadar, Anjani Kumar Singh, however, told TOI that the power to arrange a special mass meeting is only with the district magistrate or the deputy inspector general (DIG), Luksar Jail.
 
 “The jail manual allows for such a meeting only after a permission is sought from the DM or the DIG (Jail),” Singh told TOI. Farmers have now called a panchayat at Beel Akbarpur village on Monday where they will decide on the next strategy.
