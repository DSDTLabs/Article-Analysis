Panaji: Men in Asia tend to have worse health outcomes and a higher   rate than women because most public health policies focus on women, said  , a professor of global public health at University College London. She was speaking to TOI on the sidelines of the ‘Difficult Dialogues’ conference in Goa.   said men in less industrialised countries bear the biggest brunt of non-communicable illnesses.

 “Globally, there has been a shift from infectious diseases to chronic non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease, stroke, and lung diseases,” she said. “The rise is because of urbanisation and industrialisation, shift in pattern of consumption, people shifting their diet to more processed foods, and more meat-based foods.” 
 
 Hawkes said non-communicable diseases are, in large parts caused by behaviour such as smoking and drinking, habits mostly seen in men in Asia, while in more industrialised countries, the gender gap in smoking and drinking has decreased due to factors like more women entering the workforce. Hawkes said she wanted to see public health policies to be more equal in their focus on men as well as women’s health.
