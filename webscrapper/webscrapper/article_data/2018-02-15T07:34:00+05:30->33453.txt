Chandigarh: The cash-strapped Punjab government has accumulated a fuel bill of over Rs 8 crore in the past six months, but has not been able to pay it, and its officials now run the risk of being turned away at petrol pumps. 

 With petrol pump owners in the state getting impatient, there is a possibility that government officials could face a siuation similar to that in 2005 when petrol pumps in Chandigarh stopped fuel supplies due to non-payment of bills.
 
 Petrol pump owners have begun compiling data of outstanding bills and a meeting will be held shortly before deciding on the next course of action. Sandeep Sehgal, the president of Punjab Petrol Pump Dealers’ Association, said the issue was being taken up with district administrations for now. “Petrol pumps, too, operate on cash and credit basis. If the credit cycle is extended beyond three months, it becomes unviable. The issue has been taken up with government departments by district bodies of petrol dealers. One of the key defaulters of payments has been the police department,” added Sehgal.
 
 During the previous SAD-BJP regime too, petrol pumps had threatened to stop supplies to government departments in 2013, when the outstanding bills for six months crossed Rs 3 crore. The usual practice in the state is that drivers get petrol or diesel filled by signing a voucher at a petrol station. The owner of the petrol station then sends a bill and payment is made through cheque. Meanwhile, an official said that in some cases the payments could have been delayed due to delays in release of payments by treasuries or other local reasons. “The dues of the petrol pumps are always cleared and the payments could be stuck in some districts,” he said.
 
 Salaries late too
 
 This month, the salaries of senior government officials too were delayed. Some of them were paid as late as February 14. Sources said the government had taken a loan of Rs 600 crore to ensure that salaries were paid to all.
