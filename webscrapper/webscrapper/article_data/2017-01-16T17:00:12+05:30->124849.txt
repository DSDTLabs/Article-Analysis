NEW DELHI: Taking the ongoing power tussle between   and   for control over the Samajwadi Party (SP) one step further, the   chief minister's faction has now installed a plaque proclaiming him as the party's national president.

 It's interesting to note that the brand new nameplate at the SP's Lucknow office is placed right below an older one, which bears the name of party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav with the same designation.
 
  
  
 
 
 While Mulayam has repeatedly dismissed report of a rift between him and his son, it seems that Akhilesh's faction is keen to finalise the SP supremo's displacement as party president.
 
 Akhilesh was declared the SP's national president at a convention attended by the UP chief minister's loyalists as well as most MLAs and MLCs earlier this month. Mulayam Singh had called the action unconstitutional and refused to recognise his son Akhilesh's claim to the position.
 
 Since then, attempts at reconciliation were in vain. The two factions quickly staked claim over the 'cycle' symbol, which has gained crucial importance in light of the impending state assembly polls. 
 
 The   had asked Akhilesh and Mulayam for a show of majority, with both sides strongly arguing their case. After reserving its order last week, the Election Commission will likely give an interim order on the dispute today, with the option of freezing the cycle' symbol most likely to be exercised.
