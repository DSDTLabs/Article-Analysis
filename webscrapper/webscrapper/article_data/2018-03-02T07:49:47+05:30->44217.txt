AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education   (GSHSEB) on Thursday directed all state board affiliated schools to collect halls tickets of students of class X and XII and distribute the same to the students. 

 In fact, the board has threatened to take action against the schools which are playing truant and are holding the students at ransom, elevating their anxiety by not taking and distributing hall tickets. The board however refrained from specifying the exact penal action that the school managements will face for defying the order.
 
 The boardâ€™s threat came in wake of the call given Gujarat Self Financed School Management Association to boycott collecting and distributing them to students in protest of the state education minister   and and minister of state for home  's recent anti-private school statements.
 
  managements had taken offence to Jadeja saying that bootleggers, butchers and schools managements which were charging exhorbitant fee from parents have not voted for the   government during the assembly elections.
