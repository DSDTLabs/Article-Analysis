PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The   has demanded that panel 19 comprising Pimpri camp, Bhatnagar, Empire Estate, Anandnagar, Udyognagar and   and panel 21 Milindnagar, Jijamata hospital, Pimpri gaothan and Ashok theatre be declared sensitive for the civic election. 

 Rival NCP workers had attacked Vaibhav, son of Shiv Sena candidate Datta Waghire, on Tuesday. “The attack was pre-planned. The NCP is trying to influence the voters by taking up whitewashing, repairing drainage pipes and constructing compound walls in housing societies in the wards even though the residents have not sought it,” Waghire said.
 
 Shiv Sena’s Pimpri MLA Gautam Chabukswar said, “Panel 21 has a history of violence. A woman died in the run-up to the 2012 municipal elections. The police had sent 45 people behind the bars for two months due. Rival NCP workers have also attacked Datta Waghire twice in the past month. Maximum police should be deployed in these two panels.”
