Thane: Don’t be surprised if you see a postman knocking your door to   something you ordered online. In order to keep pace with the   and logistic business, the   unit of the postal department have sealed an arrangement with a string of e-marketing firms to hand-deliver their merchandise within a time-bound manner. The postal department has assigned two postmen and two vehicles for this. 

 Senior post master, Y N Mohammed said, “It’s just five days since we have begun this facility and the business is very good. We have been getting around a 100 packages every day from just these e-commerce industries. People are trusting us with their precious parcels and our aim is to deliver them to their doorstep as quickly as possible.” 
 
 This facility will not only be accessible to the residents of the lake city, but also to those living in the neighbouring suburbs of Kalwa and Mumbra. The postal department will be delivering goods through speed post and would charge a nominal amount for products weighing up to 35kgs.
 
 Moreover, it has also assured an increase in the postmen and delivery vehicles if the business goes well. With a vast network and deep reach in the remotest of villages, the postal department has proved its ability to reach even the remote places in the country. The entry of such a reputed player in the market is likely to change the dynamics in the online space where plenty of private logistics delivery companies exist.
 
 “I don’t think this is going to affect our business. If we continue to provide quick and speedy services without damaging the parcels we don’t have to worry,” says Shashi Maurya, from a tech-based logistics company in Mumbai.
