AURANGABAD: Defending their stand to invite former foreign secretary of India Nirupama   as chief guest for the forthcoming convocation, top authorities at Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar   University ( ) have asserted that no precedent mandates presence of only serving officials or leaders.

 Rubbishing fresh controversy over the choice of convocation guest, Bamu vice-chancellor B A Chopade cited a few examples of other state universities who had invited non-serving officials.
 
 “The most important fact is that former foreign secretary of India Nirupama Rao is an alumnus of our university and she has very great regards for her alma mater. Rao has credited her success in personal life to the formative years she spent on the university campus. We are indeed proud to invite such a student with illustrious background to address passing out students,” he said. 
 
 Rao, who completed her masters degree in English from Bamu in the early 70s, had visited her alma mater in June last year.
 
 Around 16,000 students are scheduled to get awarded with degrees, diplomas and Ph.Ds during the 57th convocation ceremony of Bamu, to be held on May 30. 
 
 The university has formed a total of 20 committees involving 120 staffers to ensure smooth conduct of affairs during the convocation ceremony. Sharing minute-to-minute programme of May 30 event, authorities said the mega function would be organised in well-planned manner. 
 
 Bamu has jurisdiction over Aurangabad, Jalna, Beed and   districts and students from these four districts of Marathwada are scheduled to attend the convocation.
