NEW DELHI: Four Test series, four double-hundreds and the new record of most runs in a home series for any batsman from any country. That is the kind of rich batting form India’s captain   is in. 

 On Friday, day two of the one-off Test match between India and   in Hyderabad, Kohli converted his overnight 111 into his fourth score of 200, making it the fourth series in a row that he has crossed the landmark. On the way to that double-century, the 28-year-old broke the record for most runs by a batsman in a home Test season, surpassing former team-mate Virender Sehwag’s mark of 1105 in 2004-05. He got out for 204 in the second session. 
 
  
  
 
 During India’s 2-1 win the West Indies last summer, he scored 200 in the first Test; against New Zealand at Indore, his 211 helped complete a 3-0 sweep; then in the fourth Test of the 4-0 win over England, Kohli stroked his way to an epic 235. And now comes this almost effortless innings. Previously,   and   had scored three double hundreds in three successive Test series.
 
 During this amazing run of form, when he hit that 211 against New Zealand, Kohli became the only Indian captain to score two Test double-centuries. 
 
 In nine Tests at home in the 2004-05 season, Sehwag scored heavily against Australia (299 runs in four Tests), South Africa ( 262 in two) and Pakistan (544 in three) for a total of 1105 runs at 69.06 with four centuries and three fifties. Kohli went past that when he got to 144 with his 19th boundary during the morning session on Friday. India have four Tests to play against Australia after this match is done, and Kohli looks set to go much further in his almost insatiable appetite for runs this season. 
 
 Incidentally, when he got to three figures on day one in Hyderabad, Kohli completed the cycle of having scored a century against all seven Test teams he has faced.
