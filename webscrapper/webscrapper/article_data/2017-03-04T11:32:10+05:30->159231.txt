NASHIK: With around three months since the new garbage collection system being implemented along with plying of new  , the   segregation system at the spot of collection is yet to be implemented.

 The health department of Nashik Municipal Corporation ( ) had a meeting with garbage contractors on Friday regarding waste segregation.
 
 According to the NMC, every garbage van has waste   system but since very few people segregate waste before handing it to the garbage vans both dry and wet waste gets mixed.
 
 The citizens, however, beg to differ. 
 
 Paramjit Singh, a resident of Panchavati, said, “Many a times empty garbage vans or vans with very less garbage are seen near our residence but I did not notice any compartments for segregated waste.”
 
 Rohini Kulkarni, a resident of Gangapur Road, reiterated the same. 
 
 “I asked the garbage van operators about it (waste segregation) and they asked me to hand it over to them,” said Kulkarni.
 
 “Most of the people do not segregate waste before handing it over to the garbage vans but those who do should have the option of segregation in the van,” she added.
 
 Vijay Dekate, health officer of NMC, said during the meeting with contractors he had asked them to segregate the waste completely in the next 3-4 months. Currently, the waste is segregated by the garbage collection employees and at the compost plant by the employees there.
 
 “People should also feel responsible and segregate waste before handing it over to the garbage vans. We have asked the garbage collectors to segregate the waste at the doorstep of people. Still if people do not feel ashamed and learn from this in the next 2-3 months then we will start imposing fines on them,” said municipal commissioner Abhishek Krishna.
 
 Agreeing that the contractors should be creating awareness among people about waste segregation, he said that all the citizens had been instructed to do the same for a better Nashik.
