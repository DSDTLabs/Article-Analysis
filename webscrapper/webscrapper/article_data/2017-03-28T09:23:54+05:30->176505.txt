NAGPUR: One of the   operators of NMC —   — has been fined by it for keeping its plant closed for over one year. 

 The plant had been kept closed as Hanjer was not finding any takers for its bio-organic fertilizer produced from garbage. The operator had challenged the fine before superintending engineer Dilip Jamgade but its appeal has been turned down.
 
 Jamgade said the health department had imposed a fine of Rs 1.64 crore on Hanjer for keeping its plant closed for 449 days between 2013 and 2015. “The fine was earlier imposed at Rs 25,000 per day and then Rs 50,000 per day,” he said.
 
 Hanjer chose to go in for dispute resolution as per the clauses of the agreement. Civic chief   ordered the panel comprising Jamgade, health (sanitation) officer and accounts officer to give a hearing to the operator. 
 
 The committee found Hanjer’s reply unsatisfactory and upheld the decision to impose the fine. The operator now has the option of appealing to additional commissioner against the committee’s decision.
 
 Hanjer’s performance has been questionable from the beginning. It was only treating 200 tonnes per day against installed capacity of 800 tonnes. 
 
 In spite of this NMC continued with the operator. It was not until a sharp rap from   (NGT) that the civic body decided to appoint another operator. 
 
 With no orders coming its way, the Hanjer was finding it difficult to run the bio-organic fertilizer plant. It got a lease of life recently when   and Fertilizers (RCF) placed an order for 125 tonnes of compost. 
 
 With an assured demand and revenue from RCF, NMC is hoping that it can operate the plant to full capacity. Hence, it has decide to continue with the company for another 5 years.
