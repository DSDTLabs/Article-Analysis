PANAJI: A child welfare committee will conduct a survey of 2,500 children in the state’s 67 childcare institutes to identify the ones who need to be repatriated, the government has told the high court of Bombay at Goa 

 The submission was made in response to a PIL filed by SCAN (Stop Child Abuse Now), a child welfare organisation. SCAN director   had told the court there are 2,500 children in around 67 homes. Provisions under Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, require that a child should be repatriated at the earliest and reunited with the family. 
 
 A division bench of justices N M   and  , asked the child welfare committee to file a report on the next date. 
 
 “If the child welfare committee in the meanwhile finds that any children who are identified need to be repatriated, it need not wait for this court to pass the order on the next date,” the bench said.
 
 The court also directed the government to take a decision on the proposal pending since 2015 about filling up the post of a probation officer.
 
 The petitioner had told the court that there is only one probation officer for the juvenile justice board for north and south Goa, and one for the child welfare committee. 
 
 The government has not been able to fill up the second vacant post.
 
 Advocate general   told the court that a proposal for creation of 15 posts has been sent to the government. The division bench subsequently posted the matter for hearing on June 12.
