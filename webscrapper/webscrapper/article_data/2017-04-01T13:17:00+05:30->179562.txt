  Collegians, who had fun during the entire educational year ignoring studies, are now turning their homes upside down to find their regular lucky charms. “I have a lucky pen. It’s been with me since my board exams and I never go to any paper without it,” says Manasi Pawar, a third year diploma student from  . “I never use this specific pen on a regular college day.

  Jatin Shekhawat, a second year commerce student from   will be wearing same shirt throughout his exams. “Usually, I am the best dressed guy in our group, but come exam and I become the simplest dresser. I repeat my lucky shirt for all the papers,” he adds.
 
  
 
 
  What is the best (and of course honest) way to ensure good marks in exam? One might say studying as much as possible. But you will be surprised to know that there are a few people who think studying too much before the exam will mess up with their brain function and they will go blank while writing paper. Supriya Aher, a third year BSc student from   says that she stops studying a couple of hours before exam. “Yes, that’s my exam ritual. I see many students who are studying till the last minute. I see them reading while walking, eating, and even when they are travelling to college. But it just increases your anxiety and sometimes, makes you forget what you have learned so far. So I don’t do that. That’s my way to stay focus,” she adds.
