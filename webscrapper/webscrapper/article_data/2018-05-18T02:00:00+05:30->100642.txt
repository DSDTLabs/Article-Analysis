PATNA: Days after collapse of a flyover under construction at Varanasi in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, the state government on Thursday constituted a team of 40 engineers to conduct a special five-day inspection of ongoing road, bridge and flyover projects from May 21 to May 25.

 State road construction department minister Nand Kishore Yadav said the engineers would also review the quality of materials being used in the ongoing projects. “The team will comprise chief engineers and other officials from road construction department. They will inspect 500 roads, bridges and flyovers which are under construction in the state,” Yadav said.
 
 The minister said the engineers would assess whether the projects fulfil the prescribed standards or not. “The load bearing capacity of roads should be enough to handle the flow of traffic,” he added.
 
 “A special online system has been introduced where the engineers can submit the status of the project. Once the inspection is completed, the engineers will submit hard copies of the reports and steps will be taken accordingly. For minor defects, contractors concerned will be asked to initiate corrective measures and raise the quality of work. However, if the defects are found to be major, the contactors concerned will be suspended from work,” the minister added.
