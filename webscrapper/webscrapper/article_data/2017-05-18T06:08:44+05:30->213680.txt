GUWAHATI:   has sent an alert across the state as well as to police in New Delhi and Chennai to be on the lookout for  , a state excise officer   in the   

 The alert was issued following Nath's alleged non-cooperation in the ongoing investigation by the agency. Rajesh Jalan, a liquor baron of the state, had in connivance with several government officials duped the state government of some Rs 25 crore of excise duty by submitting forged documents.
 
 Jalan and his associate Banti Gogoi have already been arrested in the case.
 
 Raunak Ali Hazarika, DIG (CID) said, "Nath has been continuously evading interrogation, fuelling strong suspicion against him and turning him into an absconding accused in the case."
 
 Sources said Nath was nowhere to be found. Though a leave application by Nath had mentioned that he could be reached at his city residence at Shantipur, he has been traceless. He is suspected to be somewhere in Delhi or Chennai as he had reportedly taken a leave on medical grounds.
 
 Despite repeated summons, Nath has not appeared before the investigating agency. "Many other officials summoned for quizzing have sought time to appear before the CID. However, they are reachable and informed the agency about their whereabouts but Nath has been absconding since the beginning," sources added.
 
 While the scam was estimated at about Rs 25 crore in the FIR, the investigation has so far revealed that it could turn into hundreds of crores.
