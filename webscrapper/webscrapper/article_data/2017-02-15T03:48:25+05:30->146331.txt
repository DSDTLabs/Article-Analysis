GURUGRAM: There is no evidence to support the allegation against the employees of Maruti’s Manesar plant of unlawful assembly with the common objective to kill or set the office on fire, claimed the lawyer representing the accused staffers of the company in court on Tuesday. 

 Pointing to loopholes in the investigation, senior advocate RS Cheema argued that the employees were falsely implicated in the case as there was no evidence to support their involvement.
 
 Cheema countered the prosecution’s charges in the court of additional district and sessions judge Rajendra Pal Goel, saying no evidence had been put on record to prove the workers’ involvement. He said the case was based on unlawful assembly with objective to kill. “Unlawful assembly needs to have common objective, which is missing in this case. There was no common objective to kill or set the office on fire. The evidence suggests the office caught fire after the incident and it wasn’t caused by the employees,” said Cheema, adding the medical report also suggested no one, except the deceased, sustained major injuries. 
 
 In the case, 148 workers of Maruti are being prosecuted for the July 18, 2012 violence in which Maruti’s GM (HR) Awanish Kumar Dev was burned to death in the violence at rhe plant.
