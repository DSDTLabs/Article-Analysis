PATNA: Altogether 3,839   were generated for interstate movement of goods during the two days since the launch of the e-way bill system in Bihar on Sunday.

 Existing taxpaying traders have to register themselves on the e-way bill portal for bill generation. Till March this year, 21,857 of the state’s 27,991 traders registered themselves on the portal. Another 1,010 traders registered themselves this month.
 
 Experts said the efficacy of the e-way bill generation system would be better tested in the next few days. Bihar Chamber of Commerce & Industries president   said the new system was expected to make things easier for traders applying for documents for movement of goods. “Earlier, the form concerned had 25 columns whereas the e-way bill has only nine columns to be filled up. The online registration system is also quite simple,” Agarwal said.
 
 He, however, added that he had interactions with quite a number of traders and they complained about certain issues related to the government server.
 
 Official sources, however, said there were GST helpline numbers (0612-2233512/13/14/15/16; 9199273130/9472457846 and 18003456102) to provide assistance related to the new system. “Most of the queries received on the helpline numbers on the first two days pertained to the procedure for online registration. There were also queries about the value of the products for which an interstate e-way bill has to be applied for and if the bills are necessary for inter as well as intrastate movement of goods,” an official told this reporter.
 
 Launched by deputy CM  , the system makes an e-way bill mandatory for interstate movement of goods worth more than Rs 50, 000. The e-way bill is generated free of cost through www.ewaybill.gov.in.
 
 The provision for e-way bill was introduced on February 1 this year. But the system was unable to bear the transaction load as several states started using the portal to generate intrastate bills along with interstate bills. Hence, the implementation of intrastate e-way bill system was put on hold. The platform has since been made more efficient and it can handle as many as 75 lakh applications per day.
 
 According to the official portal, the intrastate e-way bill system as of now has been introduced in   only. Intrastate e-way bill generation for Bihar will begin after April 15.
