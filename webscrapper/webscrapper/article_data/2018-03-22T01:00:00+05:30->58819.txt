Ten years have passed since   first made a mark in Bollywood. However, the singer-actor-television anchor feels that he has just begun. “I feel like I’ve just begun! Not because ‘time flies’ and ‘there’s so much to learn’, but because becoming a singer, actor and TV host was not part of the agenda before I took the leap of faith (he had studied to be a dentist).My lineage and looks made me feel like an outsider for years, but I guess, being the ‘different’ one turned out well for me. My command over the Hindi language was, of course, a big plus. I wish I was cast more often in acting roles that go beyond my ethnicity, but life has been very kind otherwise,” says Chang.

  About his upcoming projects, he adds, “I’ve just released the first in a trilogy of interconnected love songs with my buddy  . The response has been lovely and the next one, 'Rafta Rafta', is due on my channel on a video-sharing platform in April. Originals are lined up too, including a Bengali song with Lesle Lewis and a beautiful folk song with a talented new composer. I am excited for all of them!”
 
  Chang, who has also worked in two big-budget movies in the past, reveals that the kind of roles that come his way are mostly restricted to playing North-Eastern and Chinese characters. He shares, “I've played specifically North-East Indian and Chinese characters in my films ' ' and 'Detective Byomkesh Bakshy'. I can count on my fingers the instances when I’ve been offered non-oriental roles. Last year was a refreshing first though, when I landed a leading role in a web-series that had nothing to do with my ethnicity. I believe there is enough diversity in our industry and that it should be given a fair chance. Why not write more roles for ethnicities beyond the established norms?”
