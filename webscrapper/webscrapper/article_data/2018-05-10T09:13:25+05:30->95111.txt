CHENNAI:  , one of the stalwarts of   cricket, is set to retire from first-class cricket. Badrinath, who is currently doing commentary at the ongoing  , will make an official announcement once the tournament concludes at the end of this month. Badrinath had taken a break from the game last year but he made it clear that he wasn’t announcing his retirement.

 
 
 
 Badrinath has been playing non-stop cricket for over a decade-and-half. But, sources close to the player said that he has “lost the motivation to carry on” and that led him to take the call. 
 
 The right-hander, who played 14 seasons for Tamil Nadu, played for other states from 2014-17. While he led Vidarbha from 2014-16, the middle-order batsman played for Hyderabad in 2016-17. But his most successful years were with Tamil Nadu and performances for his home state helped him get the India cap as well. While he played two Tests, seven ODIs and one T20I for India, the right-hander will always be remembered as a  . He has 10245 runs under his belt with 32 hundreds and 45 fifties from 145 first-class outings at an impressive average of 54.49.
 
 The 37-year-old has a young family and he feels it is important to spend more time with his wife and kids. 
 
 “In the months that he was away from the game, he didn’t particularly miss it as a player. He kept himself busy with television commitments and seems to be enjoying his new innings as a commentator,” the source added. However, it is learnt that Badrinath has not ruled himself out from featuring in the third edition of the   (TNPL) in July.
 
 The cricketer won’t be taking up a coaching role either for the time being. “Badrinath is clear that he will only take up assignments which won’t keep him away from family for long,” added the source.
