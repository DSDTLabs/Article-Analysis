MARGAO: Kuddtorkars or Curtorkars (residents of   in Salcete taluka) are busy preparing for their annual two-day Carnival celebrations called ‘Festival of Curtorkars’.

 Businessman Peter ‘Pitu’ Dias will be Curtorim’s King Momo, who will stand atop the main float with a live band accompanying him. Till date, a total of 10 floats have confirmed their participation, although spot entries are being accepted.
 
 The float parade will be held in two categories – open and ‘Curtorim only’ with commercial floats being barred, said Curtorim cultural committee (CCC) organising secretary  . 
 
 This year is the CCC’s 11th anniversary. CCC has organised various talent search competitions such as ‘Voice of Curtorim’, ‘Dancing Stars of Curtorim’, ‘Comedy Kings of Curtorim’, besides drawing, singing, group dancing, jive dancing, ice-carving, vegetable-carving, and flower decoration contests which have attracted good responses with auditions being held two weeks prior to Carnival to shortlist the best participants.
 
 “While the department of art and culture provides financial assistance for the talent search competitions, the CCC generates funds through local donations and lotteries. We are grateful to our patron member and Curtorim MLA Alexio  , who has always been very supportive,” said CCC vice-president Wilson Luis. 
 
 Also present were CCC general secretary   and treasurer Aires Viegas.
