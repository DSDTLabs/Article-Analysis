Mumbai: Your city’s draft Development Plan (DP) 2034 will get delayed yet again. 

 During the civic general body meeting on Monday,  , the ruling party in the  , demanded a two-month   to approve the   2034, which was released last May. It was to be submitted to the state government by May 19, 2017, after an extension was sought in March. This is the third extension sought by the civic body after a planning committee was set up last November to hear citizens’ suggestions and objections on the draft DP 2034.
 
 According to sources, the state is unlikely to give a two-month extension.
 
 Justifying the demand for yet another extension, Sena party leader in the BMC Yashwant Jadhav said this was a plan for the city for the next 20 years and cannot be passed in a hurry. “The time given to corporators to analyze the draft DP was insufficient. Every corporator would suggest some amendment and want to speak on it,” he said. “We also need experts to explain the plan properly to us for which we need two more months,” Jadhav added.
 
 The BJP neither supported the demand of its former ally in the BMC nor opposed it. “The draft DP 2034 is on board since the last two years and if an extension is being sought, there should be concrete reasons to support it,” said BJP party leader in the BMC Manoj Kotak. 
 
 NCP party leader in the BMC Rakhi Jadhav said the draft DP is very technical. “We also need an architect to explain it to us. We feel a six-month extension should be sought,” Jadhav added.
