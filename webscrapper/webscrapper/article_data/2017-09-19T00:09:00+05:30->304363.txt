Aurangabad: Members of the   and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Monday staged separate protest demonstrations across Marathwada region against the union and the state governments for fuel price hike.

 Namdeo Pawar, city unit Congress president, led a protest at Kranti Chowk, displaying traditional chula (firewood-stove) and empty LPG cylinder. The protestors said that the government has increased the prices of LPG forcing people to opt for traditional stoves.
 
 Former MLA, Pawar, said, “The tremendous increase in fuel prices have affected the common people while the prime minister Narendra Modi was touring the world at the cost of public exchequer. He said the state government is putting further burden of fuel hike on the people by imposing a cess on fuel. This has affected commoners as well trade and industries.”
 
 On the other hand, NCP activists led by Abhishek Deshmukh, the party’s youth wing president, staged demonstrations at Paithan Gate.
 
 Beed NCP women’s wing led by its district president, Rekha Phad, took to streets with a two-wheeler mounted on a handcart. In a representation made to the district collector, Rekha Phad said that it was due to the wrong policies of the government that the people were suffering. She said that petrol prices have crossed the Rs 80 mark, while it was around Rs 73 about three months ago and cooking gas has also been made unaffordable to a commoner.
 
 “When people were about to prepare for the Diwali festival the government has stopped supply of sugar from fair price shops and poor people are bearing the brunt,” she added.
