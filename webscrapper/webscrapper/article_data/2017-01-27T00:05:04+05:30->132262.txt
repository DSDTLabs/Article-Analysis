New Delhi: The 68th   Day Parade at Rajpath was a day of several firsts, and the crowd welcomed the new weapons and contingents with a cheery warmth on an overcast morning. 

 The loudest applause came when the National Security Guard commandos, also called Black Cat commandos, marched down the Rajpath in full battle gear. The crowd was also collectively awed when the indigenous light combat aircraft Tejas swished by in the flypast.
 
 A contingent of about 140 NSG commandos, dressed in black and complete with headgear and MP5 submachine guns marched to the tunes of their song, ‘Hum hain na hain na Hindustani’, penned by Javed Akhtar. NSG is the only counter-hijack force of the country and specialises in hostage rescue. Since its inception, it has carried out 115 operations, and was fundamental in fighting the 26/11 Mumbai attackers. The contingent also displayed the ‘Sherpa’, a bulletproof vehicle. 
 
 The force has won three Ashok Chakras, three Kirti Chakras, three Shaurya Chakras, 40 Sena Medals, and 16 Vishisht Seva Medals among others. Tejas also made its debut. Incidentally, this was the first time when the single-engine aircraft flew over a crowded area. The Tejas formation of three aircraft was cheered by the crowd. 
 
 An Airborne Early Warning and Control System (AEW&C) named Netra mounted on an Embraer, too, made its public debut, despite heavy clouds and light drizzle. The aircraft flew at a height of 300 metres and speed of 780km/hr, leaving the crowd at the Rajpath boulevard enthralled. 
 
 DRDO showcased Dhanush artillery guns and Advance Towed Artillery Gun systems made on public-private partnerships. Indigenously developed field radars, too, were a matter of pride for the crowd. 
 
 The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research also celebrated its 75 years of existence by showcasing its achievements. The military police also enthralled the crowd with their motorcycle daredevilry, which was cheered even by the foreign delegates.
