LUCKNOW: The UP government on Wednesday decided to lodge an FIR against BJP MLA   in connection with the alleged rape of an Unnao girl and refer it for a probe by the CBI. The government also decided to recommend a CBI probe into the alleged murder of the rape survivor’s father in judicial custody.

 
 The government decision for a CBI probe came just after Sengar made an appearance at the official residence of Lucknow police chief to announce that he had no role in the rape of the teenager and death of her father.
 
 The government also announced suspension of two senior doctors of Unnao district hospital. It also announced disciplinary action against three other doctors of the jail department for dereliction of duty and negligence in attending to the rape survivor’s father, who died on Tuesday. An officer of the rank of DSP has been suspended for not attending to the repeated complaints of the rape survivor and her family.
 
 Principal secretary (Home) Arvind Kumar said the decision was taken on the basis of the interim report submitted by the additional director general (ADG), Lucknow Zone,   on Wednesday. Krishna was heading the SIT to probe the allegations against the MLA and his brother. Action against the doctors was initiated on the basis of separate inquiry reports submitted by deputy inspector general (DIG-Prisons), Love Kumar and Unnao DM on the role of jail administration and doctors who attended to the rape survivor’s father before he was sent to jail in connection with a case of assault.
 
 Just before the probe report was made public, Sengar trashed speculations that he had come to surrender before the police. He said reports that he had gone into hiding was doing the rounds and he had come there to assure the SSP that he was very much present.
