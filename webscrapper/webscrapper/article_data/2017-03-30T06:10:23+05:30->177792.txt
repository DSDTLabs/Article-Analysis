AHMEDABAD: Mufti Abdul Qayyum Mansuri, who was acquitted by the   in the 2002   terrorist attack case along with five others, has approached the city civil court seeking compensation of more than Rs 5 crore from the state government and four police officers, including retired DIG D G Vanzara.

 In his civil suit filed earlier this month, the mufti sought compensation from   officer G L Singhal, retired   V D Vanar and police inspector R I Patel apart from Vanzara and the government. The compensation has been demanded for the cops’ actions of falsely implicating him the terrorism case, for his 11-year incarceration live under the constant fear of the gallows, for losses he suffered during his jail term when his parents passed away and other family members suffered in his absence as well as the financial losses he suffered because he did not receive a salary and for the expenditure he incurred in fighting the long legal battle, said his advocate M M Sheikh.
 
 Mansuri approached the civil court after the Supreme Court redirected the acquitted persons to the proper forum, when they sought compensation and registration of a criminal case against the four police officers from registering a false case against them. They had approached the   with these demands after their exoneration by the apex court as innocent people falsely implicated in the terror case in May 2014.
 
 Mansuri is seeking compensation from the government and the cops who arrested and investigated the case after the state government unsuccessfully exhausted all remedies against the acquittal. The SC rejected the state government’s review and curative petitions.
 
 Three months ago, Mansuri dashed off a legal notice to the government and the four police officers in this regard, but did not receive a response.
