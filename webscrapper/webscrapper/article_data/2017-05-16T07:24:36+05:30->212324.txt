NASHIK: In an attempt to streamline the flow of vehicles, police on Sunday closed the   for   moving from  . 

 Senior officials said the decision was taken to get rid of the chaos at the junction. The U-turn for two-wheelers was effected on an experimental basis and, if it worked, it will be continued, they said. 
 
 Now, all vehicles moving towards Indiranagar from Govindnagar have been diverted to the left from the underpass, from where they drive around 100m, take a U-turn and proceed towards Indiranagar or the Mumbai side. 
 
 Over the past couple of years, the Indiranagar underpass has been the focus of police with respect to traffic management. In view of the numerous incidents of traffic jams at the underpass, police had closed the underpass and diverted traffic on either side of the underpass, forcing motorists who want to get to the other side of the road to take a U-turn after driving some distance.
 
 This decision had not go down well among motorists, considering the time and fuel consumed to take the U-turn. Buckling under pressure, police opened the underpass again during the Kumbh Mela last year. 
 
 Later, they made three-wheelers and four-wheelers from Govindnagar to Indiranagar take the U-turn and allowed two-wheelers to use the underpass. Meanwhile, all vehicles were allowed to use the underpass from Indiranagar to Govindnagar. 
 
 This also did not prevent the chaos. So, on Sunday, police also diverted two-wheelers from Govindnagar to take U-turn to the other side of the road. 
 
 Deputy commissioner of police   said, “The underpass has been closed for traffic from one side for safety reasons. The two-way traffic has led to many accidents. We will be conducting a survey to decide the course of action to   at the underpass.”
