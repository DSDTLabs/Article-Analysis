NEW DELHI: BJP on Friday strongly condemned the   rape-cum-murder and called for harsh punishment to the culprits. It also asked opposition parties not to politicise heinous crimes like rape.

 
 “Such an inhuman act calls for harsh punishment against the culprits. In such a situation, law and order could take its own course and the matter should not be politicised,” BJP spokesperson and Lok Sabha MP   said. The MP backed the investigation by J&K Police as a thorough job and said two BJP ministers, who joined the protests in favour of the accused in Kathua, should not have done so.
 
 Lekhi said BJP had always worked for the welfare of women, Dalits and the deprived sections of the society. “Congress has a history of doing politics over dead bodies and rape incidents. The party, which is responsible for inhuman acts with Sikh women during the 1984 riots, is doing politics over such issues just for its political survival,” Lekhi alleged.
 
 The BJP spokesperson said in the   incident, the UP government took immediate action and handed the matter to the CBI after a report from the special investigation team. In the Kathua incident, BJP’s J&K unit condemned the crime in its working committee meeting on April 1, she added. 
 
 “While   is doing the drama of a candlelight vigil in Delhi, people from his own party are demonstrating in support of the accused which shows what the real face of   is,” she said. 
 
 Lekhi said two of its J&K leaders who joined rallies in support of the accused were “misled”. She claimed Congress was indulging in “selective activism” as the party had not said a word about the rape and murder of a Class V student in Nagaon, Assam, even when it happened this month unlike Unnao and Kathua which were old incidents.
