NEW DELHI: A two-month-old girl was allegedly   an acidic liquid at her house in   on Sunday evening when her mother had gone out to buy vegetables.

 “My husband works in Okhla as a tailor and usually returns home late. I was at home with the baby and my two-year-old daughter. I left them at home and stepped out to buy vegetables. After 15 minutes, when I returned home I saw my infant daughter lying on the floor frothing at the mouth,” said Nasreen, the girl’s mother.
 
 The woman said access to her house is easy as it not made of concrete and has no doors. “We felt this was a safe locality as nothing grievous had ever taken place here, but we were mistaken,” she said.
 
 Nasreen immediately called her in-laws who stay nearby and they informed the police. The baby was rushed to  . Her condition is stable after five days of treatment. “There is a possibility that the baby girl was fed phenyl or a similar caustic liquid. The acidic content and quantity of the liquid has affected her mouth and food pipe,” said a doctor.
 
 The family said that the infant has suffered severe burns in her mouth and food pipe because of which she can barely consume anything. “We registered a case at Govindpuri police station on Monday based on the woman’s statement and have started an investigation. Nasreen is also being questioned to know the sequence of events,” said DCP (southeast) Romil Baaniya.
