Summer arrived early in Los Vegas as   and her ‘Baywatch’ co-stars  , Zac Effron, Alexandra Daddario, Kelly Rohrbach and Jon Bass took to the stage of the on-going   event. Joined by a group of models clad in the iconic red swimsuit, the complete star-cast came together for the first time to present a clip from their upcoming action-comedy that is a film adaptation of the hit television show by the same name.

  
  
 Introducing themselves as the ‘Avengers of the Beach’, the star cast took to the stage and wooed fans over with their comic and witty one-liners. However, it was all the backstage action that really caught everyone’s attention. Priyanka and her co-stars Alexandra and Kelly got together for an impromptu gig backstage, singing Britney Spear’s 90’s hit ‘I’m not that innocent’.
 
  
  
 Apart from posing for pictures, singing, joking around and practicing their scripts, the stars also shared their fitness tips and how they managed to maintain their fit and fabulous bodies. Priyanka revealed that she often found herself snacking on Pizzas with her female co-stars and admitted that she too was amazed how they maintained their bikini bods. PeeCee also revealed that exercise was her secret to getting a toned body in her 30’s.
