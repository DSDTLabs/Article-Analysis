 They say while the number of wards in each of the three corporations – 104 each in South Delhi Municipal Corporation and North Delhi Municipal Corporation and 64 in East Delhi Municipal Corporation — has remained the same, the number of wards in a few assembly segments has changed, ranging from three to seven.
 
 In 2012, ahead of the civic elections, a notification was issued regarding allocation of wards amongst schedule caste, women and general category, the pleas stated.
 
 Claiming that the present notification was contrary to the Constitution as well as Section 3 of the DMC Act, a plea demanded that it should be quashed and a fresh circular issued in accordance with the law.
