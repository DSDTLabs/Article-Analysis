MUMBAI: Former central information commissioner   on Monday said that the Right to Information Act was being "strangled" due to the neglect of the state government. 

 Gandhi has written to chief minister  , asking him to fill vacancies in the information commission in the state.
 
 "RTI is slowly being strangled in   by not appointing information commissioners. In Maharashtra, there is vacancy of one chief information commissioner and three commissioners. These are not being filled despite repeated reminders," Gandhi stated in his letter to Fadnavis.
 
 Gandhi said the pendency at all commissions was killing the objective of the Act which was transparency.
 
 Sharing figures of 31,474 pending cases in four regions, Gandhi said, "...Mumbai(HQ) has 4,870 cases pending. These cases are languishing for the want of information commissioners."
 
 His letter stated that it was a serious matter and needed immediate attention and claimed that failure to do so would allow the state to "succeed" in making the RTI Act "redundant". AGENCIES
