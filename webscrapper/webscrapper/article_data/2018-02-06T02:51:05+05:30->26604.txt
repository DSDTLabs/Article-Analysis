NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind   on Monday claimed that   would get   in the   due to   and   with the saffron party. 

 Kejriwal took to Twitter to make the observation and said it was based on the opinions of several people he had met recently, especially after the defeat of BJP in the Rajasthan bypolls. 
 
 “Met several people in last few days. A consensus amongst all — BJP getting less than 215 seats, unemployment biggest problem, youth worried about its future and middle class very disenchanted with BJP,” Kejriwal tweeted. 
 
 BJP, however, dismissed Kejriwal’s observation. “In 2014, when Kejriwal had claimed that BJP will win 200 seats, we won 282 seats. Now he has claimed that BJP will win 215 seats, that means BJP will win more seats in 2019 than it won in 2014,” said Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari.
 
 Nevertheless, AAP believes it would have a chance to win the confidence of the people at the national level. It hopes unemployment alone would attract middle class support to it. 
 
 Kejriwal also asked BJP chief Amit Shah in a tweet if youngster couldn’t be given better education so that they could become doctors, engineers and lawyers. This was in response to Shah’s statement in Rajya Sabha: “It is better to be a labourer or sell pakodas than to be unemployed. There is no shame in selling pakodas.”
 
 AAP has its units in 22 states now and has been building its base, but it continues to remain a negligible political force beyond Delhi and Punjab.
