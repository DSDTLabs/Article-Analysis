LUCKNOW: The deputy director of minority welfare and waqf in   division,  , has lodged a complaint of misconduct against the chairman of UP State Minorities Commission. She sent her complaint to the director of minority welfare department following which minority welfare minister   ordered a probe. 

 State minorities commission chairperson Tanvir Ahmed Usmani denied Singh's charges and demanded a fair probe. 
 
 In her complaint, Singh said Usmani and 10-12 men misbehaved with her in   guest house on April 14. She said that he used harsh words. 
 
 "I recounted everything that was said to my seniors on phone and later gave it in writing too," she said. Singh said that she reached Aligarh from Lucknow in the intervening night of April 13 and April 14 and went to meet Usmani on April 14 after being asked to do so by his personal secretary. She said that Usmani hurled allegations at her, some even harming her dignity and called in some young men. "They were targeting me for not receiving Usmani at station when he arrived on April 13. I told them that I was in Lucknow and had returned early morning. When I said that I would complain against their conduct to the chief minister, he pleaded me not to say a word. But it is important that action is taken against him," said Singh.
 
 Denying allegations, Usmani said, "I am executive council member of AMU and had come with my wife as I was to be felicitated. When this officer came to meet me, former president of district minority morcha checked her on the protocol she had to follow, but she started insulting him. My wife was also present in the room."
