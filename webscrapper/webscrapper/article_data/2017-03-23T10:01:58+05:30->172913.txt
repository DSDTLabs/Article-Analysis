JAIPUR: A special   (NIA) court in Jaipur sentenced the two convicts in the   -   and   - to life imprisonment on Wednesday. 

 The court questioned the clean chit given by NIA to Pragya Singh, Indresh Kumar and other suspects and asked the NIA to either file a closure report on the clean chit given to the suspects or file a chargesheet against them by March 28.
 
 The special NIA court of Dinesh Kumar Gupta said it would be unfair to hand out the death penalty to the two convicts because, according to the prosecution's report, three of the many people involved in the conspiracy were still absconding while seven had been acquitted for want of evidence. The court reasoned that a life term for the two convicts, who could not alone be blamed for the entire conspiracy, was sufficient.
 
 The court had convicted Bhavesh Patel, Devendra Gupta and Sunil Joshi on March 8 and had acquitted seven others, including Swami Aseemanand. The third convict, Joshi, died under mysterious circumstances soon after the blast in 2007.
