NEW DELHI: Survivors of all sexual offences seeking justice in Delhi courts but based abroad or in far-flung places can hope for some relief. 

 Delhi State   (DSLSA) has decided to provide air fare to such victims to facilitate their timely presence for trial.
 
 Justice   of  , who is the executive chairman of DSLSA, earlier this week, approved the proposal to ensure survivors of such crimes can get air fare and other reasonable expenses, like lodging, reimbursed.
 
 The authority plans to meet or bear these expenses out of Victim Compensation Fund or Legal Aid Fund, in case the trial court, hearing the matter, doesn't order the release of funds.
 
 DSLSA decided to move on this front after it received a US citizen's request. The woman was allegedly raped in December last year and lodged an FIR with Connaught Place police station. 
 
 After filing her complaint, she had returned to the US but has to now visit Delhi for trial and related proceedings.
 
 In agreeing to her request, the Legal Services Authority relied upon a Delhi government notification of 2015 relating to payment of expenses to complainants and witnesses, who have to appear in court for inquiry or trial. But the notification doesn't allow air travel refund even as it leaves it to the judge to use his discretion in cases where witnesses have to come from distant places.
