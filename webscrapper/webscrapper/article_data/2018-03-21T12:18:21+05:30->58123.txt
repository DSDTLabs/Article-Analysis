PATNA: Leader of opposition in state assembly   on Tuesday launched a frontal attack on CM  , accusing him of bringing back the   into power through the backdoor.

 Amid ruckus in the assembly over recent communal clashes in Bhagalpur and Darbhanga, Tejashwi said, “Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi had categorically said the killing in Darbhanga was the result of a land dispute. Still, Union minister Giriraj Singh linked the incident to the naming of a square after Prime Minister  . People are confused who is speaking the truth – the deputy CM or the Union minister?”
 
 Tejashwi also raised the issue of alleged involvement of Union minister Ashwini Choubey's son   in communal clashes at Nathnagar in Bhagalpur district on Saturday. Shashwat has been booked for taking out a procession without prior permission of the district administration.
 
 “The CM had said on Monday that he won’t be in the company of those disrupting social harmony in the state. However, it was Nitish who had brought those indulging in such politics into power through the backdoor,” Tejashwi said while referring to the turn of events in July last year which saw Nitish severing ties with Grand Alliance and returning to the   fold.
 
 “The CM is silent. In fact, he is giving protection to those who tried to destroy social harmony in Bhagalpur and Darbhanga,” Tejashwi told media persons outside the assembly soon after Speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary adjourned the proceedings of the House amid opposition ruckus.
 
 Tejashwi said attempts were being made to disrupt communal harmony in the state, especially after recent byelections to Araria Lok Sabha and Jehanabad and Bhabhua assembly seats. The BJP emerged victorious only in Bhabua, while rest of the two seats went to the kitty of RJD.
