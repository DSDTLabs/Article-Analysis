DEHRADUN: A former butler at the   (IMA) has been sentenced to five years of rigorous imprisonment by the court of the special judicial magistrate ( ) for duping several unemployed youths of Rs 6.9 lakh on the pretext of providing them permanent jobs at the IMA.
 
  While pronouncing the judgement, special judicial magistrate (CBI)   also slapped a fine of Rs 9.5 lakh on 52-year-old Suresh Kumar who worked as a butler at the IMA mess.
  
  “The CBI received a complaint from the IMA in April 2014 that Suresh Kumar took Rs 6.9 lakh from seven people on the pretext of providing them permanent jobs in various Group C posts at the IMA. His services were terminated by the IMA after he was found guilty in an in-house enquiry,” said prosecution lawyer  .
  
  In February 2013, the IMA had invited applications for 52 posts in Group C, including positions in housekeeping and the mess. Kumar, a resident of Premnagar in Dehradun, who was at the time working at the IMA mess, promised employment to seven job seekers and took Rs 6.9 lakh from them.
  
  When Kumar failed to fulfil his promise, the victims filed a formal complaint against the butler with senior officials at the IMA. After conducting an inquiry and finding the charges to be true, the IMA officials filed a complaint with the CBI on April 12, 2014 under section 420 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
  
  “During investigation, it was found that Kumar had taken some money in cash while the remaining was deposited in his bank account. During trial, he failed to prove the source of money deposited in his account in that period. He has been convicted for cheating,” said the prosecution lawyer.
  
  The prosecution examined 27 witnesses during the trial to prove the charges levelled against Kumar.
