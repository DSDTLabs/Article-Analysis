KOLKATA: The Kolkata police’s cybercell busted a fake BPO racket operating from Kasba that allegedly duped Americans of around Rs 1.74 crore.

 Police said they have arrested one Abhishek Gupta (24), a resident of Tallah and a BTech graduate from a top engineering college, for running the racket.
 
 Styled as Blue Hat IT Solutions Private Ltd, Gupta and his team hacked into the customer base of ‘New Cingular Wireless PCS’, which provides Telecom service in the US on behalf of AT&T. Gupta claimed he was the director of Blue Hat.
 
 According to police, the suspects would pose as Internal Revenue Service (IRS) officials and send voice mails, informing the targets that they had defaulted on taxes, which will attract fines and imprisonment. IRS is similar to the   department in India.
 
 Additional CP (V)   said, “Alarmed at such messages, people would call back asking for further details when the con men went for the kill.”
 
 Posing as IT sleuths, they would then convince their victims to clear all the ‘arrears’ by purchasing gift cards of iTunes and Walmart. Finding the option less time consuming, most of the callers would give in to this trick.
 
 They would readily buy the gift cards. So far, the scam is estimated to be worth around $2,72,018 (Rs 1.74 crore). Smelling a rat, authorised representative of AT&T in India Adarsh Chauhan filed a complaint.
 
 The cybercell also seized of a number of hard disks and documents related to different US agencies. Gupta was produced in a local court, where he was sent to police custody till January 25.
 
 A similar gang was busted by Mumbai crime branch in November last year and police believe that the two might be linked.
