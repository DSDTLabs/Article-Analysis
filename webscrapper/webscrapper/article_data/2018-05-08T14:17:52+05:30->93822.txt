BHUBANESWAR: In an unprecedented move, described by industrialist Ratan Tata as 'earth-shaking' and which prompted chief minister   to quote British author Aldous Huxley,   on Monday provided land rights certificates to 2,000 landless   and promised to develop modern urban habitats complete with roads, street lights, parks and playgrounds for them. 

 The initiative is the culmination of the Odisha Land Rights to Slum Dwellers Act, 2017, notified in October last year, and is expected to help the ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) in the assembly and Lok Sabha elections scheduled for early next year. Under the Act, the government had promised to give 45 square metre of land to landless slum dwellers in municipal towns and 60 square metre in notified area councils (smaller towns).
 
 The government on Monday also launched the   to ensure liveable communities and infrastructure in slums. Naveen, who handed over the land documents to the first lot of beneficiaries from nine small towns in the Puri and Ganjam districts at an event in Chhatrapur, said, "As chief minister, I would love to see Odisha at the vanguard of creating a brave new world."
 
 His sentiments were echoed by Tata, whose Tata Trusts was given the task of surveying the feasibility of the Act. "Odisha as a progressive state will certainly fulfil the hopes and aspirations of slum dwellers who are the lifeline of cities," the pioneer said. Terming the occasion as 'historic', Tata assured "whole-hearted support' of Tata Trusts to 'convert the dream of the chief minister into reality'.
 
 Besides Tata, the event was attended by visionary British architect Norman Foster and state government dignitaries and officials.
