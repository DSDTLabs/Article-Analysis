A hard-nosed stand by the Madras high court, which made it clear it had already restrained government employees associations from going on an indefinite strike and that it intended to enforce its orders, brought the strike to an end on Friday.

 A bench of Justice   and Justice   ordered that striking staffers return to work latest by 2pm on Friday, and then summoned the state chief secretary to be present in court on September 21 to explain the government’s views on resolving the wage dispute.
 
  The court said the government must now approach the issue with open mind, and endeavour to address the genuine demands of the employees taking into account the seventh pay commission report.
 
 In a related development, Justice N Kirubakaran, sitting in the principal seat in Chennai, has called for details of the online trolling he was subjected to, in order to initiate action against the offenders. He was trolled online for his remarks against teachers who boycotted work, despite poor show of government schools in competitive tests, including NEET.
 
 On his part, actor   wondered whether the ‘no work no pay’ principle held against staff would apply to ruling party MLAs chilling out in a   resort too.
