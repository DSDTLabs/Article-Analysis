NOIDA: A hike in parking fees at   18 market to Rs 20 per hour from Rs 30 a day has come as a setback for local businessmen and shop owners. The fee hike in parking along the internal lanes of this market hub was introduced after the inauguration of the multi-level parking facility earlier this year.

 “Previously, for parking our car at the market we would pay Rs 30 for the entire day. Now we are compelled to pay Rs 20 per hour for the same. So on a daily basis, each shop owner is paying about Rs 200 as parking fees. So for a shop with two or more employees, the parking cost is shooting up. The employees of the shops, too, have asked the shop owners to pay for their parking, so suddenly, the parking expenses of each shop has shot up, adding to the operating costs,” said  , president of Sector 18 Market  .
 
 The provision for the Sector 18 shop owners at the multi-level parking constructed by  , at present is Rs 1,000 per month for a single car. For additional cars, it is Rs 1,500 per car. The shop owners claim that because their nature of work entails carrying valuable goods from the car to the shop and back, parking at a distance at the multi-level does not help.
 
 “Operation costs have shot up for all existing shop owners. While the multi-level parking was supposed to solve our problems, it has now become a deterrent. We have been requesting some concessions for our parking rates. The market has not been performing well and the Noida Authority should keep the welfare of the traders in mind,” said Jain.
 
 “We are already challenged with the advent of malls in Sector 18, now with the increased pressure on our operating costs, most shop owners would be eventually forced to shut business. We are seeking concession on parking and may soon meet Noida Authority officials with a formal appeal,” he added.
