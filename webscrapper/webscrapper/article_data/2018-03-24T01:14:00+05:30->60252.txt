Tirupur: Farmers alleged that the direct procurement centres were charging more than the price fixed by the government for procuring paddy in Dharapuram taluk. The Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation (Tncsc) has 10 direct procurement centers (DPCs) for paddy in the district. The corporation has fixed 20 paise per 40-kg sack paddy as a procuring charge. “But, DPCs in Dharapuram block were charging 90 paise per sack and the authorities were pinpointing that the procurement yard was functioning in a private property and they were paying rentals,” said Eswaramurthy, a farmer. The issue was raised before the district collector in a farmers grievance meeting held at the collectorate on Friday.
