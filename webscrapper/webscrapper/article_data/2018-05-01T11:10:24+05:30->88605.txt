 Rakesh Reddy Dubbudu told TOI,” Most people talk about the foreign visits of the PM. We have in detail analysed Narendra Modi’s domestic visits in the last four years. The analysis of data from 2014 to 2018 includes both official tours and unofficial visits including those related to party work. It is clear that his visits are more to the states that went to polls. In south,   was the most visited state. There is a possibility of non-BJP ruled states not inviting PM for their states. But it is evident that the highest number of foreign dignitaries had visited Gujarat, Maharashtra and UP the most.”
 
 He added: “In 2017, PM Modi made 21 visits each to UP and Gujarat which went to the polls in that year. In 2015, Bihar was visited the most as it went for elections in that year. Likewise, in 2014, PM Modi mostly visited Maharashtra, Jammu & Kashmir, Jharkhand and Haryana that witnessed elections.”
 
 Chattisgarh and Goa, though being BJP ruled states, were among the least visited.
 
 “PM Modi visited   five times and Telangana four times in the past four years,” he added. The most domestic visits were made in 2017 followed by 2016.
