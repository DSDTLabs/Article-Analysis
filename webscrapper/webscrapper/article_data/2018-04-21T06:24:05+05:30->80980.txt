KOLKATA: A day after police arrested two persons from Budge Budge in South 24 Parganas, allegedly for selling meat from carcasses to hotels and restaurants, the   (KMC) carried out surprise raids in different eateries in Sealdah on Friday. The civic body collected samples of both fresh and cooked meat from the restaurants and sent them for testing.

 Three teams from KMC started raiding different hotels and restaurants from Friday morning and the inspection will continue on Saturday as well. They will also collect samples from the wholesale market in Sealdah from where the meat is supplied to different restaurants and food joints. “There was no request either from the police or  , but we took suo motu cognizance of the case and made surprise visits to different hotels and restaurants. Strong action will be taken against the owners if meat from dead animals is found in the samples,” said MMiC (health) of KMC Atin Ghosh.
 
 Police, however, said they were yet to find out where the meat was actually supplied. “Interrogating the duo, we learnt that they used to send it to Kolkata. One of them said it was sent to a person named   in   and another said it was sent to Sealdah where some people collected it and mixed it with fresh meat. We are verifying both statements. We are also on the lookout for Sani and Nimai, the masterminds behind the operation. Once we get them, we will be able to know other details,” an officer said.
 
 Budge Budge Municipality, too, has taken steps to check such incidents. A six-member team of councillors visited the spot in Budge Budge and have submitted a report to the chairman regarding the security arrangement there.
 
 “We have decided to deploy watchmen round the clock and have also arranged for lighting. We have requested the police to arrange for a patrolling van as well. These people managed to carry out the operation since the area is in the backyard of the city,”vice-chairman of Budge Budge Municipality Goutam Das Gupta said.
