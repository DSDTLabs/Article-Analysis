AMETHI: The Raja of Amethi,   on Monday charged Rani  , his estranged wife of misleading their children. Replying to a question on the children—son Anant Vikram Singh and daughters Mahima Singh and Shaivya Singh—canvassing for Garima, he said, “They are the same children who in 1996 threw her (Garima) out of the palace. Bachon ko gumraah kiya gaya hai (kids have been misled).’’ 

 Reacting sharply to his father’s charge, Anant said, “She (Ameeta Modi) is walking freely in Amethi only because she has been misleading people for 20 years saying she is the wife of Maharaj (Sanjay Sinh). Had she not been saying so, people of Amethi would not have allowed her to stay here. It is unfortunate how she has misled the Maharaj too. Don’t know what she has got him into believing.’’
 
 Confident of her mother winning her first electoral battle, Mahima Singh said, “People wanted our mother to contest and so she decided to be in fray. If Ameeta Modi says she is the wife of Maharaj, I can also say I am the Queen of England. So anyone can say anything.’’ 
 
 She added that in 1996, she was 20-year-old and had just got engaged. “Ameeta Modi threatened to get my engagement cancelled. She threatened to ruin my reputation. She kept us up all night when my sister Shaivya was only 13, and forced us to stand at the gate. She came dressed as a servant behind us threatening that if we don’t get this done (throw Garima out of the palace), she will ruin our lives and we will never get married,’’ alleged Mahima, now 42.
