MEERUT: Stoking a row, senior   Indresh Kumar on Friday said that   was a “bigger” follower of non-violence than Mahatma Gandhi, who he claimed could have averted partition of the country.

  Speaking at a function organised to mark the 160th anniversary of 1857 revolt, Kumar said: “The definition of 'ahimsa' (non-violence) is very different from what has been told to us. Non-violence does not only mean shunning of violence, but it also means attacking to defend oneself from a demon. Bhagat Singh made the demons (British) realise that they were wrong, and his act of throwing a bomb in assembly was not to kill anyone. But, what he suffered afterwards was actually an act of violence at the hands of the British.”
 
  The   blamed Gandhi for partition of India.
 
  “One man, who could have prevented partition of India was Gandhi. Every now and then he would sit on fast-unto-death, but why he did not do that to prevent partition?” Kumar asked.
