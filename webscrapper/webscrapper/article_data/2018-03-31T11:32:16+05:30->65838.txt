NOIDA:   (Confederation of NCR Residents Welfare Associations-CONRWA) has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and HRD minister Prakash Javadekar to put a stay on CBSE's decision to re-conduct Class 12 economics and Class 10 Mathematics exam as it amounts to harassing lakhs of students and their parents for a folly of few. 

 In a letter, the CONRWA maintained that students of Class 12, who are scheduled to appear for competitive exams for professional courses on April 18 will suffer as it will affect their preparations for these courses and they will not be at par with students of other state boards. 
 
 The NCR RWA further demanded investigations into the matter with punishment to the guilty including terminating the services of the CBSE chairman and officers concerned.
 
 “We have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and HRD minister Prakash Javadekar today urging them to scrap and disallow the CBSE’s decision for a re-exam of Class XII economics and Class X maths papers following their leak as is its very disheartening to lakhs of students across the country who appeared for the said exams and would be harassed for no fault of theirs,” said PS Jain, president CONRWA.
 
 On the behalf of lakhs of students and their parents, CONRWA added that pending investigations, CBSE cannot ascertain the veracity of claims of paper leakage and number of students benefitted by the paper leak. 
 
 “Such students involved in malpractices may be very few and at select centres which will be revealed in investigations only. However, the decision of CBSE has been taken in haste, burdening lakhs of students amounts to snatching their Right to Equality under Article 14 of the Constitution,” said Jain, who is also an advocate.
 
 Jain added that even if it is presumed that the papers were leaked on a wider scale, instead of harassing lakhs of children by way of re-exam, “it be justified to terminate the services of CBSE chairman and officers concerned as guaranteeing fool-proof exams is their duty.”
 
 Hence CONRWA urged PM Modi to issue appropriate instructions to HRD minister Prakash Prakash Javadekar, secretary HRD ministry and chairman CBSE against the decision to re-conduct the said examinations and at the same time, expedite investigations in the matter to punish the guilty.
