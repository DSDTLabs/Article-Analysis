Vijayawada: With a view to providing free, safe and on-time transportation facility to class X students appearing for the ongoing public examinations, which began on March 15, an auto dealer partnered with the city police and started the service on Thursday. City police commissioner Gautam Sawang flagged off the programme at KS Vyas Complex on MG Road. 

 As many as 200 students were dropped off to the   centres on Thursday. The students and in some case the parents were picked up from the designated bus stops. About 80 motorbikes were employed for the initiative. 
 
 “We have seen many CBSE students going late for their exams. Hence, we thought of beginning a free drop service,” said Venkat Maganti, owner of Dasarath Hero Motors, who came up with the idea to drop students to the exam centres. He said there are two objectives behind the programme. One is to raise among the youth about road safety.
 
 “The students will be given free rides to their examination centres with a condition that they wear helmets. The students will be without tension and will have the confidence to write the exams getting early to the centres,” Dasarath said. 
 
 The services begin at around 7.00 am and stops at 9.00 am. The board has advised the students to be at the centres by 9.00 am. The exam is from 9.30 am to 12.00 pm. Venkat said the services were divided into four groups and each group was allotted a manager. The drivers contacted their managers in case of unforeseen issues.
