MUMBAI: Despite claims by CM   that the agrarian crisis was being tackled on war footing, 117 farmers ended their lives in Maharashtra's drought-prone   in the first two months of 2017. In spite of heavy rains and a spurt in farm productivity, the scourge of suicides continues to spread. The highest number of suicides was in Beed (23), hometown of rural minister Pankaja Munde, followed by Nanded (22), Osmanabad (19), Aurangabad (18), Jalna (14), Parbhani and Hingoli (8 each) and Latur (5). Of the 117 cases, financial aid was provided to 46 families of the deceased. But 13 were denied relief and 58 proposals are still being processed. 

 Head of a state-level task force on farmer welfare, Kishore Tiwari, said while the government had taken various measures, the results were not visible. "We'll have to redraft our strategy to halt farmer suicides," Tiwari said. "We will have to provide remunerative prices for agriculture produce, along with market intervention. A plan needs to be worked out to provide education to farmers' children and financial assistance for healthcare." 
 
 In 2016, production of tur, tomato, onion and most vegetables doubled and even tripled but farm gate prices dipped. Onion was sold for Rs 460 per quintal as against the production cost of Rs 950. Tur farmers were paid less than the minimum support price (MSP) in wholesale markets. The MSP for tur was Rs 5,050 and traders were purchasing it at Rs 4200-4400 per quintal. 
 
 However, a comparison with figures for the previous year show a marginal decline in toll. According to data, 3,052 farmers ended their lives in 2016, of which 1,053 cases were from Aurangabad, which falls in Marathwada region. The 117 cases recorded in 2017, if seen against the average bi-monthly rate for the previous year, indicates a slight downturn. Incidentally, the same trend is visible for 2015 and 2016. Against a total of 3,052 farmers who killed themselves in 2016, the toll was higher at 3,228 in 2015, which was a drought year.
 
 Leader of opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil said over the last two and half years, 9,000 farmers have killed themselves. "We demand that Fadnavis declare a total loan waiver to protect the farmers' lives." Patil led an opposition delegation recently which called on Governor Vidyasagar Rao to press for their demand.
