Surat: A 35-year-old carpenter ended life by hanging self at his residence in Rustampura area of the city on Monday. Deceased Chetan Prajapati was depressed since the last few months and had stopped going to work. 

 He was first spotted by his wife Daksha, who had a talk with him just a few minutes before he hanged himself at around 7 am. Chetan asked Daksha to make a cup of tea for him at around 6 am and then returned to his bed. Daksha went to wash clothes behind the house and it was at that time when the deceased went to first floor of the house and hanged himself. Daksha spotted Chetan hanging in the room from a ceiling fan when she went to dry clothes on the first floor of the house. The victim’s mother had gone out of the house for some work. 
 
 The deceased’s tattoos on forearms made his family members think that he was addicted to some game which he used to regularly play on his mobile phone. 
 
 “He talked less and was not regular at work for the past four months. We were not worried much since he was getting Rs 10,000 monthly from his old payments,” Daksha said.
 
 “He used to tell family members that he was feeling weak and had pain in his knees. He slept most of the time and had no dispute with anyone in the family. We are shocked how could he take such a step,” she added. The couple has two boys aged seven and five years. 
 
 Sources close to the family said Chetan had a property dispute with his uncle.
