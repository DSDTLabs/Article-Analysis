KOCHI: City residents who stay near highways frequented by trucks carrying hazardous materials want the authorities to ensure that the drivers of such vehicles are adequately trained. The recent mishap involving a LPG bullet tanker has made them wary of unsafe transportation of chemicals through city roads.

 
 “What happened at Kalamassery is a very serious matter and should it happen again, the consequences may not be the same,” said Aneesha A, a student at Rajagiri College of Management.
 
 “It is not only dangerous for local residents but also for the driver. It is important for them to be aware of the hazardous chemicals they carry,” said Aneesha.
 
 Residents also want the authorities to ensure safety by at least providing good roads on the regular routes of these trucks.
 
 Ramesh Kumar, a   resident, said that due to the presence of the Kochi Refinery, the   was one of the most unsafe roads.
 
 Areas like Kakkanad, Thrikkakara, Chithrapuzha, Kalamassery, Irumbanam, Karimugal also faces the same problem, said Kumar.
 
 Satheeshbabu, who resides near Irumpanam said the road stretch from   till Irumbanam junction, frequented by bullet tankers should be considered a danger spot.
 
 Unscientific construction of the road was another cause of accident, he said.
 
 “In case a bullet tanker carrying LPG meets with accident it could lead to disaster because of the presence of many chemical factories including HOC and FACT,”   said.
 
 Sreejesh from Tripunithura said the situation at Chithrapuzha and Karimugal was no different. “There is little that we can do. Authorities should take steps to keep us safe,” he said.
