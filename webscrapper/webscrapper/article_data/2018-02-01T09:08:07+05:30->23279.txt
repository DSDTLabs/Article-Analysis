MADURAI: MRM Ramaiya Enterprises Private limited which imported sand from Malaysia has challenged the government order passed by the public works department on Wednesday. The company’s managing director MRM Ramaiya challenged the government order dated December 8, 2017 which issues guidelines for regulation of storage, transportation and sale of imported sand.

 When the case came up for admission before V Bharathidasan, the petitioner side said that there is no source of power for the TN government under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act and the   and Mineral Dealers Rules to regulate the imported sand. But, the government passed GO regulating the imported sand. Besides, the government is not in a position to lay down procedure for implementation of the GO, the petitioner side added.
 
 Further, citing the GO, the   district administration seized imported sand of the petitioner’s company, while they were transporting the sand to its customers. At the same time, another importer (Aakar Enterprises, Chennai) who imported sand from Malaysia brought it to the VO Chidambaranar port trust in Tuticorin, and took it to   and is selling there, with which it was clear that the government lacked transparency and vague. Hence, it was necessary to quash the government order and forbear the government from interfering with storage, transportation and sale of imported sand, the petitioner side prayed.
 
 Following it, the court ordered notice to the public works secretary and   district collector and adjourned the case to February 16.
