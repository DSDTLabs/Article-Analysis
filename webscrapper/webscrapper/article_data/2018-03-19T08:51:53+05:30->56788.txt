CHANDIGARH: Residents will soon not have to pay extra for any kind of payments to the   through credit and debit cards and Netbanking. The Information Technology (IT) department of the administration is going to change the bank to provide the free service. 

 Currently, a person has to pay 0.9% charges through credit and debit card to the bank for an amount of Rs 2,000 and 1% for payment more than Rs 2,000. For Netbanking, residents pay Rs 10 extra. 
 
 "The bank hired for the service had been charging merchant discount rate from the public. These are the charges for payment processing services on debit and credit card transactions. A rate is agreed to prior to accepting payment from debit and credit cards. But we have now tied up with another bank which will not charge a single penny from the public. The decision has been taken after a detailed discussion," said sources in the administration. Sources said there are around 80 to 85 services with the administration, out of which payments of around 50 to 60 are through credit and debit card and Netbanking. 
 
 "According to the record of the administration, 1.25 lakh to 1.50 lakh residents make payments for various services on a monthly basis, out of which 10,000 to 15,000 pay through credit and debit cards and Netbanking. We are now hoping to enhance this number with this new move," said an official.
