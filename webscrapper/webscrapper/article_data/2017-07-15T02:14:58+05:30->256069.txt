NEW DELHI: As fugitive businessman   has so far refused to submit himself to the jurisdiction of Indian courts to face charges against him, the Supreme Court on Friday said it is the duty of the Centre to bring him to justice by getting him extradited from United Kingdom. 

  Mallya has been held guilty by the Supreme Court of contempt of court for not honestly disclosing all his assets and diverting his $40 million to overseas accounts of his family members in violation of the court's order. It had directed Mallya to personally appear before the court to face punishment. But a bench of Justices A K Goel and U U Lalit deferred indefinitely the hearing to decide quantum of punishment to be awarded to him till he is brought before the court. 
 
 Attorney General K K Venugopal told the bench that the Centre is taking all steps to bring him back and extradition proceedings were going on in UK. He told the court that Mallya was informed by Indian High Commission in UK about the SC order for his personal appearance.
 
 Recording the AG's statement, the bench said it was the duty of the Centre to produce him before the court and adjourned the case. "You have to produce him before us. We will proceed against him when you produce him here," the bench said.
 
  The court was hearing contempt proceedings against Mallya filed by a consortium of 17 banks led by SBI which contended that the businessman had not made a truthful disclosure of his assets before the court and he had intentionally kept the court in dark on payment of $40 million which he received in February last year from British liquor major Diageo for stepping down as chairman of United Spirits Limited. 
 
  The SBI has the highest exposure of Rs 1,600 crore to the  . Other banks that have exposure to the airline include Punjab National Bank, IDBI Bank, Bank of India , Bank of Baroda and Central Bank of India.
