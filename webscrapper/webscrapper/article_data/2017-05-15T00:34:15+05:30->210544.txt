Trichy: The annual inspection on 187 school buses owned by private institutions in the city has revealed that institutions were ignoring regular maintenance and safety features and equipment. Out of the 187 buses that were inspected, 16 were denied fitness certificate by the Trichy West Regional Transport Officer. There are a total 227 school vehicles in the city under Trichy West RTO alone. 

 While many of the vehicles had minor issues, few were also found to be having malfunctioning emergency exit and brake systems. RTO officials have instructed them to reappear after carrying out the required repair works.
 
 Similarly, 22 vehicles in Srirangam were instructed to come back again in two weeks after making necessary changes. About 190 school vehicles which come under Srirangam regional transport office were put to fitness check on Thursday.
 
 A district level committee comprising officials from RTO and district administration carried out the annual inspection following a high court order after repeated accidents involving school vehicles. 
 
 “We ask the school administration to keep a check on the condition of these vehicles than waiting for us to point it out to them. Malfunctioning emergency exits cannot be accepted,” said an official. 
 
 “Starting from checking vehicle records and details about the drivers, we check the structure of the vehicle,” said a senior RTO official. 
 
 While pointing out that vehicles which were instructed to come again were again found with minor issues, the official said that many of the vehicles had their fire extinguishing cylinder expired and had outdated first aid kit. Checking the brakes, emergency exit and condition of the engine too are part of the inspection.
