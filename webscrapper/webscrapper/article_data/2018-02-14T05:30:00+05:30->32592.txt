 Chennai: Edappadi K Palaniswami-led cabinet is likely to meet on Thursday, on the eve of the completion of one year of the government. The meeting, a customary one, ahead of the state budget, will discuss the achievements to be showcased in the budget session, sources said. The meeting comes close on the heels of the high court hearing a petition filed by DMK and supporters of rebel leader T T V Dhinakaran seeking disqualification of deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam and 10 legislators, who stayed away from the trust vote against the EPS government in the state assembly in February last year. “The chief minister is keen on holding a cabinet meeting though the agenda has not been finalised yet,” said a senior minister, seeking anonymity. This is the seventh cabinet meeting of the Palaniswami government in the last one year. The last meet took place in October when the cabinet cleared the seventh pay commission recommendations to government staff and extended unauthorised layout scheme for another six months.
