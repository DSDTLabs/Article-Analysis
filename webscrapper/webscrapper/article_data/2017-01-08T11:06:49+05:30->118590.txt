AMRAVATI: Melghat   has reported that four wild boars were found dead in a farm near   on   on Friday morning. The boars were found to have been poisoned. Two boars survived, sources said.

 Though it was feared initially that somebody might have poisoned the waterhole, the fears were unfounded since no other animals died of poisoning. Forest officials said that no bison or chital died as was feared earlier.
 
 Sources said the incident happened on Thursday night and came to notice on Friday morning. Forest staff reached the spot and performed panchanama. RFO Anand Suratne told TOI that the wild animals were found dead near a farm. He said that post mortem reports confirmed poisoning. Suratne said the department is investigating the case and is on the look out for the culprit.
 
 Kishor Rithe of   said the poisoning might have taken place to protect crops from boars. Rithe suggested that forest department should round up the farmer near whose farm the animals were found dead. “Melghat tribals sometimes electrocute wild animals to save their crops, but killing them by poisoning is rare,” said Rithe.
