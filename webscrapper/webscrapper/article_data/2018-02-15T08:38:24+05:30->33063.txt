INDORE: People took part in processions and sought blessing of Lord Shiva at several temples in the city on the occasion of Mahashivaratri on Wednesday.

 Chanting hymns and dancing on the beat of drums they took part in the processions. "A bhajan mandali had come to the temple last night, so we attended that session. Today we went to the temple to worship and seek blessing of Lord Shiva," said homemaker Leena Garg, who was fasting.
 
 While many temples had Shivlinga made up of ice, some had it decorated with flowers and a couple of temples decorated it with the dry fruits.
 
 Businesswoman Smita Upadhyay, who has been fasting for nearly four decades on every Shivratri said, "This is one of the most important festival for girls and women as we pray for a good husband and family life." The 50-year-old worshipped Lord Shiva in the morning and fasted for a happy life.
 
 There are some residents who are planning to go to Omkareshwar to take a dip as it's considered good. "Till February 15, it is a good time to take a dip in Omkareshwar. Therefore, I am planning to go there," said professional Shivang Singh.
 
 Apart from the devotees, there were several people, who went to temples for prasad and bhang. "Although we don't celebrate this festival, we went to four temples to pray and see the decoration," said Jasbir Kaur Sudan.
 
 The gates of the sanctum sanctorum at Mahakaleshwar temple in Ujjain were opened for 44 hours. On the second day of Mahashivratri, bhasma aarti, was performed in the afternoon in the presence of district collector,   chairman Sanket Bhondve and Dewas collector Ashish Singh.
