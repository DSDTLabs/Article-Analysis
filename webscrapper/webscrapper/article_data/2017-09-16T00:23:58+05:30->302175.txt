NAVI MUMBAI: Three youths who broke into a nationalised bank in Kharghar early on Friday stole only the digital video recorder of   cameras on the premises after they could not lay their hands on the cash. Kharghar police arrested the trio who struck at Sector 30, and booked them for burglary. Police said they stole the DVR to prevent themselves from being identified.

 Irshad Mansuri (20), a resident of Ova Peth village, Rohit More (22), from Ramabai Ambedkar Nagar, Sector 8, CBD, and Mukesh Aade (20), a resident of Kuber Society in Sector 4 broke into   in   in Sector 30. Senior inspector Dilip Kale said, “They attempted to break open the huge metal   using an iron rod. They dented the treasury but could not lay their hands on the cash inside.”
 
 Sub-inspector Nitin Shinde said, “While probing the burglary at the bank, we rounded up four suspects from Owe Peth for breaking open a paan stall near the bank. Aade spilt the beans about them targeting the bank with two aides. He led us to More and Mansuri, who were apprehended in CBD and Ove Peth respectively. The stolen DVR has been recovered.”
 
 He said, “The trio claimed that as the bank branch was opened only two months ago, they thought the cash was stored in ordinary lockers, and hence did not carry a gas cutter to open the safe. They were taken aback after seeing the metal treasury, with a password protected security feature.”
 
 Shinde added, “More was jailed in Delhi for four years as he was probably convicted for attempt to murder. He was released from jail about a week back, after which he returned to Kharghar and met his aides and targeted the bank. Aade indulges in petty crime, while Mansuri claims that he is an auto driver and works at night, but it seems he commits crime under that pretext. The trio has been remanded to police custody till Monday.”
