AHMEDABAD: At a time when many of us fall prey to   merely after spending a couple of hours in the scorching sun, the plight of stray animals and birds is much worse. Of late, there has been a significant spike in the number of cases of birds falling prey to dehydration and heatstroke. The situation has worsened so much that birds tend to fall and suffer head injuries, as they get dehydrated while flying.

 
 Nearly 800 cases of birds falling prey to heat-related illnesses were reported at   (JCT) in Ahmedabad in the first fortnight of this month. These include some 148 infant birds, 619 adult birds and 27 others.
 
 “This is the season for babies of birds such as Parakeets, Kites and Pigeons being born. The infant birds are often ready for their first flight around this time of the year, but they get dehydrated and fall. This is really sad, as the green cover is shrinking and birds have no natural shelter left,” said  , managing trustee, JCT.
 
 Shah added, “It is high time citizens get sensitive to these aspects and act. We can always put a bowl of water in our balconies, gardens, in our backyard. With temperatures soaring, one must put a   in the water bowl or a pinch of sugar and salt each, so that it helps maintain sodium-potassium levels for the birds. At the same time it is important to clean their bowls to prevent bacterial infection,” said Shah.
 
 “One may also put in fruits, especially melons for the birds to feed them apart from grains,” she said.
