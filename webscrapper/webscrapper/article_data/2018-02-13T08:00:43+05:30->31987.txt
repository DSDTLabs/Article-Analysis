 The orders, issued by board chairman Kahan Singh  , said the hospital should immediately suspend its housekeeping in-charge   and take action against him after an inquiry. The contract of  , responsible for lifting of solid waste, should be terminated and an FIR (first information report) lodged against him, the board ordered.
 
 Pannu said, “We are adopting zero tolerance towards managements violating Bio Medical Waste Management Rules, 2016. Fortis has been found negligent in handling the biomedical waste with callous attitude. After giving a suitable hearing, the hospital has been penalised for the violation.”
 
 The orders said the conduct of Sharma should also be probed and if his connivance with the contractor in the illegal pilferage of bio-medical waste is established, an FIR should also be lodged against him.
 
 The board asked the hospital to strengthen its internal mechanism of segregation, collection, transportation, storage and final disposal and provide barcoding system within a month. The hospital was told to install CCTV cameras on final biomedical waste and general waste collection area within seven days to rule out the possibility of pilferage.
 
 The hospital was also directed to appoint a qualified officer (at least science graduate) as in-charge of biomedical waste, who should also get trained from regional office of the board.
