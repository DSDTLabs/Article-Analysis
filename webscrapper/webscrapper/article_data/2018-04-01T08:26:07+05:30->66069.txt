BENGALURU: Be it  , clearing of garbage, defunct streetlights or overflowing drains, citizen complaints to civic agencies are falling on deaf years. 

 Civic officials are citing election work or the   for their inability to concentrate on routine work. Residents on the other hand say their complaints aren’t related to new projects which must be stalled due to the model code of conduct, but those that have already been taken up and are stuck for various reasons.
 
 MPM Layout in Mallathahalli, west Bengaluru, is a case in point. According to senior citizen Gopal BV, cross roads of the 1st Main Road in his area, where over 150 people reside, was dug up last December to lay new drainage pipes. “BBMP was supposed to relay the road, but is still to complete the work. Though we were told that our road is already listed for asphalting, civic officials aren’t implementing the same despite giving us assurances every time we meet them. Meetings with the local corporator and the MLA too haven’t yielded any result. Now, some officials are using the model code of conduct as an excuse,” he added.
 
 Similar is the story of Lakshmi Road in  . “Pipe-laying and road works in Lakshmi Road and other lanes are stuck despite residents raising the issue. Whenever we call officials, be it from  , BWSSB or other agencies, they say work cannot be taken up due to the model code of conduct. Does election mean regular life should come to standstill,” wondered Anthony Raju, a resident.
 
 Residents of areas in Mahadevapura, Bommanahalli and Yelahanka also expressed similar concerns, even though election officials have clearly said that no ongoing work or emergency services should be affected during the election period. 
 
 As per election commission rules, the restriction is only on launch of new projects, calling of fresh tenders and issuing fresh work orders, a senior BBMP official said.
