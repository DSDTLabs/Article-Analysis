Vijayawada: Because of the fluctuations in the   industry, the price of dressed chicken, which touched Rs 200 per kg in December, has come down in the range of Rs 150. While this is good news for   lovers, the poultry industry is worried as the bird is fetching poor price. 

 Spread of viral diseases and poor growth of birds is affecting the prices, said poultry   in Krishna district.
 
 “Viral diseases and excessive production have badly affected the prices. A live bird, which cost Rs 145 per kilogram a month ago now costs only Rs 95, creating problems for the poultry industry,” said K Rama Rao, a poultry farmer from Unguturu.
 
 “Expenditure on chicken, feed, and manpower has doubled in the past two years, and we are able to sustain only because of the better prices which we got earlier,” he said.
 
 Ramu Paladugu, a poultry farmer from Kankipadu, said: “Cost of broiler chicken has fallen by 25 % in the past five days. We are not even getting our investments back. We are not even able to feed the birds, and with this price, we are now only clearing the stocks.”
 
 Meanwhile, denizens are lapping up chicken, and sale of broiler chicken has increased by almost 50% in retail markets in the city. “We are ordering huge stocks considering the sale,” said M Venkateswara Rao, a retail seller from Mahanti Market.
 
 “Consumers, who usually buy lesser quantities, are now taking home bigger quantities. We estimate that the price of chicken will stagnate at this point until the second week of April,” he said.
 
 Kambala Padmavati, a homemaker, said, “We had almost stopped consuming chicken for the past six months or so, considering the exorbitant prices. The sudden fall in prices is a good news. We hope the government regulates the price of eggs, which is increasing every day.”
 
 Meanwhile, eateries and restaurants in the city are offering special discounts on chicken dishes.
