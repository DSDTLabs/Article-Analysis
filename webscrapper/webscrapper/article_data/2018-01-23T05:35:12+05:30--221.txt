PATIALA: After having swept the   MC elections,   councillors who met on Monday to elect the next mayor, decided to throw the ball in chief minister Amarinder Singhâ€™s court, claiming that the name finalized by the top boss would be acceptable to all. 

 The 59 councillors assembled at the local Circuit House and held a meeting, which was presided over by cabinet minister Sadhu Singh  . Prior to the meeting, name of Sanjeev Bittu, who had been the leader of the Opposition for the last five years when the SAD-BJP alliance was calling the shots in the local civic body, along with   Jogi, Krishan Chand Bandhu, Kamlesh Malhotra and Harvinder Singh Nippy, were doing the rounds.
 
 However, as the meeting started, Dharamsot had a one-to-one interaction with the elected representatives to know their choice for the post. Later, the minister proposed that the decision in this regard should be left to the chief minister, to which all councillors agreed in unanimity. Later, Dharamsot said all councillors had approved of the decision and he would soon request Amarinder to announce the name of the next mayor. 
 
 Cabinet minister   said the decision taken by Amarinder would be in the interest of the city, which had faced utter neglect during the SAD-BJP rule as far as developmental works were concerned.
