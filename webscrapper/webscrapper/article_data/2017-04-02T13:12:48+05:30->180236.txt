 Mel C said she felt 'really uncomfortable' with her   persona in the   as it was untrue to her real self. 

 The 43-year-old singer, whose real name is  , said the perception of her being a "bolshy, mouthy and aggressive" female was wrong.
 
  
  
 "In the band, there was power in numbers and we egged one another on. As Sporty Spice, I felt I was portrayed as being quite bolshy, mouthy and aggressive and that has never been me. I felt really uncomfortable with this portrayal. When you're in your early 20s, you are trying to figure out who you are anyway. I hate confrontation and, in the band, I was the diplomat. I've always been very low key and put up with stuff. I just got to a point where I realised it wasn't serving me well. I had to take responsibility for myself," she said.
