The probe into the car crash that killed model   finally seemed to be gathering pace a week after her death, with five of her friends telling cops that they saw actor   drinking alcohol before taking the wheels.

 Cops interrogated the five friends on Monday and recorded their statements.
 
 “All of them contradicted the main thrust of Chatterjee's statement to the media, that he was not intoxicated when he was driving,“ said a senior officer. “The friends are common to both Chauhan and Chatterjee,“ he said.
 
 Police have maintained secrecy in this accident probe from day one and refused to share any information, claiming they are still “collecting and collaborating“ CCTV details.
