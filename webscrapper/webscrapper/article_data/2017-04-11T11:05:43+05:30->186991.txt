PUNE: Minister of state for water resources   has mooted a “water tax with water meters” for buildings in the fringe areas even if they are illegal.

 Nearly 20-30% of the city’s water is being used by constructions in the gram panchayats.   will approach the urban development department and the legal department to make amendments to ensure accountability for water usage.
 
 “For years, the fringe areas and the outskirts have been using water. An assessment tax of an illegal building can be collected without regularisation of the structure. We may install water   here and occupants can pay  ,’’ Shivtare said on the sidelines of the canal committee meeting.
 
 The tax collection will not make the structure legal and it can be pulled down, he added.
 
 Municipal commissioner   said as per the rules, the civic body has to supply water to gram panchayats in the periphery which distributes it to buildings in a five-km periphery. 
 
 “Any decision about providing water needs the general body’s approval. We have to check if there is adequate water for distribution. If it is done for one area, others will demand it. The process needs legal approval as pointed out by guardian minister Girish Bapat in the meeting,’’ Kumar told TOI. 
 
 Metered water supply will fetch the civic body revenue and there will be more accountability.
