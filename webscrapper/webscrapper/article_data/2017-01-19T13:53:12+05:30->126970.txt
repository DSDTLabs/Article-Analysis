KENDRAPADA: In the lead up to the  , bridges suspended in various stages of incompletion in the district have assumed political significance like never before. 

 A 350-metre-long bridge over the river Kanthia in the   in Kendrapada has been been under construction for the past seven years. The delay has made life difficult for more than one lakh people of Krushadaspur, Kusami, Palini, Earadanga, Ketuapala, Desahi, Gobindapur, Singhagaon, Dandisahi and other villages on both sides of the river. 
 
 In the seaside village of Tantiapala in the Mahakalapada block, a bridge being rebuilt for the last three years over the crocodile-infested waters of the river Hansua, has taken on similar political importance in the run up to the elections. 
 
 The 35-year-old Bailey bridge collapsed in March of 2014, effectively cutting off 25 villages with a population of more than one lakh from the main land. Authorities had promised to reconstruct it within a year. 
 
 "The construction of a 100 metre bridge should not take more than a year. Many villagers are angry and have decided to teach authorities a lesson with their votes in the polls," said Haripada Giri, a villager of Tantiapala. 
 
 Elders of the Ramanagar village vividly recall a 1990 speech at Mahakalapada by  , in which the then chief minister of the state had promised a bridge over the Mahanadi river at Bahakuda Ghat so that locals can easily reach Paradip.
 
 "Nearly a dozen bridges have not been completed in the district even though ruling party leaders, at the time of laying foundation stones of the bridges, promise to complete construction within a year or two," said Debendra Sharma, Aul MLA and president of the district  .
 
 "The state government has constructed as many as 20 bridges within 17 years in the district, and the incomplete bridges will be completed soon," said senior BJD leader Dhiren Kumar Sahoo.
