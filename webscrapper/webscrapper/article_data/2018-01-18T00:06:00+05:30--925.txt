Pune: This evening, the Yashwantrao Chavan Natyagruha will echo with compositions of noted vocalist and music director Hridaynath Mangeshkar. Through the next four days, the venue will host various events to celebrate 100 years of Balwant Sangeet Mandali, which was established on January 18, 1918, by Master Deenanath Mangeshkar, Chintamanrao Kolhatkar and Krishnarao Kolhapure. In commemoration, Pune-based Naadbrahma Parivar and Nagpur-based zonal cultural centre have organized a music-theatre festival between January 18 and 21, stated the Directorate of Cultural Affairs. Hridaynath Mangeshkar and Sawani Ravendra will present Swara Hridayantari, a four-hour concert featuring Deenanath Mangeshkar’s most celebrated work. “The festival will begin with the inauguration of an exhibition showcasing rare photographs of Deenanath Mangeshkar and Balwant Sangeet Mandli by MLA Medha Kulkarni. This will be followed by the opening of the festival by Hridaynath Mangeshkar,” said Ravindra Ghangurde, chief trustee of Naadbrahma Parivar. A short film titled Deenayan made by Naadbrahma will be screened after the inauguration. “The hour-long movie celebrates the life of Deenanath Mangeshkar and the mandali. Along with dramatized sequences of his life, the movie will also have videos and photos of Mangeshkar,” said Ghangurde.  Performances planned over January 19 and 20 include musicals Katyar Kaljat Ghusli and Sangeet Sanyasta Khadga.  On the last day of the festival, city-based Anahaat Sangeet will stage the musical Maanapmaan.
