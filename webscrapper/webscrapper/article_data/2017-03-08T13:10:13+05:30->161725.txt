VASCO: Officials of Mormugao Municipal Council (MMC) along with members of   (GSUDA) carried out an inspection to assess the progress of clearing the garbage dump at  , ahead of setting up a new waste treatment plant at the same location. 

  across three sheds, the plant at Sada had been non-functional for over a decade, thus leading to accumulation of a huge amount of untreated garbage. MMC has decided to vacate the dump and level the plant to make space for a new one. 
 
 MMC chief officer Deepali Naik said, “There is about 70,000 metric tonnes of garbabge which needs to be cleared before setting up the new plant. About 15,000 metric tonnes of garbage has been removed. The place is levelled and we can now think of getting a segregating and treating machine here itself to clear the dump faster.” tnn
