PANAJI: The surge of mercury continued to cause discomfort and burn new records, as the   recorded on Thursday the highest maximum   of 36.6 degrees Celsius in February during the last decade.

  “The temperature of 36.6 degrees Celsius recorded on Thursday was the highest during the last ten years,” S D Sanap, scientist, meteorological centre at Altinho said. The highest surge of mercury in February during this decade was a maximum temperature of 36.5 degrees Celsius recorded earlier on February 28, 2012. 
 
 The very next year, an identical temperature was noted by the centre on February 15, 2013. 
 
 A few days ago on Valentine’s day and February 15, the same temperature of 36.5 degrees was recorded twice, making it four times in just five years. The sultry heat on Thursday may have been just 0.1 degree above the earlier record, but it was 4.7 degrees above normal. The highest point mercury has soared during February all time was February 29, 1984 when meteorological centre had recorded 38.0 degrees Celsius. 
 
 The late setting in of sea breezes that bring in some coolness has been attributed to the higher temperatures. “The easterly component of winds was strong for a few days,” Sanap said. This was a   noticed not only in Goa but also Mumbai. The westerly sea breezes start blowing by 10am in the morning, but the easterly winds being more powerful, the heat persisted till afternoon and beyond, too.
 
 But on Friday, there was some relief as the westerly winds resumed as usual and the maximum temperature came down to 34.5 degrees Celsius, just 2.6 degrees above normal. The mercury is not expected to rise high in the next few days while the minimum temperature has been in the range of 22.0 degrees Celsius, within normal range.
