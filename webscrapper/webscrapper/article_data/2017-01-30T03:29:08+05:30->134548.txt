GURUGRAM: Reeling under criticism following frequent power outages in the district for the past few weeks, power officials in the city are leaving no stone unturned to tackle   power woes.

 Three new 220 KV power houses will be set up in sectors 57, 33 and 20 to cater to the increased demand in summers, power officials told TOI on Sunday. In a bid to further augment the existing power infrastructure, as many as ten 66/11 KV   will be replaced across the city.
 
 “We will get the entire infrastructure ready before summers,” said Anil Yadav, superintendent engineer,   ( ).
 
 The average demand of electricity in the Gurgaon circle during summers shoots up to around 1,400 MV. In winters, the average demand is 600MV. 
 
 Boosting existing infrastructure with new power houses and replacement of ten transformers would give the city an additional 1020 MVA (mega volt ampere) of power supply before summers, said officials.
 
 The authorities are planning to convert the existing substation in Sector 15 into a   for the areas near MG Road and Udyog Vihar. The supply for this powerhouse will be drawn from the power house in Sector 72. 
 
 The discom is also eyeing capacity enhancement of the 66 KV substation in Sector 34 and the creation of a 66 KV Gas Insulated Station (GIS) substation in Sector 46. Other localities including sectors 38, 46 and 58 will also benefit with augmentation in infrastructure.
 
 It may be recalled that last year in September, officials from HVPNL and Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) came together to finalise the integrated planning for the fiscal year 2020-21 and 2021-22 for the Gurgaon circle.
 
 The project, expected to be completed in three years, will take up Gurgaon's power generation capacity from 1,600 MVA to 1,920 MVA.
