PUNE: With several colleges being granted autonomous status, second and third-year students of these colleges appearing for term-end examinations are facing problems with respect to exam centres.

 According to the rules, autonomous colleges cannot be treated as exam centres. Hence, the students have to travel to distant colleges to write their papers.
 
 So, Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) was forced to allot other colleges for conducting exams. The problem is being mainly faced by students in rural areas of Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar. The exams began on Wednesday.
 
 Surabhi Mohite, a second-year arts student, said, "We were told by the college that the exam centre has been changed. We even received hall tickets and just four to five days before the exam, the information about the change in the centre was communicated to us. We are now making last-minute plans to reach the centre."
 
 Another third-year arts student   was earlier allotted the   centre in Yerawada, which was later changed to St Vincentâ€™s Commerce College in Camp, which is at least five kilometres apart.
 
 "I stay close to Don Bosco, and with the change in the centre, I am forced to travel the distance to write my paper. It will take me at least 40 minutes to cover five kilometre distance during peak traffic hours. "
 
 The circular stated that it would be the responsibility of the college previously allotted to inform the students about change in the exam centre. Controller of examination, SPPU,   said, "The situation has arisen because some colleges have been granted autonomous status and hence they cannot be treated as exam centres. The previous exam centre was asked to inform all the students regarding the changes. And the varsity would ensure that no student faces any difficulty due to these changes."
