HYDERABAD:  , the first suspect to be picked up after the blast, said prosecution had no interest in seeking conviction for the accused.

 Detained in jail for seven months, Shoeb Jagirdar, 57, recounted how he was subjected to third degree interrogation by the police to extract a confession about his involvement in the Mecca Masjid blast case. “I suffered a lot as they falsely implicated me in the case and soon everyone socially boycotted my family,” said Jagirdar.
 
 On June 26, 2007, sleuths of Special Investigation Cell constituted by the then commissioner of police Balwinder Singh, arrested Jagirdar, a kerosene dealer from Jalna, Maharashtra. Allegations levelled against him were that he helped one alleged Lashkar-e-Taiba activist to conduct a recee of the grand mosque.
 
 “I was stunned to hear the allegations levelled against me. I could barely hold my tears each time they said I was a traitor,” said Jagirdar. The then Task Force inspector M Ramchandran, who was a part of the SIC, filed a complaint with the CCS against Jagirdar,   Nayeem and Mohammed Imran Khan for waging war against the nation and under Indian Passport Act. SIC sleuths in the FIR said that during the investigation, they came to know that Nayeem, who was arrested by the   near Kolkata along with two Pakistanis and a Kashmiri, got help from Jagirdar in Hyderabad.
 
 Cops claimed that Nayeem after signing the passport application at Secundrabad, went around the city and carried a handycam with him to videograph important places in Hyderabad.
 
 “I was even forced to undergo a   in Bangalore and it was clear that they were hell bent on framing me as an accused,” said Jagirdar, who secured bail after spending seven months in jail.
