Bharuch: The work to construct a toll tax collection plaza near the newly built cable-stayed four lane bridge over River Narmada in Bharuch has come in for criticism. 

 Congress leader Ahmed Patel in his tweet mentioned that Rs379 crore was sanctioned under engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) basis for the project by the central government and no tax was to be collected from people. 
 
 He tweeted on Saturday, "Shocked to see work on toll booth for Bharuch bridge. UPA government had sanctioned this project on EPC basis to protect people from the levy of toll tax. Nitin Gadkariji, please look into it." 
 
 Nazu Fadwala, Congress leader, said: “Congress will launch a mass movement against this.”
