 An embarrassed   said it “disagreed completely” with Khurshid. “All leaders must remember that such unfounded statements only help the cause of those in power today who seek to divide society on caste and communal lines to retain and attain power at any cost,” party spokesman   said. 
 
 Asked if the party would take action against Khurshid, Punia evaded a direct reply, saying he need not add to what he had said.

Asked by reporters on Tuesday if he would stick to his comment, Khurshid said, “Have you ever known me to withdraw a statement? What I said, I will continue to say. What I didn't say, I will never say.” Asked if he made the remarks as a member of Congress, Khurshid replied he did so “as a human being”.
 
 “It’s the party that has given everything that I have today. And why should I step aside when my party is attacked? I must answer anyone who attacks my party and I do it to the best of my ability,” he added.
