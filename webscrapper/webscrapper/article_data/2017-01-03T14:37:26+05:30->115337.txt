MUMBAI: In a relief to Cellular operators, the   vacation bench on Friday ordered a status quo to prevent   from attaching properties for 15 days from December 23, over alleged  .

 Pune municipal corporation said it has to recover over Rs 332 crore from mobile tower owners and service providers till date.
 
 Vacation judge Justice K K Tated was hearing petitions for urgent relief filed by Bharti airtel and Idea Cellular among others for relief against action being taken by the state and Pune Municipal Corporation. Idea Cellular said it was issued notice for 246 mobile towers.
 
 Venkatesh Dhond, senior counsel for the cellular opertaors said that the civic body had issued a notice dated December 21, 2016 to Bharti Cellular asking it to pay property tax along with a penalty for their mobile towers. Civic authorities also issued warrants to attach their mobile towers under Taxation Rules of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporations Act.
 
 Dhond said, despite having 15 days in law to make the payment, before an actual attachment can take place, and despite the notice being received on December 23, civic administration had begun taking steps to seal and attach the properties of the Cellular companies.
 The Pune corporation counsel Vishwanath Patil, vehemently opposed the grant of any immediate relief, the court order observed. Patil said that the corporation had issued demand notices several times and hence there was no need to wait for 15 days to attach their properties.
  
 Justice Tated, however said that under the rules, Municipal corporation has to wait for 15 days before acting on the attachment warrant. â€œIn case if amount is not paid within 15 days, then they can take action according to law," said the judge directing both sides to maintain a status quo, asked the corporation to file its reply before January 4.
