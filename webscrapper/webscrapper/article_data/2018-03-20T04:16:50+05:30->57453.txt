MUMBAI: The   government would explore the possibility of amending the 2015 Act that bans slaughter of cows so that bovines with certain infections can be culled, minister of state for animal husbandry Arjun   said in the legislative assembly on Monday. 

 He was replying to a query raised in this regard by leader of opposition Radhakrishna  . "We will explore the possibility of introducing an amendment in the cattle slaughter ban (law) so that farmers can cull infected animals," Khotkar said.
 
 Besides cows, the Maharashtra Animal Preservation (Amendment) Act, 2015 bans slaughter of bulls, bullocks and calves and makes such slaughter a non-bailable offence, with punishment of five years.
 
 MLAs in the   raised the issue of veterinary doctors contracting Brucellosis infection through bovines while treating them. Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria Brucella, which is transmitted from animals to humans by ingestion of milk or meat or close contact with infected animals.
 
 Asserting that the state government has taken preventive measures, the minister said over 1,47,568 calves from Nagpur region have been administered vaccines to stop the spread of the infection. Vikhe Patil said the minister's answer showed the disease has spread and is infecting humans as well.
 
 "The problem is that banning slaughter of bovines has made it difficult to eliminate the threat of spread of the disease. Will the government revisit the Act and introduce an amendment to allow slaughter of infected animals?" the   leader asked. To this, Khotkar said the government would explore the possibility of bringing such an amendment.
