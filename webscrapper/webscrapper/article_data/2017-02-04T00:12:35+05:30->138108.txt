Mumbai: A group of schools in the western suburbs has dropped a specific area in Kurla from its list of pin codes from where applications can be accepted for admissions, claim activists. The school management denied the allegations and said the list of pin codes was prepared on the basis of past admission applications.

 Activist Jeetendra Gupta said a neighbour could not apply for admission for his child at   School in Bandra (E) as the pin code 400070 (Kurla west) was not listed in the online admission form despite its proximity to the school. “The school is discriminating on the basis of residence. Kurla hasn’t been included on the list, while Dadar, Matunga and areas farther away are on it,” he claimed.
 
 But school authorities said the pin codes were drawn on the basis of past applications and logistics. “We have determined the pin codes four to five years ago based on the applications received,” said Avinash Datta, general secretary of the AVM society tht runs the school. “School records showed that we hadn’t received any applications from this area, hence it was left out. If a parent is unable to apply, he should write to us on the email address mentioned on our website and we’ll address the issue.”
