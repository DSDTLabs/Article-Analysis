LUCKNOW: As the elections for the   assembly entered slog overs on Monday, the voter strike rate came down below 60%. An estimated 57.39% turnout was recorded in the fifth phase held across 51 constituencies in 11 districts -- a marginal increase over 57.09% in 2012 -- but lowest as compared to first four phases that recorded 64%, 66%, 61.16% and 60.75% respectively. 

 “57.36% polling was recorded till 5 PM and the figure is likely to go up as several voters waited in queues to exercise their franchise,” UP chief electoral officer T Venkatesh said. Three incidents of violence were reported from Gonda Sadar and   of Gonda districts and one from Lambhua in Sultanpur. 
 
 The phase saw triangular fight between SP-Congress, BJP-Apna Dal and BSP. In 2012, SP won 37 seats, out of 51, and Congress 5. This time they are contesting together. The BJP-Apna Dal alliance was ahead in 44 assembly segments in 2014 Lok Sabha polls. The BSP, which performed poorly in both the elections is hoping for a come back. 
 
 The phase also saw `friendly fights' between the and Congress in seven constituencies including Gandhi bastion Amethi witnessing contest between Congress leader Sanjay Sinh's two wives Ameeta Singh (Congress) and Garima Singh (BJP) and controversial rape accused minister Gayatri Prasad Prajapati (SP). 
 
 The four assembly constituencies under Amethi district which went to poll on Monday saw decline in voter turnout from 58.60% in 2012 to 56.25% this time. Districts with substantial Muslim population, however, saw an increase in the turnout. In Balrampur, polling went up to 54.25% in comparison to 49.88% in 2012. 
 
 Gonda saw 56.73% turnout, a slight increase from 56.69% in 2012. Around 60.14% of the electorate came out to vote in Faizabad in comparison to 59.61% in 2012. Ambedkarnagar also witnessed increase in polling percentage from 62.12% in 2012 to 64.88% this time. In Bahraich and Shrawasti, voter turnout was 59.50% and 61.50% respectively, almost same as 2012 - 59.55% and 61.40%. 
 
 Polling percentage declined in Basti from 58.13% in 2012 to 57.61% this time. Siddharth Nagar, Sant Kabir Nagar and Sultapur saw substantial drop in voter turnout. In Siddharth Nagar, 51.82% polling was recorded in comparison to 58.60% in 2012, in Sant kabir Nagar 50.31% as compared to 53.59% in 2012 and in Sultanpur 56.53% in comparison to 58.60% in 2012.
 
 Besides Muslims, Brahmins and Thakurs, substantial number of non-Yadav backward classes and non-Jatav are present in these backward, but agriculturally rich districts. The gradual decline witnessed in the polling so far can be because of fatigue among voters, said pollsters. In this round, they added, it indicated absence of communal polarization in some parts. 
 
 Supporter of Shiv Sena candidate from Gonda Sadar, Mahesh Narayan Tiwari and BJP candidate Prateek Bhushan Singh, who is son of five-time MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, clashed outside a polling booth located in Mooda Diha area. Two of Tiwari's supporters were allegedly manhandled. 
 
 While heading towards the polling station on learning about the news, Tiwari's cavalcade came face to face with Prateek's convoy and two leaders confronted each other. Tiwari's alleged Prateek opened fired and bashed up his supporters. He gave a complaint at Gonda Kotwali later on. ADG law and order Daljeet Singh Chawdhary said that local residents have not confirmed that gunshots were fired and further probes were on. 
 
 In Tarabganj supporters of SP candidate Vinod Kumar alias Pandit Singh clashed with BSP candidate Pappu Singh's supporters. In Lambhua constituency in Sultanpur too supporters of two contestants had clashed outside polling station. Both Chawdhary and chief election commissioner T Venkatesh said that the complaints are being examined. 
 
 Over 1.81 crore voters, including over 84 lakh women and three lakh first time voters, were eligible to exercise their franchise in this phase which has now sealed the fate of eight ministers in Akhilesh Yadav government including Vinod Kumar Singh alias Pandit Singh from Tarabganj (Gonda) and Tej Narain Pandey alias Pawan Pandey from Ayodhya.
