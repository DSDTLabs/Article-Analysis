 In the  , the top cop said the inspector had failed to ensure the bar closed regularly at stipulated time. “The inspector failed to enforce the Excise Act and other guidelines,” read the order.
 
 ‘Liquor sold post midnight’ According to sources, locals complained to home minister   during his inspection on Monday that the bar was selling liquor round the clock. “Liquor was sold through a window next to the shutters post midnight,” sources claimed.
 
 However, police officials from Kalasipalya denied the claims, saying: “If the allegations were true, everyone would be awake at night and no one would have died in the fire accident.
