NEW DELHI: The   on Wednesday set aside a trial court order summoning former Union minister   in a trespass case. 

  Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva asked the trial court to consider afresh the main chargesheet and the supplementary chargesheet filed in the case, before passing any order in the matter. HC allowed the plea of the   leader seeking to quash January 8 order of the trial court summoning him as an accused for alleged offence of trespassing into an office of the   (DPS) society in south Delhi. 
 
 Senior advocate Amrendra Sharan and advocate Pramod Dubey, representing the senior leader, argued that the trial court's summoning order is illegal as it was passed without taking into account the main chargesheet. They argued that even the entire record of the case was not available with the magistrate when summons were issued.
