CHANDRAPUR: Nagpur based   Limited (ULSL) faces a strong action for   and deceiving the   administration by furnishing a bogus quality report. Officials have immediately stalled any further protein procurement from company and have decided to file a   in the matter. 

 Deputy CEO Sanjay Jholhe informed that the ZP women and children welfare department is procuring protein powder from ULSL after allocating the supply contract to the company through e-tendering process since January 1. Administration had forwarded the sample protein powder for routine quality analysis at   (RPHL) at Nagpur.
 
 ZP office, however, received two separate quality reports from RPHL. The first report stated that the protein powder sample sent from Chandrapur ZP had 23.94% protein contents. Yet another report received from same laboratory a few days later stated that the power supplied by company had 32.10% protein contents. 
 
 Officials at women and children welfare department grew suspicious over two separate reports and sought explanation from RPHL food analyst RB Kurhade who had filed the report. In a written explanation given by Kurhade, he has maintained that the first report which showed that powder had only 23.94% protein content is original. Kurhade claimed he did not forward the other report with higher protein contents and his signature on it, too, have been forged.
 
 As per standards, it was mandatory to have at least 32% protein contents in the supplied protein powder. However the company not only supplied sub-standard product, but also went on to forge a bogus quality report to deceive the ZP administration. Jolhe claimed that they are soon going to file a criminal complaint against the company in the matter.
