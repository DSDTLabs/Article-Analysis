KOLKATA: Third-rank holder   stood out among the toppers. Unlike the other nine on the merit list,   didn't enrol in any coaching centre. He had tutors at home to guide him, though. Six of the others in the top 10 attended the same coaching institute. 

 
 Not joining a coaching class didn't leave him at a disadvantage, said the DPS Ruby Park student. "I attended a coaching institute for four years from Class VII. Then I moved to  , which saved a lot of time. For the last two years, I never attended coaching institute. Most of my friends did, but I was confident of doing well without it. My tutors were good," said Archishman, who had six-seven tutors.
 
 It is difficult to crack an entrance exam without tuitions, felt a teacher. "But it is not impossible once you know the coaching pattern they follow. If you get it replicated by private tutors, there will hardly be any difference. It will also save you a lot of money and time," he said.
 
 Archishman felt he was better off without institutional coaching. "But I admit that the four years of coaching strengthened my basics and helped me prepare for the plus-two," he said.
