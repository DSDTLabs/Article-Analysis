CHANDIGARH: Bhagwan  , professor of contemporary history,   ( ), New Delhi, who was delivering the 48th Colloquium Lecture at SS Bhatnagar Hall, Panjab University ( ) on the topic ‘Nehru, Ashoka and the making of nation-state in post-colonial India’, said the government has not given sufficient thought on the use of violence against the own people.

 “People living on the periphery will always feel excluded. We used violence against Nagas only to reach peace accord four decades later. In Kashmir, the young generation will perceive the Indian government in a different way from their forefathers,” he said. 
 
 The speaker explained the presence of an eternal contest between violence and non-violence in Indian history citing the examples of Ashoka and Arjuna.
 
 During the lecture, Josh linked Jawaharlal Nehru’s extensive knowledge of world history and inclination towards the restoration of Indian culture. The speaker said that Jawaharlal Nehru was convinced by Ashoka’s glorification as the world’s most significant ruler who had shunned war and began to spread his message of peace by European intellectuals after World War I.
 
 The speaker also labelled India’s defence enhancements and nuclear tests as the watershed moment in the post-colonial era. 
 
 “After the Sino-Indian war in 1962, the Indian reality stood exposed. Nehru claimed the Chinese were military-minded people, while we were peace lovers. Social Welfare gained from the Ashoka era needed to be mixed with the military might,” he said.
 
 Ronki Ram, professor, department of political science, PU, questioned the speaker on the empire expansion being a purpose of Ashoka’s expedition to Sri Lanka and other South East Asian nations after embracing Buddhism. 
 
 To the question, the speaker said, “You believe that history is about proof. I believe that we will never know what happened. There will always be multiple paths in history.”
