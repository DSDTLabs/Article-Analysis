After Shilpa Shinde, there were reports of Anita Bhabhi aka   quitting the show as the actress did not renew her contract with the makers of ' !'.
 
  There were reports of her leaving the show and it made the fans really upset.
  
  But, finally Saumya rubbished the rumours by taking to Twitter. She wrote: "Guys relax don't jump to conclusions, all is well, I am here shooting Bhabhiji ."
  
  
  
  Saumya adds a lot of charm to her character with her comic timing and keeps the glamour quotient alive on the hit daily soap.
  
  
 
  
 
  
  'Bhabi Ji Ghar Par Hai!' is a show that brings back the good old 90's humour. The show has a nostalgic tone to it and is loved by viewers for the same.
  
  Well, that was a huge sign of relief for all the 'Bhabhiji' fans.
