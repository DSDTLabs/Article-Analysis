LUCKNOW: To commemorate the day ‘Baaghi Ballia’ turned rebellious and freed their political leader Chittu Pandey from the district   in 1942, every year on August 19, Ballia locals celebrate Ballia Balidan Diwas. Here, hundreds of students, officials, political leaders and common folk assemble at the district jail to open its main gate for a few minutes to commemorate the day Ballia’s political leaders were freed from jail in 1942.

 The celebration marks how British rule was overthrown from Ballia for three days even before India achieved Independence and Chittu Pandey was made first collector of free Ballia on August 19, 1942. The day is a local holiday in Ballia when all schools, colleges, offices and even courts remain closed for a day. Ballia has been celebrating this day every year ever since 1942.
 
 Krishna Kant Pathak, president of Amar Shaheed Mangal Pandey Vichar Manch—a prominent voluntary organisation working to create social awareness about Ballia’s freedom fighters and their work said, “On August 19, people come out in large numbers on road, dressed in their favourite leader’s attire and move towards the district jail. The main gate which remains closed for rest of the year is opened for a while to let people enter and celebrate Ballia’s Independence anniversary.”
 
 The procession, including political leaders and officials visits all important statues installed on main crossings of Ballia to put garlands on them. Nagar Palika cleans and paints every statue of freedom fighter a day before. Vinay Pandey, the great grandson of Chittu Pandey tells TOI, “Many social organisations help in this celebration. District administration provides refreshments and other arrangements, while voluntary organizations come forward to provide posters, banners and volunteers to decorate the city.”
 
 On August 19, family members of freedom fighters of Ballia are invited at Bapu Bhawan and honoured.
