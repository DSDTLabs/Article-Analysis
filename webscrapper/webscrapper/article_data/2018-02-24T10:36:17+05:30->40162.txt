KOZHIKODE: The ban imposed by the Jharkhand government on the   (PFI) is a test dose prior to a nation-wide ban, feels   leaders. They fear that a similar action will be replicated in states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and  , and plan to take steps to resist the move. 

 "We will fight the ban imposed by the Jharkhand government legally, once the order is issued," said PFI national chairman E Aboobacker. "We have not yet received any order from the government. Once the order comes out we will explore all legal avenues," he said.
 
 Aboobacker said the reason the Jharkhand government cited for banning the organization was curious. "It said that PFI members have connections with the Islamic State. Some of our former members in Kerala might have joined the IS, but there is no police action against the PFI in the state. Why is the Jharkhand government worried over a development happened in Kerala? he asked.
 
 It may be recalled that there were some reports in a section of the media that Kerala police had raised the demand to ban the PFI at the meeting of the state police chiefs last month. But chief minister   and DGP   had clarified that there was no such demand from the state.
 
 The PFI leadership is confident that the cases cited by the security agencies for banning the organization are not solid enough to test legal scrutiny.
