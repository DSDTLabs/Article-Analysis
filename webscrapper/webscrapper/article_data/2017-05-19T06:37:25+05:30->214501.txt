NAGPUR: Omprakash   and Sukhdev   were granted   by the Nagpur district court on Thursday in the Nara Road land grabbing  .

 Counsel for accused Kailash Dodani argued before the court that the beneficiaries and the informant had made a settlement before the mediator. He also said the original documents for the same had been handed over to the investigating officer Vazir Sheikh, so Bajaj and Bhagchandani should be granted a bail. Dodani added that since both the parties had to wait till May 22 before the settlement could be legalized, the detention of the accused could be avoided.
 
 Sheikh, however, countered the counsel for the accused, claiming that since the investigation into the case was still in the preliminary stage, granting bail could lead to the possibility of the accused trying to tamper with witnesses and proof against them, which would hurt the case against them. 
 
 The court verified the documents presented before the bench and then granted bail to both Bajaj and Bhagchandani. However, the accused are required to meet Sheikh every Saturday between 12 noon to 2pm.
