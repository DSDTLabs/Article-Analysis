Rajkot: Food lovers in the city will get a dedicated place to satiate their late night hunger pangs soon.

 The Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) has decided to develop one night-food market in each of the three zones. The civic body will collect rent from food kiosk owners and they will be permitted to operate from 7pm to 11pm in the beginning. The number of food joints that will be permitted in each zone will also be decided soon.
 
 To begin with, RMC will allot 100-metre road to food joint owners on Dr Dastur Road adjoining the Dharmendrasinhji College. The rent, to be specified later, will be collected from each owner and a policy for night markets will be framed.
