MUMBAI: Eighteen students have been barred from five attempts at the   examination for forwarding images of question papers using WhatsApp during the boards in March 2017. They now get a shot at the exam only in 2020.

 The Mumbai division of the   took the decision as four HSC papers had gone viral before the tests started this year (see box).
 
 Last year, three HSC students had faced the same punishment. “We have strengthened the examina ion system by setting up vigi ance squads which keep an eye on malpractices, but students seem to be getting very nnovative in the ways they cheat. Use of social media for cheating is something that he board cannot control but we can at least punish those ndulging in these malpractices,“ said Dattatray Jagtap, chairperson of the board's Mumbai division.
 
 The board makes its deci sion on the basis of the material confiscated from a student, a report from the supervisor and other relevant information available. “We followed the inquiry procedure which included giving the students a chance to present their side,“ said Jagtap.
 
 The board has also barred 12 HSC and 30 SSC students caught cheating from taking the July re-exam. “Not being able to appear for board exams has an impact on one's career and it is important students understand that. They must not forward images of question papers even if they receive any,“ said an official.
 
 Principals said the board needs to think of preventive measures as well. “Not everyone will learn by example.The board needs to take action against erring teachers. Exam conductors could be allowed to frisk late-comers to ensure they do not carry copying material inside the examination hall. All details of late-comers must be recorded,“ said Prashant Redij of the Mumbai Principals' Association.
