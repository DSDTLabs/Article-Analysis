GURUGRAM: A day after the Haryana government announced that all government and private   in the state would remain closed till January 16 in the wake of intense cold  , schools in the city seemed to be clueless about any the directive.

 Most schools in the city are due to resume lower primary classes from Monday (that is January 16) at the end of the scheduled  , while several have restarted classes for students above 4th standard from January 9.
 
 Asked whether the   has reached the   in the city, Sunita Nagpal, principal of DPS Sushant Lok, told TOI on Saturday, “We have not got any such direction from the government yet”. 
 
 “Most importantly we don’t even know if they have mandated us to close the school or just advised. If latter is the case, then I don’t think we would be inclined enough because already the sun is out and the timing of lower primary classes is from 9am when cold is not that intense,” she added.
 
 Faculty members from Scottish International School were also clueless about any such government directive. “I am afraid we haven’t received any such notice yet. But if the government needs us to close schools for primary classes, we will look into it,” said a teacher, who did not wish to be named.
 
 A spokesperson for Lancer International said the timing of the directive was silly. “Most of the schools were closed on Saturday and they are likely to remain closed on Sunday too. We are yet to get any intimation about the directive. Now it’s too late. Schools are opening on Monday. That’s final,” he said.
 
 Education minister Ram Bilas Sharma had announced the extension of the winter break on Friday when temperatures in most parts of the state remained below 5 degrees Celsius. 
 
 Principals in city schools are anyway opposed to shutting down schools in this manner because of concerns about completing the syllabus as well as annual examinations that are round the corner.
