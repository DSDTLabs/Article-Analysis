 The denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 were demonetised following an announcement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Novermber 8, 2016. The time to exchange the notes in banks too had ended long ago. However, many who had stashed the old currencies are trying to exchange them with the help of connections in banks and RBI branches.
 
 Police based on the information from the quartet, picked up Ramaiah. They told the police that they transported the cash totalling Rs 1,20,90,000 to be handed over to Ramaiah. When police picked him up and grilled, he disclosed the name of DMK leader, who promised him to exchange the money for a hefty commission. Police could not establish the origin and ownership of the demonetised money. They alerted income tax officials in Madurai and handed the four picked up from hotel with the officials. Ramaiah was released after inquiry. 
 
 It may be recalled that a 10-member gang robbed Rs 30 lakh new notes, all in Rs 2000 denomination notes from a duo from Madurai in Sivaganga on December 16. The duo, shopkeepers from Madurai, were lured by the gang with hefty commission to exchange the new notes to old notes.
