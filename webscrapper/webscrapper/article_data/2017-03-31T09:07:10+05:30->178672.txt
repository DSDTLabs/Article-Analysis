AHMEDABAD: When   arrived on Indian shores along with thousands of Polish nationals, mostly women and children, in 1942, he did not know where he would land up. They were refugees of World War II and were devoid of clothes, food and most of all, hope. 

 "But then Jamsaheb gave us shelter at Balachadi. From 1942 to 1946, India became our second home and thus this land is encased in my heart forever," says Stypula who has written several poems on Polish in India,   and Balachadi, calling the hill at Balachadi a mother calling out to her Polish children.
 
 Stypula was in Ahmedabad along with a crew from Poland shooting for a docu-drama on historic rescue of 1000-odd Polish children and women by the then   of Nawanagar, today's Jamnagar in Saurashtra. The team had visited Balachadi and Jambuda in Jamnagar last week. The film would be part of an internet-based multimedia project primarily targeted at children.
 
 Zofia Pregowska, co-producer of project, said that the story of Polish refugee children is at the heart of the work not only because it's a great story but also due to its context in contemporary times.
 
 "It is a story of refugees embraced by a kind-hearted state when they had nowhere to go. We decided to revisit the tale in today's context when the refugee crisis looms large on European nations and there is a growing inclination to close the borders," she said, adding that they aspire to make Polish children curious about other cultures and not fearful.
