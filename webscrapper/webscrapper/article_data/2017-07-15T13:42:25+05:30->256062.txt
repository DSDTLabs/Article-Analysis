SASARAM: Dissatisfied with the inquiry report submitted by  , the National Commission for Scheduled Castes has directed the IG (weaker section) of Bihar police to conduct a spot inquiry into the lynching of two Mahadalit brothers by locals at Parasia village under   of the district on June 29. The brothers – Baban Musahar (40) and Murahu Musahar (35) – were killed when they allegedly tried to enter a house for committing theft. 

 Commission’s member Dr Yogendra Pasawan passed the direction on Thursday, when Rohtas DM and SP appeared before him with the corresponding status report during the hearing of the case in New Delhi.
 
 Sources said the commission was dissatisfied with the investigation report of the police as not a single culprit has been identified even after a fortnight of the incident. Sources added though Sasaram SP has confirmed the incident of lynching in his report, the charges have been framed against unknown persons.
 
 The commission, while expressing its concern over the role of police and district administration in inquiry, directed Rohtas SP M S Dhillon to identify the culprits responsible for lynching and ensure their immediate arrest. 
 
 Rohtas DM A K Parasar told the commission that a compensation of Rs 4.62 lakh has already been given to family members of the deceased and the process for extending other benefits under the SC/ST Atrocity Act would also be completed soon.
 
 Sources said the commission also expressed its annoyance over lodging of a theft case against the deceased Mahadalt brothers after five days of the alleged crime. The commission reportedly described the act an attempt to save the skin of the culprits.
 
 Sources said the FIR was lodged after the commission took cognizance of the case and issued instructions to investigate the matter. Incidentally, Rohtas SP had visited the spot after one week of the incident.
