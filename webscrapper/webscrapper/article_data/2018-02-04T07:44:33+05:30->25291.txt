"The offenders were nabbed from different localities including Habeeb Nagar, Mallepally, Sitarambagh, Bazaarghat. They were detained in the police station and their family members were called there so that they could be present during the counselling wherein they were told about the health hazards of smoking. We also registered cases against them for violating norms in public places," said, P  , station house officer of Habeeb Nagar police station.
 
 So far the police have nabbed 57 people for the offence.

 Locals from the area, while lauding police for launching the drive, appealed to the city police commissioner to extend it to other parts of the city.
