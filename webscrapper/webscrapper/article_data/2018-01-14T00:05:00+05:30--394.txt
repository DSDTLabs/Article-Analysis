Through everyday routines, morning shaving regimes and tasks that involve basic grooming, hacks come in handy to save time and energy. So, while getting ready in the morning, follow these tricks to make sure you reach work early and yet, look clean and groomed.

 
 To avoid cuts while shaving, leave your shaving gel on for 5-7 minutes and then use the razor to shave it off.
 
 
  We’ve all been there. In case your ‘already-squeezed-to-its-limit’ gel runs out, replace it with a hair conditioner. Conditioner works wonders in softening the skin and helps the razor glide easily. 
 
 
 If you are the sort who cuts themselves while shaving, especially around the lips, pre-empt it and apply some lip balm on the area. This helps to avoid blood from oozing out.
 
 
 To ensure ample exfoliation for the lips every day, rub your toothbrush on the lips. This eliminates dead skin on the surface and makes the lips smoother. 
 
 
 Use olive oil to clean the inner (not the inside; stick to the opening) and outer area of your ears. Use a little drop and rub it in. Use a cotton to wipe clean. The oil keeps the wax buildup at bay and also keeps your ears moisturised.
