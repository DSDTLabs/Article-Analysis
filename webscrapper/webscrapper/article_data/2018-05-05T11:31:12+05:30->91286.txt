CHANDIGARH: The UT is likely to soon frame rules whereby uninsured motor vehicles involved in accidents, both fatal and non-fatal, will be auctioned and proceeds deposited with the   ( ) to pay compensation to victims. The Central government has directed the Chandigarh administration to frame rules on the pattern of the Delhi government.

 As per norms, a vehicle cannot be used without having an insurance policy covering third party risks. The term ‘third party risk’ refers to coverage for bodily injury and death of the third party. A large number of vehicles, especially two-wheelers, ply without insurance. At present, the owners of the   get them released from the court and in absence of insurance policy covering third party risks, victims often go without adequate compensation.
 
 As per the proposal, the court will not release the vehicle if it does not cover third party risks and sell it off at public auction by the magistrate of the area where the accident took place within 15 days of the announcement of claim by the MACT.
 
 UT additional secretary (transport) Amit Talwar said the rules would be notified shortly. “Required amendments will also be made in the Motor Vehicles Act,” he added.
 
 Welcoming the move, Harman Sidhu, president of Arrive Safe, a city-based   on road safety, said it would safeguard the interest of the victims and force the owners to get their vehicles insured. The   order issued on March 26, 2018, had also made framing of such rules mandatory for all the states and UTs.
