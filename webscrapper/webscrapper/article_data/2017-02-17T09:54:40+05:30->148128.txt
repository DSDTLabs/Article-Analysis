AMARAVATI: A former Congressman, Sanjay Agrawal shifted to the   in 2007. He faces a tough fight from Dinesh Boob. He first won from Khaparde Bagicha ward in 2007 as a BJP candidate and retained his seat in 2012 from Shrikrishnapeth prabhag. While seeking third term from the same prabhag, he feels that money and muscle power will be used by rivals.

 
 
 
  There is a BJP wave in the country, state and city. People have a favourable mindset for BJP. In last 10 years, I have done a lot for the all round development of my prabhag and I am sure my work will win this time. As I have worked as standing committee member, as group leader and then for opposition, I have good knowledge of technical and non-technical subjects.
 
 
 
  The economic condition of AMC is bad since the ruling Congress-NCP had no planning. Corruption was at its pinnacle. The erstwhile   government did not aid AMC financially, nor did it pay any attention towards it. The civic body got funds only when BJP came to power at the centre and in the state.
 
 It is alleged that there operates a Golden Gang in AMC to corner power.
 
  It is true. Some people have hijacked AMC. They are feared by officers, staff and contractors. I am sure people will teach them a lesson in these elections.
 
 It is alleged that despite being the opposition leader, you took a compromising stand on many issues instead of being aggressive.
 
  It’s not true. Mine was the hardest stand in general body meetings. I single-handedly fought against the powerful and the Golden Gang. I was not allowed to speak many times. The house did not transact business as it should have. Even though we had less strength, yet I succeeded in putting the Golden Gang on the back foot.
 
 
 
  My fight is with Shiv Sena. Congress and   are not strong.
 
 
 
  I don’t think he is a strong candidate. Had he been, he wouldn’t have come to this prabhag quitting his previous one. BJP has visionary leaders, plans for development, good machinery.
