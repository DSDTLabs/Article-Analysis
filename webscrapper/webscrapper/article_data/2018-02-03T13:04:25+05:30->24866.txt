MARGAO: Navelim Congress MLA Luizinho   along with his supporters staged an impromptu rasta roko at the road junction behind Aquem-Margao Power House enroute to nearby Davorlim village on Friday morning.

 Faleiro was enraged at the apathy of the authorities to rectify the damaged water pipeline that severely affected Navelim residents. 
 
 The Navelim legislator along with sarpanchas of his constituency, Navelim, Telaulim and Davorlim, also filed a complaint at the   police station.
 
 Faleiro informed TOI that he had urged his supporters to also file a FIR against PWD officials for the destruction caused to public property. He said that the water pipeline was ruptured on Thursday evening by workers hired by the contractor to lay Reliance Jio’s cables.
 
 “ Despite my appeals not to undertake any digging works in my constituency, on Thursday evening they went ahead and dug a hole through the 300m pipeline and ruptured it, resulting in flooding. Neither the police, nor PWD officials were responsive,” Faleiro said. 
 
 PWD Assistant Engineer (AE) M P Balan confirmed that the water pipeline had been damaged by   at 7 pm on Thursday between Aquem-Margao Power House and Rawanfond bridge . Margao town police have registered an FIR based on a complaint by Navelim sarpanch Wilma D’Silva.
