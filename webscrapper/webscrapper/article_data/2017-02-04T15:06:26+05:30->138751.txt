*   is where the siren call of India's first war of independence was sounded. Back then, it was a fight against the British. This time it's a fight against poverty.

 * Uttar Pradesh has immense potential to become the number one state in India. This state has rivers like Ganga and Yamuna, hardworking farmers and talented youth. 
 
 * In return for the confidence and love which the people of Uttar Pradesh have shown me, I have done everything I can to uplift the state.
 
 * But no matter how hard I work, if we've a state government that creates obstacles, then the development work will get stalled in Lucknow.
 
 * Meerut is the door to development for western Uttar Pradesh.
 
 * For years SP and   had been after each other, criticizing and blaming the other for corruption and ruining the state.
 
 * Overnight, these two parties struck an alliance. They cling to each other and yell, "Help! Help!" Those who can't save themselves can hardly save Uttar Pradesh.
 
 * This election is the BJP's fight against SCAM and the meaning of SCAM is -  , Congress, Akhilesh,  .
 
 * Until the people of UP put an end to SCAM, there can be no development in this state.
 
 * The current UP government considers everything in terms of its vote bank.
 
 * BJP allocated Rs 4,000 crore to UP government so that they can give health-related aid to you, but they couldn't even spend Rs 250 crore.
 
 * Even if I try and help UP from Delhi, if the state government has no intention to help the people, the money will go somewhere else.
 
 * Of the Rs 7,200 crores released for UP, the state government used only Rs 400 crore. They wanted to divert money, but Iâ€™ve asked for the entire record.
 
 * Uttar Pradesh made me the Prime Minister of India. My government in Delhi is prepared to do everything it can for the people of UP.
 
 * Samajwadi Party gave tickets to those it called mining mafia just a while back. Murderers and goons have flourished in UP due to political patronage.
 
 * My question to the SP government is, "What is your relationship with the sugar mill owners, that they can get away without remunerating sugarcane farmers?"
 
 * If voted to power in UP, BJP will clear all dues of sugarcane farmers within 14 days.
 
 * For 40 years, the Congress fooled soldiers with its false promises. We were the ones who implemented OROP for the sake of those who risk their lives for the country.
 
 * Congress has been opposing demonetisation. I want to ask them why was their minister in Karnataka discovered with Rs 150 crores in his house? What is the reason that he has not been removed from his position?
 
 * I knew on November 8 that this (demonetisation) decision would not be easy. I knew all those with unaccounted wealth would join hands and turn against me. 
 
 * As long as I'm here, I won't rest and I will not let the corrupt rest easy either.
