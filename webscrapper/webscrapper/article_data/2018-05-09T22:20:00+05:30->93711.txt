The TV show 'Chandrakanta', which started with a promising cast and a visual extravaganza, will finally go off air. The show which had Madhurima Tuli, Vishal Aditya Singh and Urvashi Dholakia playing the main roles, was entertaining for viewers when it started in June 2017, but soon did not do well in the weekend slot with low ratings. Earlier there were reports that the show might change its time slot but now the channel has decided to end the show and they are planning to kill Urvashi's character in the show.

 We spoke to the lead actress Madhurima Tuli and she admitted to it. She said, "This was a role of a lifetime and I am happy that the makers thought of me for this character. Also, it was very hectic shooting for this show, because it required me to be a warrior princess along with being a wife and a daughter, so it was very adventurous. It also involved heavy duty stunts and among the historical shows, it enjoyed good ratings. The show's ratings hardly dipped and remained stable most of the time. I am now looking forward to a good break because I deserve it now since the show is ending. It's good that the show is ending on a positive note and not because it wasn't doing well."
 
 The show will end on May 27, another show 'Naagin 3' is likely to replace it.
