NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court approved the Centre's draft Cauvery management scheme for distribution of water among Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry and asked it on Friday to be put in force before the onset of the impending monsoon. 

  A bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud said the scheme is in consonance with its February 16 judgement and turned down the plea of Karnataka and Kerala which had raised objections. The court said, "We cannot allow the parties to reopen the issues already settled in the award and as modified by this court in the guise of questioning the appropriateness of some clause in the draft scheme." 
 
 "In view of the above, we dispose of all applications and the contempt petitions by this common order, on accepting the assurance given on behalf of the Union of India that the draft scheme will be taken to its logical end in accordance with law, with utmost dispatch. We hope and trust that the draft scheme is notified in the official gazette and given effect to with promptitude before the onset of the impending monsoon," the court said.
 
  "Considering the fact that the Union of India has already formulated the draft scheme and has also offered explanation about the reasons which were beyond the control of the appropriate authority dealing with framing of the scheme, we do not wish to continue the contempt action any further," the bench said.
