LUDHIANA: The   on Sunday arrested a   for trying to sodomise the three-year-old son of his neighbour. 

 In his police complaint, the boy’s father, who works in a hosiery factory, said, “My wife and two sons, aged 5 and 3, were at home when I left for work on Sunday. Around 3pm, my younger son was playing outside when the accused lured him with biscuits and took him to his room. My son started crying when he tried to sodomise him. Neighbours rushed to the house of the accused on hearing the boy’s shrieks. They caught hold of the rickshaw puller and called up the police.”
 
 Police have booked the 40-year-old accused, a native of Bihar, under sections 377 (unnatural sex), 511 (punishment for attempting to commit offences punishable with imprisonment for life or other imprisonment) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.
 
 Investigating officer assistant sub-inspector Makhan Singh said, “The accused was produced before a local court on Monday which sent him to judicial custody. The rickshaw puller used to live alone after his wife died in 2006. He had no children.” 
 
 “It seems the accused did drugs before trying to commit the crime. He knew the boy’s family well and had been living in the area for the past about 10 years,” a cop said.
