BHUBANESWAR: Mumbai City FC survived a massive scare before managing to subdue   2-1 in extra-time of their   qualifying match at the Kalinga Stadium here on Friday.

 
 Arrows, comprising a bunch of Indian teenagers, looked set to maintain the trend of I-League clubs mastering ISL rivals when birthday-boy Rahul Kannoly Praveen scored in the 76th minute. Mumbai City levelled scores in stoppage time via an   penalty, before Everton dos Santos netted the winner in the first session of extra time.
 
 Mumbai City will face Kolkata giants   in the round of 16 on April 5. Despite failing to make it to the main phase of the tournament, Luis Norton de Matos’ boys can hold their heads held high for putting up an exceptional fight.
 
 No one gave Arrows, who finished last in the I-League, a chance against a side that finished seventh in the ISL, but the spirited youngsters fought, matched and even dominated their opponents in patches.
 
 Alexandre Guimaraes’ side had more possession and also tried to use the flanks to spread the wings, but the crosses were not accurate and their final ball left a lot to be desired.
 
 
 
 Later on, ATK joined Mumbai City in the main round after thrashing Chennai City FC 4-1.
 
 In a match that held up for seven minutes in the first half because of floodlights failure, the Kolkata franchise took the lead in the 43rd minute through Hitesh Sharma before Jean Joachim levelled matters just before the break.
 
 However, ATK restored their lead in the 58th minute through Zequinha. Ashutosh Mehta made it 3-1 in the 76th minute and Robbie Keane completed the rout seven minutes from the end.
 
 This was ATK’s second consecutive victory with Keane operating as play-cum-manager of the side. They will now face FC Goa in the main round on April 3.
