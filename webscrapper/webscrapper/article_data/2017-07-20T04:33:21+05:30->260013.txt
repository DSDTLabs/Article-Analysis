NAVI MUMBAI:   dam in Uran started overflowing on Tuesday, almost a week before it did last year.

 This has prompted   to withdraw Tuesday’s water cut as these areas had been reeling under 25% shortfall for the last 4 months. Residents have heaved a sigh of relief. 
 
  The total rainfall in the catchment area so far this season stands at 850mm against 740mm during the same period last year. 
 
 The water level in the dam has crossed the overflow mark of 116.5 feet because of the heavy rains since last one week, which has pushed the season’s total rainfall to 850mm.
 
 “This year the dam has overflowed earlier, which is a positive sign for the entire season and indicates regular supply. The Tuesday supply has been restored whereas the Friday shutdown will continue for routine maintenance,” said Ranjit Biranje, deputy engineer of MIDC.
 
 With the dam crossing its overflow mark, tourists from across   are expected to throng the dam site in large numbers during the weekends. 
 
  MIDC has asked the local police to deploy its team during the weekends to check unruly revellers. 
 
 “I met the local police officials on Wednesday and apprised them about the imminent turnout at the dam site, which needs adequate security cover to avert misadventures. We are not taking any chances and are providing proper security at least on Saturdays and Sundays when picnickers usually flock to the spot,” Biranje said.
