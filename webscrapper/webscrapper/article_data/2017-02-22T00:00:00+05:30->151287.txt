It might have seemed like Malayalis and stray dogs are bitter enemies but the recent stray dog puppy adoption event held at Kaloor, probably the first of its kind in Kochi, told a different story. Not only did Malayalis show their love for the streeties, there weren’t enough puppies to cater to the demand! The event started off at 9 am, and the organisers originally brought 50 stray dog puppies for adoption but by 12 am, all the puppies had been adopted. The organisers had to collect a second batch of puppies and distribute them to those waiting, in a second session in the afternoon.

 Organised by an animal welfare group founded by Ranjini Haridas, Aishwarya Prem and Daya, the drive aimed at sending out the message that street dogs can be as good a pet as breed dogs. Says Akshay V Prabhu, one of the organisers, “It came to us as a surprise that so many people were genuinely interested in street dogs pups. Many, however, thought we had picked up the pups directly from the streets. The puppies were all abandoned due to different reasons; the mother dog dying due to illness or injury, or people abandoning a litter of puppies. They were all cleaned and fed and ensured to be in a healthy condition before they were put up for adoption.”
 A free vaccination drive was also held in the premises, in association with a pet hospital in the city. People from all over Kochi as well as neighbouring areas came forward to adopt the puppies and were given instructions on how to take care of them, when to give the vaccinations etc. The group were planning a second event after three months, but considering the response to the first event, they are planning to hold one even earlier.
