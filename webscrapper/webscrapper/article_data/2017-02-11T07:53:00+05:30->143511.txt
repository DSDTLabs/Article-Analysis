GURUGRAM:   Bank has filed a complaint about cases of customer data compromise at two prominent locations in the city. Based on the complaint by Harish Kumar, HDFC senior manager, intelligence control, an FIR was lodged at the Sector 29 police station.

 The bank has said in its complaint that there are a number of disputed transactions which have been carried out at two locations: Molecule bar, in Sector 29, and Manhattan brewery, on Golf Course Road. The bank, however, refused to divulge the exact number of fraudulent transactions that had taken place.
 
 According to the complaint filed by the bank, some of their customers have “disputed certain ATM cash withdrawals carried out on their cards. They have informed the bank that the disputed transactions had not been created on their card nor authorised by them. At the time of the disputed transactions they were in possession of their cards.”
 
 The bank’s internal probe revealed that following the data compromise duplicate cards have been fraudulently made and later misused. It is suspected that there might be more such cases.The owners of Molecule, Bipin Rao and Manish Sharma, told TOI the bank had contacted them some months ago, saying their POS (point of sale) machines were compromised and had blocked a payment of Rs 19 lakh.
 
 “When the company contacted the bank, an official visited us and took   camera footage,” they said. “We have cooperated with the bank, but they have not gotten back to us about what the problem really was,” said Rao, who said he wasn’t even aware of the idea of card cloning. Manhattan brewery when contacted did not comment on the matter, saying it was a Friday evening and they were too busy to talk.
