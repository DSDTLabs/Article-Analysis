The   and Haleem Contest presented by   in association with   is back! And like any pucca Hyderabadi, popular TV anchor Ravi says you haven’t had proper   biryani unless you’ve been to one of the city’s old   cafés.“Biryani spoon se nahi hath se khaya jata (biryani must be eaten with your hands and not with a spoon),” he says in endearingly chaste Dakhni before digging into his plate of biryani from Sarvi with his bare hands. “I can eat biryani for breakfast, lunch and dinner. This is yum,” he remarks savouring mouthfuls of Hyderabadi delicacy. 
“Let’s face it. What most moms cook at home is pulao. While it’s very tasty, it’s not actually biryani. This is the real Hyderabadi biryani I’ve grown up eating. Honestly, I can’t live without eating biryani. It keeps me 
 going,” the actor adds. 
 The star anchor has a lot of interesting biryani stories. “I remember, while studying engineering, I would gather with a group of friends at a biryani joint and we would hog like mad dogs, literally. Five of us would order 10 biryanis and there would be a competition among us as to who would finish first. I was number one all the time because I love biryani,” he boasts. 
 However, for him, taste for haleem didn’t come as naturally. “To be honest, I didn’t initially like haleem because of the way it is made. My mother is a vegetarian and she told me that haleem is made from animal fat. That grossed me out and I didn’t try it for ages. But as my friends circle widened, I started eating and realised that it’s actually healthy and nutritious,” he says. 
 Being a fitness freak, Ravi says he definitely needs his haleem fix during Ramzan. “During the month of Ramzan, I make sure to eat haleem every single day, because it’s healthy and has plenty of nutrition. I chalk out my workout schedule in a way that I can have a piping hot bowl of haleem to ensure I get my protein,” he says signing off.
