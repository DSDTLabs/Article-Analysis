PANAJI: Goa Forward Party candidate Jayesh Salgaonkar defeats BJP MLA and current tourism minister Dilip Parulekar in Saligao in the 2017 state assembly elections for Goa. Salgaonkar benefited from the entry of Aam Aadmi Party, the Shiv Sena and the Congress’s lethargic entry in Saligao which was seen to be loyal to Parulekar.

 Parulekar quietly left the counting centre after news of his defeat trickled in.
 
 Salgaonkar polled 6571 votes with Parulekar coming close behind with 5141 votes. In the 2012 state assembly elections, Parulekar polled 10084 votes to independent candidate Tulio D’Souza’s 4276 votes. Parulekar had won by a massive 5808 votes in 2012. 
 
 AAP’s Dattatraya Vittal Padgaonkar is a distant third with 1071 votes, but long time Congress leader Agnelo Fernandes appears to be facing the biggest disappointment with 896 votes.
