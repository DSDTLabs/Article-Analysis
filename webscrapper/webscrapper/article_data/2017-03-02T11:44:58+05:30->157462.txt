CHANDIGARH: The   on Wednesday issued notices to  ,   and authorities concerned on a plea seeking intervention for reconstruction of a temporary foot bridge across the Satluj at Ajoli village in Nangal subdivision of   Directions have also been sought to take steps for building a permanent bridge.

 A division bench comprising Justices S S Saron and Darshan Singh issued these after taking cognizance of a public interest litigation filed by advocate H C Arora. The case would now come up for hearing on March 23.
 
 The petitioner informed the HC that there was a temporary bridge constructed by villagers in 2001, for connecting certain villages, including Bela Dhiani on one side of the Satluj and Ajoli on other side (towards Nangal). The temporary bridge was inaugurated by the then food and supplies minister, Madan Mohan Mittal, on April 1, 2001, who had also given a grant of Rs 2 lakh for its construction.
 
 The said bridge collapsed on February 8, causing injuries to several persons, and connectivity between Bela Dhiani village and 12 other villages was lost. With the bridge gone farmers have to walk 10-15 km extra for reaching their farms on the other side of the river. Besides, around 500 students from those villages, which include a considerable number of girls also, are unable to attend classes in three senior secondary schools situated in three different villages, argued the petitioner.
 
 Claiming to have visited the area on February 24, he submitted that got information that the PWD had already approved an estimate for Rs.5.65 crore for constructing a permanent bridge, but no further initiative had been taken for its construction. He also apprised the bench that villagers were ready to pool in resources, but were unable to meet the expenditure even for the construction of a foot bridge.
 
 He added that the case involved a basic requirement of villagers, and so urgent intervention of the administration was required.
