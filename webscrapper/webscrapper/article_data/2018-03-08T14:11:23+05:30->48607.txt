GAYA: Nearly one lakh intermediate students of the sessions 2016-18 and 2017-19 studying in 44 constituent colleges of the   (MU) will be ineligible to participate in the students’ union election as the university does not recognise them as a part of the system.

 Though these students are enrolled in constituent colleges of MU, their certificates are given by the   (BSEB).
 
 The draft electoral roll for MU students’ Union election has been published and nomination will be filed on Thursday. Voting, counting and results will be declared on March 17.
 
 Confirming the exclusion of intermediate students, MU VC Prof Qamar Ahsan said, “The university recognises only degree students including post graduate degree aspirants and registered scholars for the PhD course,” and added, “The elections are being held as per the statute framed by the university.”
 
 The statute for Union elections has been framed by adopting almost all the recommendations contained in the famous   report. The Lyngdoh Committee did not recognise intermediate students as part of the university system, say sources.
 
 On the other hand, students have condemned their exclusion. “Our exclusion from the entire Union election process violates the Right to Equality guaranteed by the Constitution,” an intermediate student Anil Kumar said.
 
 “We also pay tuition fee and are equally affected by the lack of amenities including library, laboratory, play field and common room,” an aggrieved student said.
 
 ABVP leader Rupesh Kumar said it is too late for the inclusion of intermediate students. “The student body would take up the cudgel on behalf of the left over section of the student community from the next session,” said Kumar.
