NAVI MUMBAI: Following the   incident that took place towards the end of December, the   (NMMC) has chalked out plans to hold   at various schools, colleges, malls, shopping centres, crowded places and housing societies to train people with fire fighting skills and measures to deal with emergency situations. The NMMC fire department has kicked off the drive from a Sanpada school and will cover other institutions as well.

 The NMMC is prompt to come out with an appropriate and consolidated plan and strategies to overcome such contingency situations in Navi Mumbai. 
 
 The civic body has tightened the noose on hoteliers and commercial establishments and have asked them to take immediate measures to revive the fire safety NOC. The civic body’s fire department has started creating awareness among people on how to tackle the situation before the firemen reach the accident spot.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Prabhakar Gade, NMMC fire officer, said, “We have just begun the fire safety mock drill. We will be showing people some rescue operation tricks. This will be carried out across the city in a phase-wise manner. We kicked off the drive from Ryan International School in Sanpada. It will be a continuous process, despite the limited staff.”
 
 Students will be the target audience for NMMC’s drive who, in turn, can educate people in their neighbourhood. 
 
  “It was a good experience. Fire safety drills were conducted by experts which helped upgrade students and teachers with safety measures needed in case of a fire,” said Principal of Ryan International, Sanpada, Muriel Fernandes.
