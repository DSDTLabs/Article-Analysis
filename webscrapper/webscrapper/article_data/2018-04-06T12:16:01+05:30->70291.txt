VARANASI: A day after actor   tweeted to say that she was not performing at the   Sangeet Festival as announced earlier, the organisers clarified on Thursday that they had done so as per the initial talks with the actor's PR team but later removed her name from the final list. She was approached by the organisers for a kathak performance during the festival but it didn't work out. 

  
  
 
  The row over her participation erupted after Dixit tagged a TOI report on her participation and tweeted that she was not a part of the event. Posting a screen shot of a report published in TOI on her Twitter handle @MadhuriDixit, the actor wrote on Wednesday, 'Don't know where this news is coming from, it's a rumour. I am not a part of this event.' 
 
 "It is unfortunate to see her tweet showing disrespect to the place where Goswami Tulsidas had a vision of  . I wonder why she put these words in public domain when her wish to change the date of her performance was not accepted," mahant of temple   told TOI. 
 
 One of the organisers,  , also tweeted a reply to Madhuri saying that her name was included in the initial list of performers in consultation with her secretary. Later, it was removed from the final list after denial. According to Mishra, it was agreed by both sides that Dixit will perform on April 8. But, later she wanted to change the date as it clashed with her shooting schedule. 
 
 "When we expressed our inability to make any change, her participation was dropped," he said adding that she wanted to perform on April 6.
