SURAT: Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has decided not to supply additional water to any area in the city on  . Rather it has started water cuts in Varachha, Udhna and central zones where the supply has been reduced from 1,250 MLD to 1,150 MLD because there isn’t much water in Ukai dam. 

 Judicious use of water has become need of the hour. SMC has been supplying more than 170 litres per capita per day (LPCD) in Varachha, Udhna and central zones when the limit stipulated was 150 LPCD. 
 
 Thus, it has reduced water supply to these areas by about 100 MLD per day. “We would supply water for 20 minutes less. This would bring down per capita supply daily by 30 litres,” additional city engineer, in-charge, hydraulic department, SMC, K H Khatwani said. 
 
 The temperature in the city at present is 38 degrees Celsius. When temperature increases, the consumption of water also increases in the city, but the reservoir is not left with much water. The situation has forced the SMC authorities to appeal to people to not waste water during Holi celebrations. 
 
 “We urge people to play dry Holi this year. Last year people had ensured that they didn’t use more than their regular supply on Holi,” Khatwani said.
 
 In the past, SMC used to supply 200 MLD of extra water on Dhuleti so that people could bathe and do cleaning of their houses once the celebrations with colours were over. 
 
 “This year there is no possibility of supplying additional water to any part of the city. People would have to make the most of what they are getting,” a SMC officer said.
