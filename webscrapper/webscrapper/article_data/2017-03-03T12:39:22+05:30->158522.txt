Fashion critics may complain that   wears a lot of black. But let’s be honest, nobody looks as stunning in black as the former beauty pageant. Sushmita showed us yet again how to sizzle in black with her latest picture on Instagram. 

 She turned up the heat as she posted a picture, where she flaunted her toned back in a cross-back waistcoat. While we were already bowled over by the picture, she dialed up the hotness quotient further as she gave a glimpse of her leopard tattoo and alluded to it in her post which read, “P.S. my #leopard #tattoo on the back loves peeping from the waistcoat ...Perrrrrrfect😅😄❤️😅😅stay blessed..more power to you!!!! 👍❤️love u....”
 
  
  
 The gorgeous actress posted some more pictures of herself, where she looked sensuous as always. When it comes to Sush, age is truly just a number.
