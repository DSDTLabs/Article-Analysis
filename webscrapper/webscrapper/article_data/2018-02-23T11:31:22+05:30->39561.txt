In a state, which is synonymous with poor social development indicators, here is another shocker.

 Nearly 97,000 primary and middle schools go without electricity in the age of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI)— highlighting dismal infrastructure across the state. ‘ And to power schools with electricity, a fund of Rs 271 crore is needed —no small sum — going by data compiled by the school education department on electricity connections for academic year 2017-18.
 
 In July 2016, school education minister Vijay Shah had informed the state assembly that more than one lakh government primary, middle and higher secondary schools do not have power supply for past three years.
 
 After almost two years, there is hardly any change in the situation as the number bears it out. The school education department has deprived nearly one lakh primary and middle schools of the basic facility.
 
 Last year, the ministry of human resources and development (MHRD) ranked Madhya Pradesh third among states having poorest record of electricity provision in 28% of primary, middle, high and higher secondary schools.
 
 The information given by HRD ministry to the Rajya Sabha was based on data collected by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA).
 
 “The poor condition of schools in the state is despite centre government’s 40% support through flagship schemes like Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and   (RMSA) in creating infrastructure facilities for electrification in government schools,” said an official on condition of anonymity.
 
 He said besides centrallysponsored schemes,   also failed to yield results.
 
 The scheme aims at providing electricity supply in government schools in the state.
 
 Findings for 2015-16 pan-India survey ( ) released by the Union government showed that 71% of schools had no electricity in the academic year, suggesting schools continue to struggle for electricity since 2015.
