PANAJI: Over the last three years, the state   (RDA) has provided non-polluting cooking kits, including two gas cylinders, to 1,474 below poverty line (BPL) families in the state. Under the Goa Grameen Urja Yojana, revived recently by the state government, a cooking kit worth Rs 6,000 is provided to   families. 

 “The objective of the scheme is to provide to all BPL families installation of one new LPG connection, thus minimising the use of firewood, and decreasing the pressure on forest while also helping in maintaining a pollution free environment,” said RDA official Bhaskar Narulkar.
 
 Every BPL family covered under this scheme is provided with a domestic LPG connection with two cylinders, a gas regulator with its accessories and one gas stove of ISI mark with two burners.
