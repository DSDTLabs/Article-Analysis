 Jackson, who hails from Britain, has made a mark for herself in Hindi and Tamil films. However, she reveals that   dancing was alien to her, initially. The actress adds, “During my first film I was told that I had to shoot for a song. And my first reaction was ‘Do I have to sing?’ I was told, ‘No, you just have to lip-sync and dance freestyle’. My response was, “I have no idea where to start and what to do. There were many people on the set and I asked if they would be present when I would have to break into a dance? But now dancing is like second nature to me.”
