HYDERABAD: If   officials are to be believed, the foot overbridge plan has remained in limbo for years owing to litigations.

 
 “The proposal designs have been ready, but we have been facing opposition from locals and shopkeepers on the opposite side of SD Eye Hospital. Even recently when we went to survey the land so that the alignment for the bridge can be fixed, residents did not allow us to complete the work. Locals have been saying they have not received compensation and there are petitions in the court as well. Moreover, even the road widening has not taken place uniformly. We are trying to seek help from the local   so that a meeting can be arranged with local residents to convince them,” said  , executive engineer, GHMC, Mehdiptnam area.
 
 But the proposal might not come as a great relief to many as it does not make provision for escalators or lifts (essential for old patients). While GHMC authorities say the structural design of the bridge will allow an upgrade later on, others say that there is a need to include it right away in the plan.
 
 “During morning hours, at least 200 patients cross the road as it is outpatient time. There are patients who come out immediately after undergoing surgery too. Given the location — the PVNR Expressway ends right here — and the fact that this is a high traffic density route, a FoB can be a great help. But it will need escalator or lift for the elderly,” said S A Farheem, a cop stationed there on Monday.
 
 Even as the proposal continues to be stuck at the drawing board stage, another FoB has come about a kilometre away, near the   campus. According to hospital officials, this was originally planned for the hospital, but was later shifted to this location. “It was shifted to the NMDC citing security concerns due to VIP movement along the PVNR Expressway,” said Dr S  , superintendent of SD Eye Hospital.
