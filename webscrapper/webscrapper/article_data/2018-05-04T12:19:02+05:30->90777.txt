Bollywood choreographer and director   has been taking things slow after she fractured her foot. The famed director, who reportedly hurt her leg while on the sets of a dance reality show, has been taking to social media to share interesting tidbits from her “#wheelchairdiaries.”

 On Thursday, Farah went on to show that there is never a dull moment in her life with friends like  , Tabu,  ,   and others stopping by to pay her a visit. While her friends took turns to sit in her wheelchair, Anil and Tabu put up a little performance for her.
 
 Apart from the hilarious captions with the pictures, it was comments by Shilpa Shetty and Sania Mira that also demanded a second look. Sania, who is good friends with Farah, recently announced her pregnancy. The mommy-to-be couldn’t help but ask, “Why is everyone treating this wheelchair like a throne? And why aren’t you on it?”

 The director is expected to be seen at   and Anand Ahuja’s wedding next week.
