MUMBAI: Ginni   didn’t like being referred to as the “first woman CEO” of  , till she realised that role models were the key to advancement of women leaders. On a visit to India, the chairman, president & CEO of IBM, who is described by some as a ‘rock star CEO’, said, “We need a lot of role models around. I did not want to be known as IBM’s first woman CEO. But somewhere down the line I began to change. I believe it’s very important to be a role model.”

 Rometty — who was speaking on ‘Advancing Women’s Leadership’, part of the IBM ‘Think Forum’ here late on Monday — said with disruption brought about by technology across jobs, it’s incumbent upon organisations to help workers live in this new era. “That’s responsible stewardship for us, which is underpinned by inclusion. Everywhere in the world, people should feel comfortable for whoever they are — whether it’s gender, religion or sexual orientation,” she said to a gathering of Indian women leaders.
 
 Rometty recalled how 25 years ago, early in her career, when she was offered an important job, she thought she was not ready for it. “I said I am not sure. I need to go home and think about it. I was not prepared for the big job. I talked to my husband and he said to me: ‘Do you think a man would answer the question that way?’ I went in the next day and took the job,” she said.
 
 In a fireside chat with Rometty, ICICI Bank MD & CEO Chanda   said it’s not easy to define work-life balance for women managers. “You have to give 100% to work and 100% to life, so you have to give 200% to have both in a wholesome manner,” said Kochhar.
 
 She told women leaders conviction, capability and confidence are the three Cs that will help them grow. Kochhar, however, said, “Equality is not to say I have a male and female, I have to treat them equal. I cannot treat them equal if they are not equally capable.”
