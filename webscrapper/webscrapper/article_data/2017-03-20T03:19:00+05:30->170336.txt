Margao: The gram sabha convened by Dramapur village panchayat has resolved to demolish mobile towers allegedly illegally erected overnight in Zamcotto ward in the village sans permission of the Dramapur village panchayat, said sarpanch Bernard Rebello. Rebello said that there was a government directive issued three years ago that there should be no structures erected on the side of the national highway (NH) due to the proposed expansion of the NH.  “There was also a government directive to create awareness about these mobile towers before erecting them. This was also not followed and the gram sabha has now resolved to demolish these mobile towers. The NOC permitting new mobile towers for better connectivity and coverage in the village will be granted only if they receive permission from the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the Goa state pollution control board (GSPCB) after the latter tests the electro-magnetic fields and radio frequency radiation and rules out the possibility of being cancerous to humans, the radiation on the human brain and body and its biological effects, any ill effects on the environment, pets and animals, etc,” said Rebello.
