BENGALURU : Normal life is likely to be disrupted in Bengaluru city on Thursday, with Kannada organizations calling for a dawn-to-dusk Karnataka bandh to press for the Centre to intervene in the   river water dispute.

 State government employees said they will back the bandh and keep off work.
 
 Several private establishments, including technology major  , have declared a holiday. But BBMP offices, nationalized banks and courts will remain open.
 
 Though BMTC, KSRTC buses and   will operate normally, continued operations are subject to lawand-order contingencies, transport officials said.
  
  
 Cab aggregators Ola and Uber said their apps will work as usual, but plying of cabs is left to their driverpartners. JD(S)-backed   said their taxis will operate. Malls, too, are likely to remain shut between 6am and 6pm. But hotels said they will remain open.
 
 Airport passengers will have a tough time, as BMTC is likely to operate only a few Vayu Vajra buses to the airport. However, all services are expected to resume by 4pm. South Western Railway will run trains as usual, but a rail-roko by activists may create hiccups.
 
 Schools and colleges in Bengaluru have announced a holiday, and   and   have put off examinations scheduled for the day.
 
 The organizers made it clear that essential services — hospitals, medical shops, ambulance, milk transport and newspaper distribution — have been exempted.
 
 Police said they are braced to tackle any untoward incidents, even as the organizers exuded confidence that the bandh will be total.
