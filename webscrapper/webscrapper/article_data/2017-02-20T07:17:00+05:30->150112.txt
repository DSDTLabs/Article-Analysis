HISAR/JIND: Having earned notoriety for violence and causing huge loss to private and public properties during previous agitations, especially during the one held in February 2016, the Jat community on Sunday announced to bring reforms in various social practices in the community, including limiting the guests in marriage functions and prohibiting dowry and liquor.

 The community also resolved to put an end on other social practices like ‘mrityu bhoj’ (feast after death) to limit expenses and carrying of weapons in marriage functions. Protesters further said that no DJ would play during functions and they would encourage their children to get education and take to sports.
 
 Such a pledge was taken by lakhs of members of the community during the ‘Balidan Diwas’ organized by the   (AIJASS) on Sunday in 20 districts of the state. The event was organized by the samiti in memory of those killed during the Jat stir in the past.
 
 While talking to TOI, AIJASS chief Yashpal Malik said the decision to bring in these social reforms was taken because it was most an appropriate occasion when the entire community had gathered on one platform. “Even if 20 per cent of those present are able to implement the resolution, we will succeed in bringing changes in some old practices, which are giving unnecessary financial burden to the peasantry class,” Malik added, claiming that over 20-25 lakh people had gathered across the state on Sunday.
 
 Malik also added that as land holdings were shrinking in the state, “We have asked them to send their children to schools and to participate in sports, which can help them in future.
 
 Sources, however, confirmed that the decision to bring these reforms in Jat community was taken by the organizers to clean the community’s image as the previous violent incidents during Jat stirs had earned them nationwide condemnation and brought disrepute to the state.
