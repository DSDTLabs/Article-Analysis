NAGPUR: A 30-year-old woman constable has lodged a complaint of   against a male colleague for sexually exploiting her for a year on the pretext of marriage promise.

 The cops, both posted at police headquartersâ€™ subsidy canteen, got introduced to each other while working as computer operators at the unit at Takli.
 
 In February last year, the survivor claimed that she was forced to have physical relation by constable Pawan Singh   (27) at his residence on Godhani Road.
 
 She claimed in her statement before Mankapur police, who have now registered an offence of rape, that Thakur forced her to consume liquor before forcing her into physical relationship. He had taken her home on the pretext of showing the place. Thakur is yet to be arrested. 
 
 Police said the survivor, who had joined the service in 2012, developed a friendly relation with Thakur while working at the police headquarter-based canteen. The survivor stated in her report that she already knew Thakur as he stayed in the vicinity. She claimed that Thakur made the first move by proposing her in 2016. The survivor refused the proposal as she was three years elder to him. 
 
 Despite her refusal, the survivor has claimed that Thakur pestered her to accept the proposal to the extent of harassing her while coming to office and even while returning home. After being pressurized over a period of time, the survivor stated that she accepted his proposal as he used to sound genuinely keen to marry her.
 
 As their relationship developed, Thakur started visiting her residence. He also informed her family members about his intention to marry her.
 
 After repeated physical relationships between them, the two enrolled their names for marriage registration in April. The marriage was to be formalized in May, but the accused did not turn up and also started avoiding her. She came to know that Thakur was having relation with another woman, following which she lodged a police complaint.
