Patel was remanded to police custody till March 19.
 
 API Uddhav Damale said, “The youth is pursuing BE at a college in Thane, while the girl is pursuing Chartered Accountancy after her graduation. After their relationship soured, they stopped meeting. Recently, when Patel spotted her several times with another youth, he got peeved with her for dumping him for another boy. He went to her apartment in Kopri when she was alone on Tuesday evening. Her mother had gone downstairs while her father, a trading agent was at work in Mumbai, and her brother had gone to college. He quarrelled with her and assaulted her in her flat and then allegedly attempted to strangle her with a cable. The youth panicked and ran away when she screamed for help and neighbours rushed in. He was arrested the next day from his residence.”
