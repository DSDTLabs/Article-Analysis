Jisshu Sengupta and  's daughter  , who's debuting in   with  's Uma, is thrilled. And why not? The teaser of Uma is trending on number 6 on YouTube! Ever since the teaser went live, there's been a lot of buzz around it. We called up Nilanjanaa and she couldn't stop gushing about how proud she is of her daughter. "Jisshu and I were out when Sara called us up to tell us that the teaser is trending. Her friend had called her to share the news and she was thrilled. It's an amazing feeling," she said.

 So, how clued in is Sara about all the accolades that are pouring in for her on social media? "She is clueless! She doesn't know much of what people are saying on Twitter or  . But she wanted to share the poster and I allowed her that. Her final exams are on and she hates studying so I have asked her to keep off social media for the time being!," said Nilanjanaa. 
 
 Nilanjanaa is extremely proud of her daughter. "Sara got along amazingly well with everyone on the sets of Uma. Besides, no one treated her like a child â€” they treated her like an actor. The extensive outdoor shoot schedule was tiring but she coped wonderfully. Even after she was down with dengue, she resumed the shoot within a week. She is very dedicated and I'm proud of her," she added. Little Sara is unaware whether hoardings of the poster will be put up across the city and keeps asking mommy Nilanjanaa about the same. "I explained to her that it's a movie and poster will be splashed all over the city. She is excited but the feeling hasn't sunk in yet," she said. 
 
 Nilanjanaa and Jisshu are as excited as they are nervous, "It's a big thing! I'm excited but I'm also very nervous about her debut. But I know she will make us all proud," Nilanjanaa signed off.
