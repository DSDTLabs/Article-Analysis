Pune: The outgoing chairman and managing director of the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited, Tukaram Mundhe, on Thursday said all his decisions were in the interest of commuters.

 “I am happy with the fresh posting and the work will be on wider scale and more challenging for me,” Mundhe told TOI when asked if he felt that political pressure was the reason behind his sudden exit.
 
 “None of my decisions can be said to be anti-commuter. During my tenure here, I received seven threat letters from the same person and with the same handwriting. It really disturbed me and my family,” he said.
 
 Mundhe said he tried to make the employees feel proud of the   and believe that it was an independent company, free from the civic bodies in all aspects. “My logic is simple. It calls for working hard or face action. If someone worked hard, I always praised him,” said Mundhe, expected to join his new office in Nashik on Friday.
 
 He said the number of bus breakdowns had drastically come down from the earlier 300 per day on an average to almost 50 to 60 per day. “I have always worked towards a larger public interest and not individual interests. Only efficient public transport is the way forward. New roads, bridges or flyovers won’t solve problems,” he said.
