CHENNAI: As psychiatrists in the city see a rise in people reporting to them for   and   addiction, many find themselves caught on the back foot as there is little literature to guide them on how to treat these people. A group of senior   in the city will soon chalk out a treatment   for handling such cases.

 In the past five years, Rajaji Center for de-addiction, the unit at Voluntary Health Services hospital, Taramani, has received around 20,000 outpatients for various addictions. “We started noticing the increase in people approaching us for help to fight porn and internet addiction only three or four years ago,” said Dr Lakshmi Vijayakumar, head of the department of psychiatry at VHS. Previously, they received only one or two cases a year. “Now we see at least two cases a month,” said Dr Vijayakumar. Most of those addicted to porn are in the 20-35 age group. “They come to us when their addiction affects their work or they are unable to perform sexually,” said Dr Vijayakumar. Most of the ‘internet addicts’ are children brought in by anxious parents.
 
 Treatment of these people were among the topics discussed by doctors and survivors at an event to mark the 26th year since the facility was opened. The center primarily caters to people from weak economic backgrounds. Actor Siddharth was among those invited to understand the high prevalence of various types of addiction. 
 
 With internet addiction being a relatively new field, doctors go by models followed abroad. They analyse the patient to look for underlying depression, anxiety or stress. Simultaneously, they put them on cognitive behavioural therapy for three to six weeks.
