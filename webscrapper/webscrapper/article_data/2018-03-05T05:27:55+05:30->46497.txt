NOIDA: The residents of   2 in   have been protesting against a sudden deduction of money from their pre-paid electric meters that they had topped up in February.

 The residents claimed almost everyone had filled nearly Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,000 each in their meters but by the evening of March 1, the entire amount had been consumed.
 
 “I filled Rs 1,000 on February 28. By March 1, the entire money was consumed. Similar deductions were made from all other meters. So, we asked the builders’ office about it and they said water bill had been deducted. We have been protesting for the past three days that the builder cannot make such deductions arbitrarily from the pre-paid meter,”  , a resident, said.
 
 Antriksh Golf View is a 1,000-apartment society in which about 500 have been given possession. 
 
 Ramesh Arora, the estate manager for   Golf View 2, said: “The electricity tariff has been increased by 88 paisa since December 8. We had informed the residents about it. So most of the amount, which is about Rs 600-1,000 per family has been deducted as arrears. We have also charged Rs 300 for water connection. We have not started taking any maintenance as the project is still not complete.”
