JAIPUR: The   police arrested six persons on Thursday for allegedly raping a 28-year-old woman from New Delhi. The arrests came two days after the woman had complained to the district superintendent of police in Bikaner that she had been raped by 23 men, including two whom she knew by name.
 
 The woman had met Bikaner SP   on Tuesday and had complained she had been raped by 23 men after being abducted from roadside in an area on the outskirts of Bikaner in the middle of the day. 
 
 Soon after the meeting, an FIR was lodged at   police station and the police initiated raids to nab the culprits. However, in her statement registered before the magistrate under Section 164 CrCP, the woman alleged she was raped by eight men.
  
 “Since most of the accused were locals, we kept the incident under the wraps. After the raids, we managed to arrest six persons in this case. The men arrested have been identified as Subash, Raju Ram, Bhanwar Lal,  , Jugal and Madan (all above 20 years),” said   told TOI on phone on Thursday. The woman, in her complaint, said she visited Ridmalsar Purohitan, an area in Bikaner, on September 25.
  
 “She alleged while she was waiting for some conveyance to return, two men offered her a lift in an SUV. They drugged and raped her. Thereafter, these two accused called up their friends, who also raped her in turns,” the SP added.
