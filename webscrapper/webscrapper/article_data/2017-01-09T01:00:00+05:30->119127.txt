Boman Irani, who welcomed his first grand child   on July 3, 2016, hosted a family gathering to celebrate the completion of his first six months recently. The actor, who has grown immensely close to his grandson, organised the do at home with his wife Zenobia and son Kayoze. It was an intimate gathering with just the family in tow. The Iranis offered prayers for Danesh and Reah’s little one’s well-being and good health, followed by a traditional dinner loaded with Parsi delicacies. Over the last six months, Boman has slowed down on work and spends more time at home, playing with his grandson. He even makes it a point to get home early from his shoots and is a hands-on grandfather who has plenty of stories to tell.
