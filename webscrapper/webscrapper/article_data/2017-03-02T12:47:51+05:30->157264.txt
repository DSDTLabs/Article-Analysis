PONDA: Close on the heels of villagers in Undir, Bandora, residents of   of   have also raised their voices demanding a relocation of the sewage   in their village. The issue was also raised in the recent gramsabha of Kavlem villagers. However, the panchayat has refrained from taking a call on the matter until the formation of the new government.

 Admitting that some locals want the processing unit shifted from their vicinity, Kavlem sarpanch Rajesh Kawlekar said they want the sewage treatment plant but do not the processing unit to be located close to them.
 
 Undi villagers have been opposed to the proposed sewage processing unit since the declaration of the polls. They had also gheraoed panchayat members to compel them to revoke the permission issued by Bandora panchayat to the proposed plant at Undir and the panchayat had resolved to revise the decision.
 
 Soon after, Kavlem villagers wanted their panchayat to emulate the example. The panchayat, however, refused to revise the decision before the new government comes to power. “Panchayat is a local self-government and can’t oppose government projects. The new government will decide on it in consultation with the MLA,” Kawlekar said.
