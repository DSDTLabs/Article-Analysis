Compared to where I’m from, Indian education is a far better option. I’ve been staying in India for a while now, but have only explored Gujarat and Karnataka, besides Mumbai.

 Mumbai is very different from the other cities that I have been to. It is extremely lively even during the wee hours. Also, I absolutely love the crowd here — there are always so many people going on and about with their lives, it’s fascinating. It’s taught me some important lessons, like how one should always keep moving. Living in a city that never sleeps keeps me motivated. I’ve also learnt to share and make friends with people I wouldn’t have initially thought of being friends with.
 
 My college experience in Mumbai has been fun — right from the first train ride with my friends to Marine Drive and bunking lectures to go to the beaches. My classmates also help me out when I am unable to understand certain Hindi words. Pani puri is my most favourite Indian food item. You can find everything else around the world, but you will not find pani puri…
