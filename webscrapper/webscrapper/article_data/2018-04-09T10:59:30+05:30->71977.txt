CHENNAI: Burglars broke into the house of a   in   and made away with 25 sovereigns (200g) of   worth Rs 5.8 lakh.

 Kumar, who lives in a rented house in   in Madhavaram Milk Colony and is attached to the traffic wing with the Madhavaram traffic police, said in a complaint that the jewellery was for his daughter’s marriage this month, investigators said.
 
 The burglars struck when Kumar and his family were away in Coimbatore to invite relatives for the wedding, an investigating officer said. When Kumar returned on Sunday, he found the door locked but a cupboard broken open and ransacked.
 
 “It appears that the thieves used a duplicate key to enter the house,” the officer said. “The culprits only targeted the cupboard that held the jewellery. The burglars appear to have known exactly where the valuables were.”
 
 “Kumar had placed some of the jewellery for the marriage in a bank locker and took the rest home,” he said. “We suspect that the person who plotted the theft knew the sub-inspector and was aware that part of the wedding jewellery was in his house.”
 
 Investigators recovered fingerprints from the crime scene and are checking security camera footage to identify the thieves.
 
 “Because the burglars used a duplicate key, Kumar’s neighbours did not hear any unusually loud sound,” the officer said.
 
 “The thieves probably scoped out the house and made their move when the family was away,” he said. “We have a list of suspects.”
