  : The state assembly on Friday introduced a resolution requesting the Centre to persuade   to scrap its project of constructing a fence along the India-Myanmar border in  . 

 The proposed fence has caused consternation here as Nagas feel it would prevent free movement in what they perceive to be their ancestral land. Chief minister   said the state government and the Naga people were united on the issue as the India-Myanmar boundary cut right across the eastern Naga homeland.
 
 "So, even if we may not be able to do much to change the   boundary, we will do everything to see that the traditional right of the Naga people to move about freely within their own ancestral land is not taken away," he said.
 
 Friday's resolution was introduced by P Longon, health and family welfare minister, and will be considered and adopted on March 28. 
 
 Longon informed the house that Myanmar had begun fencing work along the border from December 12, 2016. Villagers in the affected areas had rejected the exercise from the very first day, he said, adding that 39 iron pillars erected by the neighbouring country should be removed immediately.
