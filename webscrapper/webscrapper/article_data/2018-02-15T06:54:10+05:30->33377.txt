NEW DELHI: A 32-year-old man was shot by three assailants in   Sector 23 in what appeared to be the fallout of a gang war between two factions from Bihar. 

 Two of the three suspects were caught by cops on patrol duty on Valentine’s Day. Police said the victim, Firoz Ali, belonged to Siwan district in Bihar. He was residing in southwest Delhi’s Mahipalpur.
 
 The arrested duo were identified as Sabir (28) and Amjad (30). The incident took place around 6:30pm when Ali, who was travelling in a Wagon R, was stopped by three masked, bike-borne men. The men fired two rounds at him. Ali got down from the car and ran towards a housing society. Two of the men chased and gunned him down, police said. Eyewitnesses said Ali, too, pulled out a pistol, but couldn’t fire a shot. 
 
 While fleeing, Sabir and Amjad were spotted by policemen at a picket near the metro station and asked to stop. They didn’t slow down but the cops nabbed them after a brief chase. The third suspect fled in another direction and was yet to be arrested. A countrymade pistol was seized from the arrested duo. 
 
 Police said the suspects, who had come to Delhi on February 12, belonged to the same district as the victim and were engaged in a fierce inter-gang rivalry. They had been following Ali for two days. The registration number of his car was found to be fake. Police claimed that Ali had worked with gangster Shahabuddin till 2008. 
 
 The two accused told police that they were sent to kill Ali on the behest of gangster Raees Khan, who has about 50 criminal cases against him. Confirming the developments, additional DCP (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said a case under sections of   and arms Act had been registered. CCTV footage from the area was being scanned to ascertain the sequence of events. A search is on for the third accused.
