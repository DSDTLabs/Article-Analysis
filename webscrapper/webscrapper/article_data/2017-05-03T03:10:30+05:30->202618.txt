Gurgaon: Residents of   in Sector 67 breathed a sigh of relief as the developer and   began work on clearing the   dump right outside the society. 

 Residents said Ansal API has begun filling the two pits dug right outside the society’s boundary wall, which were being used to dump sewage in violation of National Green Tribunal ( ) norms. Huda officials, too, have begun work of connecting the society’s sewer line to the main sewer line. 
 
 “We are happy the authorities have taken note of the problem and begun work. We hope the pits are covered soon enough, which is absolutely necessary to prevent an outbreak of disease. The area has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes and other vectors due to sewage dumping,” said resident Bavesh Swami.
 
 TOI had earlier reported that Ansal Esencia residents’ repeated complaints to the developer about the dumping of waste right outside the society fell on deaf ears. 
 
 Residents had alleged that the developer dug up two pits outside the boundary of their society, where the sewage was being dumped instead of the sewage treatment plant inside the society. The pits are close enough to pollute its groundwater source. 
 
 The residents further said that the sewage treatment plant inside the plotted society was either not functioning or insufficient to handle the entire neighbourhood’s waste.
 
 The residents then approached the Union ministry of forest, environment and climate change (MoEF&CC), which directed the department of town and country planning (DTCP) to probe the matter. As per documents accessed by TOI, the MoEF&CC order was issued in July 2015, but no action was taken by DTCP on the ground till now.
 
 An Ansal API spokesperson, however, said the matter rests with Huda and the RWA, and the developer has got nothing to do with them.
 
 Huda’s estate officer-2 Vivek Kalia said, “We will work on connecting the sewer line with Huda line.”
