BHUBANESWAR: Auto rickshaws across the state will go off the road on March 22 in protest against a hike in fee for registration, insurance and fitness certificate of the vehicles. The decision was announced by the   on Friday even as it urged the Centre and the state government to withdraw the fee hike which it said will hit the drivers hard. 

 But the strike is likely to affect students appearing for their Plus II board exams. On Wednesday, students of Humanities stream have to appear for their education and psychology optional papers.
 
 Gandhi Swain, father of Soumya Ranjan, a Plus II student in Ganjam, said: "The strike will create problem for us. But I will have to arrange a bike to take my son to the exam centre, which is around 25 km from my village."
 
 Asked why the strike was called on a day when a board exam is scheduled, Mahasangha general secretary   said: "We urge the parents of the students who are appearing their board exam on March 22 to make alternate arrangements to reach the examination centre. We had to take this route because the government's decision will affect around 1.4 lakh auto drivers in the state. We took this decision five days in advance so that people get to know about it and can make alternate arrangements." 
 
 More than four lakh people travel in autos on an average in urban centres while around 1 lakh people use the service in rural areas, Samal said.
 
 Transport minister   said he would discuss the issue with members of the auto rickshaw association.
