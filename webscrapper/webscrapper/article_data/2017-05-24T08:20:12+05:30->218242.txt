VISAKHAPATNAM: Motorists waited eagerly at the traffic signals of   and   junctions on Tuesday morning to see who gets rewarded by The Times of India as part of the ‘Win with the Times’ campaign. Even the oppressive heat could not deter them from following the traffic rules and wear helmets.

 Motorists who were spotted with the TOI newspaper were also recipients of rewards from traffic cops. DVSN Raju, who was spotted at Thatichetlapalem junction, said wearing a helmet has been his habit since the day he began driving a two-wheeler. “TOI is encouraging the public to follow traffic rules. The campaign is yielding positive results and surely making a difference,” he added.
 
 Another commuter B  , who was spotted at Pendurthy junction, appreciated TOI for coming up with a campaign that is successfully generating public awareness, while Dr KV Srinivas said, “I am so glad to get a gift. Rarely someone appreciates the true followers of traffic rules.” 
 
 Organised by The Times of India, the campaign is supported by the city traffic police and   department and would be held at various junctions in the city till May 26 from Monday to Friday between 8.30 am and 10 am. On Wednesday, ‘Win with the Times’ campaign will be held at CP Office, Suryabagh Junction and Sheelangar Junction.
