RAJKOT: Seven persons of a gang were arrested by the Rajkot crime branch for allegedly cheating people by posing as ‘godmen’ and using black magic to dupe people of   jewellery and cash. 

 The accused have duped people across Rajkot, Amreli, Morbi and   districts using similar modus operandi. 
 
 Police have recovered 51.07 gram gold worth Rs 1.2 lakh, Rs 57,000 cash, three bikes and three mobile phones from the accused. This gang was committing fraud in Rajkot city and district, Amreli, Morbi and Jamnagar. 
 
 According to crime branch officials, this gang used to target people who are more religious minded and frighten them by saying that god will be offended if they did not give them cash or gold. They posed themselves as godmen and convinced people into becoming part of black magic ritual to save themselves from the ‘aggrieved’ god. 
 
 Those arrested include   (32),   (28),   (26), Rohitnath Dhandhu (24),   (35), Jitendranath Lakum (31), all residents of Rajkot, while Jesalnath Bhuranath Bloch (40) is a resident of Surendranagar.
