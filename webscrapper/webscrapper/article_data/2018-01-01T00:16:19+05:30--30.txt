Tirupur:   railway station on Sunday as the works of directly linking goods train track with the main track were completed.

 The station could now receive freight trains from Erode and Coimbatore directly to goods train track without being first chugged into platform I and then shunted to the goods train track. 
 
 “The shunting process used to take about an hour, during which the passenger trains had to be detained. But now it would take only five minutes to move the bogies from the main track to the goods shed line,” said a senior official working at the station.
 
 The connection would save time and energy for officials as well as for passengers. “Earlier, at the last moment, passenger trains which were supposed to be stopped at the platform I would be diverted to platform II. Many passengers, especially elderly people and orthopaedic disabled people, would face inconvenience due to this diversion,” said the official.
 
 By connecting the tracks, the Southern railway has fulfilled a 15-year demand. The goods train track is attached with a parking facility for trucks, which would help transfer goods from the locomotive to the trucks. 
 
 Earlier, Southern railway decided to operate goods bogies based on the demand to connect northern and northeastern states with the dollar city. From April 2018, on an average 15 bogies would be operated a month, which could be more than 30 during peak seasons. 
 
 Besides, the railways has extended the low-level platform of the goods shed line. Now, 34 out of 42 wagons of a train could be parked adjacent to the low-level platform, which would be more convenient for loading and unloading of goods from trucks.
