CHANDIGARH: The   ( ) has opposed the bail plea of corruption-accused Haryana Civil Services (HCS) officer Shilpi Pattar Dutt, who was posted as Chandigarh   (east) when arrested on August 5 for allegedly taking a bribe of Rs 50,000.

 Its reply in a special CBI court on Friday, the CBI said Pattar should not be granted bail, as her voice matched with the voice recorded during the raid that led to her arrest. A decision on the bail petition is expected by September 25.
 
 The CBI also said the CFSL report confirmed that the ink marked on the currency notes recovered from the middleman in the case matched with the one that the CBI used. It was also pointed out that if the officer was given bail, there was a possibility that she takes bribe from others. The CBI, specifically, said that if she was granted bail, she could influence investigations.
 
 Pattar is on deputation in Chandigarh. She had allegedly demanded Rs 5 lakh for de-sealing a showroom in Sector 26. After negotiations, the deal was struck at Rs 2 lakh. Of this, Rs 50,000 was to be paid on August 5. Dutt, her husband Dhiraj and a middleman, G S  , were arrested after a local team of CBI raided the SDM’s house on August 5 night and allegedly caught Shilpy red-handed while accepting the bribe. As per CBI, Dhiraj had hidden the graft money (Rs 50,000) in his garments when the sleuths came in. This money was recovered from his garments during the search. The CBI also recovered Rs 25,000 from Brar.
 
 Shilpi had stated that she has been falsely implicated. Her counsel argued that that no recovery had been made from the accused and that no role had been made with the alleged offence by the petitioner and, hence, she wasn’t required for further investigation.
