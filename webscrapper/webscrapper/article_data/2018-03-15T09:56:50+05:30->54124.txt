ALAPPUZHA: The Bharat Dharma   (BDJS) has announced that it won't back the BJP in the soon-to-be-announced assembly by-election in  . 

 Speaking to newsmen after the party's 18-member state council meeting at   near here on Wednesday, BDJS president   said that his party will also convene a meeting of all NDA allies in the state, except the BJP, within two weeks to discuss the stand to be taken in the bypoll.
 
 Thushar said the state council meeting registered strong protest over the political game played by some BJP leaders from Kozhikode who created fake news about his contesting in the forthcoming   elections. "We decided to demand the national leadership of the BJP in writing to take action against those BJP leaders for insulating the BDJS by dragging my name for their personal gains. Their intention was to prevent the move of the BJP national leadership to allot the Rajya Sabha seat to a BJP leader, who is their rival in the party. Their political game has hurt us deeply," he said.
 
 He said his party was yet to get the 14 central corporation and company posts promised by the BJP. "If the BJP leadership continues its studied silence over our demands, we will not cooperate with BJP in Chengannur," he said. "When the BJP contested the 2011 assembly polls from Chengannur, it got just 6,000 votes. Their tally went past 40,000 in 2016 and that was because of our strong base," he added.
 
 Asked if BDJS will leave NDA and join any other front, he said that if BDJS is ready, the UDF was willing to welcome his party. "If LDF can join hands with  , I don't think they will have any problem in making BDJS its ally. But as of now, BDJS is part of NDA," he said.
