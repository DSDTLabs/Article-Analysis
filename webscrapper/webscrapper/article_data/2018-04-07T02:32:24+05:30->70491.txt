 Speaker Ram Niwas Goel, however, emphasised that Rule 293 states that no decision of the speaker in respect of allowing or disallowing any resolution or question can be questioned. 
 
 He also asked the BJP MLAs not to “politicise” the issue of the white paper. It’s the prerogative of a government to submit a report on administrative matters, he added. “It is not a personal report on the LG. It is simply a report to bring out the facts on the proposals sent to the office of LG. There was neither any interpretation nor allegation in it,” Goel said in the ruling. 
 
 Before walking out of the House along with O P Sharma and Jagdish Pradhan, Gupta claimed that the government couldn’t table the report without presenting a copy to the LG’s office. It has no right to “disrespect” the LG’s office, he said later. 
 
 The BJP legislators also met LG Anil Baijal to apprise him of the violations of rules of the assembly. 
 
 On Thursday, Gupta wrote to Goel pointing out that MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj’s resolution seeking the report violates Rule 264 (2) that states a member while speaking “shall not reflect upon the conduct of the President or any governor or any court of justice”.
