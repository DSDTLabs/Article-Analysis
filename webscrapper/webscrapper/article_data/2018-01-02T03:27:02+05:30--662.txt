MUMBAI: A week after   made an offer to controversial   leader and former minister   to join the party, state   president   on Monday said his party will welcome him in the party fold. “If he joins the Congress, we will welcome him,” Chavan said.

 A week ago, speculations were rife in political circles over the possibility of Khadse joining the NCP after he shared dais with senior NCP leader and former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar in Jalgaon.
 
 Khadse had denied any plans to quit the BJP and join the Congress. “I have no plans to quit the BJP,” he had said.
 
 Khadse, who was under investigation over the MIDC land deal in Pune, is awaiting his rehabilitation as a cabinet member. Chief minister Dedendra Fadnavis has ruled out such a possibility saying since ACB is conducting probe against him, there was no scope for his re-induction in the state cabinet. tnn
