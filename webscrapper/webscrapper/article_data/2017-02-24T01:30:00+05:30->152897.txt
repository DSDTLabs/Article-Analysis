Hyderabad: City-based pharma player   Pharma has recalled 47,040 bottles of its anti-depressant drug Venlafaxine Hydrochloride extended release capsules, 37.5mg, from the US market, the United States Food and Drug Administration website said.

 Citing the reason for the voluntary recall, the company said, “Failed tablet/capsule specifications: Some bottles contain punctured, and/or clumped/melted capsules.”
 
 The recall falls under Class II, which according to the US drug watchdog is a situation in which use of or exposure to a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.
 
 Though the drug recall was voluntarily initiated by the company on December 22, 2016, it is still ongoing. 
 
 Aurobindo had received final approval to manufacture and market Venlafaxine Hydrochloride extended-release Capsules 37.5mg, 75mg and 150mg in the US in 2011. The drug is the generic equivalent of Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc's Effexor XR Capsules and is used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD).
 
 Aurobindo also voluntarily recalled 29,800 vials of Pantoprazole Sodium for injection, (single dose 40mg vial) from the US market. The recall was initiated on December 16, 2016, as some vials were found to contain powder with a yellowish-brownish appearance.
