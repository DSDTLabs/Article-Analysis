VADODARA: The detection on crime branch (DCB) on Sunday arrested Abdul Qadir Dudhwala, a bootlegger who had attacked a woman police sub-inspector for closing down shops after night deadline in Doodhwala Mohalla five days ago.

 Abdul, who was on the run since May 9, was nabbed from Padamla area. He will now be handed over to the Raopura police which is investigating the case. The police said that Abdul has several cases registered against him in different police stations of the city.
 
 “We had received information about Abdul’s whereabouts following which we nabbed him. He had attacked   A J Tomar during the ruckus in Doodhwala Mohalla on the night of May 8,” said  , police inspector, DCB. 
 
 Police said that Abdul, who stays in Sardar Bhavan’s lane, had got a call from his brother Rafiq who was present in Doodhwala Mohalla. Rafiq told Abdul that Tomar is closing down roadside eateries following which he rushed to the spot.
 
 Abdul, Rafiq and others got into heated arguments with Tomar and her team. Soon a mob gathered at the spot and began opposing the cops for shutting down the eateries that were open well beyond the deadline. The police said that Abdul snatched Tomar’s baton and also tried to take away her revolver. He then hit her on head with the baton. Tomar suffered from grievous head injuries.
 
 While the cops ensure that strict deadline is maintained by the roadside stall owners in western parts of the city, many such stalls remain open well past midnight in old city areas. Senior police officials have said that the drive to close down roadside stalls functioning beyond the deadline will continue.
