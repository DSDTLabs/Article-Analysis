On the special occasion of his birthday, here are 4 reasons why we absolutely adore Abhishek Bachchan!
 
 The Son
 
 Being born to a mega movie star like   could be extremely overwhelming, especially when you decide to pursue the same career as him. But this never held him back. While a lot of comparisons have been made through the course of his career, Abhishek has always maintained that he takes pride in being the son of the superstar. The father-son duo have in fact worked together in quite a few films - Sarkar, Sarkar Raj,  , Bunty Aur Babli to name a few. The most heartening was Paa, where Abhishek played Big B's father.
 
  
  
 The Actor
 
 Having debuted in 2000 with Refugee, Abhishek has done more than 40 films since. Be it an aggressive, yet witty cop in the Dhoom series, or having perfect comic timing in films like   3,   and Happy New Year; Abhishek has managed to leave a mark on his audience. 
 
  
  
 The Husband
 
 Abhishek fell in love with the beautiful Aishwarya Rai Bachchan while filming Guru and the two tied the knot in April 2007. This year the couple will complete 10 years of marriage. Abhishek fondly refers to his wife as his best friend. Bachchan Junior seems to surely give many single ladies husband goals!
 
  
  
 
 
 The Father
 
 Abhishek Bachchan became a father to 'Beti B', Aaradhya as the B-Town fondly calls her; on November 16th 2011. The doting father that he is, the actor has maintained that the birth of his daughter has had a great impact on his choice of films.
