MANALI: With rugged mountain faces collapsing on the highway and huge mountains with deep cracks and loose rocks hanging between Pandoh dam and Thalot stretch of the Chandigarh-Manali national highway, public works department (PWD) is going through tense moments. 

 The road in about 15 km stretch near the Hanogi temple has been built by cutting a steep mountain. It has steep mountain on one side and a deep valley on the other. The rock strata is very loose and the mountain has developed multiple cracks. Though there is another bypass road between Mandi and  , it is only for light vehicles. Thousands of vehicles, including of tourists, use this highway every day. 
 
 This stretch witnesses dozens of landslides every year, mostly during monsoon. In two years, the region has experienced two massive slides. Hundreds of tonnes of debris collapsed on the road near Dabada on December 7, 2015. A similar incident occured near the Jogni temple on Sunday evening. 
 
 According to PWD officials, the road here cannot be widened at some places as it is not safe. PWD (national highway) executive engineer Raujif Sheikh said, “It is a Rs 2,800-crore project. This is also the toughest stretch of the Kiratpur-Manali national highway to convert into four-lane. Special plans have been made to make highway wide and safe.” 
 
 Kullu deputy commissioner Yunus and other officials have discussed disaster management preparations with the chief secretary. “The Mandi-Manali national highway has many landslide prone areas. Besides, there are some internal roads which frequently get blocked after rainfall. PWD, police and other departments have been directed to restore blocked highways immediately. Police have been asked to manage and divert traffic immediately in case of road blockades,” the DC said.
