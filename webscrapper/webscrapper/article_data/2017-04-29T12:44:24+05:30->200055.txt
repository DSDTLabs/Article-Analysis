In yet another shocking incident of crime against women, a   was sexually harassed by a stranger on the roadside, as she picked up some groceries from a store near her home in Hadapsar. What makes it more disturbing is that the incident took place in broad daylight, around 12.30 pm, and yet no one even attempted to stop the offender.

 The minor had gone to the neighbouring kirana shop on Wednesday to help her mother, when she saw the accused, Razaq Mustaq Bijapure (35), standing a little away and staring. He was also touching himself inappropriately and his genitals were out of his pants. Shocked, the girl ran home crying and told her mother what happened. Her mother immediately took her to the police station to report the matter.
 
 Cops registered the plaint and went to the spot. After making some enquiries, they nabbed Bijapure and produced him in court. When he was questioned, Bijapure admitted to the act but tried to justify it, saying he had a medical problem and was attending to an itch. He went on to claim he had no intention of scaring or offending the girl or anyone else.
 
 While this is the version he has stuck to for two days in police custody, police are not buying his story.Hadapsar cops said he keeps making ill health excuses when questioned. Assistant police inspector Mali Memane of Hadapsar PS, investigating officer in the case, said, “The girl is extremely scared at the moment.I see that in many such cases, the victim is often not treated properly by society around her. This breaks victims from inside and in case of minors, affects their mental stability, too. We are still questioning Bijapure, who works as a painter. The victim's father drives a rickshaw, while her mother sells utensils.“
 
 Bijapure has been charged under Section 354 (A) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for   and Section 8 of the Prevention of Children from   ( ) Act.
