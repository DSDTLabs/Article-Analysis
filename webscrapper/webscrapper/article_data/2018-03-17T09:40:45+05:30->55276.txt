RAJKOT: A gang of burglars broke into 17 locked houses in   village of Limbdi taluka in Surendranagar district and stole cash and valuables worth more than Rs 5 lakh on Thursday night. One thief was nabbed by the villagers. 

 Police identified the arrested accused as   (30). The burglars whose number is yet to be ascertained had come on a bike which too was stolen. “The thieves stole cash, gold and silver jewellery worth more than Rs 5 lakh. However, we believe that the amount of stolen booty may go up manifold as several house owners who live outside the village are yet to give the assessment of their articles,” Limbdi deputy superintendent of police   said. 
 
 “The number of accused will be ascertained after we get the details about them during Soma’s interrogation,” one of the investigating officials said. 
 
 Parakramsinh Rana, a resident of Limbdi from whose house a gold biscuit and Rs 10,000 cash were stolen, has registered the complaint in this connection.
