 The PM also praised the hard work of the community in Sri Lanka.
 
 "People the world over are familiar with the famous Ceylon tea that originates in this fertile land. If Sri Lanka today is the third- largest exporter of tea, it's because of your hard work," Modi said to applause.
 
 Modi also spoke of two Tamil icons: film star MGR and cricket's leg spin-master  .
 
 "Puratchi Thalaivar MGR was born on this very soil, establishing a life-long connection...In more recent times, you have gifted to the world one of the finest spinners in cricket, Muttiah Muralitharan," the PM said.
