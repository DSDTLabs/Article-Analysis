Reality TV personality  's daughter Stormi made her debut on Snapchat.

 Kylie took to the mobile app on Sunday to share with her fans another glimpse of Stormi, posting a video of her holding her daughter's tiny foot.
 
 "Mommy's cute little toes," Kylie could be heard saying while rubbing Stormi's foot.
 
 Though Kylie is yet to debut Stormi in full on social media, she did share what the little girl looks like.
 
 Taking to her Twitter account last week to respond to a fan asking how Stormi's doing, the reality TV star said, "she's good", telling the fan that the little girl "looks just like me when I was a baby".
 
 She also posted a photograph of her baby daughter grasping her hand, which quickly became the most-liked image on Instagram.
 
 Part of the baby's face, which was out of focus, was seen in the photograph that she shared to announce the name of the baby girl, her first child with rapper boyfriend   (II).
 
 Kylie and Travis welcomed Stormi on February 1.
