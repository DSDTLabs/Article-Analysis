GURUGRAM: Visitors to   in Sector 44 and pedestrians crossing the pavement right in front of the hospital have to be cautious each time they pass by the area to avoid coming in contact with the protruding high-voltage   and steel bars.

 A   Hemant Kumar highlighted the issue and a brief report was published in TOI’s February 16 edition.
 
 Kumar, a resident of New Colony, whose wife was recently admitted in the hospital said that he almost tripped off the wires. “I could have landed in a hospital as my feet touched the wires, but not everyone would be as lucky as me.”
 
 “Even an accidental contact with the high-tension wires can be very dangerous. The power officials should cover these wires at the earlier to avoid an unforeseen accident,” Vikrant Dhahiya, a visitor to the Fortis Memorial Hospital, said expressing concern. The duct tape, covering the two   wires, is wearing off at some places. 
 
 When TOI spoke to the sub-division officer, he pleaded ignorance in the matter. “I don’t know where exactly these wires are exposed. The 11 kv line runs from pole to pole.” He requested that the images be shared with him so that he can take action.
