 Set in the India of 1971, against the backdrop of the period around the India Pakistan war in the same year, the film covers all sensibilities of that era. Speaking about the same, filmmaker   had said, “Sensibilities are very different from what we know today. Even the patriotism as it is in the film is very different from what we know of patriotism today. And that is where the magic of cinema comes in where we all come together and create that world, pull you into it and convince you that now you are in this world too. All the departments of the film pull together to make that world a reality and that is exactly what shows in the film.”
 
 Also starring  , Jaideep Ahlawat, Shishir Sharma, Rajit Kapoor, Soni Razdan, Arif Zakaria and   in pivotal roles, ‘Raazi’ has been produced by Vineet Jain, Karan Johar, Hiroo Johar and Apoorva Mehta and co-produced by Priti Shahani.
