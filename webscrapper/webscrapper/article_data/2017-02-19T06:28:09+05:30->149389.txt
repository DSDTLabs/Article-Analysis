LUCKNOW: With an aim at improving voter turnout, the   will keep close watch on about 60 polling stations in Lucknow on Sunday. During voters' education and electoral participation programme, it was analysed that turnout was lower than the overall average at 60   in either 2014 Lok Sabha elections, or 2012 assembly polls. 

 In last assembly election, 56.37% voters had stepped out of their houses to cast vote, while in 2014, the turnout dropped marginally to 55.15%. "I feel more awareness was created this time so voter percentage will surely go up," said former IPS RKS Rathore who retired as DIG Lucknow last year and stays in Vipul Khand. On the outskirts, Sarojininagar assembly segment seemed to be caught in a limbo. Less than 10% people came out to vote at Alambagh junior high school polling station in Bargawan and at the APS academy booth in Senani Vihar in 2012. 
 
 Similarly, in 13 other polling stations in Sarojininagar, not more than 25% voted due to castesism, tension or lack of awareness in Muslim villages. In Lucknow Cantt assembly's five booths, less than 30% polling was recorded in 2012.
