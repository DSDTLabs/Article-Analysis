CHANDIGARH: Even though the general house of the   has increased the commercial   by 10% from the current financial year, the local bodies department hasn't issued the notification so far due to some technical problem. Since May 31 is the last date to file the tax under the self-declaration scheme, the tax branch will charge the enhanced amount only when the new order will come into effect. 

 The commercial property tax was hiked for the first time since its imposition in 2004. Though, the matter of tax hike had been taken up several times in the general house in the past 14 years, the house had not given its consent. Last year, the then mayor   had proposed 10% hike in commercial property tax and the house had given its approval to the same with the majority.
 
 "Since the house has already approved the hike from the current financial year, we have already sent the matter for notification to the secretary, local government. But the notification process has come to a halt due to some technical reasons," said an MC official.
 
 A data with the tax branch of the municipal corporation revealed the branch had earned Rs 30.75 crore in commercial property tax in the last financial year.
 
 Since the private company has been carrying out a fresh survey of commercial properties in the city, the civic body hopes the number of properties would increase in the current financial year which would help MC generate more tax revenue.
