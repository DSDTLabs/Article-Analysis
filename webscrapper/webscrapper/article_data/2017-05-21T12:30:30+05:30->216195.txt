  Two teams, each led by Rajaji director Sanatan Sonkar and veterinarian Aditi Sharma have been searching in the probable locations since partially eaten body of a forester was found on Friday in the area behind Nepali Farm and Satya Narayan temple.
  
  Sonkar’s team spotted a leopard three times in the morning and Sharma also saw it relaxing it on the branch of the tree, but it slipped away. Lantana is also posing a problem as this invasive species, spread across the area, is providing good cover to the animal.
  
  The leopard was seen to be quite similar to the one seen on a camera trap image on May 18 before the forester was killed. A fresh image captured on Saturday morning showed another leopard and a leopardess in the area.
  
  Officials are therefore at a loss to identify the maneating leopard. Pradeep Kumar, wildlife warden of Motichur range said, “The body of the man was more than 80 per cent eaten. A leopard can’t eat more than 30 kg at once, so there may be more than one maneater.” However, others experts said other animals could have eaten the rest.
  
  Sonkar said all leopards in the area would be tranquillised, and scats sent to Wildlife Institute of India for analysis.
