PUNE: The civic body has proposed to set up a mix waste processing unit of 750-tonne capacity at Uruli Devachi producing electricity, manure and refuse-derived fuel (RDF), two weeks after chief minister   asked the civic body to prepare a concrete plan to tackle the garbage mess.

 The   (PMC)’s solid waste management department said the comprehensive plan on which the department had been working for the past two weeks was almost ready. Soon it would be tabled before mayor  , leaders of political parties in   and the residents of Uruli Devachi and Phursungi for consultation.
 
 The PMC administration has been working on a proposal of commencing a 750-tonne mix waste processing plant for the past few months. 
 
 An official said, “This is a crucial project to tackle the city’s garbage because it will treat the waste not being treated within the city at present and going to Uruli. The project was taken up with the   (MPCB). The board has recently given its consent to operate and consent to authorization,” the official added.
 
 The civic body hopes to commence the plant in the next 22 to 24 months. There is a plan to produce about 13MW power, of which 11MW will be saleable.
 
 Suresh Jagtap, the head of PMC’s solid waste department said about 15 tonnes of compost can be produced daily at the plant depending on the availability of wet garbage.
