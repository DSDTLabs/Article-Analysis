However, coaching centres say students are training for both exams which have very different formats. While the board exams have more comprehensive essay answers, preparations for JEE will be very different as it involves multiple choice questions.
 
 Meanwhile, to make it easier for students to locate exam centres, the board has come out with the exam centre locator app which helps students to quickly trace the exam centre concerned on the basis of their roll numbers. A student can easily find the address, images and geo location of the designated exam centre on the map and know how to reach. A student or a parent has to register once with their mobile number or email id to receive an OTP. This will help the student log on to the Centre Locator App which is also available for download on the CBSE website.
