MUMBAI: Parts of Bandra, Khar and   may again get waterlogged this year as the   is struggling to complete the construction of the Gazdarbandh pumping station at Santacruz. The civic body is spending over Rs 100 crore on the project, which started in 2014.

 Civic sources said that 15 days ago, the BMC served the pumping station’s contractor a show-cause notice for the seventh time questioning him on the delay in the work. The construction of the pumping station begun in October 2014 to bring relief from waterlogging to areas in the western suburbs Bandra-up, including Andheri and Juhu. So far, only 51% of the work has been done. Initially, the contractor—Pratibha Industries—was given two years to finish the project. The BMC stopped payment to the contractor a year ago because of repeated deadline breach.
 
 
  
 
 An official from the BMC’s storm water drains department said, “With the monsoon barely four months away, the municipal commissioner has instructed us that the pumping station should be completed by March-end. But the contractor said this may not be possible and has sought time till April. A major part of civil, mechanical and electrical work is yet to be started. Several show-cause notices have already been served to the contractor.”
 
 Because of the missed deadlines, the civic body has decided to recover a compensation charge of Rs 21 crore from the contractor's running bill for delay in project deliverance, said a civic official.
 
 Hansel D'Souza, founderpresident and member, Juhu Citizens Welfare Group, expressed disappointment at the delay. “Our group was the one to demand this pumping station almost a decade ago to ease flooding in parts of Santacruz, Juhu and Linking Road. But four years after work started, even basic elements are yet to be completed.”
 
 Additional municipal commissioner   said, “I have taken eight to ten meetings on the project. We are following its progress rigorously.”
