NAVI MUMBAI: Two   of Kharghar initiated a cleanliness drive recently called Shramdan where sackfuls of   from Kharghar's driving range was collected. Around fifty residents including   and Rohita Dwivedi who launched this project participated in this event.

 They decided to   the range, a popular tourist attraction and a total of 25 huge sacks of garbage were collected that was later picked up by the municipal authorities. 
 
 “Although our motto is say no to plastic, we also believe that it is time we stop complaining and stop waiting for someone to get it done,” they said.
 
 The volunteers also want to take this message to housing societies as well and are looking at other areas in Kharghar that need to be cleaned up. Members from the Rotary Club of Kharghar and a local eco club who were part of the event felt that this drive should extend to other tourists spots as well. “It was a wonderful experience especially for the students," said resident Dr Sapna Modi.
 
 “With this success we hope to take this practice of cleanliness and avoiding the usage of plastic to housing societies and to commercial offices as well,” said another resident Sham Phadnis.
