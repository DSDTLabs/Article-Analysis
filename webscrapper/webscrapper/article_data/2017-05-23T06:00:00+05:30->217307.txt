Kolkata: The three government-run festivals in India so far have not had any competitive segment reserved exclusively for Indian cinema. However, the 23rd Kolkata International Film Festival (KIFF) is all set to change that.   – which will be held between November 10 and 17 – is going to be the first state-run festival to entertain Indian language films for competing in a new section. 

 KIFF director Yadav Mandal said: “From this year onwards, we will be introducing this new competitive section for Indian language films. The prize money for the best film will be Rs 7 lakh and the best director will get Rs 5 lakh.” Last year, KIFF had introduced an award in the international competition titled Innovations in Moving Images. In order to make it gender neutral, the prize money of Rs 51 lakh, which was reserved for the Best Film by a Woman Director, will now be given to the winner of this category.
 
 Most felt that the introduction of this new award and the prize money will play a major role in wooing Tollywood too. Prosenjit Chatterjee said, “I have always been saying that it is very important to introduce such a section. It is not just about having a competitive segment but about getting an opportunity to showcase the best of regional cinema. We need to see what’s happening next-door. I’m sure such a competition will be a big boost for Tollywood.”
 
 An official associated with International Film Festival of India said, “We don’t have any competitive segment exclusively for Indian cinema. These awards are given to winners in an international competition. The National Awards are there for judging Indian cinema.”
 
 Deepika Suseelan, programmer of International Film Festival of Kerala, said: “We don’t have any competitive section just for Indian cinema. If KIFF is introducing it, it will be the first one to do so among government-run festivals in this country.”
