PUDUCHERRY: Puducherry Lt Governor  , who has been at loggerheads with the   government here on certain issues, on Tuesday met Union Home Minister   in New Delhi and apprised him of 'constraints' she faced in serving the union territory. 

 "Called on Hble UHM @rajnathsingh Apprised him of constraints and challenges being encountered in serving Puducherry," she tweeted.
 
 
  
 
 Official sources here said Bedi, who reached Delhi last night, was scheduled to meet some more union ministers, including   Minister  , and would return to the union territory tomorrow.
 
 Differences have cropped up between Bedi and the V Narayanasamy-led government and MLAs over her style of functioning. The matter reached a flash point in March last when a senior civic official was transferred on orders of Assembly Speaker V Vaithilingam over an alleged breach of privilege issue raised against the official by an opposition MLA.
