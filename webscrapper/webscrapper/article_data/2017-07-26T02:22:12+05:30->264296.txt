GURUGRAM:   visited the   on Tuesday and issued directions to remove the   on the natural drain. 

 He said these encroachments could lead to waterlogging in the area. Every monsoon the traffic on Gurgaon-Faridabad road gets disrupted as it gets flooded during heavy rains. For the past few years, the MCG installs pumps to drain out the water from the road. Some local residents have been fighting a case both in the Punjab and Haryana high court as well as in the National Green Tribunal against private builders who have constructed buildings right on the natural drain.
 
 “There are some water bodies in the   and   areas and the commissioner has asked us to do re-modification and beatification of these water bodies. He has also asked us to remove encroachments that are there on the natural drain preventing the flow of water. We will take the necessary action in the coming days,” said an official from MCG’s engineering team.
 
 The commissioner also asked officials accompanying him to construct a mini sewage treatment plant will also be installed in the area. “There is an illegal sewage line flowing in the Gwalpahari area and the commissioner directed that this should be dismantled and accordingly the process has begun. There is also a plan to construct a mini sewage treatment plant in the vicinity so that sewage generated from here can be treated locally and the treated water can be put to use,” the official said.
 
 Local residents have been demanding that the encroachments be removed. “Private builders are blatantly flouting all rules and are constructing buildings right on the drain. We have been asking MCG and the state government to remove these encroachments but they are yet to take concrete steps in this regard. Multiple surveys conducted here by government agencies have shown that the construction is taking place right on the natural drain and every monsoon this area gets flooded,” said a resident, who did not wish to be named.
