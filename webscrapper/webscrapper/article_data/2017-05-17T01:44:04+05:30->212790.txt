CHENNAI: Former Union minister P Chidambaram’s son   said he had not done anything wrong, and alleged Tuesday’s   raids were driven by political vendetta.

 “They have not seized any documents and cannot prove any charges against me. I have not done anything wrong,” Karti told reporters here after the CBI conducted raids at the family’s properties in four cities. He said the raids were being conducted to “silence the voice” of his father.
 
  ally DMK’s working president M K Stalin accused the Centre of “misusing” agencies like the CBI, and said the former Union minister and his son would face the matter legally.
