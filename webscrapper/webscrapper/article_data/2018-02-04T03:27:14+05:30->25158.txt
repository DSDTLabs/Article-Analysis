ISLAMABAD: Pakistani police say three gunmen have shot and killed a female   language actor and dancer for refusing to accompany them to aprivate party.

 The actor,  , was shot multiple times and killed at her home in Sheikh Maltoon Town of Mardan after three armed men broke into the house and tried to force her to perform a “mujra” for them, said police. “The men opened fire when Sumbul refused to go with them and fled the scene after killing her,” police said, adding that the killers have been identified.
 
 One of the suspects is an expolice inspector,  , while another,  , is the ex-husband and killer of a renowned Pashto singer, Ghazala Javed, said police.
 
 Khan had killed Javed along with her father in   in June 2012. He was sentenced to death but later released after paying a ransom to his wife’s family, called “diyya” in Islamic law, which is a form of monetary compensation or blood money. The third person named in the FIR is a taxi driver.
 
 Following the killing and rape of two minor girls, this is the third case of murder in Mardan in the recent past. The police have so far failed to arrest any of the culprits involved the three crimes.
