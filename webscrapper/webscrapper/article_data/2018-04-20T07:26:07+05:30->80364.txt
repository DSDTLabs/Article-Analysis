MANGALURU: He is no stranger to poll exigencies. Early in his career as superintendent of police in Mysuru,   Kumar, a 2001 batch IPS officer, who on Wednesday took over as the eighth city police chief, had just 10-days to get his battle plans ready ahead of the general and assembly polls held simultaneously in 2004. 

 His latest posting gives him the luxury of 13 extra days to plan and execute a strategy to ensure a peaceful conduct of the polls slated for May 12.
 
 Noting that policing is showing leadership in an exigency, Vipul in an informal chat with TOI said he had just 10 days to prepare for the twin polls held 14 years ago. "This job always prepares us for and we are trained to handle such emergencies," Vipul said, adding it is his foremost task to ensure that all activities related to the state assembly polls in city police limits that has three assembly constituencies is uneventful and as per provisions laid down.
 
 Getting down to the job soon after assuming charge from T R Suresh, Vipul in a meeting with senior officers that included deputy and assistant commissioners of police and police inspectors got a feel of the ground situation. A firm believer in man management and direct interaction with stakeholders, a move that allows him to understand them better, Vipul said every posting in the police department is an opportunity to learn. "Challenges are good," he asserted.
 
 Barring a term as district police chief of neighbouring Chikkamagaluru when the Menasinahadya encounter with naxalites took place in July 2007, Vipul has not served in this part of the state before. He has served as SP in  , CID, Mysuru, Kolar, and on deputation to  .
