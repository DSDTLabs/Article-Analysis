NEW DELHI: The government is now getting set to clear the much-awaited “strategic partnership” (SP) policy to boost the private sector’s role in  .

 Under it, a select few Indian private sector companies will be nominated to jointly produce fighters, helicopters, submarines and armoured vehicles in India in collaboration with foreign armament majors.
 
 The   (DAC), chaired by defence minister  , “covered substantial ground” on the SP policy in an over two-hour meeting on Monday evening. “Things are moving forward. The SP policy is likely to be cleared in the next DAC meeting later this month,” said a source.
 
 As was earlier reported by TOI, the SP policy seeks to create capacity for arms production in the private sector on a long-term basis, over and above the capacity and infrastructure that exist in the   and ordnance factories.
 
 Under the SP mechanism, six top Indian companies will initially be selected as SPs in the four segments of single-engine fighters, submarines, helicop- ters and armoured vehicles. 
 
 But one company will be able to get nominated as the SP in only one segment at a time.
 
 The companies will be selected on the basis of adequate financial strength (Rs 4,000 crore in annual turnover over the last three fiscals, capital assets of Rs 2,000 crore etc), demonstrable manufacturing and technical expertise, existing infrastructure and the ability to absorb technology from their foreign partners.
 
 The foreign companies or   (OEMs), in a separate but parallel process, will be selected primarily on the basis of the “range, depth and scope” of the transfer of technology they are willing to offer.
