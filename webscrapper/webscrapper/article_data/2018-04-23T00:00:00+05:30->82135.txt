Nandana Sen, actress, author and child-rights activist, has donned a new role — that of a mother. Daughter of Nobel laureate   and Padma Shri Nabaneeta Dev Sen, Nandana has been passionately working in the area of child protection for many years, being an ambassador and advocate for organisations such as  , NCPCR and others. Nandana started working with children as a teenager in Kolkata, and told her mother that when the time was right, she would adopt a child rather than have one biologically. In 2012, Nandana applied to adopt a girl child as a single mother, and subsequently married John Makinson in 2013, who was equally delighted with the plan to parent a child in need of a home. The couple feels truly blessed to have adopted a four-year-old, Meghla Devsen Makinson. “The wonderful Karuna home in Howrah as well as the CARA team in Delhi have been a joy to work with,” they said.
By an auspicious coincidence, the pet name the child was given as a baby is Gudiya, the title of the first film Nandana acted in, an official selection at Cannes directed by Goutam Ghose. “Gudiya loves books (especially Abol Tabol), dances to Tagore songs and ABBA like a true dancing queen, and her favourite film is Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne,” says Nandana. “She and John are communicating perfectly in multilingual gibberish for now.” John adds that “Meghla is feisty, affectionate and argumentative, taking after her mother of course!” On the professional front, Nandana has been busy writing children’s books — having published five in the last two years, which have been translated into as many as 15 languages across the world. She keeps up her fight against child abuse by continuing to be the ambassador of a number of child rights organisations in India and New York. Nandana was last seen on the big screen in her award-winning performance as Sugandha in Ketan Mehta’s Rang Rasiya.
