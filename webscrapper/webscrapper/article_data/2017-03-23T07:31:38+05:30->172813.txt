AHMEDABAD: In a startling revelation about gender-based oppression and discrimination, the   (NFHS) 2015-16 has reported that cellphones of 52.1% women in Gujarat are not used by them, but by male members of their household. Only 47.9% women in the state have access to their own cellphones and can use them without male monitoring. Facts and findings about women's access to their own bank accounts or entitlement to participate in household decisions are also shocking. 

 The survey, conducted under the stewardship of the Union ministry of health and family welfare, pointed out in its category of 'Women's Empowerment and  ' that in Gujarat, only 63.9% women in urban areas are in a position to use their cellphones by themselves, while this drops to 35.4% in  .
 
 The figures also revealed how women faced domestic violence in the state even during pregnancy. The NFHS figures said that 1.8% women including 0.4 % women in city and 3 % in the villages faced spousal violence when they were pregnant. 
 
 Exposing the injustices of male dominated society and how a patriarchal system rules even in present days, the figures say that while overall 85.4% women participate in household decisions the rest are kept away. In urban areas, 86.9% women participate in household decisions which drops to 84.2% women in rural areas.
 
 The figures regarding bank accounts operated by women come as a shocker. The figures revealed that 51.4% women cannot operate their bank accounts in Gujarat.
