GOGHAT: Even as unrest continued to brew at Goghat for the second day over filling an 18-acre waterbody to make way for a 89-km railway project, the Hooghly administration proposed an alternative plot to dig a pond there. 

 Tension started to simmer right from the morning as villagers gathered around the contentious Bhaba Dighi after two farmers,   and Kartik Pandit, were allegedly beaten up. An   team reached the spot around 10am to avoid violence like that on Thursday.
 
 Later, Hooghly DM Sanjay Bansal and Goghat Trinamool MLA Manas Majundar held a meeting with the agitators and proposed to give them a 9-acre land, to be dug into a waterbody. Tutul Roy, who spearheading the agitation, said, “Merely promising us a land is not enough. A pond can’t be dug out of any plot. We have to see if it protects our interests.”
 
 The 18-acre waterbody, which is reportedly holding up the completion of the   railway line, is owned by 268 fish farmers. Of them, 177 have accepted compensation; the rest 91, who have refused to give up the waterbody, own 9 acres of it. 
 
 MLA Majumdar said, “We have identified three plots on vested land near Bhaba Dighi. The unwilling fish farmers will have to choose from them. The administration will dig up the 9-acre waterbody.”
