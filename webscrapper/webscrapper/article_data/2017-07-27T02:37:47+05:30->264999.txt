NEW DELHI: A day after being pulled up by Delhi   and getting directed to remove   near Sewa Nagar crossing within three days,   said that it will comply with the order. However, PWD officials said this will delay phase-II of the Barapullah project.

 Officials said that they had constructed a temporary platform using rubble near Sewa Nagar crossing for movement of heavy machinery for constructing the flyover. “We had ensured that the flow in Kushak drain was not hampered, but now we will remove it,” the official added.
 
 Earlier, an angry   high court had again pulled up PWD over the “dismal” condition of Kushak drain in south Delhi and warned of heavy costs if the agency doesn’t get its act together.
 
 PWD said that while the drain near INA and Sewa Nagar is with them, South Corporation and NDMC are responsible for desilting the remaining length.
 
 South Corporation, however, said that desilting work started from May 12 and they cleared their portion. “The malba removed after digging work by PWD flowed back into the drain after rain,” said a senior official.
