BENGALURU: Vijay Kumar, a 37-year-old priest of the Sri Revanna Siddeshwara Swamy temple in   near Ramanagara town sustained severe burn injuries after he slipped and fell on the red-hot embers while performing the   ritual during temple festivities on Sunday. Manjunath, Vijay’s brother, also sustained burn injuries when he went his sibling’s rescue.

  
  
 
 
 The incident occurred at around 6.30am on Sunday, the second day of three-day festivities planned by the temple’s trust. The ‘agnikonda’, the strip of burning embers, had been prepared and Kumar, holding a sword, began walking on it. He had covered about half the length of the 15-foot long ‘agnikonda’ when he slipped and fell.
 
 Manjunath, who was among those watching and cheering on either side of the ‘agnikonda’, immediately went to his brother’s rescue. While attempting to get Kumar away from the embers, Manjunath suffered burn injuries to his feet.
 
  
  
 
 “The duo was immediately taken to a private hospital in Ramanagara town and later shifted to St John’s Medical College Hospital in Bengaluru city for treatment,” an office bearer of the Sri Revanasiddeshwara Swamy Kshetra Abhivrudhi Seva Trust, Avverahalli said. “Manjunath suffered burn injuries to his feet, while his brother Kumar suffered injuries to his chest, legs and hands. Both are out of danger.”
 
 Ramanagara Rural police have registered a case and a probe is underway. Police said this is the third such incident in a span of two months. Ravi Poojari, a 35-year-old priest, was injured during the firewalking ritual as part of Maramma Devi fest in Uyyamballi village on April 11 at Uyyamballi village near Kanakapura. He succumbed to his injuries on April 15.
 
 Another priest was injured during the ritual in   at Satanur, a month ago. He is said to have recovered from his injuries.
