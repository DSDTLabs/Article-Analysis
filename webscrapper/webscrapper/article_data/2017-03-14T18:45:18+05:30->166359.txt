KOZHIKODE: As many as hundred persons including shop owners and staff working at various shops in the city have expressed their willingness to render   to the   personnel at the time of a fire mishap. The fire and rescue service department will form three community based fire and rescue teams by March 20. The three team will be formed at S M Street, Payalam and Valiyangadi.
