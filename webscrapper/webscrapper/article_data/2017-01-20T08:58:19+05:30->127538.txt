PUNE: The   and   workers in the city are keenly waiting for the parties’ decision on alliance in Mumbai because their leaders have communicated that a pact in Pune is possible only if they contest the   together in Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.

 The city BJP chief, Yogesh Gogawale, said, “While the state leaders will take a final call on alliance, the city BJP is ready to contest the civic polls. We are confident that the BJP will come to power in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad.”
 
 A majority of the city BJP leaders and workers have opposed an alliance with the Shiv Sena, stating that their party had a chance to win majority on its own. “We have communicated our stand to the state leadership. But if the party joins hands with Sena in Mumbai, we have to follow the pattern,” said a senior BJP leader of the city. 
 
 The Shiv Sena’s city unit chief,  , said, “We shall follow the order of the party’s executive chief,  . We are geared up for the polls since we had started preparations a year ago.” Meanwhile, senior Sena and BJP leaders have told their Pune counterparts to not make statements that could hamper the chances of an alliance in Mumbai.
