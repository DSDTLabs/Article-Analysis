Indian beauty   looked red hot during her second red carpet appearance at the   Film Festival as she opted for a ruffled strapless gown. The red Ralph & Russo number was a showstopper as photographers scrambled to click pictures of Aishwarya, who was more than happy to oblige.

  
  
 The 43-year-old   teamed her outfit with a pair of danglers and chose to go bold with a dark hue on her lips. 
 Aishwarya made her debut at the film festival for the film 'Devdas'. She became a regular at the gala as the face of the cosmetic. 
 
 For her first appearance at the film festival this year, Aishwarya picked a sheer green tiered ensemble by Yanina Couture and was even spotted posing with model   in an off-white floral gown. 
 
 It was her blue Cinderella-esuqe ball gown that was the talking point when she stepped out in it for her first red carpet appearance.
