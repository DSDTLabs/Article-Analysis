BHUBANESWAR: When   walked up to the dais to take oath as the  , he must have surely looked back the way he had to travel. Son of a driver, Susanta lost his parents one after the other when he himself was barely out of his teens. As he a resul, he had to drop out of college when he was 21 and take up odd jobs to sustain his family of four - two elder sisters and two younger brothers. The family stayed in a two-room mud-walled house in their  , under Sohela block. 

 Though he had dabbled in politics during his college days, he took active part when   became the chief minister for the first time in 2000. Soon he became a key member in BJD's organizational works in the area for party heavyweight and current  , who was then a Lok Sabha MP.
 
 Susanta, a bachelor, became popular in his area as he lend a helping hand to everybody. From arranging money for someone's daughter's marriage to getting some work done in government offices, people in his area say Susanta never let anyone down. 
 
 It was in 2009 that Pyarimohan Mohapatra took a liking for Susanta and his fortunes changed for the better. Ahead of the 2009 assembly election, the BJD had announced Acharya's candidature from Bhatli. But the party had to change its decision and handed the ticket to Susanta when it realized the public wanted him. Acharya was shifted to Rairakhol while Susanta went on to win from Bhatli, defeating Prakash Debata of the Congress.
 
 In 2014, he won the assembly election for the second successive time and the next year Naveen made him the convenor of the party's farmers' cell. He did not let the BJD chief down, successfully organizing a massive farmers rally at Sohela, which was addressed by Naveen days later. He was rewarded with the post of Bargarh district planning committee chairman last year. The elevation to a ministerial position seems a natural progression.
 
 "I am thankful to the chief minister for his faith in me. I will try to live up to the expectations," Susanta said.
