AHMEDABAD: After submitting an application for discharge from the   on Monday, PAAS convener Hardik Patel’s advocate, Rafik Lokhandwala, told a city sessions court that it was clear from Hardik’s speeches statements and transcripts of telephone calls, that he wanted to follow in the footsteps of Bhagar Singh, who was a patriot.

 Lokhandwala said that had Hardik wanted to become a Nathuram Godse, who killed Mahatma Gandhi, then the BJP-ruled government would have never slapped sedition charges against him.
 
 Pointing out that expressing dissent against the ruling party and its policy does not signify conspiracy against a lawful government, as the ruling party is not the government, Lokhandwala said that the material submitted by the crime branch nowhere shows that Hardik ever incited people to engage in violence.
 
 While arguing for Hardik’s discharge from the sedition case that was slapped on him in October 2015, Lokhandwala asked, “What could be the government’s stand on   and patriots, if it could book Hardik under sedition charges?”
 
 Three co-accused, Ketan Patel, Chirag Patel and   have parted ways with Hardik. Ketan has turned an approver and has been granted a pardon by the court. Further arguments are to take place in this case on January 16.
