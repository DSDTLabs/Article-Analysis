CHENNAI: The Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council ( ) has said it finds it surprising that while so many of its members were struggling to get financing for legitimate concerns, others (Nirav Modi/Gitanjali Gems) were able to get away with unsecured and unregulated lending.

 "Going by the prevalent compliance system followed, chances of such vast irregularity without any detection across several financial periods are extremely surprising and unreasonable. This only demonstrates lacunae in internal control system and failure or lack of fraud protection measures within the PSU," said the GJEPC in a statement.
 
 The trade body also highlighted the plight of smaller cap companies in securing credit. 
 
 "On one hand, GJEPC is struggling to garner financing to gem and jewellery exporters, especially the SME export sector, who are required to give upward of high collateral for the limit sanctioned to them, and here one finds this kind of clear advances ( ) being provided by a bank without any safeguards. This speaks volumes of irregularities that needs to be thoroughly investigated," said the GJEPC.
 
 The Indian diamond industry, which has 6,000 exporters exporting $23 billion, had adhered to all norms and practices, prescribed very diligently, added the GJEPC.
 
 On the Nirav Modi/Gitanjali Gems incident, the GJEPC said it strongly condemned any sort of unlawful and illegal actions by any individual, trade or otherwise. "This incident will not have any contagion effect on the gems and jewellery export industry," it said.
