BENGALURU : The integrated skywalk being built by BBMP at Mahatma Gandhi Circle was initially proposed to come up a few metres away at  . 

 According to a private consultation firm that worked with the   to figure out the most congested traffic islands where pedestrians are at risk, Anil Kumble Circle was among the 46 locations chosen for constructing skywalks in 2013.
  
  
 However, BBMP changed the skywalk’s location from Anil Kumble Circle to Mahatma Gandhi Circle in 2015, saying the TenderSURE project had begun on St Mark’s Road and as per the rules laid out by the Palike itself, no digging could be taken up on the stretch. The earlier plan was to construct the skywalk from   to Bible Society and from LIC India to the state wireless headquarters next to Chinnaswamy Stadium.
 
 “According to the feasibility study conducted by a third party, Anil Kumble Circle was in need of a skywalk. However, since St Mark’s Road was developed under the TenderSURE project, we could not dig the footpaths or shift the utilities. For this reason, we shifted the location to MG Circle,” said B Prabhakar, executive engineer, road infrastructure (special division).
 
 However, the agency did not conduct a feasibility study for the project on MG Circle. Sources said BBMP concluded that MG Circle saw more pedestrian footfalls, with five roads joining at the intersection. “No feasibility study was done for the new location, but since it was ‘comparable’ and close to the original spot, it was decided to shift the skywalk,” said a BBMP official.
 
 Asked whether the skywalk would block the view of the Gandhi statue, the BBMP officer incharge of the project said, “The bottom of the skywalk will be six metres above the road level. The statue is only two metres above road level, so it will still be visible. More pedestrians are seen near the Gandhi statue.”
