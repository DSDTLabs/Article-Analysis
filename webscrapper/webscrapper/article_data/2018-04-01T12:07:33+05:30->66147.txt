PANAJI: An extensive survey of 15 freshwater dam-lakes in the country, including two in Goa, by a team of researchers from India, Germany and the UK revealed unexpectedly low levels of reactive nitrogen (RN), whose presence in water bodies promotes excessive growth of algae and consumes dissolved oxygen.

 Also, the presence of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, was found to stimulate massive nitrogen loss from freshwater reservoirs.
 
  
  
 
 The research team that had among its members  , former director of   ( ), and Marcel Kuypers from Max-Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology, Bremen, Germany, collected a unique set of data to better understand the fate and behavior of the RN.
 
 “Our results are of enormous environmental significance because they show unexpectedly low build-up of nitrous oxide, commonly known as laughing gas and a potent greenhouse molecule, in Indian lakes. ,” Naqvi said. 
 
 According to the research published in scientific journal ‘Nature Communications’, most lakes, in summer, were found to contain no oxygen below a thin surface layer. Such total depletion in the oxygen level is called anoxia and conditions are suitable for the removal of RN by microorganisms that use oxygen (from nitrate) to breathe. 
 
 The study concluded that the bacteria either have an alternative life style, or work closely with other microbes when oxygen disappears. “Similar processes may occur in other freshwater ecosystems where methane is available in significant quantities,” predicts Kuypers.
