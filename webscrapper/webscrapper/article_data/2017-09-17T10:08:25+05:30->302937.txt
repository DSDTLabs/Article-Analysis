PATNA: An alert has been sounded in seven Bihar districts as the Haryana police suspect that   chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim’s adopted daughter   is in the state and may flee the country through Indo-Nepal border. The Haryana police shared some verbal information with Bihar police a couple of days back about Honeypreet and her suspected movement towards Nepal through Bihar.
 
  Haryana police on September 1 issued a lookout notice against Honeypreet, who has been on the run since August 25 after violence broke out in   and Sirsa following the conviction of Gurmeet in a rape case.
  
  Bihar shares 729km-long open border with Nepal along Sitamarhi, Kishanganj, Araria, Supaul, Madhubani, East Champaran and West Champaran districts.
  
  ADG (law & order) Alok Raj told media persons on Saturday that there was no written communication between Bihar and Haryana police regarding Honeypreet. “We got verbal information that Honeypreet might have entered Bihar with the motive to escape to Nepal. We have informed the SPs of the seven districts sharing border with Nepal. All the police stations have also been alerted. Vehicles are being searched as standard procedure and her pictures and posters have been pasted on every road junction and public place in those areas,” he said.
  
  “We are also in touch with the Nepal Police at the border check posts in view of the high alert. They have been requested to inform us if they find any suspicious woman or girl entering their territory,” he said.
  
  The Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel posted along the Indo-Nepal border have also been asked to check the people crossing the border, he said.
