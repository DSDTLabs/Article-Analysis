I spent almost my entire childhood in North India as my dad was in the Indian Army. We used to feel nostalgic about everything related to Kerala and always wanted to have the best   ever. Most of the things needed for Vishu sadya and kani werenâ€™t available around us, but as the festival came close, my dad would somehow manage to procure every single item, from people who were coming from Kerala. And finally after mom set the kani and woke us up early in the morning, we would be greeted by a beautiful sight, that had all the authentic ingredients. Then came the real celebration. Everybody around, both South Indians and North Indians, used to visit our home to have the sadya, dressed in Kerala style mundu or sari. They would also sit with us on the floor while having the sadya. The fun we had while sharing our traditions with them is beyond words. Finally when we returned to Kerala for good, with all these memories, we were a bit taken aback, seeing people finding contentment with instant items from markets! That said, what I love the most are the sparklers we light in the nights and of course, the vishukkaineettam!
