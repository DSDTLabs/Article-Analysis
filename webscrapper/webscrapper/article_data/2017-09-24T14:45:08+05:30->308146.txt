NAGPUR: Issues related to the new fishing policy were discussed at a meeting here on Saturday. Bhandara-Gondia MP Nana   presided over the meeting convened by Prashant Pawar at his   outfit office in  .

 The   MP made it clear that he would pursue the matter till fishermen got justice and which would be possible after the June 20, 2017 government resolution was amended drastically. He also announced the names of two representatives of fishermen — Prakash Lonare and   — on the committee to be set up by the state government to review and suggest suitable changes in the said GR.
 
 Talking to TOI, Lonare said once the committee is in place they would tour every district and get views of stakeholders so that valuable inputs could be incorporated in the report. 
 
 Patole has been fighting for fishermen’s cause since around 2 lakh people in his constituency depend on fishing for livelihood. At his instance a meeting was convened by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on September 13. At the meeting Patole reportedly blasted fisheries minister Mahadev Jankar for drafting a policy that is totally insensitive to interests of small fishermen. He took exception to unsavoury terms and conditions and manifold increase in lease rents which would make life difficult for the fishing folks.
 
 The CM then directed that a committee be formed with representatives of fishermen on board to make suitable amendments in the GR. Accordingly the two names were sent by Patole and he is expecting the matter would be resolved soon.
