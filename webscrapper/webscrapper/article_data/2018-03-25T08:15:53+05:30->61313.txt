PANAJI: In six months to a year, do not be surprised if you find every municipal supervisor or utility service provider toting a radio  . Aiming to bring accountability, Imagine   plans to procure around 50 to 60 radio handsets and install between four to five mast towers for the   network.

 The handsets will be provided to municipal workers and officers along with key government officials who will be able to keep tabs on services provided by the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP), the public works department and the electricity department.
 
 Speaking to TOI, chief executive officer and managing director of Imagine Panaji Smart City Development   confirmed that the smart city mission had floated a tender seeking interest from agencies which have implemented such projects earlier.
  
 
 “There will be a dedicated frequency and if a query or alert is raised on the wireless network, all those tuned into the frequency will be updated,” Chaudhuri said. “Currently, if a government officer witnesses burning of garbage, he calls up the commissioner or the mayor on their cell phones. But it takes time till the supervisor reaches the site.”
 
 The agency selected will have to supply, install, configure and undertake testing and commissioning of the devices.
 
 While Imagine Panaji Smart City Development has not divulged the cost of the entire project, the installation of the mast towers for the smart radios wireless network itself is expected to cost over Rs 26lakh.
 
 “A control room will be setup at the Smart City office and all civic services will be monitored from there,” Chaudhuri said.
