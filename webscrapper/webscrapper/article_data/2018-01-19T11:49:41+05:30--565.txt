KOTTAYAM: A 12-year-old girl from Kerala has set her eyes on creating a new world record by singing in 102 languages at a concert.   Satish will be trying her luck on January 25 at the Indian Consulate Auditorium in Dubai. Representatives from US-based World Record Academy will be present at the event. The existing record of 76 languages is held by Kesiraju Srinivas from Gandhi Hills,  . He did it in 2008. 

 Suchetha’s parents TC Satish (a dermatologist from Kannur) and   settled in Dubai 19 years ago. She hit upon the idea after she listened to her father’s Japanese friend singing a folk song. “I learnt the song from him and I could sing just like him,” said Suchetha. Since then she has been learning songs in various languages from   and other online sources.
 
 Suchetha will begin her concert with a Sanskrit song and conclude it with a patriotic song in Hindi. She has chosen popular, folk and traditional songs for her performance and 25 Indian languages will find space in her effort. The rest will be sung according to the alphabetical order of each language.
 
 Suchetha is doing voice therapy exercises and learning breathing techniques to prepare for the big day. The total duration of the concert is expected to be five hours. “We are taking care so that she can maintain her stamina right through the concert,” said Sumitha.
 
 Suchetha, who is a Class VII student at   in Dubai, started learning music when she was only four years old. She is a trained singer in Carnatic and Hindustani classical music. Her parents chose the songs and she later learned the meaning of each song. She also took pain to correct her pronunciation in each language with the help of her friends.
