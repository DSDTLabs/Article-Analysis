 The management of the university, known till now as Unitedworld Institute, imposed an express ban on eating non-vegetarian food on its campus.
 
 The students cannot even get non-veg food from outside.  , Ritesh Handa told TOI, “We have restrained our students from going out for lunch. Their going out for lunch was creating various issues. We have allowed them to bring food with them and get food from outside the campus, but have made it clear that they cannot get non-vegetarian food inside the campus from outside. We have prohibited non-veg food on our campus.”
 
 This move by the university has not gone down well with a section of students, who staged a demonstration against the “dictatorial” approach by the management. On condition anonymity, a student told TOI, “Food available in the university canteen is not cheap and everybody cannot afford it. For those who want non-vegetarian food, it is not available in the canteen. These students were compelled to order food from outside, but that also has been stopped.”
 
 Another student said, “The restrictions are imposed on students to make them eat in the canteen. Whenever we have raised our voice, we are threatened that they will fail us in exams. When careers are at stake, nobody is ready to be singled out by continuing with the protest.”
