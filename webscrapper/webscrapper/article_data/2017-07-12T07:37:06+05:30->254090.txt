CHANDIGRAH: With the results of the undergraduate courses to be declared on July 14, the   for filing online admission   for different courses at Panjab University has been moved to July 17.

 Moreover, since the university has introduced cloud-based management services for online   this year, the university has created a desk to accept the hard copy of the form along with self-attested photocopies of various documents and certificates through registered post. 
 
 “Alerts are being flashed on the university website that the hard copy of the form and accompanying papers is accepted through registered post also for the convenience of students. If the results are out in time, students can either upload scanned copies of the result cards from their e-mail IDs or send hard copy to respective departments by registered post or by hand,” said PU dean of university instructions (DUI) Meenakshi Malhotra.
 
 She said the university will hold assistance camps for students whose certificates are found invalid for various reasons. “We held similar camps on July 3 and 9 to verify and cross-check the documents,” Malhotra said. 
 
 After the provisional merit list is uploaded on July 26, the   for the different courses will be held from July 27 to August 4. This year’s process was meant to be online completely, since the work is outsourced to a Bhopal-based agency. Still the university demands hard copy of the online forms to eliminate the chances of any error.
