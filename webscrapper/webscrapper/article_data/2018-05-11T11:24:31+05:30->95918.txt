MEERUT: With police launching an investigation into the death of   (25), brother of Bhim Army’s   district president Kamal Walia, Thakurs on Thursday accused the investigating agency of “framing innocent men” in the case.
 
  On Wednesday, Sachin was shot dead in Saharanpur’s Ramnagar colony, which is metres away from Maharana Pratap Bhawan, where members of the Rajput community were celebrating the birth anniversary of the king.
  
  On Thursday, a delegation of Thakurs reached Lucknow to meet chief minister   to seek a   inquiry into the matter. Speaking to TOI, Yogender Pundir, who organized Wednesday’s event, said, “Our men have been unnecessarily framed. We have video recordings of the presence of two of the accused in the function, while another one was away in Nasik. Besides, Sher Singh Rana was not even there in the function. How can he be named in the FIR? We are in Lucknow will ask him for a CBI investigation.”
  
  Vice-president of All India Kshatriya Mahasabha, Devender Rana said, “On Wednesday, from divisional commissioner to SSP, everyone had said that the death had occurred due to an accident and the details will be revealed after the investigation is over. Half of the persons named in the FIR were not even present in Saharanpur. We have nothing to fear and fully trust the local and state administration. At the same time, we also want the truth to be out and that is why we have demanded a CBI enquiry into the matter.”
