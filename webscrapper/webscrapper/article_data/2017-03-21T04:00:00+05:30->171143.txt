Vadodara: Nearly 600 workers at the General Motors plant in Halol have decided to fast in protest against the management’s decision on compensation being paid to workers. The General Motors Employees Union (GMEU) has also sought intervention of Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani in the matter. The Indian subsidiary of US automobile giant General Motors had in July 2015 announced closure of the facility.  Later, the company decided to continue production till April 2017 to ensure an orderly transition for employees, suppliers and other stakeholders. “The workers were promised adequate compensation but the management offered us only Rs 10 lakh. The workers gave so many years to this company and this compensation is not enough as our livelihood is dependent on this plant,” said Rachit Soni, president of GMEU.  “The supervisors are getting somewhere between Rs 32 to Rs 35 lakh towards compensation then why are the workers not being given more money? The workers want compensation between Rs 35 lakh and Rs 40 lakh,” Soni told TOI. He added that their union tried to meet Rupani several times in the past.  “We went to the chief minister’s office (CMO) about 15 to 20 times but he didn’t give us appointment. With no way out, the workers have decided to observe fast as a mark of protest. We will continue working at the manufacturing facility but we won’t eat,” he added. “The agitation will continue till the time the CM intervenes and addresses our issues,” Soni said.  GM’s exit has come at a time when Gujarat has emerged as an auto hub with the likes of Tata Motors, Ford India and Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India Pvt Ltd (HMSI) already commissioning their manufacturing plants in Gujarat.  Suzuki Motor Corporation (SMC) is soon going to operational its plant, while HeroMoto Corp's two-wheeler facility is under advance stage of development.
