NEW DELHI: L-G   on Tuesday set up a high-level committee to prepare a   for installing,   and monitoring   in Delhi. 

 The committee would put in place a standard operating procedure. Principal secretary (home) Manoj Parida has been appointed chairman of the committee and tasked with submitting his report in 30 days after consultations with all departments. “The committee will recommend SOP to address the issues of uniformity in installation as well as issues of privacy, security, feed-sharing, integration and optimum utilisation,” said an   office statement. 
 
 The SOP will also develop a mechanism for informing the general public that they are under surveillance, wherever applicable. 
 
 The LG office statement said while the use of surveillance cameras helps improve safety, there have been instances of misuse of CCTVs for breach of privacy. “The use of surveillance camera system should not be permitted to become a tool to violate privacy of individuals, which is considered to a Fundamental Right. The privacy concerns related to installation of CCTVs have, therefore, to be addressed appropriately and effectively. There must be clear responsibility and accountability for all surveillance camera system activities including images and information collected, held and used,” the statement read. 
 
 Noting the importance of CCTVs, the official statement asserted that these cameras are being installed all over the world in public spaces and have become an important tool for law enforcement authorities. The primary objectives of installation of CCTVs are enhancing security, preventing and detecting crime, and supporting criminal investigation.
