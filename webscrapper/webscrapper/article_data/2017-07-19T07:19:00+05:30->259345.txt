 Ludhiana: The police have decided to take CBI help to investigate the killing of priest Sultan Masih. He was shot on Saturday night outside a church in Peeru Banda Mohalla, Saleem Tabri. 
 
 Punjab director general of police (DGP) Suresh Arora visited the family of Masih on Tuesday and assured early arrest of the killers.
 
 While addressing the media, he said the killing could be a terrorist activity and they were linking it with previous high-profile murders of RSS vice-president VP Gagneja, city-based Hindu outfit leader Amit Sharma, Khanna-based Shiv Sena leader Durga Prasad and Dera Sacha Sauda followers Satpal and Ramesh Kumar. 
 
 Arora said, “We will be investigating the killing by linking it with other cases. Besides, the CBI has been involved in the investigation.” The DGP also handed over a job letter to Masih’s son, Alisha. Members of Christian community were also present there. 
 
 Chairman of the Ludhiana Churches’ Council Kunju Koshy said, “There were some controversies abuzz on social media related to the name of this church, ‘Temple of God’. On a Facebook page, some people were condemning the use of ‘temple’ word for a church. Others were accusing priest Sultan Masih of conversions. This could also be a lead in the case.”
 
 The family does not suspect anyone, said police.
 
 Sources in the police said the land on which the church was built was disputed and a benami property. This angle would also be probed. 
 
 Later, in the day police rounded up four men for questioning.
