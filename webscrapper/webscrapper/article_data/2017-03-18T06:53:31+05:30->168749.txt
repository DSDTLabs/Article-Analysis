JAIPUR:   are busy finalising a proposal for programme implementation plans (PIPs) to seek funds from the Centre. A meeting of health department officials with the ministry of health and family welfare will be held on Monday.

 An official said that all nodal officers and project directors of the health department will take part in the national programme coordination committee meeting on Monday along with principal secretary   and   (NHM) mission director Navin Jain.
 
 Officials said that they have prepared a plan proposal that requires Rs 2,364 crore for implementation. The share of the Centre will be 60%, while the state government will bear 40% of it.
 
 If the Centre approves the plan, funds will be utilized for programmes such as immunization, population stabilisation, reducing infant mortality and maternal mortality. Besides, it will focus on improving healthcare infrastructure in rural and urban areas. Allocations will be made also for national programmes on blindness, tuberculosis, leprosy and mental health.
 
 Over the past few days, the health department officials are working overtime to complete the details of programmes that require funds from the Centre.
 
 Officials said that the meeting was important as all programmes to improve healthcare facilities in the state may not be approved by the Centre.
 
 They said that Rajasthan was one of the high-risk states in the country, which requires more funds for improving health facilities. There are 10 high-risk districts, which have been poor on health indicators such as infant mortality and maternal mortality ratios.
 
 Besides, there are three other districts, which are categorised as tribal districts, that require special attention of the government.
