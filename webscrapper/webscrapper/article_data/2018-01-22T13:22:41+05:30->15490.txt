MADURAI: Turicorin district police arrested a 30-year-old sailor, from Theni district in a murder case that happened four days ago. He murdered a 25-year-old man for blackmailing a woman who was related to him.

 P Arunpandi, 25, from Chinnamanur in Theni district was working in a spinning mill in Coimbatore. He was in love with a woman from the same place. The woman’s family members did not accept the affair and the woman moved on. As the family members organised her marriage recently, Arunpandi started troubling her. He threatened her of releasing the intimate photos on social networking sites.
 
 When the woman brought it to her family’s notice, her brother Ramkumar tried to solve it. He struck a deal and paid some cash. But Arunpandi continued to create problems even after receiving money on a couple of more occasions. When he again demanded money, the woman’s nephew M Neela  , a sailor in a ship, went to meet him with some cash. The two met at   near   in Tuticorin district Tuesday night.
 
 Police said in a dispute Neela Vignesh snatched the knife from Arunpandi and attacked him. As he fell down with a couple of stab injuries on his neck, he mowed her to death by running her over with his car. While Vignesh escaped, the body was found the next day morning. Masarpatti police rushed to the spot and shifted the body to government hospital.
 
 During the investigation, Neela Vignesh was picked up based on suspicion on Saturday. As he confessed to the crime, he was arrested and produced before a judicial magistrate. He was lodged in prison on the same day.
