NEW DELHI:   slammed the   for not utilising budgetary allocations and not holding any meetings with various departments for the forthcoming budget. 

 “Kejriwal government has failed to do development of Delhi in their three-year rule. They have also failed to carry out any development in the fields of education, transport, health, metro and social welfare,” Singh said. 
 
 He added, “We have specific information that not even a single meeting has been called in connection with the budget between finance and planning departments. The Kejriwal government has also failed to prepare revised budget estimates for 2017-18, which has happened for the first time.”
 
 Singh said due to this, several thousand crores of rupees would lapse. “During FY 2016-17, 1,704 works were sanctioned but only 787—less than 50%—actually started. Only 31% of projects were completed that year,” he said.
