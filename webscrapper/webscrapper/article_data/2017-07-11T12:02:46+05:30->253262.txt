AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Monday decided to hear a PIL that is seeking a ban   issued by political parties.

 The petitioner, Jayesh Shah, managing trustee of an NGO,  , urged the HC to completely ban the practice of manifestos being issued by political parties. He also sought directions to the  , to formulate guidelines with regard to manifestos and to   for promises made in them.
 
 The PIL lay with the court registry for nearly a month, due to an objection regarding the format of the petition, its draft was shorter than the minimum requirement. The petitioner’s advocate argued that a genuine PIL can be articulated in one line as well and the argument also could be summed up in one line. Such a technicality should not bar a petitioner from bringing a real issue before court. While seeking a declaration from the HC that the issuance of manifestos by political parties is illegal and unconstitutional, Shah argued that parties never fulfil promises made in manifestos and they are nothing but pieces of paper without any accountable value. The petitioner cited manifestos issued by political parties during the 2014 general elections, when manifestos titled as ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat’ and ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ were issued with tall promises. He contended that the ruling party does not make any efforts to implement them. This violation of election promises has become a routine in India and manifestos are hence are nothing but cheating.
