GURUGRAM: The death of the   boy after falling into a sewage swamp next to the slums in Tikri village off Sohna Road on Tuesday may have come as a shock to many, but   of Central Park Resorts, a condominium overlooking the marsh, said they had been fearing this for long.

 Residents claimed they have approached the MCG many a time to get the swamp cleaned, but their requests have only fallen on deaf ears. “I moved here a couple of years back and since then I have been trying to follow up with civic authorities to get this place cleaned, but there has been no action on the ground so far. Two years ago, it was just a puddle,” said Paankaj Sethi, a resident who captured the video of the   drowning.
 
 “When we approached the authorities, we were told it is a private land and there is not much the government can do about it. A young boy has lost his life, which could have been saved if the authorities took timely action,” said another resident, Gaurav Dhamija. 
 
  
  Some residents said the swamp also posed health risks to people living in the slums and it’s high time the MCG did something about it.
 
 Vidhu Singhal, a resident of Central Park Resorts, said the sanitation in-charge of the area had told her the maximum MCG can do is to fog the area as it’s a private land. “Some time back there was a dead pig floating in the swamp for two days straight, MCG officials came with a crane and removed it, but nothing happened beyond that. Imagine the kind of health risks this poses,” said Singhal, who is a doctor.
 
 “We keep hearing about   initiatives and then we hear about such incidents. Every day we see a number of people defecating in the open because they do not have toilets. The minor boy’s death is a wake-up call for civic authorities in the city,” said MS Kocchar, another resident who is on the board of  , an international NGO.
