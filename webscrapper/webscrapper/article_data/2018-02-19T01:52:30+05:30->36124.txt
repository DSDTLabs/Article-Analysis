NAVI MUMBAI:   corporators including the mayor and the deputy mayor staged a sit-in protest outside the civic commissioner's cabin demanding action against a PCMC official on Saturday. They were protesting the alleged abusive behaviour meted to a woman staff by the PCMC chief accounts and finance officer  . 

 PCMC   president Darshana Bhoir raised the issue of an anonymous letter sent to various political leaders, which mentioned the alleged abuse of a lady employee by Ambapkar. Bhoir demanded that strong action be taken against the official.
 
 Leader of the house   threatened that house will not function till action is taken. Mayor Kavita Choutmol adjourned the house till Wednesday and BJP corporators blackened the name plate on Ambapkar's office door. 
 
 A PCMC official said, "Five women staffers have complained against Ambapkar for abusing them. The commissioner heard the staffers on Friday."
 
 A PCMC staffer said, "Such abuse has been on the rise for over two months."
 
 Agitating BJP corporators sat for 45 minutes raising slogans. PCMC commissioner Sudhakar Shinde said the departments handled by Ambapkar have been handed over to chief auditor Vitthal Sude. The BJP corporators relented from their protest later.
 
  Ambapkar denied the allegations. "I am on leave from Friday for medical reasons. All these allegations are baseless, " he said.
