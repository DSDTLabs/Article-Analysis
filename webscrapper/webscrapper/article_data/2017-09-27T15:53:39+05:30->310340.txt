NAGPUR: The crime branch has nabbed a gunrunner from  , Imam Khan (29), and seized four pistols, one country-made revolver, an airgun, five live rounds, and a magazine, from   on Monday. In another case, a separate squad nabbed a dreaded chain-snatcher, his accomplice, and a bullion trader, and recovered 13 tola stolen gold, other materials, and a car, worth more than Rs10 lakh, from them.

 Khan, nabbed earlier while ferrying liquor at Ballarshah, Chandrapur, was lured into a trap by cops while trying to sell firearms. He had shifted to city from MP around five years ago.
 
 Jt CP Shivaji Bodkhe, DCP Sambhaji Kadam and ACP Somnath Waghchaure of crime branch said at a press conference at CP office in Civil Lines on Tuesday that the latest catch was the result of interstate crime conference meeting organized earlier this year. “An operation is underway in MP to nab the entire gang,” he said.
 
 Also, after the arrest of chain-snatcher Satish Samundre, crime branch has arrested his close aide Sohan Pandey, grandson of a Wardha-based cop, and bullion trader Diwakar Gurav for purchasing stolen gold. Gurav too is based in Wardha district.
 
 Bodkhe said Samundre had 28 offences, including murder, earlier, but now another 12 have been detected, including a rape case registered at Imambada police station. “Samundre had snatched three chains on September 12. He was spotted with a cap in CCTV footage,” said Bodkhe.
 
 Samundre, who had shifted to Amravati after marrying a second time, travels by bike to the city to snatch chains. “He was caught in his wife’s car after a chase at New Babulkheda locality,” said Bodkhe.
