Quepem:   citizens are finding it difficult to manoeuvre sharp turns near the municipal garden due to obstructions by banners and hoardings. Permitted by the Quepem Municipal Council (QMC), the advertising material on this stretch of the national highway to Belagavi obstructs visibility and raises the possibility of accidents for both pedestrians and motorists. 

 “These hoardings are in violation of the Goa Prevention of Defacement of Public Property Act,” a citizen told TOI.
 
 Banners and advertising material permitted by Quepem municipal council (QMC) on the footpaths and near sharp turns around the municipal garden are causing problems for pedestrians and motorists, as the obstruction to visibility ahead raises possibility of accidents. The garden, in the heart of the town and the main thoroughfare for traffic, is almost enclosed in banners and advertising material. Large hoardings are also displayed on the PWD building compound wall. 
 
 “The view of incoming traffic from Cuncolim to Curchorem and vice versa is blocked,” local resident Shivanand Naik said.
 
  Pramod Dessai, who holds additional charge as QMC chief officer, said he will instruct the person in charge to take action against illegal banners. Action will also be initiated against those who do not display their licence number. QMC in its resolution on May 28, 2013, stated that banners will not be allowed in and around the garden but later in 2016, it modified the resolution to allow display of banners outside the garden.
