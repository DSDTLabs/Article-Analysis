The latest episode decided the nominations for the upcoming week's election. In the previous episode,   had played a prank on Megha, which was related to eviction. Later he announced the result that none of the contestants would be eliminated as Rutuja had already left the show under medical grounds.   and Sai were overjoyed. In fact all the contestants were happy with the result.

 Then Megha was having a conversation with Tyagraj about Sushant's behaviour with Smita. Both were on the same page that whatever Sushant did in the previous episodes with Smita (pulling an apron from her feet), was completely wrong. But Sushant was having a discussion with   and Aastad in the garden area that he hasn't done anything intentionally. He said that whatever he did was, out of fun.
 
 Sai was discussing with Pushkar that she feels Usha is a good actor. Every time she gossips about Resham in front of Megha and Sai but she behaves nicely once she meets her.
 
 Then   gave an unusual task to the contestants in the house. This task was for the upcoming week's elimination process. In this task,   and Tyagraj were safe as they have just got the wildcard entry. Also Megha, being the captain of the house was safe from the eliminations.
 
 The name of the task was Baba Gadi Ghara Baher Kadi. According to the task, the contestants were given   with a doll inside it and photos of the co-contestants were placed on it. There was parking area made in the garden. So whenever the contestants hear the sound of crying, the contestants had to rush to the parking area to park their Baba Gadi. In this task, Pushkar, Resham, Sai, Jui, Sushant and Aastad were the ones who got nominated.
 
 After the task got over, Sushant, Resham and Jui were angry with Bhushan since he saved Usha . Due to this Sushant got nominated for the eliminations process.
