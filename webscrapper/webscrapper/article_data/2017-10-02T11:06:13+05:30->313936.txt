UDAIPUR: An RAC (Rajasthan Armed Constabulary)   shot his wife and then killed himself with his service gun on Sunday afternoon at his quarters here in Debari area under   police station.

 “Manjeet Singh Jat (28) was posted with the 12th RAC battalion here and was married for around eight years. He killed his wife   (26) before shooting himself for reasons not yet clear,” DySP Bhagwat Singh   said.
