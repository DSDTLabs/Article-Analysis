NEW DELHI: A seven-year-old   died after drowning in an open drain at a park in south Delhi’s   on Thursday. Raja Babu, who used to study in an NDMC school, stepped into the drain to pick up a cricket ball while playing with his friends and slipped. His friends told the police that he could not climb out as his feet got stuck in the sludge.

 Raja left for the park around 2pm after returning from school. When he didn’t return till 5pm, family members searched the colony but couldn’t find him and informed the police around 5.30pm. As a police team also started looking for him, one of Raja’s friends noticed him floating in the drain and alerted others. He was taken to AIIMS but was declared brought dead. 
 
 A probe has been started to establish which agency is in charge of maintaining the park. The police have approached both DDA and Archaeological Survey of India as there is a historical structure in the park. A case under IPC 304(A) (causing death due to negligence) will be registered once the culpability is established, said Chinmoy Biswal, DCP II (south). 
 
 Raja, who lived at Hauz Rani, had a younger sister, Afreen (5). His father Mohd. Haroon, who works as a tailor, said that though the incident took place around 4.30pm, nobody was informed. 
 
 Later, four boys, aged between 15 and 20 years, went inside the drain but couldn’t find Raja, he added. The police have ruled out possibility of any foul play.
