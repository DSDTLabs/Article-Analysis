Indore: Though the supply was affected in half of the city, residents did not face much problems. Authorities had earlier informed citizens regarding the shut down and requested them to make alternate arrangements. Pintu Yadav, a resident of Nanda Nagar, said the civic body had already informed us about the shutdown. “We did not face any problems as we had already stored water in advance," he said. While most residents had stored water in advance, several of them expressed discontent about the poor management and improper supply. Residents of Gumashta Nagar, Usha Nagar, Dravid Nagar and other areas in the city have to face water woes due to water supply being disrupted by the civic body following various reasons. Kushal Gayakwad, a resident of Gumashta Nagar, said the shutdown has become a routine affair. “We do not have a dedicated water supply for half the month and we have to depend solely on tankers as borewells are not enough,” he said. He questioned why the civic body had to carry out repairs every month when they should be looking for alternatives. Promod Kumar, another resident of the area, said people have to depend on alternate or irregular water supply for about an hour early in the morning. When authorities talk about adequate water supply, we are surely the deprived lot, he rued. People residing in western parts of the city have been facing problems due to the inadequate supply. After work was done on roads, a pipeline got damaged that affected the water supply, they claimed.
