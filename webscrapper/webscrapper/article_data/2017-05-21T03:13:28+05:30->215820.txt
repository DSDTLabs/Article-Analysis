NEW DELHI: The government has asked all ministries and departments to prepare details of both direct and indirect   generated from central schemes during the past three years to blunt criticism that it’s term so far has failed to create enough  . 

 Sources said this is going to be one of the government’s major counters to the offensive launched by the opposition. The ministries have been asked to come out with the data by Monday. The decision was taken at a meeting earlier this week in a meeting chaired by information and broadcasting secretary.
 
 TOI has learnt that all information officers have been asked to complete the task quickly, though it’s a tough one considering that the exercise to map both direct and indirect jobs is being undertaken for the first time. “The task is also to estimate the potential number of jobs that can be created because of the ongoing schemes and programmes,” said an official.
 
 The official said all the data will be collated and will be taken to people through proper communication strategies.
 
 The recent report of government’s labour bureau showed job generation has been anaemic at only 1.1% last year. An earlier report had pegged joblessness at a five-year high of 5% in 2015. The   had promised to generate two crore jobs annually in its poll manifesto. Considering that unemployment is a critical aspect which the government needs to address, the   government has made it a norm that every Cabinet proposal must specify how many jobs a project is likely to generate.
 
 Government sources said that four focus areas have been identified for preparing communication strategies during the third anniversary celebration of the Modi administration. Besides employment generation, the others are initiatives taken in the agriculture sector, countering left-wing extremism and terrorism.
