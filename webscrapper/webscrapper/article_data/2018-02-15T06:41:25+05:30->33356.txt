AHMEDABAD: The   might claim 100% enrolment in class 1, but data from the   2015-16 tells a different story. The data reveals that 22% of girls and 16% of boys in the age group of 6-17 do not attend school in the state. Gujarat fares better than only Assam when it comes to girls in the age group of 6-17 attending school. In Assam, 23% of girls don’t attend school, which is the lowest percentage in the country. The data shows that in Gujarat, 19% of children overall don’t attend school — 22% in rural areas and 15% in urban areas. Among girls in the age group of 6-17 years, 26% in rural areas and 16% in urban areas don’t attend school. 

 The data suggests that the attendance of boys and girls has improved compared to the period covered by NFHS in 2005-06. In 2005-06, about 29% of girls and boys didn’t attend school. The 2005-06 report stated that in the state, only 71% of children in the age group of 6-17 attend school. “School attendance is somewhat higher in urban areas (74%) than in rural areas (69%),” the report says. “Ninety percent of primary-school age children (6-10 years) attend school (92% in urban areas and 89% in rural areas); the percentage attending school drops to 74 percent for children in the age group of 11-14 and further to 32 percent for children in the age group of 15-17. The differential in the urban and rural school attendance rates also increases with children’s age.”
 
 Gujarat’s education secretary Suniana Tomar and minister of state for primary and higher education Vibhavari Dave were not available for comment. Apart from school attendance, the report also provides information on drinking water, sanitation, exposure to smoke inside the home, wealth, hand washing practices, composition of household population, educational attainment, birth registration, children’s living arrangements, and parental survivorship.
 
 Gujarat’s ranking is not just the poorest for school attendance of rural girls, it is equally bad for urban girls in the age group of 6-17. The report reveals that 82.2% of urban girls attended school during the two survey periods, 2014-15 and 2015-16, which is the worst among all 21 major Indian states, with the sole exception of Assam (77.3%).
 
 The report further says, “Almost all (95%) males and females in the 6-10 age group attend school, including pre-primary school. This percentage decreases to 88 percent for children in the age group of 11-14 and then drops further to 63 percent for children in the age group of 15-17.” The report goes on to say: “There is almost no difference in school attendance of males and females in the 6-14 age group, but males are more likely than females to attend school at age of 15-17 (67% versus 60%). Urban-rural differentials in school attendance are minimal at age 6-10, but widen at older ages.” 
 
 Sukhdev Patel, an education activist, said: “The main reason for the state’s poor education record is that parents are not willing to allow their daughters to travel over long distances for education.” The girls are encouraged to study only if there are schools nearby, Patel said. “Moreover, in the state, private schools outnumber government schools and hence when it comes to paying for the education of the girl child, parents would prefer to pay for boys’ education at private schools.” He said that the government should make some arrangement for girls to make them feel safe while travelling to school. He said that the government should roll out schemes to encourage girls to study.
