KOLKATA: The higher education department is in the last phase of finalizing names of Presidency University vice-chancellor selection committee members as the term of the current VC is set to end on April 30.

 According to sources, the   has already selected Nirmal Ganguly, former director general of the  , as a nominee while governor Keshari Nath Tripathi has sent Ved Prakash, former chairman of   (UGC) as the chancellor’s nominee. The state government is in the process of nominating Sidho Kanho Birsha University vice-chancellor Dipak Ranjan Mandal as the third name in the committee.
 
 “We are in the process of notifying the same through a government order,” said the source in the education secretariat at Bikash Bhavan. “A VC is appointed for a term of four years with effect from his/her date of joining or till he attains the age of 65 or until further order, whichever is the earliest,” added the source.
 
 When   was selected the VC, he met the governor and informed him about his inability to join. He was 62. Anuradha Lohia, the present VC, was the second name on the list. She is 62 now.
 
 “Lohia may be given an extension since there is very little time left before her tenure gets over. However, a decision will be arrived at once the committee is framed,” a government official said.
 
 Lohia’s tenure had its share of ups and down. While she had to face a series of controversies, including student unrest in the initial years after she took charge, Lohia steered the university to greater heights as Presidency celebrated its 200th year last year.
