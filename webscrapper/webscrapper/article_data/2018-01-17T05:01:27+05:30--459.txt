Actor   says there are only "very dark" characters and no heroes in the upcoming film 'Ferrous'.

 "The film is a crime drama. It is not the run-of-the-mill kinds. It has an unconventional screenplay,"   said in a statement to IANS.
 
 Vijay instantly accepted the movie because of the film's "flavour".
 
 "There are no heroes in the film. All the characters are negative, in fact very dark," he said.
 
 Written and directed by Shaurya Singh, the film also features  , Bikramjeet Kanwarpal and Gopal K. Singh.
 
 "I feel that a film should move the audience. I will also be sending 'Ferrous' to certain film festivals before its worldwide release in the mid of 2018. I just want people to enjoy the film and remember it as a good memory," said Singh.
 
 On preparation for films, the director said: "I try to be different with every character. I generally write the plot of my film first and then go deeply into the characterisation. I put a lot of emphasis on the mannerisms of a character."
 
 "I also try to give them catchy lines. I personally stay open to suggestions of actors and my team, and sometimes we make changes on the spot," he added.
