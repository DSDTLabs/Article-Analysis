PUNE: A 15-day drive to identify illegal hospitals, sonography and abortion centres started in the   on Thursday.

 TOI in its report published on March 9 had highlighted how most nursing homes in Mhaisal village and remaining rural parts of the Miraj taluka in the Sangli district have been functioning without mandatory registrations for last many years.
 
 “Nursing homes/hospitals found running without valid registration would be given a deadline of one month get registered with the local authority. If they fail to do so, they will be told to shut down. Since medical services come under essential services we cannot straight away shut them down,” district health officer Ramchandra Hankare said.
 
 Barring the area falling within the municipal corporation limits, the Sangli district has 10 talukas. “We have formed 11 teams, each comprising an assistant police inspector, a medical superintendent, a taluka health officer and a nayab tahasildar. They will inspect every clinical establishment within their jurisdiction. A local authority concerned will issue show-cause notices to those found running without valid registrations,” civil surgeon   said.
 
 As per the section three of the Bombay Nursing home Registration Act 1949, it is mandatory for every hospital or nursing home to seek valid registration from the local health authority. The person who is running the hospital or nursing home without licence or registration can be punished under section six of the act that stipulates six months of imprisonment or a fine of up to Rs 10,000.
 
 Police and health authorities have started initiating a slew of measures to curb irregularities after the   allegedly run by homeopath   was unearthed in Mhaisal village earlier this month. It was later found that Khidrapure was running the hospital illegally without seeking the mandatory registration.
