NEW DELHI:   that are crying out loudly about being the victims of fraud may have to do some explaining in the coming weeks. 

 
 While banks such as Uco Bank and Allahabad Bank have taken the plea that they provided funding to companies operated by accused   and Mehul Choksi based on guarantees or letter of undertaking (LoUs) issued fraudulently by executives of Punjab National Bank, there are questions over the process followed by branches of other banks in Hong Kong.
 
 There are concerns in the government over how the banks fell for LoUs, which were issued for much longer tenures than the prescribed periods for diamond and gems traders, something that PNB executives have repeatedly flagged amid demands from other lenders that the Delhi-headquartered public sector bank compensate them for the hit.
 
 While the issue is yet to be settled, government officials suggested that investigations of the processes followed at other banks will determine the liability of each bank, including PNB. 
 
 Banks such as UCO Bank, a small bank with weak finances, have an exposure of over $400 million (Rs 2590 crore), which is nearly a quarter of the Rs 11,300 crore, which is the estimated value of the fraud. Others, such as Allahabad Bank, have a smaller liability after selling a part of the original loan exposure.
 
 Sources in the government said large exposures through a foreign branch of any of the banks that extended credit based on the forged documents should have set off alarm bells but that didnâ€™t happen. 
 
 Technically, banking experts said, other lenders could get a benefit of doubt as funds provided by them go into a NOSTRO account or an account that a bank holds in a foreign currency in another bank overseas. This would have made it tough for the bank management to spot, if the funding was provided to companies owned by the two diamond traders, who are main accused in the fraud.
