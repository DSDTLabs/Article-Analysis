VISAKHAPATNAM: A home guard, identified as Sheikh Valli, was killed in a   triggered by the Maoists on the Lothugedda junction-Balapam stretch in   on Friday morning. 

 This is the first naxal activity in the Andhra-Odisha border areas after the Ramaguda encounter that killed 31 Maoists and their sympathisers in October 24 last year. 
 
 Sources said the explosion occurred at around 8.30am when Valli was returning from the CRPF outpost at  . After learning this, Maoists waited in ambush to eliminate the home guard during the journey. 
 
 The impact of the blast was so strong that the remains of Valli’s body and the SUV he was travelling in were scattered everywhere. 
 
 Visakha Rural SP Rahuldev Sarma told TOI that the naxals have been showing their presence in   pocket for the past few months. “They wanted revenge after the Ramaguda encounter and were waiting for a chance,” he added. Sources said the landmine was at least four years old as the road was laid at least three times in the last four years. The police have deployed special parties to intensify combing operations in Visakha Agency following the incident.
 
 Valli’s brother   is a sub-inspector in   district.
 
 Frequent incidents under Annavaram police station limits has raised doubts over the strong presence of naxals. Maoists exchanged fire with Vizag rural police before making an escape in the forest area near   under Annavaram police station limits in Vizag Agency in April 9.
