NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court-appointed   ( ), which had brutally cut the administrative powers of   officials on Thursday, showed on Friday it meant every word of the letter sent to the board functionaries by refusing to clear BCCI’s acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary’s three-day tour of Sri Lanka at the board’s expense.

 
 
 
 TOI had exclusively reported on Thursday that the CoA, led by  , had asked Choudhary to explain what his “functional duties” would be in Sri Lanka. Not convinced with the secretary’s explanation, CoA gave strict instructions to the BCCI management on Friday not to sanction Choudhary’s trip to Sri Lanka till further instructions.
 
 
 
 It was revealed that the CoA’s instructions went hours before the BCCI secretary wrote a scathing letter, in which he has questioned the role of the CoA.
 
 Choudhary was not available for his reaction but sources close to him said his fight against the CoA’s attempt to undermine the office-bearers will not stop. They said that by virtue of being an ICC director and a member of the Asian Cricket Council, Choudhary was well within his rights to be a part of the ongoing Nidahas Trophy final.
 
 It was learnt that Choudhary’s travel plan was revealed after he applied for foreign exchange from BCCI in Mumbai. He also had his tickets booked.
 
 Now that a miffed Choudhary has gone ahead and released a seven-page letter questioning the CoA’s role, the fight between the CoA and BCCI could only get uglier.
