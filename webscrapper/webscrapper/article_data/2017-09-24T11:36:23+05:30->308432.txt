CHENNAI: Nearly 2,300 years after Greek mathematician   measured the earth's circumference from Egypt, students repeated the experiment Bhavan's   in Kilpauk on Saturday. Armed with a simple formula derived during the 3rd century BC, 30 students from Classes VI to VIII set about determining the angle of a shadow cast at noon by a 10cm stick planted on the handball court in the school campus.The students, handpicked from M Ct Muthiah Memorial Matriculation Higher Secondary School,   and   completed the experiment within an hour, arriving at a result which was 98.3% accurate. Eratosthenes' result had been deemed 90% accurate.

 The circumference of the earth is 40,008km, as per modern experiments. Following the experiment carried out with the help of protractors and the stick, the students ar rived at a result that was not too far off -40,680km. The experiment by Eratosthenes had shown the circumference of the earth to be 44,100 km Eratosthenes' experiment helped solidify the theory that the earth was round.Aristotle and Pythogoras of Greece had claimed that the earth was not flat a few hund red years before Eratosthenes conducted the landmark experiment at the town of Syene (modern Aswan, Egypt).
 
 The experiment can be conducted on any day of the year, but mathematicians prefer doing it on one of the four days of the year when the position of the sun is exactly known. Eratosthenes had decided to conduct the experiment on a summer solstice, while the city students chose the autumnal equinox on Saturday .
 
 The experiment was part of the `Project Paridhi' launched by Delhi-based SPACE India. â€œThe project is a showcase to prove that science can be best learned by doing," said, astronomy educator A Prabhakaran of the SPACE India.
