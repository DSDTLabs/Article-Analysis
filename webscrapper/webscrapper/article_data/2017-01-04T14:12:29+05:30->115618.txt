SURAT:  , two of the worst aquatic weeds, have taken over the surface of   just above the pumping stations. This phenomenon of summer, which creates problems in the pumping of water from the pumping stations to Surat city, has occurred this time of the year for the first time. The reason for the growth of vegetation is reduced water level in Tapi river. The vegetation has got a chance to grow because of sewage in the upstream of the river from outlets of tabelas at khadi and near Kamrej Bridge.

 K H Khatwani, additional city engineer,   (SMC), said, “At least 14 outlets in the upstream of the river starting from weir-cum-causeway to Kamrej throw all kinds of sewage into the riverbed. When water level is low, the sewage acts as nutrition for weeds and help them to grow faster. This is what is happening now.” 
 
 SMC would have to remove the vegetation or else it would interrupt the pumping of water into intake wells and from the pumping stations. The algae has started to give out a particular odour which has become unbearable for residents of nearby areas. 
 
 “We are trying to remove the vegetation to keep the water as clean as possible. Things would be set right in a day or two,” Khatwani said.
