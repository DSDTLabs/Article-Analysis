MADURAI: The Madras high court Madurai bench ordered notice to the   collector on a plea seeking disbursement of insurance amount to farmers in the district. One C Maragatham from Sivaganga filed the petition. She said that in 2016-17, farmers insured their paddy crops with primary agricultural cooperative society in the district. The premium amount per acre was Rs 22,000. More than 1,000 farmers paid their premium based on their land. 

 Due to rainfall deficit, the farmers were affected. Meanwhile, the government released insurance fund to the farmers. It led to farmers demanding insurance amount, but the society is refusing to give money. The officials cheated crores of rupees.
 
 Regarding that, a complaint was also lodged before   in Sivaganga. Following it, peace talk was conducted at the tahsildar’s office at   on October 10, in which the officials assured farmers’ branch that they would pay the insurance amount. Even after that, no amount was paid. Hence, it was necessary to direct the authorities to give amount to the farmers. On this petition, the division bench headed by justice M   ordered notice and adjourned the hearing.
