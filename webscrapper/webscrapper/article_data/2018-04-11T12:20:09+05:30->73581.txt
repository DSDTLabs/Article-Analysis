MARGAO: The All Goa Senior Citizens’ Federation on Tuesday expressed grave concern over the rise in cases of harassment and physical abuse of the elderly people in the state. They have rued the failure of the law enforcing agencies in effective implementation of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and   Act 2007. 

 Addressing media persons, president of the Forum, Diago D’Souza, pointed out several cases where the elderly were subjected to physical abuse and assault at the hands of their kin, the latest being that of 90-year old Revati   from   who was allegedly assaulted by her daughter-in-law leading to her hospitalisation. 
 
 Stating that the police have largely failed in booking cases against the accused under the Act despite efforts by the Federation in sensitising the police towards abuse of the elderly, D’Souza stressed on the need for reviewing the Act. 
 
 “According to the Act, the beat policeman is required to visit the houses of senior citizens staying alone and inquire about their safety and welfare. The Act also mandates appointment of a conciliation officer with a view to facilitate mutual settlement of cases. The implementation of the Act is very poor,” D’Souza lamented. 
 
 Demanding effective implementation of the Act, D’Souza said, “We have restrained ourselves from taking to the streets as senior citizens are considered to founts of wisdom and experience. If the government is unable to implement the provisions of the Act, we demand that the Act be withdrawn,” D’Souza said.
