Chennai:   is of utmost importance for lawyers, judges, scholars and for any user of technology alike, said   of Madras high court Justice Indira Banerjee here on Monday. With a considerable part of the economy becoming dependent on cyber technology, legal issues are bound to arise, she said.

 Chief Justice Banerjee, speaking afer launching a book -- Decoding Technology Laws -- a book on cyber laws by advocate N S Nappinai, said: “Issues of jurisdiction arise because in cybercrime, the thief can be in any part of the world. People are lured by messages and mails claiming they have won a lotter. If people share their bank details with these thieves, the outcome is quite evident.”
 
 The book deals with all aspects of law relating to cyber technology. The book which was previously launched in Delhi and Mumbai by the respective Chief Justices was launched in Chennai on Monday. The book talks about the relationship between the Constitution, crimes, IPR and contracts with technology laws.
 
 “Any cybercrime is not just registered with IT Act. It will broach upon Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) as well. When IT and IPR are put together, you can find a lot of inconsistency,” said Nappinai. She said cyber law could not act as a stand-alone law. The book explores and provides an in-depth analysis of each relationship between cyber law and the different legislations.
 
 She said the main objective of the book was to remove the opacity regarding laws and create awareness about laws that apply to the cyber domain, the threats that lurk and how to protect one.” According to her, although the book is primarily a legal reference, it can be easily read by a commoner.
