Pune: The TOI   app received an overwhelming   from all quarters on the first day of its launch in the city on Monday.

 Citizens as well as authorities not just applauded the initiative but also hoped that it would usher in a positive change that TOI has always supported and stood for.
 
 People from different parts of the city took to the   to air their grievances, sharing photographs, videos and text messages on diverse issues ranging from traffic woes to garbage segregation, water scarcity, illegal constructions, civic amenities and safety issues.
 
 From roadside encroachments to the bribe-taking babu, from the unattended pothole to an unauthorised food joint, from parking problems on college campuses to harassment on the streets, every problem has a solution. And the TOI Citizen Reporter app is the newest way to get it heard and resolved in a speedy manner. 
 
 So, what are you waiting for? Download the app and tell us about the problems in your vicinity through photographs, videos or just text and be a part of the change. Be a TOI Citizen Reporter.
