 is a well known name among Telugu moviegoers. 

 
 Irrespective of directing a very few number of films in a career spanning almost three decades, with his quirky style of filming and aesthetic sense for music, Vamsy has carved a niche for himself. It wouldn't be any exaggeration to mention that he has gained a cult following among elders and youngsters alike.
 
 
 After a long hiatus, Vamsy, who is badly craving for a hit to comeback, is gearing up with 'Fashion Designer, S/O Ladies Tailor', which is all set for a theatrical release. Young actor   played the titular role, which is said to be an extension of the director's cult classic-'Ladies Tailor' starring Rajendra Prasad. According to the updates from makers of it, the movie will open in theatres on June 2.
 
 
 Music director Mani Sharma collaborated with the maverick director for the first time ever and the songs that were released recently straight into the market already made an impact. With the film's major portions being shot in Godavari, given the director's obsession with the river, the visuals of the songs are tantalising.
 
 
 
 Anisha Ambrose is the female lead of the film, produced by Madhura Sreedhar.
