KOCHI: Private hospitals management in the state have decided to recruit nurses from Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, if the employed nurses in Kerala decide to go ahead with the indefinite state-wide strike from March 5.

 
 "We have decided to engage nurses from other states on a temporary basis if our nurses go on indefinite strike. They have pushed us to a corner and we will be forced to act. We are taking up the matter with the state labour department on Tuesday," said  , KPHA Secretary and   Coordinator.
 
 In the meeting, it was decided to start talks with nursing recruitment agencies from the neighbouring states. "We are aware that the number of patients in our hospitals will reduce due to the strike. If that happens, then the nurses will be taken back only in proportion to the patient load," said  , KPHA Treasurer and State KPHA Action Committee Coordinator.
 
 The unanimous decision in the meeting was that they will not permit the shutdown of private hospitals which treats 70 % of the patients in the state.
 
 "IMA has also expressed their full support to us and said that they will provide medical treatment to the patients," informed KPHA. KPHA has decided to protect the nurses who will participate in the strike.
 
  (UNA) said that they are unaffected by the threats of the hospital managements and will go ahead with the indefinite strike if they fail to give the revised wages and also end the ongoing strike at KVM hospital, Cherthala.
 
 "Any such move of the hospital management will only add to the patient's inconvenience. If they are really interested, they should immediately implement the revised wages," said Bibin N. Paul, state treasurer, UNA.
 He added that after the one -day token strike last week, the hospital managements has served notice on many nurses for restraining from coming to duty and it is unfair.
