GANDHINAGAR: Senior Congress leader   has attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his ‘silence’ over the beheading of two Indian soldiers by Pakistani border forces.

 “The PM is not serious about the country’s defence,” said Vaghela who is leader of opposition in the Gujarat assembly. 
 
 “Modi has not said even words of sympathy to the families of the two jawans who were beheaded by Pakistanis.”
 
 The Congress leader further said that instead of solving the Kashmir problem and strengthening the country’s security, Modi is busy inaugurating Baba Ramdev’s factory.
 
 Changes in Gujarat Congress likely
 
 Top Gujarat Congress leaders are likely to visit New Delhi to meet   and Rahul Gandhi. Changes in Gujarat Congress are expected on May 8 and there is speculation that a Patidar leader may replace Shankersinh Vaghela as leader of opposition before the one-day assembly session on May 9.
