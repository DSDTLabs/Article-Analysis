Indore: Failing to catch the tiger that was spotted in Nagda, the forest department has decided to bring in two more elephants to rescue the wild cat that has created panic among people living in the area. Two elephants were already involved in the operation. “We have called in for two more elephants from Peench National Park. They will reach here tomorrow,” said BS Annigiri, chief conservator of forest, Ujjain said on Wednesday. The other two elephants that were already involved in the operation were brought from Satpura National Park. The operation will resume on Friday. “Elephants need a day’s rest, so we will halt the operation. However, we will keep track of the tiger’s movement,” Annigiri said. Forest officials said that using elephants was necessary in the area as there are tall bushes and travelling by vehicles is not possible. Forest department officials said the tiger had moved four kilometres away from its previous location. While it was in the forest land, it was still in the vicinity of human settlements. The forest department had kept a bait for the tiger on Tuesday, but the tiger killed it and left without eating it. Officials said that from the tiger’s initial sighting, it was clear it was a male and around three years old. It was spotted near a human settlement near Nagda last week, prompting forest officials to launch a rescue operation for the wildcat. Officials said that tiger did not belong to the jungles of Nagda and had come from a nearby forest. “Once it is caught we will have it sent to Satpura wildlife sanctuary,” Annigiri said. The forest department has urged villagers to keep calm and take necessary precautions. They have also advised residents to stay away from the hills where the animal was spotted. Reports of presence of wild animals being spotted have started cropping up in the last two weeks. Some goats and a cow were also attacked.
