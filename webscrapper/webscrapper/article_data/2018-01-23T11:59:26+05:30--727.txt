NEW DELHI: 20   ( ) Delhi lawmakers today again moved the Delhi high court (HC) against their disqualification; the court said it will hear the plea tomorrow.

 
 The MLAs moved the   a day after they withdrew an earlier plea saying they had to examine Sunday's Presidential order approving the  's ( ) recommendation that they be disqualified. 
 
 On Friday, the EC sent President Ram Nath Kovind its recommendation to disqualify the AAP MLAs for holding offices of profit.
 
 AAP appointed 21 of its Delhi MLAs as parliamentary secretaries in 2015 soon after it won a thumping majority in the Delhi Assembly polls. One of the 21 MLAs, Jarnail Singh, earlier already resigned.
 
 AAP moved the Delhi HC on Friday immediately after news broke of the EC's recommendation. Yesterday, though, the MLAs' counsel told the court that that since President Kovind had accepted the EC recommendation and issued a notification disqualifying them, the plea had become infructuous.
 
 The axed MLAs include Alka Lamba, Adarsh Shastri, Sanjeev Jha, Rajesh Gupta, Kailash Gehlot, Vijendra Garg, Praveen Kumar, Sharad Kumar, Madan Lal Khufiya, Shiv Charan Goyal, Sarita Singh, Naresh Yadav, Rajesh Rishi, Anil Kumar, Som Dutt, Avtar Singh, Sukhvir Singh Dala, Manoj Kumar and Nitin Tyagi.
