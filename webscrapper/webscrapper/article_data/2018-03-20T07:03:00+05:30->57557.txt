AMRITSAR: The   ( ), Amritsar may finally have its regular director three years after its inception. The Union ministry of human resource development (MHRD) has advertised for the post on contractual tenure of five years with April 16 as the last date of applying for the vacancy.

 The IIM Amritsar is being mentored by the director of IIM Kozhikode.
 
 Sources told TOI on Monday that during the previous   regime the IIM directors were appointed through an appointment committee of the cabinet ( ) that recommended names of the candidates to the Prime Minister and he then who gave his approval accordingly.
 
 Sources said currently, the PM and the Union home minister were the only two members of the ACC, which meant recommending and appointment committees were the same.
 
 “In the prevalent system, a person considered close to the ruling government at the Centre was shortlisted on the recommendation of some cabinet ministers. The ACC would then recommend his or her name and the appointment of candidate was okayed by the PM,” said sources, adding that since January, the authority of appointment of director has been vested with the board of governors (BoG) of the IIMs who are now independent to select the candidates.
 
 “Still the final approval has to be taken from the ACC. We hope the ACC wouldn’t decline the board’s recommendations,” said sources.
 
 Earlier, the post of director of IIM Amritsar was advertised twice but no candidate could be finalized. “A couple of candidates were considered for the post but they were not appointed due to their proximity to the previous Union government,” alleged the sources.
 
 Recently, Amritsar MP   had taken up the issue of delay in the appointment of a regular director of IIM Amritsar, due to which construction of a permanent campus of the institute and other important decisions had been delayed.
