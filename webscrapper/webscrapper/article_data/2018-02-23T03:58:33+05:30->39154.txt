LUCKNOW: Expelled BSP member   on Thursday formally joined Congress, along with his wife Husna and son  , in the presence of   UP in-charge Ghulam Nabi Azad and UP Congress chief Raj Babbar in New Delhi.

 
 He also merged the Rashtriya Bahujan Morcha — a non-political organisation he had formed after his expulsion from BSP — with Congress. After joining, Siddiqui said he felt privileged on becoming part of country’s leading political party. Later, he met   with his supporters, including former BSP MLC OP Singh.
 
 Siddiqui, a former BSP national general secretary, was expelled by   on charges of usurping party funds. He had denied the charges while accusing the BSP chief of deviating from the principles of BR Ambedkar. Siddiqui’s switch over to the Congress was criticised by his supporters who had left BSP after his expulsion. One of them claimed that Siddiqui did not consult his supporters before joining the Congress.
