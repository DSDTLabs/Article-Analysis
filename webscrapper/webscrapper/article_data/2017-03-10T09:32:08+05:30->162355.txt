LUCKNOW:   will make e-journal available round-the-clock at   from the new academic session. Earlier, the e-library could only be accessed for six hours a day.

More than 100 computers will be installed in the library for facilitating 24-hour access of e-books following the direction of vice chancellor S P Singh,” said deputy librarian Jyoti Mishra.
