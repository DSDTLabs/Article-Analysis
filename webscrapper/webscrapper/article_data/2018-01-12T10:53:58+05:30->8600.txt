 "According to media reports, India is set to launch 31 satellites including the earth observation spacecraft Cartosat, on 12th January 2018. All space technologies, including earth observation satellites, are inherently dual use and can be employed for both civilian and military purposes," spokesperson of Ministry of Foreign Affairs Pakistan Dr   said in a media briefing.

  "All states have a legitimate right to pursue peaceful uses of space technologies. However, given the dual-use nature of such technologies, it is essential that such pursuits are not directed towards a build-up of destabilizing military capabilities, which can negatively impact the regional strategic stability," he added.
 
    today launched its 100th satellite,   into the space.
 
  The Indian microsatellite will demonstrate a new technology which will allow capturing of images at night and will also provide high resolution scene specific spot imageries.
 
  The imagery transmitted by the satellite will be related to areas of cartographic, urban & rural applications, coastal land use, road network & monitoring and water distribution.
