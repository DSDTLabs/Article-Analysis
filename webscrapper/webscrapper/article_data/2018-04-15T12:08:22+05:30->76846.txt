MAPUSA: With a view of attracting more global tourists, civil aviation minister   has suggested creating an entertainment park at the upcoming greenfield international airport in  .

 “As much as 234 acres of land (at the   site) has been allotted for commercial development. We should explore the possibility of developing a huge entertainment park here so that it can be a tourist attraction,”   said. 
 
 He explained that the park could either be developed under a public private partnership (PPP) model, or outsourced.
 
 Prabhu was speaking to reporters after inspecting the airport project site on Saturday, where work on the runway has begun. 
 
 “The airport will earn profit every time an international flight lands here. More flights will translate into more income, and more tourists,” Prabhu said, adding that by 2025, 30 million tourists will visit the state because of the airport.
 
 The minister also said jobs created out of the Mopa airport project would be offered only to locals, and that there would be no compromise on this. “A skill development programme will be launched in the state. Those who undergo training will be employable anywhere in the world,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, some people held a protest against the ongoing Mopa airport work, saying the massive tree-cutting and land-filling has threatened the endangered flora and fauna and the existence of natural springs.
