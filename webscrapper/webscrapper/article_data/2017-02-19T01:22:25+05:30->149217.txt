GURUGRAM: As as many as 9,100 trees have been cut in 2016-17 so far. The figure exceeds the maximum number of trees felled in Gurgaon in the past four years, as per the data available with the district forest office. 

 Government agencies sought permission to cut 8,500 trees to carry out construction of the underpass near  , while private enterprises and individuals only sought to cut 600 trees. In 2015-16, 1,646 trees were cut in the city, 3,120 in 2014-15, and 1,997 trees were cut in 2013-14. 
 
 It’s not private enterprises, but government agencies which have sought permission from the forest department to cut more trees. Statistics reveal that that in the last four years starting 2013-14, government agencies have felled 11,495 trees. The figure for private enterprises is a mere 2,296. Besides, cases involving felling of 2,072 trees are pending with court. 
 
 “Tree felling in 2016-17 is largely due to construction of underpass on the three junctions — Shankar Chowk, Signature Tower and Iffco Chowk. But we have ensured that at least 10 times the number of trees felled are planted by the agencies which sought permission for cutting them,” said MD Sinha, Conservator of Forest, Gurgaon Circle.
 
 Green activists, however, feel that lack of stringent laws against tree felling is the reason behind depleting green cover in the city. 
 
 Activists have sought for urgent implementation of a tree act on the lines of Delhi. “As there is no ‘Tree Act’ in Haryana, it is easier for everybody, be it a government agency, individuals or a private enterprise, to axe trees. The Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994, slaps a penalty of Rs 34,500 for felling even a single tree, to be recovered by the forest department. Besides, an individual must plant 10 trees in lieu of cutting one. Moreover, illegal tree cutting invites seven years of imprisonment. In Hayana, meanwhile, the penalty for felling trees is a mere Rs 200. The state needs a strong tree act like Delhi,” said Vivek Kamboj, an environmentalist.
 
 R S Rathee, president of  , a citizens’ platform, said, “Blatant tree cutting has made Gurgaon the most polluted city in the country. Trees, which are the primary source of oxygen, have been cut mercilessly and there is no strict law in place to penalise those disturbing the ecosystem.” 
 
 Rathee has been fighting a legal battle against authorities for allegedly cutting trees in the green belt in DLF phase 1.
