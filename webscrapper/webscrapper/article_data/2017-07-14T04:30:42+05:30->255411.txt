Mumbai: Kherwadi police on Thursday arrested two   for molesting a first year college student on a busy street in   (E) on July 7. Sunil Rathod (19) and Umesh Chavan (24) allegedly groped the victim when she and her friends were crossing the road at 3pm. They were nabbed after police hunted for a biker in blue shirt.

 The bikers sped away before the victim could react, police said, and added that they reached the spot after a passerby called up on seeing the victim crying. “We scanned CCTV footage from 200 metres away. It was shown to many people from Vakola and we finally zeroed in on Rathod. His arrest led to Chavan’s arrest,” said Kherwadi police senior inspector Rajendra Patil. They are residents of Kherwadi and Vakola.
 
 The incident occurred at RNA building, near the collector’s office. The victim said in her complaint, “We were about to cross the road, when suddenly a two-wheeler passing by stopped near us. The pillion rider molested me and sped away.”
 
 Patil said they formed three teams to crack the case. “Forty persons were interrogated and CCTV footage was scanned. The police team searched visitors’ books from buildings nearby and finally assistant inspector Sohan Kadam and his team got the clue that led to the arrests,” he said.
 
 The duo has been booked under sections 34 (common intention) and 354 (outrage modesty) of the Indian Penal Code and under sections 8 (sexual assault) and 17 (abettment) of POCSO Act. They will be produced before the Bandra court on Friday.
