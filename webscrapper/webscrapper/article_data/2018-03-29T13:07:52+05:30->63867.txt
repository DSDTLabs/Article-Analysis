MADURAI: Doctors who practise allopathy should also be aware of alternative forms of medicine such as siddha, said Justice S   delivering the convocation address at  . 

 The convocation was held for the 2012-17 batch of medical students and 149 graduates received their degrees. Justice Vimala said that the graduates should always think of the sacrifices made by their parents to educate them. Cases of parents approaching the court to seek maintenance from their children who neglected them were on the rise. Medicine, being an outstanding profession, made it all the more important for new doctors to be socially responsible, she said. Doctors should treat the sick and injured without any discrimination and serve the society, she added. 
 
 Speaking about the important role medical records play in convicting criminals, she said that doctors should ensure that all medical details are obtained when it is a medico-legal case.
 
 She said that traditional medical practices in the country were also very knowledgeable and added that allopathy doctors should also be aware of them. For example, siddha has the ability to know the intensity and the nature of a disease by feeling a patientâ€™s pulse.
 
 Director of medical education Dr A   said that doctors should live up to the expectations of their patients who looked up to them like gods and serve society to the best of their ability. A doctor learnt a lot from his patients, hence doctors should treat their patients with humanity and also follow ethical practices, he said.
