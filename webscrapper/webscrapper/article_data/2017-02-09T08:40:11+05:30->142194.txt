JAIPUR: The   (JMC) will table the budget for financial year 2017-2018 on Thursday. The corporation has proposed budget of Rs 1,715.90 crore which is Rs 350 crore higher than the previous year. 

 The JMC has proposed to spend Rs 736.87 crore to carry out development in the city. In 2016- 2017, the corporation had allocated Rs 688.70 crore, however, only 12% of the budget was spent on city’s development. “Every time fancy budget is presented. But, due to lack of sufficient funds, the amount spend on ground is relatively very less. In previous year, only Rs 79.91 crore were spent against the proposed budget,” said an official source. 
 
 Last year, a provision of Rs 10 lakh for heritage conversation, Rs 10 crore for maintenance of sewerage treatment plant, Rs 2 crore for development of slums was made in the budget. However, no amount was spent under this section. 
 
 In absence of finance committee chairman, newly appointed mayor   is expected to present the budget in the   (GBM) on February 9. “In the 8th GBM, six agendas will be tabled. The four agendas will be related to sanitation,” said an official source.
 
 It is expected, the new city mayor will face stormy session on Wednesday as Congress and Independent councillors are unhappy with his recent warning which was issued during the budget discussion meeting. 
 
 “Lahoti warned councillors that they will not be allowed to sit in meeting if ruckus is created. This is not justified and disrespectful for councillors. We would protest against the mayor in the meeting,” said an Independent councillor. 
 
 During the Congress pre-board meeting on Wednesday. Congress city president   criticised the Mayor’s statement. He said, every public representative has right to speak about the ward problem in the GBM. Directions were given to present ward problems in the meeting. 
 
 Meanwhile, in the BJP board meeting, Lahoti directed the councillors to focus on the budget and avoid the unnecessary arguments.
