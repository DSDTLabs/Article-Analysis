 Taking to Instagram, he shared his statement alongside the caption, "My first and last comment."
 
 "I am a very private person and would normally never answer to gossip and stories that are so ridiculous that they are laughable.
 
 "Out of deep respect for Kylie, Travis (Scott), their daughter together and their families, I would like to set the record straight and say that my interactions with Kylie and her family have been limited in strictly a professional capacity only."
