HYDERABAD: Floored by IT minister KT Rama Rao’s recent tweet, Sai Vishruth Devireddy, a Class X student from the city, donated Rs 50,000 to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund (CMRF). He handed over a cheque to the minister on Tuesday morning.

 
  
  
 
 Vishruth saved up the pocket money given by his mother and planned to buy a mobile phone with the money but after reading a tweet by the minister on the night of April 23, he had a change of mind. The minister had tweeted from his twitter handle @KTRTRS: “Through CMRF so far, more than 1.2 lakh families have received assistance in emergency situations. Nearly Rs 800 crore has been spent in the last 46 months. Those who would like to contribute can write a cheque to Chief Minister’s Relief Fund, Telangana state.”
 
 On learning that CMRF supported more than one lakh families, Vishruth decided that he too should contribute. “Seeing the way ‘Ram uncle’ is helping people, I thought I can get the phone at a later stage. Right now, the money which I had can help a poor person who is sick and he/she can get better (treatment),” said the student of Future Kids International School.
 
 On receiving the cheque, the minister tweeted, “Inspired by this young man Sai Vishruth Devireddy, a 10th Class student. When his parents gave him money to buy a smartphone, he chose to donate the same to CMRF. He handed over a cheque of Rs 50,000 on Tuesday morning to me.”
 
 While the tweet was liked over 2,800 times and has been widely retweeted, many others went on to applaud the boy and the minister. “Can we include online payments for CMRF sir? Why not have TWallet be taken as a gateway for contributing to CMRF? Please think over,” suggested a citizen from the twitter handle @bajjiladeva.
