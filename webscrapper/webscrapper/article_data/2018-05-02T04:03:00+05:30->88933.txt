Ahmedabad: City crime branch on Tuesday apprehended K S Detroja, managing director of Gujarat Sate Land Development Corporation (GLDC) and handed him over to state Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB). Detroja, a resident of Satellite, was wanted in a case registered under sections of Prevention of Corruption Act.

 ACB had conducted a search operation at GLDC’s Gandhinagar headquarters on April 12 during which Detroja was found in possession of Rs 1.28 lakh cash and a gold ornament in his bag. His colleagues were also found in possession of money, totalling Rs 55 lakh. Detroja’s extension has recently been cancelled by the Government of Gujarat.
 
 “After the ACB Nadiad team had approached city crime branch about Detroja, a team led by inspector R S Suvera had started tracking him. Working on information that he was going to pass from near Gujarat Vidyapith on Tuesday, a team kept a watch and spotted a white car matching the description. The team asked Detroja to halt but he instead tried to flee. After a small chase, he was apprehended. As he was not willing to come out, the officials had to use force,” said a crime branch official.
 
 Investigators said that ACB will further question Detroja who is also facing a separate disproportionate assets case.
