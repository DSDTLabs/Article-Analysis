GURUGRAM: The gang   of a 26-year-old Sikkimese woman in the early hours of Saturday has once again shaken the conscience of the society, raising serious questions about safety of women in the city.

 Girl students and working women, especially those living in hostels and paying guests around   road, are scared of venturing out at night. Sources said there were more than 800 paying guest (PG) facilities around the 14.5-km-long road that starts near Najafgarh-Kapasehra road in Delhi and stretches up to   in Gurgaon.
 
 The local people alleged that this important road lacked streetlights and proper vigil. “While the entire road is dimly-lit, there are stretches where you won’t find a single streetlight. I have been living here for past two years or so and I have never seen a PCR on the entire Old Delhi-Gurgaon road, except on the border,” said Jasmine Kaur, who lives near Kapasehra.
 
 “The incident took place in an area where a lot of women professionals and girl students live. The gang rape survivor was abducted right outside her home. There is a need to make the area well-lit and increase police patrolling,” said Khyati Prasad, a BPO employee who lives in Sukhrali. 
 
 A resident of Sector 17A, Kritika Srivastava echoed Khyati. “Sukhrali area has small lanes, where it is sometimes difficult for cabs to enter. So, girls often get down on the main road and walk through the dark lanes. After this shocking incident, this area does not feel safe anymore,” she added.
 
 Some students also complained about unruly men travelling in cars along Old Delhi-Gurgaon and passing lewd comments. “We don’t have any option but to digest all these nonsense. We are under constant fear,” said a student, requesting anonymity.
