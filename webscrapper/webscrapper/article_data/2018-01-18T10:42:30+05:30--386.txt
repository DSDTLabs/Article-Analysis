PANAJI: In view of the proposed strike by tourist taxi operators on Friday, the   ( ) has assured its members of extending help with regards to their transport requirements for guests on that day and has asked stakeholders to let it know about their needs in this regard. This will be the third tourist taxi strike since 2012. 

 President of the tourism trade body, Savio Messias told TOI that, as part of the preparation, he visited Drishti Marine’s facility at Baina. “TTAG has spoken to   to arrange for ferry service to transport guests from the airport to   and Verem,” Messias said.
 
 Messias said he also called on KTCL chairman Carlos Almeida and will be placing a request for coaches on Thursday. “We have asked all members to approach us for help. I will know our requirement by Thursday,” Messias said, adding that TTAG will be setting up help desks in North and   to help tourists who may be inconvenienced by the strike.
 
 With the state government extending its full support to the tourism trade body, the TTAG feels they are better prepared to deal with the strike this time. Messias, who was part of the meeting chaired by chief minister   on Wednesday, said that tourism stakeholders are extremely “unhappy” with the strike as tourist taxi operators have neither held any dialogue with the government to resolve their issues nor have they submitted their demands to the transport department.
 
 “I think they ought to have had a discussion with the government before resorting to the extreme step,” he said. 
 
 Black and yellow taxis, rickshaws, motorcycle pilots have not announced their support to the strike yet.
 
 “Already the image of tourist taxi operators has been affected due to overcharging by a few operators. They should not use the threat of strikes,” a tourism stakeholder said.
