PUNE: Summer is harsh on animals, especially if they do not have access to water. To provide better access to water for birds at   village in Mulshi, a   of volunteers have built a cost-effective  .

 The waterhole, measuring about 30-feet long and 3-feet deep, was built by volunteers of the ‘Mungi’ (ant) nature   group from Nisargved Charitable Trust.
 
 According to group member Saee Purandare, “Around 25 volunteers built the eco-friendly artificial waterhole using high-density polyethylene (HDPE) sheet, layered over a dug-up hole, and covered with big natural rocks and sand at the end of February”.
 
 The waterhole is now being maintained by   of Gomukh and locals from the area. It has already started attracting wildlife from the nearby area. “After the work of building the water was completed, we also installed a trap camera atop a tree nearby. We have captured images of wildlife, including deer at the spot. Since the camera only captures movement of large animals, we have not been able to capture the movement of birds here,” she said.
 
 Explaining the specialty of the waterhole, Saee said, “It is saucer shaped. This makes the water accessible to birds and animals even when levels are very low. So they can literally consume water to its last litre. In many other places, waterholes are square shaped, which are not as easily-accessible for the wildlife”. Nisargved has been building waterholes for wildlife across the state and has built close to 350 so far, she said.
