SHIMLA: All India Democratic Women Organisation (AIDMA) reached Shimla and held an agitation against the state government on Tuesday demanding to shut down the liquor shop opened near girls’ and women’s hostels in   of Shimla.

 AIDMA state vice president   said they have launched a state wide campaign to shut down the liquor shops beings opened at wrong places. “Till now we have launched the campaigns at  , Hamirpur and Mandi, and now the campaign will be carried out in the remaining eight districts too. We are happy that the protests were successful at Sirmaur, where some of the liquor shops got closed. We are headed to Shimla now and starting from Panthaghati, we will search more liquor shops that are creating annoyance to non-drinkers.”
 
 Chauhan said the state must do proper research of an area before giving licenses to liquor vends. “After shutting down the liquor shops on national highways, the state government has been openly giving licences to people to open liquor shops wherever they want to,” he added.
 
 As many as 60 women from AIDMA gathered in lower Panthaghati area to agitate against the liquor shop. “Lower Panthaghati is not a commercial but a residential area. A liquor shop is not meant to be opened here as the atmosphere will affect the safety and security of large number of students, girls and families here,” AIDMA said.
 
 Women also presented a memorandum to the Shimla deputy commissioner Rohan Chand Thakur on Tuesday. “Deputy commissioner has assured us action but if district administration does not shut down the liquor shop within 3 days, we will shut it down ourself,”   threatened.
