The assault on filmmaker   by a fringe group on the sets of his upcoming film ' ' in Jaipur, for allegedly distorting facts, forced the makers of a historical serial, ' ', to halt shooting for a day. 

 Shaleen Bhanot, who plays an important role in the show, is upset about the treatment meted out to   and its rippling effects. 
 On driving back to   after a day’s break, the actor learnt that the palace officials had not given them permission to shoot there as they feared that the protesters would target their set as well. So, the producers and the team took the day off. 
 
 Shaleen said, “What happened on the sets of 'Padmavati' has shaken us all and these are just precautionary measures. It’s sad when such things happen. We have lost out on a day of shoot. I hope and pray the situation settles down soon.” 
 
 The shoot of the show resumed a day-and-a-half later, but fear still looms large on the set.
