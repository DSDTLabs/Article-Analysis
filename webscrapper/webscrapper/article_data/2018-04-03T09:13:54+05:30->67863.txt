BENGALURU: The long wait of   ( ) who haven’t got their wages since September 2016 has ended, with the government approving the release of about Rs 84 lakh from the state treasury to the   Employees Benevolent Fund Bangalore for disbursal of the pending salaries.

 The   had staged several protests after jail officials stopped paying their wages citing technical problems. “Under the new system introduced in 2016, the wages were to be deposited in the prisoners’ bank accounts. We had managed to open accounts for several prisoners at SBI’s Singasandra Branch but were unable to do so for everyone, resulting in the stopping of payment,” a senior officer from the prisons department said.
 
 Sources said Somashekar, superintendent of  , recently wrote to the government saying the financial year (2017-18) was about to end and the problem of   persisted. A March 23 government order permitted release of pending wages to the Karnataka Employees Benevolent Fund Bangalore account. But this is a one-time relaxation only and payment would be transferred to prisoners’ bank accounts directly in future. “We will transfer the wages to the inmates’ bank accounts once treasury releases the money,” an official said.
 
 The inmates are paid wages in three slabs. The prison department has fixed Rs 70 per day for unskilled prisoners, Rs 80 for skilled and Rs 90 for highly skilled. There will be a daily deduction of Rs 40 against the prisoner’s daily expenditure in jail.
