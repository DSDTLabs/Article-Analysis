 However, Sindhu’s victory failed to lift the morale of rest of her teammates as they lost three matches in a row including two doubles against the Indonesians. The performance of   and Sikky Reddy was the most disappointing. What happened earlier in the day was repeated later in the evening as Indian men were ousted by the Chinese. Here also   was spot on and provided a 1-0 lead with a hard-fought three-game victory over Shi Yuqi.
 
 In the second singles too, Sai Praneeth dished out a lion-hearted show but he wasted a game’s advantage and lost against Qiao Bin in a thriller.
