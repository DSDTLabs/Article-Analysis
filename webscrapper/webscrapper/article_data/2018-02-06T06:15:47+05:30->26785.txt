AHMEDABAD: The   of   (GIFT) City, the   near Gandhinagar, was gutted in a major fire on Monday afternoon, possibly caused by a short-circuit.   (GFES) and other fire services doused the flames after two and a half hours.

 The premises, called Aspire II, housed the administrative office of International Finance Service Centre (IFSC). The fire broke out in a room 20 feet from the cafeteria of the office wing. Officials said that the fire broke out at lunch time, about 2.15pm, when not many people were in the office area and those in the cafeteria, including senior GIFT City officials left the building minutes after the fire was noticed.
 
 Mahesh Mod, fire officer of GFES, said that apart from Gandhinagar, the fire brigades of Ahmedabad and Kalol were told to provide vehicles to fight the blaze. “About 1 lakh litres of water was used. No one was reported injured. The fire spread quickly due to strong winds, but we managed to contain it and cooled the area down,” he said.
 
 Mod added that they had recently written to GIFT City, asking them to equip for fire emergencies. GIFT City presently has a small fire tender, insufficient to address any major incident, said experts.
 
 Ajay Pandey, MD and group CEO, GIFT City, in a statement said that the building that reported the fire was a makeshift one and was previously used as an administrative office. “Most of GIFT staff were shifted to a new premises last year and there were no casualties or injuries. As a precautionary measure, all nearby buildings were also evacuated,” it mentioned, adding that from preliminary examination, the cause seems to be a short circuit.
