 Sources said NHAI chairman Deepak Kumar has written to Haryana chief secretary D S Dhesi saying that the authority cannot give the appointed date to L&T since the required land parcels are not available. “It’s being developed as an expressway and without getting land for the entire stretch, building small stretches won’t help,” said an official, who did not wish to be named.
 
 In his recent letter to Dhesi, NHAI chief has referred to a meeting held in last week of February where the Haryana government officials had committed to resolve the land related issues and provide the required right of way (RoW) for carrying out construction. But even after three weeks the state has not fulfilled its commitments.
 
 The commitments included removal of all structures and hindrances in   barring 68 structures where there is stay by High Court, confirmation to reimburse the cost of 14 hectare land acquired by NHAI in Haryana and transferring 4.25 hectares of state government land to NHAI without any cost.
