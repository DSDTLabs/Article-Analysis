BENGALURU: Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) will relaunch special services on the IT corridor, after the transport department withdrew permission for a private common bus system for 45 companies on Outer Ring Road. 

 IT/BT minister   and transport minister R Ramalinga Reddy called a meeting of the various stakeholders to discuss traffic congestion on the   stretch of ORR. They discussed ways to enhance public transport and the common bus system. The common bus system will help employees of 45 companies on this stretch. They will be picked up from different parts of the city and dropped in the tech enclaves. The service will be available from 7am to 9am .
 
 Ramalinga Reddy said BMTC will be able to handle the services as it already serves Infosys, Wipro, ITPL, JFW and Manyata Tech Park. "We will buy 1,650 more buses this year, probably by March. We should be able to cater to the IT employees on ORR with about 800-odd buses. The quality of the buses will be better. The services can be mapped as the companies' association has planned. This will improve people's confidence in BMTC and increase public transport usage," he said.
 
 Sources said the transport department had admitted that it was a mistake to have issued permission for a common bus system as bus aggregation by private parties is not allowed under the Karnataka Motor Vehicle Rules.
 
 "First BMTC did not show interest. A private real estate consultant agreed to be the aggregator of buses operated and owned by private sector. We also got special permission to operate the common bus system. Later the department withdrew the permission. Now BMTC has agreed to deploy its fleet for the service, catering to over four lakh employees of all 45 companies between Silk Board and   junction on ORR. The BMTC app is fantastic and can improve reliability of the service," sai d Captain  , honorary president of Outer Ring Road Companies' Association.
