AHMEDABAD: City crime branch on Thursday registered a case against K S   for intimidating cops and trying to run over members of the crime branch team, when they had gone to apprehend him last Tuesday. The managing director of   (GLDC), a resident of Satellite area, was handed over to the state Anti-Corruption Bureau ( ) by the crime branch. Detroja, was wanted in a case registered under sections of Prevention of Corruption Act.

 “After the ACB Nadiad team had approached city crime branch about Detroja, a team led by inspector R S Suvera had started tracking him. Working on information that he was going to pass by Gujarat Vidyapith on Tuesday, a team kept watch and spotted his white car,” said a crime branch official. “The team asked Detroja to halt but he instead tried to flee. After a small chase, he was apprehended. As he was not willing to come out, the officials had to use force,” he added.
 
 Deputy commissioner of police, Deepan Bhadran, said they have booked Detroja and have lodged an FIR against him. “We will seek his custody once ACB finishes with their interrogation,” he added. Investigators said that ACB will further question Detroja, who is also facing a separate disproportionate assets case. ACB had conducted a search operation at GLDC’s Gandhinagar headquarters on April 12 during which Detroja was found in possession of Rs 1.28 lakh cash and a gold ornament in his bag. His colleagues were also found in possession of money, totalling Rs 55 lakh. Detroja’s extension has recently been cancelled by the government of Gujarat.
