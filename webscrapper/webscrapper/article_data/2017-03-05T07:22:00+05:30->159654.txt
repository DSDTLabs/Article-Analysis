AMRITSAR:  , hoteliers,   and religious bodies have come forward to help   who are making distress sale following glut of potato crop in the fruit and vegetable markets.

 On Saturday, Federation of Hotel and Guest House Association held meeting and decided to extend helping hand towards potato growers. Association’s president Surinder Singh said their members had met several potato growers in Amritsar and Tarn Taran districts to assure purchase of potatoes directly from them at Rs 6 to 8 per kg. He said there were around 200 hotels and restaurants with majority of them having their own kitchen which would be a major help to the distressed farmers. “As much as 150 quintals of potatoes will be purchased daily by the association,” he said.
 
 Tarn Taran deputy commissioner D P S Kharbanda said the administration had decided to use potatoes for mid-day meals and asked the government schools to directly purchase potatoes from farmers for Rs 5 per kg.
 
 A wholesale potato dealer in Amritsar’s fruit and vegetable market, Aman Kumar, said presently farmers were selling potatoes for Rs 2 to Rs 2.5 per kg which was far less than even input cost. 
 
 In recent past, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee has also announced to directly purchase potatoes from farmers for its langar. Narinder Kumar Langarwala said he had replaced dal with ‘aloo ki sabji’ at his daily langar. “It may be a small step, but this is what I can do to help them,” he said.
 
 While hailing the efforts of hoteliers and langarwalas, Jamhuri Kissan Sabha president Satnam Singh said the government should come to the rescue of farmers. “We have demanded to fix minimum selling price of potatoes at Rs 10 to sail farmers out of the present crisis,” he said.
 
 Gurnam Singh, a potato grower, said that in view of high demand and attractive price of potatoes received last year, the farmers in the region brought maximum of their land under potato cultivation.
