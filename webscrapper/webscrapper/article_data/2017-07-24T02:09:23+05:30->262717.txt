MUMBAI: A day after the Devendra Fadnavis government lifted the   on  , it is set to   it in view of stringent criticism of the controversial decision.

 FDA minister Girish Bapat confirmed to TOI that the ban is being reimposed. “Pending report of the one-member panel of  , it was proposed that the decision to ban flavoured supari will be taken after receipt of the report. However, we will impose the ban again and take a final decision after receipt of Deshmukh’s recommendation,” he said.
 
 A few months ago, when a delegation of flavoured supari manufacturers called on Fadnavis, he had assured them that he will look into their grievances. Their contention was that flavoured supari does not contain carcinogens, like tobacco and heavy metals, and “as such was not harmful”. Fadnavis asked the then medical education secretary, Rajgopal Deora, to give them a hearing and submit a report. A day after the CM’s order, Deora was shifted to the protocol department and Deshmukh was appointed in his place. Deshmukh has given a hearing to the aggrieved supari manufacturers and is expected to submit his report.
 
 In 2012, the government banned gutkha, pan masala, chewing tobacco and zarda on the grounds that these contain carcinogens and cause oral cancer. In July 2013, the state extended the ban to include flavoured supari. —Prafulla Marpakwar
