AHMEDABAD: The   (I-T) department sent more than 500 summons to citizens who deposited more than Rs 50 lakh   was announced, but could not explain their large deposits. Interestingly, the I-T department attached literature of the Pradhan Mantri   (PMGKY), an amnesty scheme launched by PM   in December 2016, with a view to help citizens avail of all remedies.

 Sources, however, said that the I-T department has making a bid to make more number of income declaration under PMGKY. Because, the I-T department had never, in past, sent any such literature of Income Declaration Scheme (IDS) to the persons having unaccounted income.Highly-placed officials in the I-T department said the investigation wing has taken the initiative to send PMGKY literature because taxpayers should have information about income declaration and not run from pillar to post when they arrive to give their statement regarding the summons. The taxpayers who received these summons were unable to satisfactorily explain the large deposits by email. “The initiative was taken to make taxpayers aware of the PMGKY schemes. We also gave details about the penalty for having unaccounted income, if they fail to answer the summons. Thus, we provide all alternatives to these taxpayers,” said an official.
 
 The tax and penalty for those who hide unaccounted money and fail to avail of PMGKY could go as high as 137% of cash deposits made. Under the scheme, people can deposit unaccounted cash in bank accounts till March 31 this year, by paying 50% tax plus penalty. A quarter of the sum will also have to be parked in a non-interest paying deposit for four years.
