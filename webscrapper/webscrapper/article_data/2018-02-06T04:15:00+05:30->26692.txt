Vadodara: The detection of crime branch (DCB) has arrested a man who jumped his bail conditions and didn’t appear at the central jail for a month. Farooq alias Chhapra Sheikh, a resident of Fatehgunj, was arrested in a murder case by Sayajigunj police in 2015. He was accused of killing a man identified as Akbar in Kalumiyan Chawl. 

 The cops had nabbed him later and he was lodged in Vadodara central jail. He was given interim bail and had to report back at the jail on January 21. However, when Farooq didn’t turn up, the parole-furlough squad and other police teams began looking for him. He was nabbed from the banks of Vishwamitri River in Fatehgunj on Sunday.
