ALLAHABAD: Ruling that Election Commission can remove duplicate and fake names from electoral roll till the last date of filing of nomination, the Allahabad   on Friday directed it to correct electoral roll of Ghaziabad assembly constituency (No. 56) of Ghaziabad district. 

 While disposing of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by one Ajay Rajput, a resident of Ghaziabad, a division bench comprising Chief Justice   and Justice   passed the order after hearing the arguments put forward by the counsels of the petitioner and the   (ECI).
 
 The petitioner contended in the PIL that he is a voter in constituency no. 56 of Ghaziabad where a large number of fake and duplicate voters have been included in the electoral roll.
 
 It was further contended that the petitioner had earlier sent a representation to the ECI along with the documents containing details of 10,504 duplicate voters and 7,123 fake voters in this area. He had also given details of houses which, according to the electoral roll, accommodated more than 250 voters each. However, he alleged, no action has been taken by the ECI officers on his representation.
 
 During earlier court proceedings, the ECI counsel raised the preliminary objection and argued that election dates were notified by the ECI on January 4. And once it is notified, a PIL is not maintainable, he contended.
 
 The court refused to accept this contention and clarified that as per law, voter list can be corrected till the last date of filing of nomination. Hence, the ECI is empowered to make corrections at this stage also. 
 
 The court, while disposing of the petition, directed the ECI to make corrections in the election roll of the said constituency if it found that name of any voter appeared twice or if fake names have been added.
