PATNA: Accepting an invitation from Congress chief Sonia Gandhi’s daughter  , RJD boss   on Monday left for Lucknow to campaign for the SP-Congress candidates contesting in different assembly segments of Rae Bareli and Amethi Lok Sabha constituencies in Uttar Pradesh.

 Rae Bareli and Amethi are represented in the Lok Sabha by   and her son and Congress vice-president  , respectively. 
 
 “From Lucknow, Lalu will visit different assembly segments in Rae Bareli on Tuesday and campaign for the SP-Congress alliance. Tuesday is the last day for campaigning in Rae Bareli district where polling is scheduled on February 23,” RJD chief’s public relations officer Syed Shamim told TOI.
 
 He said the RJD chief would campaign in Amethi on Wednesday. Amethi is going to the polls on February 27.
 
 “We are yet to receive the list of assembly segments where Lalu will campaign. That will be decided by Priyanka. Lalu ji will get the list on Tuesday morning,” a political aide of the RJD chief told TOI on Monday. He said Priyanka telephoned Lalu ji and requested him to campaign in the stronghold of Gandhi family.
 
 Before leaving for UP, Lalu attacked PM   for making unsuccessful attempt to divide voters on communal lines by raising issues like ‘Shamshan’ and ‘Kabristan’.
 
 “Who has stopped you from constructing cremation grounds and waiving farmers’ loans? Should a person with a 56-inch chest mislead the country by resorting to meek ways?” Lalu said.
 
 Lalu also tweeted that PM Narendra Modi is a dictator and the unity and integrity of the country is not safe under his leadership. “Ye to tanashah Pradhan Mantri hain. Desh ke tukde-tukde kar tabah kar denge. Janab, aap PM ho, itni ochhi, chhoti aur khoti bate nahin karni chahiye (he is a dictator Prime Minister. He will divide the country and destroy it. Sir, you are PM; you should not make such low-level unsavoury and acerbic statements),” he tweeted after the PM’s rally in Bundelkhand on Monday.
