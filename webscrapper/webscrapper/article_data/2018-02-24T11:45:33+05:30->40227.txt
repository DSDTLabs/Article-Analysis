LUCKNOW: An inquiry committee of the   set up to probe the   in Lucknow has on Friday asked people to share evidence regarding the incident. It could be an audio, video or a photo showing the build-up and factors that led to the fateful incident in which the stray feline was shot at in Aurangabad Khalsa locality under Ashiana police station and subsequently succumbed to injuries. 

 Media, NGOs and even individuals, who happened to be on the spot the same day, can share the information. "Media reports may not stand a chance in the court though they describe clearly as to what happened that day. Videos, photos and audio clips may serve as an evidence," said sources.
 
 Based on media reports, the inquiry committee has issued notices to two cops who were present on the spot at the time of 'killing'. "The two policemen have been asked to furnish details of others who were 'on-duty' at the spot," the sources said adding that the pace of the probe would be affected by the response time of the police. On the other hand, villagers too are not coming forward to share details. The committee is finding it difficult to convince them to talk, the sources added. 
 
 The leopard, that had strayed into Aurangabad Khalsa, village within the city limits last Thursday, was 'killed' on Saturday morning after it ventured out of the area where the forest department had kept it localised for two days. 
 
 The department failed to tranquilise and trap the leopard safely. The department said it found the leopard lying dead in the kitchen of a house in the village. It added that it did not know who 'killed' the leopard and what led to the fateful incident.
 
 A police officer, who was at the spot, had said it fired two rounds at the leopard in self defence and locked it inside kitchen. Postmortem report showed two bullet wounds and death due to shock and excessive loss of blood.
 
 The forest department had constituted an inquiry into the matter.
