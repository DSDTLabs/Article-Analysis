 The PMC is starting a drive to clear land titles and has completed credit rating system to attract private investments. The government has recommended municipal bonds and value capture finance tools to meet capital expenditure needs of cities.
 
 Municipal commissioner Kunal Kumar said the PMC is appointing agencies and efficient professional staff to execute projects under smart city mission.
 
 The ministry of urban development has proposed increase in reform incentive fund from Rs 500 crore during 2017-18 to over Rs 3,000 crore per year over the next three years. Cities will be ranked based on performance under each category for providing reform incentive.
 
 Civic activist Vijay Kumbhar said the municipal corporation needs to be more impartial and participatory in its approach. “Many reforms get stuck in rule books and citizens don’t get any benefit out of them. The civic administration must respond to citizens’ demands and complaints,” he said.
