COIMBATORE: For the second consecutive year, city corporation’s annual budget will be tabled in the absence of councillors, most likely on Friday. 

 Sources in the corporation said that it will be another surplus budget, with very few project announcements. Only projects proposed under the central government schemes such as smart city and   will be announced in the nearly Rs 1,080cr-worth budget, said an official. “We will have a separate table that will provide information about all the projects that were announced in the earlier year’s budget with details and their progress. We will ensure that this budget is also simple with not many big projects. Only projects under smart city and a few proposed projects will be part of it,” corporation commissioner   said.
 
 But, corporation officials confessed that in the absence of the finance committee, they are clueless on how to go about it. While a dedicated audit team is working and consolidating all the revenue receipts and expenditure, the officials said that there was lack of clarity in many fronts. “Last year, the entire system was changed and we had to work in a different format. This year, again, though it is the same format, it is not easy to get the document ready on time,” said an official. They are struggling to consolidate information from various departments, the officials said.
 
 This year again, the budget will not have much taxes or increase in charges as it is being prepared with an eye on the upcoming local body election. 
 
 Public representatives said they were in dark about the process. “Zonal meetings were held with residents before projects were finalised when the council was in place. But now, the corporation is functioning on its own and no suggestions have been taken upof,” said a former   councillor.
