LUCKNOW: The three-member probe committee constituted by chief minister   on Tuesday night to look into the reasons for the collapse of a section of the under-construction flyover in Varanasi submitted its report on Thursday and flagged six major lapses in the project because of which the tragedy occurred.

 
 The probe committee has recommended strict disciplinary action against seven officials of UP State Bridge Corporation, including managing director  , chief project manager SC Tiwari, former project manager Genda Lal, project manager KR Sudan, assistant project manager   and junior project managers Rajesh Pal and Lal Chand.
 
 
 
  
 
 The probe committee found that the drawings used in the construction had not been approved by competent officer of the department. The high-level probe panel has further pointed out in its report that the beams laid between the columns had not been tied with the cross beams.
 
 The report further says that the UP State Bridge Corporation Limited did not maintain record of the batch mix plant because of which the ratio of cement, sand and grit used to cast the beams was not affirmatively as per the set standards and had also not been checked by competent officials at regular intervals.
 
 Moreover, the working unit at the spot involved in mixing the concrete did not have the requisite check list.
 
 The committee further said that after carrying out inspections, the officers were not issuing their remarks after the inspection.
 
 Most importantly, the team found that the agency had not carried out any kind of barricading at the construction site and had not provided an alternative route for movement of traffic on the stretch.
 
 The CM has directed officials to ensure that similar lapses are not repeated in any construction work in the state.
 
 The panel comprised agricultural produce commissioner  , chief engineer of irrigation department   and Jal Nigam MD Rajesh Mittal.
