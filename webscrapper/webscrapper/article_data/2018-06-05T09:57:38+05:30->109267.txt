 and   recently made an appearance on a TV show for promoting their upcoming multi-starrer film ‘Race 3’. The dance reality show which has a bunch of talented kids has some renowned celebrity judged including Madhuri Dixit-Nene. Jacqueline posted a video from the event which otherwise seems normal but netizens found it appropriate as it sent across a wrong message. She wrote, “Kids usually love me, this boy was an exception…at least I got my hug in the end.”

 In the video, Salman asked the kid if he will let Jacqueline hug him, and the kid gave a firm no. Although it was passed on as a funny moment, but fans felt that it wasn’t right on the stars’ part to hug the child forcefully when he wasn’t willing to hug back. Soon, users started pouring in with their comments on how the video sent a completely wrong message.
 
 
 One user wrote, “how am I being pessimistic? The boy didn't consent to the hug he was clearly very uncomfortable. Kids have boundaries too that need to respected. Calling her out for her problematic behavior isn't being pessimistic it's stating facts.” While another user wrote, “regardless of whether the child was joking or not (I personally don’t think he was, look at body language, Salman turned it into a joke), when asked if he wanted a hug he said “nahi”. The word no came out of his mouth and that gives nobody the right to go hug him anyway. As far as “sabhi bachho ke saath hota hai” is concerned, well that doesn’t make it okay. It only means that adults don’t understand that the concept of consent also applies to children.”
 
 
 Users also pointed out at feminism and wrote, “What if some one forced himself on u ? Sab feminism jag jata na , remember consent of a kid equally important, dam important u woman.”
 
 While the netizens are trolling the actors, we feel it was more of a sweet gesture between Jacqueline, Salman and the little kid.
