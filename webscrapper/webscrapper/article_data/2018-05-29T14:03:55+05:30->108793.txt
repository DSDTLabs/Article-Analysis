BENGALURU: The tussle between the ruling coalition partners —   and JD(S) — in Karnataka continued over 
  on Monday, with finance being the major bone of contention, even though chief minister HD   claimed that the issue would be resolved by Tuesday. 

 
 During a three-hour meeting at Ghulam Nabi Azad’s residence in New Delhi, Kumaraswamy reportedly told Congress leaders that it has been the convention in coalition governments in Karnataka to allow the junior partner to keep the finance portfolio. When Congress leaders argued on why it had the right to stake claim to the key portfolio, the CM sought time, saying he would consult JD(S) chief HD  . 
 
 During the Dharam Singh-led Congress-JD(S) government in 2004, the finance department was with then deputy CM Siddaramaiah, and in 2006 when Kumaraswamy was CM of the JD(S)-BJP coalition, the portfolio was with then deputy CM BS Yeddyurappa. Kumaraswamy reportedly told that the formula was based on the model of Maharashtra coalition governments. 
 
 Apart from finance, a few other key portfolios, such as energy, water resources and PWD, were also discussed. JD(S) also wants to keep these departments as HD Revanna, the CM’s brother, is keen on PWD and energy. Congress leader DK Shivakumar, too, is said to be keen on the energy portfolio which he had held in the previous Siddaramaiah government. 
 
 “Congress wants all the key portfolios, leaving animal husbandry, labour, fisheries, youth services, women and child welfare to us. It is not fair,” JD(S) sources said. “A decision will be taken after Congress leaders consult  , who is abroad,” Kumaraswamy said after the meeting.
