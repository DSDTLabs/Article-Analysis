Bestselling mythology writer   launched the book cover of his highly-anticipated second book in the Ram Chandra series, 
  on Thursday, May 4. The cover launch was held at Title Waves Bookstore in Mumbai and Amish was accompanied by   actress and producer,  .

  Amish’s new book, with the central figure of Sita, defies the image we have of her and projects Sita as a feminist icon. Amish’s new book cover perfectly captures her as a fearless warrior. A powerful Lady Sita stands protesting with her lathi, single-handedly fighting a crowd of men who have come to abduct her.
 
  Commenting on the cover launch for the book, Amish said, “Ancient India witnessed a far more equal social set-up than we have today. The cover depicts Lady Sita to be a fearless warrior and the book will capture her journey from being an adopted child to a fierce warrior and then becoming a Goddess.”
 
  Raveena Tandon’s presence at the launch was supposed to emulate the spirit of the modern woman, independent and powerful, much like Amish’s Sita. Talking about the cover of the book, Raveena said, “In ancient India, women held positions of power and led countries as queens and fiercely fought on the battlefield. They enjoyed more freedom and respect from the society. It is great to see that Amish is bringing that alive through Sita and the cover beautifully illustrates her as a true warrior.”
 
  The trailer launch of the much-awaited book will take place on 16th May, while Amish’s fans will finally get a chance to grab their copies on the day of the book launch scheduled to be held on May 29 in Mumbai. 
  can be pre-ordered at Amazon,  , and  .
