PATNA: The proposed open theatre at   is likely to become operational from the first week of October.

 Patna divisional commissioner Anand Kishor, who held a meeting on Friday with officials of Patna Municipal Corporation and representatives of Spanish firm Eptisa Servicios de Ingenieria SL, the management consultant for the Smart City project, said the screen for the open theatre would be installed by September 30 prior to Dussehra celebrations. The Spanish agency has been given one-month time to complete the bidding process for roping in the agency which will install the screen.
 
 Apart from Bollywood and religious movies, documentaries on various government schemes would also be screened at the open theatre. The show timings will be from 7pm to 10pm and the entry will be free.
 
 “We have decided to use a movable screen for the theatre so that it can be removed at night after the show. No permanent structure is required to be built for the purpose. An inflatable movie screen with an attached projection screen (commonly used for outdoor movies) will be installed,” Kishor said, adding two high quality projectors and sound equipment would also be installed.
