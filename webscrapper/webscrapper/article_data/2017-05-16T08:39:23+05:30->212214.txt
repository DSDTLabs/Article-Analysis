Nagpur: Eight teams from the Rural police are scanning CCTV footage and taking other innovative measures in trying to crack the Rs 21.42 lakh robbery case that took place on Sunday at Kanhanâ€™s Amit Jewellers.

 Four armed goons, including two with turbans, fled with the booty after shooting at owner Amit Gupta and injuring him in both legs.
 
 Police said the CCTV footages from the cameras installed in the shop, which is being looted for the second time now, are being viewed by a team which is scanning records of the last one week.
 
 The investigators feel it was a pre-planned effort by the robbers who may have scouted the area first or must have had a mole in the shop.
 
 Some cops are viewing CCTV footages of different places along with the possible route taken by the robbers. Though Madhya Pradesh police have been alerted, the cops here are unsure if the robbers have crossed the state border.
 
 Cops feel that some members of the gang may have criminal records in other states. According to them, the manner in which the gun was fired is uncommon among local robbers.
 
 Another set of investigators are also tallying various call detail records and tower locations of different callers in a radius of couple of kilometres where the shop is located. The call details of the shop employees and other acquaintances are also being also studied. The cyber team is using the best software for analysis.
 
 Cops from local the crime branch and Kanhan police have also quizzed several criminals and also some released from jail in the last couple of months to solve the case. Criminals, earlier nabbed for similar crimes or known to possess firearms, were also checked.
