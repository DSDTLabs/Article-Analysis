Rare pictures of   Army’s   (BAT), accessed by ET, clearly indicate that Pak Army regulars and terrorists work in tandem on the Line of Control.
 
  On the Indian side, the posts are connected with communication trenches — semi-protected pathways through which   soldier can move between the posts.
  
  Indian soldiers also carry out regular patrols between the posts to detect intrusion attempts. Pak Army’s BATs target Indian soldiers in these trenches as well as on patrol duty.
  
  
 
  A Pak team usually consists of special service group commandoes, regular soldiers of the   regiment that mans the LoC and terrorists.
  
  Although Pak has never acknowledged the existence of such teams, terrorists have in the past boasted about such operations on the border.
  
  These teams more often than not mutilate the bodies of killed soldiers. In August 2013, a 20-strong BAT team raided an   patrol in Poonch, killing five soldiers. BAT teams are also known to have planted land mines on the Indian sides of the LoC to target soldiers on a known patrol route.
