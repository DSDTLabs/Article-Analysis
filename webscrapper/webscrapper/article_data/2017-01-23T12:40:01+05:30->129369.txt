NEW DELHI: Delhi government has written to the Centre requesting that the Central Pollution Control Board ( ) be directed to constitute a technical committee that will draft a policy for creating “standardised engineering design for green crematoria.”

 In a letter dated January 20, Delhi environment minister has written to the union environment minister saying, “Establishment of green crematoria will help in substantially cutting down pollution emissions from burning of biomass and significantly improving the air quality index (AQI).” Delhi government has just initiated the process of installing smoke tappers at crematoria in the capital.   (CSIR NEERI) is designing these smoke tappers for Delhi government.
 
 The letter also states that banning of wood in crematoria and switching to electric or CNG crematoria is not a tenable solution because “our traditions are associated with use of wood in pyres.”
 
 According to  , an NGO working to develop green crematoria, there are about 400 cremation grounds in Delhi. Around 350-400kg wood is used for each cremation. “We have been working for 25 years in this sector. In our experience, if the system is too technical or requires a lot of maintenance, it may not work,” said Anshul Garg of Mokshda.
