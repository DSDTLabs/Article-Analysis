Ludhiana: The first   of a four-year-old from Ludhiana has been reported by the health department. District epidemiologist Dr Ramesh Kumar said: “This was the first case of dengue in Ludhiana, and first death as well. The four-year-old was living in Samrala, and taking treatment in PGI. While the family directly took her to PGI for treatment, she was diagnosed with dengue, and the health department was informed about it on July 11.”

 Dr Ramesh further added: “We are done with fogging in that area, and house-to-house survey too has been done. Larvae have also been killed wherever found. The health department is taking all preventive action, and going on regular surveys. Wherever stagnant water or larvae is found, details are sent to the municipal corporation for imposing fines. But we are not sure whether they are doing any challans or not, because nothing has been sent to us in written. We were informed only verbally.”
 
 So far, only two positive cases of dengue were reported by the department, whereas it was on June 14 when TOI reported about 16 cases in Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) since January. Dr Sandeep Puri, principal and professor of medicine, said: “Since January, 16 cases have been reported for dengue. The tests done for dengue were positive and patients were treated accordingly. Even in July, two positive cases of dengue were reported in DMCH — one patient was from Jammu and Kashmir, and the other was from the city itself, for which the health department had not given any information.
 
 While diarrhoea outbreaks were being taken care of, the health department had been ignoring dengue cases, as no information was given about positive dengue cases.
