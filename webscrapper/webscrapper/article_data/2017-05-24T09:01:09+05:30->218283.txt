CUDDALORE:  ,  , has properties that can prevent  ,   and biotechnology department at   in Chidambaram have found. 

 While neem's anti-cancer properties have been demonstrated several times by a number of researchers, scientists in Annamalai University demonstrated that a bio-active ingredient, nimbolide, activates a tumour suppressor protein called RECK (Reversion-inducing Cysteine-rich Protein with Kazal Motifs), which is found in all normal tissues but is low or absent in malignant tumours. The research, they hope, will help them drugs that improve survival rates and treatment outcomes in patients with oral cancer. 
 
 The research study, published in a peer reviewed journal, Scientific Reports, Nature Publication Group in May, said nimbolide, derived from the leaves and flowers of the neem tree, could be used effectively to treat oral cancer, said biochemistry and biotechnology professor Siddavaram Nagini. In the laboratory, a team of researchers showed that nimbolide prevents cancer progression by prevention growth of uncontrolled malignant cells. It also spreads to other tissues through new blood vessels and kills cancer cells. 
 
 "RECK has tumour suppressing properties. In normal cells, it maintains tissue architecture and prevents infiltration and spread of tumour cells to other organs. In cancer, an array of molecules inhibits the function of Reck. Nimbolide suppresses the functions of the molecules that inhibit the function of RECK," Nagini said.
