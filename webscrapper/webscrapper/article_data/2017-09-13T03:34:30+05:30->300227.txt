KOLKATA: A six-year-old toddler died of   in Karaya on Tuesday evening, taking the toll to three in the city in last one week.

 Mohammad  , who was shifted to the   from a local nursing home late on Monday evening, was immediately put on life support since he was also suffering from pneumonia and septicaemia along with dengue.
 
 “The medical reports the family had submitted showed that the child was already suffering from dengue. His platelet count was very low and he was under severe respiratory distress. We tested him again for dengue and put him on life support immediately. He was administered blood too,” said a doctor at ICH.
 
 “The child died of pneumonia and septic shock in case of dengue,’ said  , incharge of paediatric ICU at ICH.
 
 This is the third dengue death in the   area in the last one week. On September 7, a father-son duo in Kasba died of dengue. Siddhartha Ghosh, 50, and his son Deep Gosh, 13, were residents of the KIT Housing Society. So far, 18 dengue deaths have been reported in the state.
 
 Though the city was spared of the menace till July due to an aggressive awareness campaign by the civic body, experts have now warned that more people could contract dengue since it had reached the densely populated neighbourhoods. Though there has been no major dengue spurt in private hospitals till now, the numbers are steadily rising. In 2015, dengue turned epidemic in Kolkata after it started from Salt Lake and took the EM Bypass route to reach Tiljala, Topsia and then entered south Kolkata through East Kolkata Township Project area and the Prince Anwar Shah connector.
