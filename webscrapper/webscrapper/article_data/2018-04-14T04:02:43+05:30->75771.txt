MUMBAI: After taking a battering from the opposition over its purported anti-Dalit policies ahead of the elections next year, the state government has decided to come up with a special   policy under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Farmland, housing, jobs and rehabilitation packages have been proposed as compensation to victims of   and acid attack, and to the family of the victim in case of murder, if they are members of   or  .

 In 2016, the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989 was amended and states were required to prepare a model contingency plan for the implementation of the provisions of the act.
 
 In keeping with the amendment, TN and MP have come up with the contingency plan. On the same lines, the state also intends to draft a similar plan for higher compensation to   of atrocities.
 
 The state has formed a 13-member committee under principal secretary of the minority development department Shyam Tagade and asked it to submit a contingency plan in a month. The committee has to decide the module on the process to be followed while paying the newly proposed compensation.
 
 “This compensation will be additional, apart from the Atrocity Act compensation, and we have asked the committee to draft the contingency plan,” said secretary to the social justice department Dinesh Waghmare.
 
 Since the Supreme Court recently ruled that an FIR under the   should not mean automatic arrest, the BJP-led government has been targeted by the opposition and several Dalit outfits for the “dilution” of the special law while it is in power.
 
 Dalits are 22% of the state population and the Congress said it was telling that the latest move by the state government came ahead of the Lok Sabha and state elections in 2019. “It is an attempt to save face by the BJP government,” said Sanjay Nirupam, former MP and city Congress chief.
