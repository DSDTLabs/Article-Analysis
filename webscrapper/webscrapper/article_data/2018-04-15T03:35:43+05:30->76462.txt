MUMBAI: A day after Bombay high court administrators took over the reins of the   (MCA) led by   president  , all photographs of politicians in the   office have been removed. 

 Significantly, following the appointment of administrators, Shelar ceases to be the MCA president.
 
 An MCA office-bearer said that while there were no specific instructions from the newly appointed administrators- former Justices Hemant Gokhale and V M Kanade-photographs of politicians in the cabinet of Shelar and other office-bearers were removed on Thursday.
 
 Disposing of a public interest litigation filed by Nadeem Memon over non-implementation of the recommendations of the Justice R M Lodha committee, a division bench of Bombay high court comprising Justices Shantanu Kemkar and M S Karnik had appointed Justice Gokhale and Kanade as administrators.
 
 After taking over, they postponed the April 16 meeting of MCA to amend the constitutions in view of the recommendations of the Lodha committee which had made it clear that no minister or public servant can be an office-bearer and that no office-bearer will continue for more than two consecutive terms.
 
 The MCA office-bearer said that it has now been proposed that the meeting be held after the administrators interact with the office- bearers of the affiliated clubs and then take a decision on amendment to the constitution.
