NEW DELHI: The love-hate relationship between   and British announcer and journalist   has a new chapter. A history of taking sarcastic jibes at each other, the two were involved in yet another banter that concerned the India-England final of the  .

 As England defeated India in the final by nine runs to win the coveted crown for a record fourth time, Morgan was quick to fire the first shot. In a tweet addressed to the former India batsman, he said: "You OK, buddy @virendersehwag?".
 
  
  
 Morgan followed it with a screenshot of a tweet he posted almost a year back, which was regarding a bet he placed that required Sehwag to pay a million rupess in charity if England win a World Cup before India bags another gold at the Olympics. He quoted the tweet saying: saying: "Ahem, @virendersehwagâ€¦ pay up!"
 
  
  
 And that was it. Not only did he recieve a fitting reply from Sehwag, as expected, but the entire   community joined the former India opener in giving Morgan a piece of their mind. This is what Sehwag tweeted in response: "Me and all of India prouder even in this loss than you can ever be mate.We fought well &will only get better & stronger. Enjoy for a change!"
