MUMBAI: Months after the BMC started putting up an “illegal structure” on the only access path leading to a school in Kandivli, the Bombay high   on Wednesday directed the corporation to pull it down within a month. 

 A division bench of Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Vibha Kankanwadi imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on the BMC, the money has to be paid to Shivdatta Educational Trust that runs Raghuvir Madhyamik Vidyalay in Kandivli east. The school trust had moved the HC after iron girders and asbestos sheets were put up on a path leading to the school. According to the trust, a similar structure in the area with an idol in it was pulled down following the HC’s orders in 2013. 
 
 Advocates Raju Moray and Sagar Rane, counsel for the school trust, claimed that the structure was put up in violation of court orders. 
 
 In an affidavit before the court, the BMC had claimed that it was constructing an “open auditorium” on collector land at a cost of Rs 5 lakh using the corporators’ funds. “The construction of an open auditorium was suggested by then prabhag samiti chairman Yogesh Bhoir,” said Rajesh Akre, assistant engineer (maintenance) of R South ward. The officer said that the proposal for construction of the open auditorium near the school was passed in the prabhag samiti on April 28, 2016. 
 
 The petitioners had cited a report of the divisional fire officer after conducting a fire and safety audit. “The approach to the school is from a narrow lane at south-side through Dr Ambedkar Road. It was noticed that a shed was constructed at the entry of the narrow lane from Dr Ambedkar Road. The shed will obstruct the entry of fire tenders and ambulance in case of any emergency from the only approach lane available for the school,” the officer said in his report. The officer further recommended that the shed should be removed and the road should be kept free of any obstruction.
