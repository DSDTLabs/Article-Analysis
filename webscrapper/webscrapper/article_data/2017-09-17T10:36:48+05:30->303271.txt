LUCKNOW: Blaming lack of research for encephalitis becoming a major threat to lives of people in Uttar Pradesh,   and parts of Bihar, chief minister Aditya Nath   asked director of   to send a research team to Gorakhpur to identify causes of the disease that manifests as brain fever.

 The chief minister said, “Nobody paid due attention to the disease till 1977 and doctors kept dismissing it as an unknown killer disease. Had its causes been studied, we would have come a long way in its treatment.“ Yogi insisted SGPGIMS take up research in the eastern, central, western and Bundelk hand parts of the state to find out causes and treatment of the disease.
 
 Yogi lauded SGPGIMS for the robotic surgery initiative and liver and kidney transplant units and said there was need to eradicate the very causes that give rise to need for transplant. “I promise, research institutes will not face any financial crunch but results must be visible,“ said Yogi.
 
 The chief minister upheld SGPGIMS as the backbone of UP's healthcare infrastructure and exhorted students to take up research and public service within the state. “Don't become money-making machines and spend at least two years working in rural areas and thus contribute more to research for which SGPGIMS was set up,“ he said.
