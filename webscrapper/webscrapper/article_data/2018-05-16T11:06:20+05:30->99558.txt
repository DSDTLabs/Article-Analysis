 CHANDIGARH: The back lanes of the markets of Sectors 8 and   continue to stink of trash and stagnant water. The   comes from the restaurants and gyms, and it has choked these lanes so much that these are almost inaccessible on certain days. The pits dug up to lay pipelines have not been filled back.
 
 The area behind Hotel JW Marriott was dug up to lay pipelines. Kashmir Kaur, joint secretary of Bhaskra Beas Management Board Colony Welfare Society, Sector 35-B, said: “For this task, the paver blocks were removed. More than one month since the pipelines were laid and the paver blocks removed, the tiles have not been restored.” The service lanes behind the market of   remain covered with water spilling out of outlets.
 
 The accumulation of filth and waste water has caused foul smell to hang over the area. The odour irritates the passersby. The stagnant water has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes, creating a threat of vector-borne diseases in summer. Sector-8 householders welfare association joint secretary Ranvinder Singh said: “The waste generated by the shops of this market is dumped in an irresponsible and inconsiderate manner. The garbage blocks the drains and leaves the area stinking.”
 
 The paver blocks uprooted from the footpaths have been restored in patches only. Pedestrians are in the danger of tripping. The filthy conditions have rendered the areas behind the markets unsuitable for parking. These have also become home to stray dogs. Area councillor Mahesh Inder Singh said: “We have filed a complaint with the SDO (subdivisional officer) for the restoration of the paver blocks behind the market area. Due to lack of funds, the issue will take some time to resolve.”
