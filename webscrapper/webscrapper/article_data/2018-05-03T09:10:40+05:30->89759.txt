MUMBAI:  A west African man died after falling 50 feet from the Sahar elevated road while trying to escape from the custody of immigration officials on Wednesday.  Police said Igbele Emeka Bon Aventure alias Emanuel Da Silva (34), detained on suspicion of travelling from Nairobi to Mumbai on forged documents, jumped out of a moving jeep while being brought back to the international airport after a check-up at Cooper Hospital in Vile Parle and leapt across the elevated road to the adjoining corridor. However, he miscalculated the distance and fell to his death.
