MYSURU: In a big relief to the student community of the   ( ), the   on Monday allowed the varsity to allot marks cards and   to the students who had enrolled before courses offered by the varsity were de-recognised by the   ( ). . 

 The students who enrolled during 2013-14 and 2014-15 will benefit from the decision, which has been made after a protracted fight lasting two years. 
 
 The varsity has stopped admission of new students from 2015-16 after UGC derecognised the courses on June 16, 2015. While derecognizing the courses, the UGC had stated that the courses are derecognised with retrospective effect from 2013-14. 
 
 This affected the students who had already enrolled during 2013-14 and 2014-15. The courses were derecognised by the UGC citing the KSOU’s area of operation. It had objected to the varsity extending courses across India and had asked it to restrict it to Karnataka. 
 
 The government has now moved in to protect the interest of the students. It issued the order late on Monday and asked the varsity to extend marks cards and degrees to the students. The   member K S Shivaram said the order will help the student get the documents. “I have received information from the varsity about the government’s order,” he told TOI adding that it will help them in their fight to get recognition from the UGC, which is pending since three years. 
 
 Sources told TOI that 90,000 students will benefit from the move, which comes following a recommendation by a committee headed by chief secretary  . Some of the government agencies have denied the KSOU students permission to attend exams citing the UGC’s derecognition of the course with retrospective effect. This is what the government has attended by recognising the degrees and asked the varsity to extend them to the students, they noted.
