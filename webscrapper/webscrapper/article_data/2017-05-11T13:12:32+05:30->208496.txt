BENGALURU: Last week, China successfully completed a 80-minute first flight of its indigenous   conceived in 2008. Sadly, India’s plans of making a plane with half the carrying capacity has remained on paper since 2007.

 China’s   — almost the size of the   A320 and   737-800 — can carry 158-168 passengers. India’s plane, the Regional Transport Aircraft (RTA), is designed to ferry 50-90 passengers. “Effectively, it will be a 70-seater aircraft,” a   (NAL) official said.
 
 Hopeful of a renewed push under the regional connectivity programme, NAL, which is developing the RTA, has completed a new feasibility study and discussions on finding partners to fund the project has begun. But it could well be another decade before the first flight.
 
 According to the feasibility study, India will need at least 150-200 aircraft for civilian use in the next 5-10 years, while RTA can also replace the ageing AN-32 fleet of the defence forces, which means an additional 70-80 planes. Meanwhile, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), which developed C919, said: “The first aircraft rolled out on November 2, 2015 and we have 570 orders from 23 customers.” Experts have pegged the C919 as competition to Boeing and Airbus, on whom the Indian market will continue to depend for its domestic demand. In 2007, NAL and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited signed an agreement for the project with the former responsible for design and development, and latter for manufacturing.
 
 The aircraft, which will be capable of short take-off, will be able to operate from smaller airfields and airports that Regional Connectivity Policy is aiming to revive. Jitendra J Jadhav, director, NAL, told TOI: “We’re looking at a riskreward-sharing model for funding and are expecting to make some headway in the next three months.”
 
 NAL had projected an estimated cost of Rs 9,000 crore in 2015 and part of the reconfiguration will be looking at a next-generation turbo prop engine.
