PANAJI:   with the potential of generating power of 375kW is being burned away every month due to government complacency. The files that would approve the export of surplus power to the state   is yet to move ahead. 

 The garbage treatment plant on the   plateau has been generating electricity from   for the past seven months. 
 
 As per plant officials, the electricity department authorities had visited the plant and the exporting of surplus power was supposed to begin by March. But now, officials say it might take some more time before the surplus power reaches the state grids. 
 
 “The plant is generating around 873kW of power per month for its own consumption from the biogas created from biodegradable waste. Surplus power of 375kW is also being generated every month. We are waiting for government’s approval to export the power to the electricity department,” said Sanjit Rodrigues, managing director of Goa state infrastructure development corporation (GSIDC). 
 
 Another senior official from GSIDC affirmed that a draft power purchase agreement was done with the electricity department and the protection system is yet to be finalized. 
 
 “The plant generated 1,64,766 cubic meter of biogas in January and 1,46,980 cubic meters in February. Since there is no mechanism to export the power right now, we are flaring surplus biogas,” the official shared. 
 
 Senior officials from the Goa electricity department stated that the delay is not from their side. 
 
 “The department didn’t receive any proposal from them (GSIDC). After reading press reports, the department contacted them and asked for their technical details. We have already referred them for a power purchase agreement. The proposal’s feasibility will have to be seen and an agreement will have to be signed and rates will have to be approved by the joint electricity regulatory commission (JERC). The cost will have to be worked out and it will have to be tendered,” they said.
