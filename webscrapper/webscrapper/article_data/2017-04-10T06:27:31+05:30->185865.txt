INDORE: After a ban on any further boring work in the city was set in place,   now plans to take the help of   so that adequate water can be supplied in the city. 

 Civic body officials said they will do this in areas where water supply is inadequate.
 
 “The water supply in areas where   pipelines are present is proper. We supply water through tankers in areas where there are problems. If we still need more water then we will use private bore wells,” an IMC official said. 
 
 However, civic body sources said this would not be of much help as the water would dry up in the next few days. Most private bore wells, especially in areas where there are residential societies, have dried up.
 
 IMC commissioner   has also given strict instructions that no permission for bore wells will be given unless water is contaminated.
 
 Certificates from the collectorate were issued only after IMC officials gave their nod. At places where supply of Narmada water is available, permissions were granted based on contamination of water supplied or irregular supply. Instructions have been given to ensure that the supply problem is solved rather than handing out permissions to dig bore wells.
 
 District authorities have also announced that action would be taken against those wasting water during commercial activities.
