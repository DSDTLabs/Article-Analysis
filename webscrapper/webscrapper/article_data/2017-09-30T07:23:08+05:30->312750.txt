VIJAYAWADA: Heavy rain and huge devotee rush resulted in traffic jams across the city on Friday. The One Town area was most affected.   police, which has successfully managed traffic for the past eight days after   festivities began, could not manage the situation on Friday due to heavy downpour.

As the rain started suddenly, at around 11.30 am, and continued for about two hours, traffic was massively hit with most roads waterlogged. With the rain receding, the sudden influx of commuters caused a huge traffic jam. Already congested areas of One Town like Kaleswararao Market, Chitti Nagar, Panja Centre, K B N College Road, Tunnel Road and Sitara Junction were choc-abloc.
 
 The vehicular movement was very slow at the low bridge, Tarapet as the roads were inundated. Devotees who came from faraway places suffered the most. It took them a couple of hours to reach the temple. “We went for the temple from Agiripalle on a two-wheeler and got caught in the rain. After the rain, water was all over the roads and the vehicle movement slowed. It took us more than an hour to reach temple,” said A Subramanyam.
 
 Kanti Rana Tata, deputy commissioner of police for traffic, said his department deployed additional men at problematic locations to regulate traffic and brought the situation under control quickly.
