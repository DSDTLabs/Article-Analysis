MUMBAI: Allowing a man to claim rights as a beneficiary to an estate under a will over three years after a parent's death,   held "there can be no straitjacket formula to determine the period of limitation for filing an administration suit". 

 The judgement passed by a full bench of Justices SC Dharmadhikari, AA Sayed and KR Shriram on May 4, decided on a point of law to hold that when it comes to claiming rights in a ' ' to an estate left behind by a person. The HC said if two provisions of law apply-with differing stipulated deadlines to seek a claim-the court must lean towards the one which allows the claim to stay alive.
 
 The law prescribes various deadlines within which court claims can be filed. In 2012, an issue was referred to a larger bench to decide which deadlines would apply to enable claims in an administration suit over an estate left behind after a person's death.
 
 The man moved court for rights under a 2001 will which he said was suppressed by other family members till 2012. The judgment clarifying the law is significant given a rise in family  , as it would impact many pending and new matters.
 
 The HC said that 'mere nomenclature' as 'administration suit' does not make it one "only for administration because other reliefs may also have been sought...''
 
 HC essentially held that 'nature of claim' in an 'administration suit' will decide how late a person can move court to seek legal remedy. -Swati Deshpande
