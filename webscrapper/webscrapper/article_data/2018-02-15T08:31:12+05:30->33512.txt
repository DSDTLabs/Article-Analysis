HYDERABAD: Over 200 nurses   for the better part of the day on Wednesday to protest against the alleged ill-treatment of a nurse by a doctor at the state-run  . This protest affected patient services. 

 The incident took place late on Tuesday night at the Pulmonology ward, when a   allegedly verbally lashed out at duty nurse Renuka for not attending to her duties properly.
 
 By Wednesday morning, a huge group of nurses launched a massive protest in front of the hospital's administrative building, demanding that the doctor apologise to them. 
 
 The boycott continued for four hours, delaying three scheduled surgeries. Many patients faced hardships due to the absence of nurses. 
 
 "Usually duty nurses administer injections to admitted patients. But today (Wednesday) many people had to wait for three hours for their injections and for having IV drips changed," said an insider.
 
 "Every time there is an issue, doctors tend to blame contract nurses. We work very hard and even take on extra work, changing IVs apart from attending to patients. This kind of behaviour lowers the morale of nurses," said a nurse.
 
 Hospital authorities later intervened and the doctor was summoned by superintendent Dr   to tender an apology. He apologised to the hospital superintendent and other senior authorities, before wrapping up his night shift on Wednesday morning. 
 
 However, agitating nurses wanted him to return and apologise at the protest site to the nurse he had abused, leading to a stalemate. "The issue was resolved amicably between both the parties," said Kumar.
