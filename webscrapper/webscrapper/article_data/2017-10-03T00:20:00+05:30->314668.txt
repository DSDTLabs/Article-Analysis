Panchkula: The trial of a remote-controlled, hydraulic e-vehicle built for Swachh Bharat Abhiyan started here on Monday. The municipal corporation says the Bharat Vidyut cart is designed to carry segregated waste.

 The battery-operated vehicle will collect segregated garbage from every door. Its hydraulic tipper can be operated with a remote control. “The MC plans to deploy this   in villages and colonies, besides on narrow roads and streets. It will help the cause of door-to-door garbage collection immensely,” MC estate officer O P Sihag said.
 
 The Panchkula civic body will try out this vehicle for three months and the manufacturer, Bharat Vidyut, is available for technical assistance.
