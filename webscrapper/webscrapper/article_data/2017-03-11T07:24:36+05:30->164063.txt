AHMEDABAD: The state health department has asked   authorities to give details of its   and fee structure to bring its admissions under the common entrance test. The department is also preparing a dossier on the recent ACB raid and search operation at the Vidyapith. 

 The health department has been tightening the noose around the Vidyapith ever since the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) uncovered an admssions scam worth crores of rupees.
 
 “The report giving details of the ACB raid will be sent to the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the Union Ministry of Health. On the basis of the report, the Centre is likely to take action against the Vidyapith,” said a senior health department officer.
 
 After the UGC issued a notification in September 2016, the government had made it mandatory for all deemed universities to join the common entrance test of the state or the Centre. The government had sought clarification from the UGC and, after receiving the clarification, began the process of bringing admissions at the Vidyapith within the ambit of centralized admissions.
 
 Officials said the state government may even recommend that the special status of ‘central deemed university’ accorded to the Vidyapith be scrapped and its Medical, Dental and Physiotherapy College be brought under the Gujarat University. 
 
 A member of the admission committee said that the state government is now determined to take action against the Vidyapith. “But the government never bothered to do anything when the authorities of the Vidyapith were charging fees even from senior bureaucrats and doctors associated with the state government,” the admission committee member said.
