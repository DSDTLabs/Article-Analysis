Bhubaneswar: Union petroleum minister   on Saturday blamed Odisha government for the alleged custodial death and violence in   on Friday. 

 Dhramendra said this in Delhi while talking to mediapersons on the sidelines of the flagging off ceremony of the Bhubaneswar-New Delhi Rajdhani Express via Sambalpur. 
 
 "The state government is trying to label the custodial death in Ainthapali police station as a suicide. Odisha is heading towards constitutional crisis. Home department, which is under chief minister  , has started favouring a certain political party. Some police officers have started creating chaos in the state," said Dharmendra. 
 
 He further said police action in the cases starting from Kunduli suicide to Ainthapali custodial death exposed the lack of neutrality of police. 
 
 "It is unfortunate that police have started diverting attention from controlling law and order to helping certain political party. High-handedness of police will not suppress the voice of the masses. Odia people will protest this in the coming days," he added. 
 
 BJD spokesperson Samir Das said the state government is taking appropriate measures to maintain law and order in the state. It has become a regular affair for BJP to blame the state government and chief minister in every issue. "Investigation is under way in the alleged custodial death case. The truth will come out soon," he added. 
 
 Das said the BJP should not politicize the issue. Action will be taken against the people, who ransacked the police station and torched the vehicles and office materials, he added.
