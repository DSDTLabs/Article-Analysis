JAIPUR: Sawai Man Singh Medical College has identified rare mutations and genes causal for   pouch colon (CPC), a developmental disorder associated in children. Children born with congenital pouch colon do not have anal opening at birth and they have abdominal distension. According to studies, such cases are reported frequently in the state. 

 Though the cases are frequent, but the etiology of this malformation was not known. But, now JK   pediatric surgeon Dr   has identified rare mutations and genes responsible for the malformation. This project was funded by Centre’s Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi. This was the study ‘Whole exome sequencing reveals rare variants linked to congenital pouch colon’ carried out during 2011-2016, which has also been published in Nature journal, recently which was done in collaboration with Birla Institute of Scientific Research, Jaipur. 
 
 “I have conducted more than 367 such surgeries of infant born with CPC from 1995 to 2016. These infants had anorectal anomalies. CPC is quite common among anorectal anomalies. During the same period, I have seen 2208 infants with anorectal anomalies,” said Dr Mathur. 
 
 Recently, I woman gave birth to twins. One was born with CPC and other was normal. It indicated that there was something related to genes which is causal for the developmental disorder,” said Dr Mathur, adding that studies suggest that Rajasthan is the place in the world where such cases are reported more frequently. 
 
 Dr Mathur said that CPC is a rare form of anorectal malformation in which part or the entire colon is replaced by a dilated pouch blocking the anal opening. Multiple surgeries are done to rectify the congenital disorder including colostomy.
