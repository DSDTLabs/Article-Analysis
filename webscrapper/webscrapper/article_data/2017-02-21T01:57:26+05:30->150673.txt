Lucknow: Personal attacks seem to be prevailing over political blame and election issues in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh. Cornered by Prime Minister Narendra   and BJP chief Amit Shah’s repeated attacks over poor law and order in UP, the ruling Samajwadi Party on Monday hit back at the BJP stalwarts describing them as terrorists of democracy.

 “Both are trying to spread fear and terror in UP with speeches, spewing venom and trying to whip up communal passions,” said SP national spokeperson Rajendra Chaudhary on Monday. Describing the two of making unfounded charges on the SP government, Chaudhary said: “They are both terrorists of democracy,” he said talking to the media. Chaudhary listed Akhilesh Yadav’s development agenda as the single factor to help SP form government after the elections. “BJP-led NDA under Narendra Modi has failed to deliver anything on ground and has resorted to baseless attacks,” he said.
 
 Chaudhary also lambasted the BJP for its remarks on the law and order problem in the state claiming that the situation was worse in most of the BJP ruled states. “But BJP specialises in misleading people, be it issues related to governance or attacks on political rivals. But people of UP understand their ‘jumlebaazi’ (rhetoric) now,” he said.
