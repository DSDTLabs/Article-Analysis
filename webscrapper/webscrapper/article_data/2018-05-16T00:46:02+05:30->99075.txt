Udhagamandalam: Badaga Day was celebrated at YBA hall in Ooty on Tuesday. Badaga  , featuring more than half-a-dozen delicacies, and an exhibition on the history of the community and the Nilgiris marked the occasion.

 May 15 is observed as the Badaga Day by the community, which constitute the largest indigenous group in the Nilgiris, as on this day in 1989 more than a lakh Badagas organised a huge and peaceful rally in Ooty and made a representation to the government, demanding tribal status and guaranteed price for their agricultural products, among other privileges.
 
 And it’s a day to celebrate their unique culture, history and political unity.
 
 Nilgiris Collector J Innocent Divya and the district SP Murali Rambha, attended the function., which attracted several hundred tourists and locals.
 
 Mathaiah Siva, a Badaga NRI who sponsored the community’s indigenous cuisine to the visitors, said, “The day is celebrated to showcase our unique culture and tradition. And the younger generation should know about it and take it forward.”
 
 Dharmalingam Venugopal, director, Nilgiri Documentation Centre, hailed the event. “The consensus is that this kind of events should be repeated in the second tourist season and the winter season also. Badaga events are rich in cultural and social life. And their contribution to the Nilgiris and Tamil Nadu is immense,” he said.
 
 The Nilgiri Documentation Centre had organised an exhibition on the Badagas that featured some old artefacts used by the community.
 
 “It’s a way of showcasing the Badaga culture to the outside world. Even many youngsters of the community don’t know their history. It is a good opportunity and a good beginning. It is a stage to showcase our history, food and music,” said N Sundaradevan, the first Badaga IAS officer, who had retired as additional chief secretary to TN government.
