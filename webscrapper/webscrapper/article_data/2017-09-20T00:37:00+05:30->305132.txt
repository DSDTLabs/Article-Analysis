 Madurai: The Madurai Corporation has constructed a rainwater harvesting structure in the midst of Madakulam tank in Madurai at a cost of Rs9 lakhs. It was inspected by Madurai corporation commissioner Aneesh Sekhar on Tuesday.
 
 Madakulam tank is spread over an area of 225 acres and is one of the largest tanks in Madurai. If maintained well it can store copious amounts of water and help in recharging the ground water level of the region. The Madurai Corporation has constructed a pit in the middle of this tank for over an area of about 1.5 acre. They hope that the pit would help in filling up water faster when it rains heavily. 
 
 However, residents who live in and around the area say that this is a waste of money. Madakulam tank was filled upto the brim a decade ago and they have not lost hope that it would do so again. “It is the supply channels that need to be maintained and renovated. With a structure like this, water would dry up faster in the next sunny season,” said C Ramakrishnan of Madakulam.
 
 Water expert J Kanagavalli is also hopeful that this tank would hold water in the next monsoon as people themselves have cleaned the supply channels to some extent.
 
 Corporation sources say that this is being done to ensure better storage of rainwater, as it would remain in a deeper pit for longer and also help in recharging ground water. But the people disagree and say “With better planning this entire tank could have been desilted, which would help in holding copious amounts of water.”
