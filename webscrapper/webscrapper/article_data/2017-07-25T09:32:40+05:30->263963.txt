AGRA:   on Monday registered an FIR regarding the disappearance of businessman  , who runs a school and other businesses in the district. Sanjeev has been missing since Saturday evening and his car was recovered from Aligarh late on Sunday night. His wife Sarika informed police that a message demanding ransom of Rs 100 crore was sent to various family members late on Sunday. The sender threatened to kill the businessman if they informed the police.

 Later in the evening, Sarika said she suspected one Neeta Pandey, her husband Pradeep and Amit Gupta of abducting her husband. Sanjeev runs a moneylending business, and the Pandey couple had recently filed an FIR against him over a financial transaction.

The abductors had used Sanjeev’s cellphone to send the message around 2am on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday before switching it off in Etah district. “Nobody has witnessed the incident and we have been trying to gather details with the help of CCTV footage. The family is pointing fingers at a couple known to Sanjeev for a long while,” said superintendent of Firozabad police Ajay Kumar.
