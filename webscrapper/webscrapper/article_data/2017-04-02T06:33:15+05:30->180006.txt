BENGALURU: If industries need to survive long, it's their responsibility to take steps not to disrupt ecological balance, said Kamal Bali, MD,  , and chairman of  , on Saturday. 

 Bali was speaking at the inauguration of Sujalaam - Water for Bengaluru, an initiative of NGO Adamya Chetana that will bring all stakeholders - BWSSB, BDA, BBMP, Pollution Control Board, Indian Institute of Science (IISC) and residents across the city together to conserve the city's lakes. "We'll instruct industries, who are not abiding by the regulations, to do their bit to conserve lakes,'' he said.
 
  minister Ananth Kumar said: "Bengaluru may see temperature rise to even 45 degree Celsius. This reflects how our lifestyle over centuries has affected ecology. It is high time we woke up to protect and rejuvenate our lakes," he said.
 
 Taking Arakere lake as a pilot project, Adamya Chetana conducted five meetings in two months to chalk out plans. Tejaswini Ananth Kumar, managing trustee, Adamya Chetana, said, "IISc has volunteered to be the technology partner for the project. In association with IISc, we have set up water testing labs in six schools to sensitize children on the issue. More such labs will be set up in other schools."
 
 Prof T V Ramachandra, dean,  , IISc, said: "Bengaluru needs 20 TMC of water. Rainwater harvesting will help get 15 TMC and recycling of water will fetch 16 TMC. With rainwater harvesting, lake water preservation and by enhancing green cover, the city can have 31 TMC of water." tnn
