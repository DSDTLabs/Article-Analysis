PUNE: Places like  , Kamshet, Vadgaon, Talegaon, Dehu Road, Somatne phata, Pavananagar and Takwe Budruk felt the effects of Wednesday’s bandh, which was called by various Dalit groups and left parties to protest the violence at Koregaon Bhima. In all these areas, shopkeepers had downed their shutters between 9 am and 5 pm and the streets wore a deserted look.

 In Lonavla, Dehu Road and Vadgaon, agitators took out bike rallies. Moreover, thousands of agitators had gathered at the tehsil office at Vadgaon and two buses belonging to the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd (PMPML) were pelted with stones on the   route.
 
 Protestors also burnt tyres on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway near   toll naka and vehicular traffic was affected for around 10 minutes. Tyres were also burnt on the Pune-Mumbai highway at Talegaon. 
 
 However, since there was less than usual traffic on the state’s highways, these incidents did not lead to any major congestion.
 
 Meanwhile, police put up barricades around Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar chowk on the Pune-Mumbai highway in  , where a large mob had gathered from Dalit-dominated areas of Bhatnagar, Bhimnagar, Bauddhanagar etc. The vehicular traffic continued through the grade separator at the chowk, though some protestors managed to pelt stones through the separator.
 
 Despite these minor flare-ups, the police, by and large, were able to maintain law and order.
