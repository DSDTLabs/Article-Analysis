BENGALURU: The   ( ) has described as misleading the usage of the term, “passive euthanasia”, and said it rather be called “withholding or withdrawing futile treatment”.

 The description comes in a document, Definition of terms used in limitation of treatment and providing palliative care at the end of life, released at the  , ICMR, in Bengaluru on Monday, three days after the Supreme Court allowed   in case of a living will.
 
 “The term may contain the meaning of an intention to kill. We support withholding or withdrawing futile treatment, which only prolongs the dying process. We don’t support an intention to kill. Using the more neutral term “withholding or withdrawing treatment” will facilitate public discussion on the topic,” the 54-page document says.
 
  Dr R K Mani, group CEO and chairman of critical care, Nayati Medicity, Mathura, who took the lead in preparing the document by a team of experts, said they are willing to meet legal authorities. “The term is confusing, misleading and ambiguous. We should finalise the contours of the judgment’s implications with the health ministry. The document will be submitted to the ministry and we’ll also appeal to the Supreme Court on implementation of the procedure,” said Dr Mani. 
 
 Though the document was prepared much before the SC judgment, ICMR says it “is in consonance” with the March 9 order. Dr Roli Mathur, head, ICMR Bioethics Unit, who compiled the document, said it’s nothing but a coincidence that it was released soon after the SC verdict. “Work on it began 17 months ago,” Dr Mani added.
