Vadodara: Two staffers of Madhya Gujarat Vij Company Limited were arrested by Bapod police in connection with Rs 88 lakh cheating case registered on May 2.

 Deepak Pagi, who lives in Bhayli, and Priti Shah, a resident of Rajmahal Road, were arrested by cops on Friday for their collusion with Bengaluru-based Messrs Subhash Project and Marketing Limited (MSPML). MSPML was given contract to operate anytime payment (ATP) machines at Indrapuri and Sardar Estate sub-division of the company in the city in 2007.
 
 On May 3, the police had arrested ATP operator Sandeep Bhil, security officer Rajesh Dubey and local branch manager Niraj Trivedi for siphoning amount to the tune of Rs 88 lakh which were collected as bill amounts from MGVCL consumers.
 
 Police said that Pagi and Shah will be interrogated to know about the involvement if anyone else from the PSU was involved besides them. A judicial magistrateâ€™s court sent the duo to police custody till May 8.
 
 The accused had submitted forged bank deposit receipts to MGVCL to avoid being caught and many times had deposited part of total amount from August last year to April 18. It was only when the bank statements and statements submitted by the accused were tallied, the scam came to light.
