Songstress   has proved her mettle once again with the song Kahna So Ja Zara in '  2: The Conclusion'. Composer MM   decided last minute to include a song by her in the album, which she believes has altered the course of her life. Madhushree believes that the track is Lord Krishna’s blessing for her and it’s miraculous that she landed a chance to lend her voice to it.

 “We all pray for miracles but miss them when they happen. We usually associate our achievements with our efforts and forget that we had asked for a miracle to happen. If you believe in the miracle, you will grow. I’m an example of that. Singing for 'Baahubali 2: The Conclusion' is a miracle for the way it happened and the way I experienced it,” says the singer. Madhushree, who has crooned songs like   (Yuva), Tu Bin Bataye (Rang De Basanti), Ham Hain Iss Pal Yahan (Kisna) and In   (Jodhaa Akbar) is currently judging a reality show with  , Shantanu Moitra, Jeet Ganguly and Palak Mucchal. Her upcoming film projects are Kabadi, Love You Family and Amrapali.
