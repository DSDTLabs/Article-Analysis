BHOPAL:   Special Task Force is looking for accomplices of Shailendra Patel, who impersonated the personal assistant of UAD minister and duped the chief municipal officer, Bhainsdehi assuring him a preferred transfer. 

 After Patel named several employees who helped him, STF has put its scanner on these staffers in Mantralaya. Patel, 48, son of Dwarka Patel, resident of Jabalpur was arrested on July 16 on a complaint of Gulab Singh, who is posted as CMO municipal council Bhainsdehi in Betul district. 
 
 Singh complained that someone called him and introduced himself as the PA to UAD minister Maya Singh and pestered him to go for a preferred transfer. When he agreed, he was asked to deposit Rs 74,000 in an account that belonged to the accused Shailendra Patel.
 
 Patel was taken on police remand till July 20 for interrogation. During interrogation he told STF that accused Shailendra managed to get a transfer done for which he received Rs 10,000. A former minister who is now dead was a friend of the Shaildendra’s father, says STF. A minister arranged a job for Patel on ad hoc basis and he started staying at the bungalow of the minister. From then on, he has been involved in getting transfers done, STF told court while objecting to the bail application moved by the accused.
 
 STF has also told court that information regarding the phone numbers on which the accused have talked is being probed. Special public prosecutor for STF advocate   objected to the bail of Patel.
 
 Court of additional district and sessions judge, SC Upadhyay while rejecting the bail petition noted, “Transfer industry, if any, is an illegal enterprise and demanding money for transfer, collecting money for this payment, gives birth to corruption of future. Though the matter is sub-judice but its impact is far reaching”
