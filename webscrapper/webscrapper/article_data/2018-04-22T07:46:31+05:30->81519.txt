PATNA: Former Union finance minister  , who had been regularly attacking the   government over the past couple of years, has quit  , while fellow dissident   dared the party leadership t o take action against him.

 
 Yashwant, who held important portfolios of finance and external affairs in the previous   government, accused BJP of undermining institutions of democracy as he announced his resignation on Saturday, formally severing a relationship which had long soured because of his relentless jibes against the leadership.
 
 "Four years back I had taken sanyas (retirement) from electoral politics. Today, I am taking sanyas from all sorts of party politics. I am also announcing from this platform that today I am snapping all ties with the BJP,” Yashwant said while addressing a meeting of the recently launched “Rashtra Manch” (national forum) at the S K Memorial Hall.
 
 The meeting was also addressed by functionaries of Congress, RJD, Trinamool Congress, Rashtriya Lok Dal, Samajwadi Party and Aam Aadmi Party. Shatrughan Sinha, a member of the Lok Sabha from Patna Sahib, and JD (U) rebel and former Bihar speaker Uday Narayan Choudhary were also present.
 
 Citing reasons behind quitting BJP, Sinha accused the saffron party of “deliberately and systematically working to undermine the institutions of democracy”.
 
 Hours after he announced his resignation, actor-politician Shatrughan dared the ruling party to take action against him if it wants to, while making it clear he won’t resign from its membership on his own.
