Grooming your   is somewhat like a short-term investment plan – you invest a bit and the returns are huge. Ignoring it leads to unruly chaos, and investing in correct products and deploying them well can raise your chic quotient.

 
 Sparse brows post overzealous tweezing creates gaps that need some serious filling. ''Draw out your brows with a matte eyebrow powder as it blends into the backdrop easily. Pick a shade that is close to your natural brow colour,'' says makeup artist Clint Fernandes. For Indian women, a grey-brown powder works well. Or use a matte eye shadow. ''Brush off the excess powder and use a clean mascara wand,'' he adds.
 
 
 
 Multi-tasking products are always an asset. A clear mascara, for instance, defines your eyelashes and also helps set your brows. Slick it on with brow colour underneath. Use just a tiny amount or your brows will look crunchier than French fries. Other brow accessories that can be in your arsenal for bushy growth are brow conditioners – they soften pokey hair. For a strong brow game, brow waxes and eyebrow gels are good buys. 
 
 
 
 If you suffer from hairloss in the brow area because of a medical reason, tattoos work well. According to Fernandes, ''People who have lost hair in the area or have scars can opt for tattoos; it is safe and looks real.'' Holistic beauty expert Suparna Trikha advises not to wet the brows for a week after the tattoo. It’d need a touch-up once in 3 to 4 years.
 
 
 
 
 Holistic beauty expert, Suparna Trikha recommends these tips for the perfect brows:
 
 
 
 
 
 Tweezers, eyebrow powder, eyebrow pencil, clear mascara and a brow comb. Buy eyebrow powders for covering brow gaps. If no gel is available, set your brows using Vaseline or aloe vera gel. 
 
 
 Use a bit of castor oil on eyebrow hair before going to sleep. Castor oil promotes hair growth and can be used on both eyebrows and eyelashes. Avoid using it at daytime because castor oil is thick and it can look messy.
