SHIMLA: While chairing a tribal advisory council meeting in Shimla on Tuesday, chief minister   directed the officials to clear the nautor cases without any delay. He said that since less time is left as the assembly polls are just around the corner, the officers should camp in the field and clear the nautor sanctions within a given timeframe. “Any laxity in this regard would be viewed seriously,” the CM said.

 The CM on Tuesday also laid foundation stone of 10 degree colleges and inaugurated   at Delath in Rampur, a building of Bharat Scouts and Guide in Mandi and a residential accommodation of Directorate of   through video-conferencing from the state secretariat.
 
 “The way foundation stones are being kept before the polls shows that   government is only trying to fool the voters,” said   spokesperson Mahender Dharmani.
 
 “Announcements of new colleges are being made but the reality is that the party is inaugurating these colleges in school rooms,” Dharmani added.
 
 He further said that shortage of teaching staff and missing basic amenities in the the educational institutions of state is the only achievement of the Congress regime.
 
 “In the meet on Tuesday decision was taken to hand over the charge of principal   in Lahaul-Spiti district to SDM Udaipur. This exposes the functioning of the present government as the institution does not even have a regular principal in place,” he pointed out.
