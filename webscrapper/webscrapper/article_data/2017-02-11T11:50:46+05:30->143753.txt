NAGPUR: The four-member ward system has failed to deter rebels of major political parties and independents from contesting the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) elections on February 21. Of the total 1,135 candidates, the BJP and Congress has fielded 150 candidates each while 326 are independents.

 Among the   candidates, many are rebels from BJP, Congress and other political parties who were denied tickets. 
 
 According to data compiled by NMCâ€™s election department, Shiv Sena has fielded 85 candidates, Nationalist Congress Party 95, Bahujan   103, BRSP 36, by MNS 31,   22, Rashtriya Janswarajya Party 21,   and AIMIM 19 each. Bharip Bahujan Mahasangh has fielded 18 contestants.
 
 The maximum number of 10 independents are from ward 5D where as many as 20 candidates are in fray. The ward falls in Satranjipura zone which has 54 independent candidates.
 
 Wards where independents can prove to be a threat include ward 15 which has 11 independent candidates, ward 17 (10), ward 26 (14), ward 20 (20), ward 5 (21), ward 21 (17), ward 4 (16), ward 22 (11), ward 2 and 3 (12 each), ward 6 (10), ward 9 (14), ward 1 (12), ward 11 (10) and ward 29 (15), respectively.
 
 However, there are wards where just one independent candidate is in fray. These include 38-B, 36-C and 36-D, 13-B 15-B etc.
 
 Such large number of independent candidates are giving sleepless nights to official candidates of all major political parties. Political experts pointed out that independents will have to secure a sizeable number of votes from a constituency of more than 45,000 voters who are part of the freshly redrawn wards. 
 
 The new system is likely to increase the volume of the targeted voters by nearly four times, which could pose a challenge to independents considering their limited resources.
