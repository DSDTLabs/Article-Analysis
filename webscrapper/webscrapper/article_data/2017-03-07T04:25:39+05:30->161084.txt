KOLKATA: The forest department on Monday unveiled a scheme that will allow civilians to join forces with officials to participate in   and  . 

 By paying a nominal amount to the forest department, civil society members will be able to undergo training and work in the state’s protected areas under the ‘Banya Prani Sathi Prakalpa’ project. A committee constituted to organize the project held its first meeting on Monday. 
 
  “The move is aimed to make the civil society aware about Bengal’s rich biodiversity and ensure their participation in protecting it. The scheme will be launched on March 16. People can pay a fee to the forest department, undergo training and then take part in wildlife management,” said chief wildlife warden Pradeep Vyas, adding this is perhaps the first such move in the country.
 
 Vyas said they have identified four zones in the state — the Hills, Dooars, Sunderbans and urban wildlife areas — where civilians participating in the project can stay and work with the foresters. 
 
 The chief wildlife warden added that for the first year, an individual will have to pay about Rs 15,000. “They will undergo training for five days and then work with foresters for 10 days in any of the protected areas identified for the purpose. For the next two years, they will have to shell out roughly Rs 10,000 each year to take part in wildlife management activities,” he said, adding that it will be a no-profit-no-loss project.
 
 A forester said any civilian — doctor, engineer or businessman — can take part in it. “But they have to be adults, residents of Bengal and medically fit. The forms will be available on the forest department’s website and there are no charges for applying. Only one person will be selected for each protected area,” said an official. 
 
 Hailing the move, conservationist Joydip Kundu, who is a member of the state wildlife advisory board, said: “This will be a hardcore on-field conservation experience for civilians.”
