THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The   had paid Rs 35.1 lakh to senior lawyer   for representing vigilance in the high court for an appeal against further inquiry in the   ordered by Thiruvananthapuram vigilance court. 

 An RTI reply also revealed that Sibal's junior lawyer   was paid Rs 2 lakh for representing K M Mani, the accused in the case.
 
 The disclosure came after state's chief information commissioner Vinson M Paul ordered to give a reply to the RTI application filed by Jomon Puthenpurackal, a human rights activist, which was rejected earlier. Jomon had approached the information commissioner after the vigilance director's office rejected his application (dated November 14, 2015), saying the case was in the high court and in the vigilance's top secret section. 
 
 The information officer in the vigilance director's office asked the applicant to approach advocate general's office to get the details of the expenditure. The chief information commissioner, in his order, noted that the reply did not have any legal standing. "The responsibility to forward a copy of the application to the SPIO (state public information officer) at the advocate general's office lies with the SPIO at the vigilance director's office," the order said.
 
 The order also said that action would be initiated against the concerned SPIO in the vigilance director's office for the lapse.
