PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: District guardian minister Girish Bapat administered a pledge of good governance and transparency to all BJP candidates by invoking the blessings of Sant Tukaram Maharaj and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj at Bhakti Shakti garden in Nigdi on Wednesday.

 Speaking on the occasion, Bapat said the NCP, which was at the helm in Pimpri Chinchwad for several years, had misused its power and was not able to transform the city. “Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis will launch the Pimpri Chinchwad election campaign on Thursday in Chinchwad,” he added.
 
 “The NCP leaders built their own houses leaving the slum-dwellers homeless. They were not even able to get tenements in the slum rehabilitation scheme,’’ Bapat said. Moreover, the problems of water supply, transport and housing for the poor have not been solved.
 
  “Several development projects, including metro rail, Pune metropolitan regional development authority, development plan, river development and ring road, are in progress in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad,” he said. 
 
  Earlier, the candidates took a pledge saying that there would be transparent and development-oriented functioning of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation. Pimpri Chinchwad will be made an ideal and smart city, the pledge said.
