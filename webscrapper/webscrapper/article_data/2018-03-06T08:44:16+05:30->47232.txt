NAGPUR: The   ( ) on February 23 promoted nine promotee range forest officers (RFOs) as assistant managers (AMs) causing flutter among newly recruited RFOs.

 Earlier, the board in its 183rd meeting held on October 25, 2017, had decided to conduct a competitive exam for all RFOs. But as 5 years of service is considered mandatory for promotion, the promotee RFOs were front-runners for  .
 
 “However, if the 5 year criteria is considered than the promotee RFOs are also not eligible for promotion,” said newly recruited RFOs. They have cried foul over managing director’s decision.
 
 FDCM had recruited 40 RFOs in 2013, who were sent for training in March and April 2014. They completed their probation in March and April 2017.
 
 “Maharashtra Forest Service (Recruitment) Rules, 2014, say that after completing training and probation period successfully, the training period shall be treated as service period,” said aggrieved RFOs.
 
 A MAT judgement on February 3, 2016, in a matter filed by ACFs ruled that they were entitled for appointment as regular ACFs from the date of commencement of their training.
 
 They drew attention towards another MAT ruling on September 16, 2016 (case of RFOs) ruling that applicants are entitled for all emoluments including seniority from the date of their appointment.
 
 “These judgements are still applicable as these have not been challenged by the state government,” said a section of RFOs. 
 
 FDCM published the seniority list of RFOs on January 1, 2018, in which promotee RFOs were at the top. Objections on this list were to be submitted by February 23. But even before the deadline, departmental promotion committee ( ) was held on February 21, two days prior to the last date of submission of the objections.
 
 “Inviting objections was a mere formality and giving promotion to promoted batch was pre-decided. We will challenge the decision,” said direct recruits.
