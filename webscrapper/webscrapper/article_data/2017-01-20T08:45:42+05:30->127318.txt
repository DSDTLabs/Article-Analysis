SURAT: The foot-over-bridge project of   (SMC) at   that was to connect   with   ground is in a limbo for over two years now due to reasons best known to the civic authorities. The project started around December 2014 and work continued for six months during which time stairs and supporting structures on both the ends of the road at Mahavir Hospital and Vanita Vishram ground were built. The contractor had spent more than Rs 1 crore on the construction when the project was stalled midway when its completion is the need of the hour as pedestrians find it difficult to cross the road. 

 Sources said there is political pressure on the civic authorities for stalling the FOB project. Recently, some people had met SMC authorities to demand that the foot-over-bridge be shifted to some other place from in front of the hospital. 
 
 “There is political pressure to stop the FOB project because its front portion obstructs the main gate of the hospital. The spot for FOB was surveyed and the decision taken on the advice of experts and demand of general public. The FOB is at an ideal spot to serve pedestrians of Athwalines. Vanita Vishram ground is occupied for events and fairs for 10 months in a year and draws huge crowds,” a SMC officer said. 
 
 RTI activist   has written to SMC authorities requesting them to restart construction of the FOB. “It is very important spot. If you want to cross the road from Mahavir Hospital to the other side, you have to walk 2km. The traffic is so heavy throughout the day that lot of pedestrians face difficulties. The civic body should take a decision in favour of thousands of pedestrians rather than buckling under political pressure,” he said. 
 
 The hospital management was not available for comment.
