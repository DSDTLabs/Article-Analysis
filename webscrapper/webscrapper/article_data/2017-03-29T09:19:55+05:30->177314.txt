PATNA: Bihar CM   Kumar’s JD (U) has officially started projecting him as the PM candidate for 2019 general election and wants all secular forces to unite and contest the 2019 parliamentary election under his leadership.
 
  Although top JD (U) functionaries are holding cards close to their chest, party spokesperson Bharti Mehta on Tuesday told TOI that the JD (U) president was unanimously accepted across the country as a progressive and visionary statesman. “As the Bihar CM, he has empowered women through his initiatives like reservation in civic bodies, bicycle scheme for schoolgirls and prohibition. His ‘Saat Nischay’, or seven resolves, are a masterstroke for development as they include free electricity and water connections to every household and 35% reservation for women in government jobs in the state,” she said.
  
  All secular and socialist forces should, therefore, unite and project NItish as PM in the 2019 general election, said Bharti.
  
  Another party functionary pointed out that RJD president   also supported the formation of a strong secular front while discussing with his partymen the rout of Congress-SP alliance and BSP in UP assembly election recently.
  
  “The parliamentary election is just two years away. If secular forces don’t join hands now, it will be too late,” he said and added Nitish had good rapport with all secular and Left parties and, as such, no one should have problems with going to the polls under his leadership.
  
  Nitish in the last couple of months has discussed the possibility of the JD (U) and Left parties coming together to take on the BJP and PM Narendra Modi in the 2019   election. Two rounds of talks have already been held in Delhi and Patna.
