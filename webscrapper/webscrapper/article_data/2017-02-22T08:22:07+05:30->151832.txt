MUMBAI: Four members of a gang that robbed a   woman at her home in Virar in 2015 have been arrested, Palghar police said on Tuesday. Police are still searching for the prime suspect, who entered her home posing as a ‘courier boy’. 

 Police said Farhan Ansari (28),   (30),   (45) and Sarfaraz Khan (25), all Kandivli residents, were arrested by the crime branch over a period of time. They have been booked for dacoity.
 
 The crime took place on January 23, 2015 when Nisha Lonkar, who was six months pregnant then, was alone in her first floor flat in Shree Vinayak Apartment, Virar (west). Around 12.30 pm, a man claiming to be a ‘courier boy’ came with a parcel for her husband, Chetan. He asked for a pen and as Lonkar turned her back, he entered the flat, gagged her mouth, and aimed a revolver at her. He told her that he intended to rob her and did not want to harm her. And within minutes, two more men barged into the room. As Lonkar raised an alarm, the men fled away with her purse. The CCTV footage showed the suspects sneaking into the building and leaving in a hurry. 
 
 Police said that it was the first time that group had committed a crime and had done it to make quick money.
