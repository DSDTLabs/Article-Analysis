MUMBAI: The   has taken a "serious view" of  's decision to go it solo for the 2019 Lok Sabha and the state legislative assembly elections, said a source in the Maharashtra BJP. 

 BJP chief Amit Shah is furious over Sena president  's attack on Prime Minister  , the source said on Wednesday. However,   bigwigs have asked Maharashtra functionaries not to "lose their cool" in the face of Sena's threat. 
 
 BJP office-bearers in Delhi are of the view that the Sena should quit the Devendra Fadnavis government in Maharashtra if the party thinks that it is getting a raw deal. 
 
 However, Matoshree is not keen on quitting the Fadnavis regime. "Asking our ministers to quit may trigger crisis in the party," said a Sena legislator.
 
  
 Addressing a Sena conclave in Mumbai on Tuesday, Uddhav urged Indians to pull down the Modi government in the next polls. The newly constituted national executive of the Sena adopted a resolution on snapping poll ties with the BJP. Many Sena MPs and MLAs think that Uddhav's announcement to snap poll ties with the BJP was premature. "Uddhav- ji ought to have waited for six months before coming to a final decision. By displaying his cards at this point of time he has given ample time to the BJP to plan its poll strategies," said a Sena MLA. 
 
 "There is no question of pacifying the Sena. Uddhav Thackeray is not Bal Thackeray," said the BJP functionary. 
 
 However, a section in the state BJP is of the view that CM Devendra Fadnavis should confront the Sena on Uddhav's outbursts. Significantly, Uddhav did not utter a word against Fadnavis in his speech, even as he targeted BJP veteran Nitin Gadkari and state minister Chandrakant Patil, who is said to be close to Amit Shah. "Uddhav left out the CM, while pouring ridicule on Modi, thus suggesting his party has a soft spot for Devendra, and contempt for Modi," said a BJP MLA.
