HYDERABAD: Cracking the whip on a private healthcare centre for resorting to ‘unethical practices’ to treat baldness, a district   here directed it to refund Rs 50,000 to a customer, paid as fee for treatment that yielded no result. It also directed the centre to cough up an additional Rs 25,000 as   and making false promises.

 In the judgment issued on February 16, the forum cited specific guidelines of the   on stem cell therapy. The forum upheld how use of the procedure for any purpose outside the domain of clinical trials was considered unethical.
 
 Chandra Shekar T was approached by an employee of Vibes Health Care Limited two years ago when he visited its Banjara Hills branch along with his sister. The employee requested him to undergo a hair loss treatment and convinced him that ‘hair stem cell therapy’ was hassle-free without side effects. He was assured of 100% hair growth post-treatment that was extended for a 50% discount. Chandra Sekhar was asked to pay Rs 50,000 for the procedure comprising 10 sittings.
 
 In his deposition, the complainant said he signed up for the programme, but noticed no improvement even after seven sittings. “The complainant got devastated when he found no improvement,” the judgement notes, adding how he also suffered side effects like nausea and dizziness, which consequently led to more hair fall. “Realising he was cheated, he deterred himself from the treatment and requested the centre to refund money. As he did not get a reply from the centre after multiple attempts, he filed this complaint,” the order reads.
 
 In its defence, the centre and its employees argued they did not assure the complainant of complete hair growth. 
 
 Not amused with their argument, the bench maintained the centre and its employees indulged in “unfair trade practice” and directed them to refund the fee and pay compensation. They have been given a time period of 30 days to comply with the order.
