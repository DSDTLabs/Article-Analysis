GUWAHATI: A day after film director   sought Ulfa-I leader  's intervention after his flick 'Shakira Ahibo Bokultolor Bihu Loi' was pulled out of theatres, protesters on Wednesday voiced their anger in front of cinemas in various parts of the state. 

 A group of people sat in front of the entrance of cinemas with placards in their hands demanding screening of Das's film at Rangiya, Bongaigaon, Biswanath Chariali and Guwahati.
 
 In Rangiya's Chitralekha theatre, people were offended at the withdrawal of the film to make way for Shah Rukh Khan's ' ' and Hrithik Roshan's 'Kaabil'.
 
 However, Das and his  , which was also associated with the production of the film, denied that any of his people were involved in the protests. He said Wednesday's protest was an expression of angst against the step-motherly treatment towards Assamese films by cinemas and film distributors.
 
 "At present, there is one cinema that is showing the film. Across Assam, there are 11 halls that are screening the film. Our single plea is that the movie shold be shown alongside the new Hindi releases. My film was doing very well since its release last Friday," said Das.
 
 Prominent organisations like Aasu expressed concern over the lackadaisical attitude of theatre owners and distributors towards Assamese cinema. "It is unfortunate that local films are facing such a situation. Assamese cinema is the pride for our culture and heritage. The manner in which our films are being neglected is simply intolerable and cannot be accepted," said  , chief adviser of Aasu.
