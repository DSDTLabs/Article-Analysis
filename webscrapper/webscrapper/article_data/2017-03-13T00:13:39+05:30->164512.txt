Madurai: Tutucorin superintendent of police Ashwin M Kotnis won the silver medal in the All India Police Shooting Championship held in Guwahati on Sunday. The 2003 batch   officer, known for his innovative approach in crime prevention, won the laurel in his first ever national participation. There were instances of IPS officers from Tamil Nadu cadre winning medals in the national level like Walter Devaram and K Vijaykumar, but Ashwin Kotnis was the first IPS officer in the country to have won a medal in the rifle category. 

 An IPS officer’s’ work is hectic, considering his bandobust and security duties apart from crime prevention and maintenance of law and order. However, Ashwin managed to steal some time to get his hands on the weapon. “When I recently took up rifle shooting after a gap of several years, people appreciated my precision. However, I could not devote much time to practise due to my hectic work schedule,” he said.
 
 While most IPS officers choose to take part in pistol category, he was somehow attracted to the rifle. He is good at pistol too. He won a gold medal in the state level pistol competition held recently. Surprisingly, he was the only IPS officer to have taken part in the rifle category in which more than 60 people had participated. 
 
 He won the silver medal, beating participants from various central forces including border security force and central reserve police force. Ashwin lost the gold medal just by one point, scoring 91 out of 100. 
 
 “I took part in the 300 meter category. Shooting with a rifle requires breath control, concentration and precision. In three minutes 10 bullets need to be fired. Even a minute of diversion will throw one out of the competition. The yoga I practised in the mornings helped me keep my body still,” he said.
