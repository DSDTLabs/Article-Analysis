BHUBANESWAR: Chief minister   on Thursday asked commissioner of police Y B Khurania to inquire into a Facebook post of a local journalist, who alleged she was molested in a running bus on Wednesday and her frantic phone calls to police and women helpline cell went unheeded. 

 In her Facebook post, the girl narrated she encountered the horror near Cuttack while travelling from Pattamundai to Bhubaneswar. "I have directed the commissioner of police to inquire and take immediate action. The CP should also fix the responsibility for the lapses," Naveen posted in his twitter handle.
 
 The incident came close on heels of the molestation of a city-based   student in Rajdhani Express. While railway ministry promptly came to the rescue of the DU student following tweets by her friends to minister Suresh Prabhu, the journalists phone calls to police (100) and women helpline cell (1091) went unanswered. "A rape could have been attempted. The so-called helpline numbers perhaps were launched to help eve-teasers to enjoy their misdeed," the journalist wrote on her Facebook account. "I repeatedly dialled 100 and 1091. But my calls went unanswered," she told TOI.
 
 The girl said she was so disgusted that she decided not to approach the police station. "I categorically blame the government and the system. What is the purpose of floating women-friendly measures when we don't get any response during crisis," she asked. 
 
 The journalist said she was perhaps the lone female travelling in the bus from Pattamundai to Bhubaneswar around 7.30 am. "Around 60 passengers were travelling in the bus as against the capacity of 30. I had to stand since there was no seat available. The conductor assured me to arrange a seat. A man boarded the bus at   and started groping me. I protested his misconduct. But he did not stop. He kept misbehaving with me for nearly an hour till the bus reached Cuttack," she said.
