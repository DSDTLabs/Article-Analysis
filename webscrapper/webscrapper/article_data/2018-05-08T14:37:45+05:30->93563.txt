HYDERABAD: Students of the Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) intensified their protest against fee hike on Monday by launching a hunger strike on the campus. Students in Hyderabad and Goa continued their protest in respective campuses.

 Braving the scorching heat, several students moved out of their rooms with their mattresses and sat outside in the open on campus to register their protest against the administration’s move to enhance fee by 15 per cent every year.
 
 
 “Sad to see that a premier institute like BITS   would soon be out of reach of a middle class student because he can’t afford to shell out Rs 4.5 lakh per annum and rising!,” tweeted Atishy Rathi, a student.
 
 
 To maintain law and order, cops visited the Pilani campus. In Hyderabad, students raised slogans against the administration as they marched from the academic block to the director’s residence.
 
 
 “Students staging protest against perennial fee hike outside the guest house as the vice-chancellor denies to meet the student community of BITS Pilani. Amidst our ongoing end semester exams, students have united across campuses to express their frustration,” tweeted Manal Garg, an undergraduate student.
 
 
 To register their protest, students also decided to wear black clothes during the comprehensive exams.
 
 
 An open letter was also issued by students addressing Kumar Mangalam Birla, chancellor of BITS, highlighting the grievances of students. “We are not demanding a break-up of the fees expenses or justification. We are here to say that we cannot pay the fees, that we are being asked to pay. We are ready to choose affordability over quality because if we cannot sustain ourselves, there is no point of a degree with BITS Pilani’s registrar’s stamp on it,” reads the letter.
