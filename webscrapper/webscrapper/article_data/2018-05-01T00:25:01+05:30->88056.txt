Bhopal: With Prime Minister Narendra Modi all set to launch election campaign in Karnataka from May 1, the BJP has roped in Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Union social justice minister Thawar Chand Gehlot apart from a couple of more minsiters from the state to intensify campaign against the Siddaramaiah government and Congress’ anti-Modi drive in assembly polls. 

 Chouhan, who recently visited Molakalmuru town of Chitradurga district in Karnataka, attended nomination of BJP candidate B S Sreeramulu and addressed a few public meetings on April 20 and 21. He is also likely to visit the state in coming week as polling for the assembly will be held on May 12 while the counting of votes would be held on May 15.
 
 The BJP has planned 65 rallies in Karnataka in coming eight days. Party leaders said apart from Chouhan and Gahlot, union minsters Narendra Singh Tomar also addressed a few meetings. Uma Bharti is also likely to campaign in the polls.
 
 “In Karnataka, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar had addressed election meetings during last fortnight. The two along with other ministers are also likely to campaign in Karnataka polls during coming week,” said BJP state general secretary and Rajya Sabha member Ajay Pratap Singh.
 
 In Karnataka, the BJP has also roped in Union minister and senior dalit leader Thawar Chand Gahlot in the election campaign. Gahlot is a Dalit face for the saffron party while chief minister Chouhan emerged as pro-Hindu face in the campaign against Siddaramaiah, who is trying to rid himself of the anti-Hindu image, sources said.
 
 Union minister and Rajya Sabha member from MP Prakash Javdekar is also touring Karnataka to address public meetings against Congress anti-Modi campaign.
 
 ​BJP leaders said Umar Bharti is likely to campaign in Karnataka. Senior leaders from MP are unlikely to join the campaign in view of BJP president Amit Shah’s visit to the state.
