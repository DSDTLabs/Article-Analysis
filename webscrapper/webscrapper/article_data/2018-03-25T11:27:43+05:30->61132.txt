VADODARA: The rapid response (RR) cell of the Vadodara range police seized Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) worth over Rs 33 lakh from near Alamgir on National Highway-8 and arrested three persons late on Friday night.

 Police had blocked the highway on the basis of a tip-off that truck carrying liquor was on its way to Ahmedabad. 
 
 Cops said that since they had information about the truck’s number too, they stopped the specific truck and checked it. The police found 60 bags of rice grass which is used as cattle feed in the truck.
 
 But on removing the bags, the police found boxes of liquor covered under tarpaulin sheets. The boxes contained 10,068 bottles of whisky and gin. A police official said that the driver of the truck   admitted that it was illicit liquor stock which he was taking to Ahmedabad. 
 
 Along with Verma, police also arrested Takvinder Chumber and Parvinder Singh, who were also travelling with him in the truck.
 
 “The stock was being brought from Panipat in Haryana. Verma was asked to call on a mobile number on reaching 20 kilometre away from Ahmedabad. But the number was found to be of the supplier therefore we believe that the supplier would have contacted the person who was supposed to take the delivery,” said  , police sub-inspector, RR Cell.
 
 The trio was booked at Varnama police station and was remanded to police custody for five days by a local court on Saturday for further interrogation about the supplier.
