 Soujana who flew down from USA to visit her ailing father said that hospital management cheated them. "They have a death certificate which says that he died at around 12.30 am on Thursday, but they verbally told us that he died at about 4.30 am in the morning" Soujanya said.
 
 Reportedly, Nagabhuhanam was admitted with chest problems on March 6 and was shifted to Acute Medical Unit (AMU). The hospital informed his family he was getting better. Then on March 14th they were informed that his condition was deteriorating and finally they informed that he was dead on Friday early morning. They were charged about 5 lakh. 
 
 However, the hospital denied the charges. "He was diagnosed with severe lung infection and required ventilator support and IV antibiotic. He was undergoing treatment till March 17th morning. The family was aware of the patient's ailing prognosis and were being counselled by medical team. The hospital billing was generated for the time he was alive," Dr  , medical superintendent of the hospital said.
