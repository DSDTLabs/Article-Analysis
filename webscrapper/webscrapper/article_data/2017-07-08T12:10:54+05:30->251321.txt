BHUBANESWAR: The NDA's presidential nominee   was scheduled to visit the city on July 14 to drum up support for himself ahead of the July 17 election, BJP spokesperson Sajjan Sharma said on Friday. During his daylong visit, Kovind will address MPs and MLAs of both BJP and BJD, albeit separately. 

 Sources said Kovind would meet chief minister and BJD president Naveen Patnaik and his MPs and MLAs. The venue for the meeting is likely to be the BJD's office here. Kovind will meet BJP legislators at the saffron party's office.
 
 The BJD has already announced support for Kovind. "As announced by party chief Naveen Patnaik, all BJD lawmakers will vote for him. The party has taken a stand. All of us will abide by it," BJD spokesperson Amar Prasad Satpathy said.
 
 Congress whip Tara Prasad Bahinipati had earlier this week said there could be cross-voting by BJD members. Dismissing this, Amar said Congress members were more likely to cross-vote because of continued infighting.
