GAYA: Coming down heavily on self-styled god-men for their alleged immoral acts, Buddhist spiritual leader Dalai Lama on Saturday said the questionable conduct of such people put their followers to shame. 

 On the second day of his three-day special sermon at the Kalchakra Maidan, the Dalai Lama told his followers a true spiritual leader could motivate his/her disciples to perform good deeds for the betterment of everyone. He also advised them to choose their ‘guru’ wisely.
 
 “Following the ideals of Buddha helps one control one’s emotions. There is peace of mind and no repentance,” the Dalai Lama said and added mental discipline and compassion were mandatory for a healthy spiritual growth.
 
 Dalai Lama’s discourse is being transmitted live in 12 different languages, including Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, English and French. He delivers the sermons in his native Tibetan language. 
 
 On Sunday, governor Satya Pal Malik and chief minister   will visit Bodh   to meet the Dalai Lama. They will be present at the Kalchakra Maidan during the final session of the spiritual leader’s sermons. A book on him is also scheduled to be released.
