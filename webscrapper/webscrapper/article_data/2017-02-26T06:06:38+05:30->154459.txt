BENGALURU: There are thousands of buildings in the city that are technically highrise, but follow no safety regulations meant for such buildings, said DGP Karnataka Fire & Emergency Services   on Saturday .
“They violate safety norms and put many buildings at risk of fire. They never come to us for assistance unless and until there are major outbreak. Biannual fire inspection of buildings can help avoid a considerable number of mishaps. We also organize awareness programmes like classroom lectures and drills. We're spreading the message through social media,“ he said at the Beyond   event.
 
 The event is organized every year in memory of 9 persons who died at   7 years ago.
 
 He said 1,400 men were recruited recently . “We are looking at setting up a fire management centre for the controlling and commanding force. All high-rise buildings will be connected to this centre to ensure emergencies are reported immediately ,'' he added.
