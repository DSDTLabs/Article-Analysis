 Explaining the house about the crisis in PU during the senate meeting, Panjab University vice-chancellor professor Arun Kumar Grover started the discussion on the budget by saying that the financial condition continues to be in a flux and PU also had to convene a special senate meeting to discuss the financial crisis. “We desperately need the first instalment of grants of the 2017-18 financial year to start the next session,” said Grover.
 
 Senator Gurmeet Singh raised objection on the enhancement of the rate of checking OMR sheets from Rs 2 to Rs 2.5 per answer book, which is effective from December 2016 and a part of the budget estimates. 
 
 Senator I S Chadha said while the budget estimates tells about the estimated income of Rs 271 crore and estimated expenditure of Rs 515.6 crore, it leaves blank the column list of maintenance grants, which tells where the balance is going to come from. On this, Grover replied that the column left blank is the desired income from the centre and PU does not know before April 17 what amount will be given to it by the centre. 
 
 Some senators suggested that PU should go for central university status to overcome the crisis. Former MP and additional solicitor general of India Satya Pal Jain said all senators should leave their personal interest and form one committee, irrespective of their political affiliations to meet the MHRD and the Punjab chief minister. He also apprised the house that the Punjab government has filed an affidavit in the high court saying they cannot even pay Rs 20 crore to the PU. 
 
 Chandigarh BJP chief Sanjay Tandon said a committee should be formed to work out the pros and cons of PU becoming a central university and should be discussed in the next senate meeting. Also, a team should be made to know how PU can enhance the income without putting burden on students.
 
 Grover resolved that a core committee will now be formed with the added members who will further talk to the MHRD and the new chief minister about the financial crisis.
