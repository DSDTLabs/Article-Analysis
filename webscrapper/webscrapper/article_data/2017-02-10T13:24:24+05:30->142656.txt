PANAJI: South   have assured that the work of illegal reclamation of   land in a no-development zone (NDZ) along River Zuari at the site of the mini-India park would be stopped shortly.

 Villagers alleged that the illegal mud-filling is being carried out in defiance of government orders. After residents complained about the reclamation during the election period,   (GCZMA) had issued a stop work order during the last week of January 2017.
 
 “But the work continued during the peak of elections and hundreds of trucks had dumped mud at the site,” Lopinho Xavier, a villager said. While villagers complained a few days back, they alleged that the authorities have been slow in initiating action against the project promoter. On Wednesday late evening, RDA minister and local MLA, Alina Saldanha visited the site with police and South Goa collectorate officials and informed about an order issued by GCZMA yet again to stop the work. 
 
 “But the deputy collector has been trying to delay enforcing the order on the ground that he is far away somewhere and that he has not received a copy of the order,” Xavier alleged.
 
 Sources said that the collector’s office has assured the minister that a written order would be issued to the party to stop the work immediately. “But, till Thursday evening, no written order had been issued,” Saldanha told TOI. 
 
 The project which has been issued only provisional approval by   (IPB) has been challenged, among other projects, before high court of Bombay at Goa by Goa Foundation on the issue of violation of Coastal Zone Regulation (CRZ) notification, 1991. Though a notice has been issued to the party, the work has been continuing illegally. Villagers expressed dissatisfaction with the authorities’ inaction in stopping it.
