TIRUVANNAMALAI: A 54-year-old farmer of Chellankuppam village in Tiruvannamalai district died reportedly of cardiac arrest after his crop failed. 

 The deceased was identified as G Mannu. Police said he was a diabetic patient and was under medication. He was discharged from the   in Chennai two weeks ago. The death might be due to his health condition, police said.
 
 Denying the police's version, the relatives and farmers in the village said that Mannu was dejected over crop failure.
 
 He had raised groundnut in 2.5 acres of land, sugarcane in 2 acres and also cultivated pulses in 1.5 acres that he had taken on lease. The crops withered due to failure of monsoon.
 
 He went to his land after sending his wife Kuppu and daughters Anjulakcham and Parameswari to   in bus. His son Periyasamy went to nearby village for sugar cutting work. "Mannu was distressed after the crop failed and spoke about it to his wife frequently. Though family members consoled him, Mannu remained upset," said M Ganesan, a farmer and friend of Mannu.
 
 Mannu's nephew  , also a farmer, received a phone call at about 6.30 am. "The person telephoned me at about 6.30am and said my uncle complained of chest pain and fainted," Jaisankar said. With a help of a farm worker, he took his uncle in his two-wheeler to a private hospital about 12kms from the village.
 
 However, the doctors in the hospital declared him dead on arrival. "We were shocked. My uncle knew nothing except farming," said Jaisankar.
 
 Ganesan said that over 90% of the crops raised in the village and neihgbouring villages have failed. "We have petitioned the district administration on several occasions, pleading to represent our problems to the government and declare the district drought-hit. But our pleas fell on deaf ears," said Ganesan. Crops in seven acres out of 10 acres of Ganesan's land have also failed and he incurred a loss of around 1.75 lakh. Every farmer has incurred heavy loss this season, Ganesan added.
