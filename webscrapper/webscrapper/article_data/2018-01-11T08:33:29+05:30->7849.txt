PORVORIM: The BJP-led government in Goa will not stop the screening of ‘Padmavat’ if it fulfils all legal provisions, chief minister Manohar   said here on Wednesday.

 “In principle, I have no objection in releasing the  , if there is a censor certificate. I don’t think we should interfere in it,” Parrikar, who is also the home minister, said.
 
  has been cleared by the censor board and is expected to be released on January 25.
 
 Goa police have recommended to the state government to “avoid” screening of ‘Padmavat’ during peak tourist season as its manpower is engaged in security arrangements.
 
 Parrikar said December was “total chaotic” in Goa with high footfall of tourists. “I could not spare police personnel then for other duties,” he said.
 
 “The day movie gets a censor clearance, I would again take feedback from intelligence and then decide. I don’t think it is a big issue. I will definitely check if something is going to be wrong. I will go by the legal provisions,” Parrikar said.
 
 Goa police recommendations came after   and three other organisations petitioned the government that the release of the controversial film “is likely to hurt the sentiments of a large section of society”.
 
 Police in its recommendation, wrote: “As per intelligence inputs, no major law and order situation is expected to arise in the state of Goa. However, the ongoing season being of great tourist rush and the police forces being engaged in arrangements… we should avoid giving opportunity to people to agitate at this stage.”
