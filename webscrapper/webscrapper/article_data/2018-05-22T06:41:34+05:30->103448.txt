MUMBAI: As elections near, the state government plans to hike the subsidy given to Scheduled Caste landless farm labourers who fall below the poverty line. The subsidy increase will be from 50% to 95% to purchase irrigated or non-irrigated land. The   is likely to be tabled before the   on Tuesday. 

 The Lok Sabha and assembly elections are scheduled in 2019. “The move is surely to woo   votes as there is unrest and anger among Dalits for various reasons, including the Koregaon Bhima violence, change in the name of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar as Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, no action against cow vigilantes and fresh attacks on Ddalits and Muslims, and the Supreme Court ruling on Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act,” said a political expert.
 
 The existing scheme—Karmaveer Dadasaheb Gaikwad Sabalikaran and Swabhiman Yojana—for landless farm workers under BPL was launched in 2004. Under this scheme, a scheduled caste farm labourer can buy maximum 2 acres of irrigated land with 50% subsidy up to Rs 3 lakh/acre, and maximum 4 acres of non-irrigated land with 50% subsidy up to Rs 2 lakh/acre. With land price increasing, the scheme was affected. Hence, the state social justice department has now proposed to hike the subsidy to 95% and the amount will be payable up to Rs 8 lakh/acre for 2 acres of irrigated land and Rs 5 lakh/acre for 4 acres of non-irrigated land. The department has made a provision of Rs 50 crore for the scheme for 2017-18.
