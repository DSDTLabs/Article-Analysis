 / GAJENDRAGHAD/ SHIGGAON: AICC president   Gandhi on Friday trained his guns on PM Narendra Modi’s popular slogan on the girl child, Beti Bachao Beti Padao. “The slogan should read as Beti Bachao   ke MLAs se (Protect girl child from BJP MLAs),” said Rahul referring to the involvement of a BJP MLA in the Unnao rape case in Uttar Pradesh.

 
 Addressing a rally at Kalagi village in Kalaburagi district, the   leader asked, “Why is   silent on the involvement of his party MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar in the rape and assault of a minor?”
 
 Hitting out at Modi for his personal attacks on him, Rahul said, “I will refrain from personal attacks against the PM as I have high regard for the PM’s post. As PM Modi finds no issues be it corruption, farmer or unemployment, he resorts to personal attacks against me, Mallikarjun Kharge and Siddaramaiah. You will not hear a single personal attack against the PM from Rahul Gandhi’s mouth,” he said.
 
 In Gajendraghad, Rahul said that this time the election is between two ideologies-one of Basavanna and Karnataka and another one of RSS and BJP.
 
 Congress to back independent in Mulbagal
 
 The Congress has decided to support Independent H Rajesh in Mulbagal, said KPCC president G Parameshwara. The party has no candidate in the constituency after its nominee Kottanuru Manjunath’s nomination papers were rejected following the high court order that held his caste certificate as fake.
