 "I will prepare for World Championships in London and I hope to do well there. My target is to win a medal in the Commonwealth and Asian Games next year and then to do even better in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics," said the 30-year-old army man who currently trains at the SAI Center in Bangalore.

 Services swept all the three medals with Devender (1:22:43.59) and K Ganapati (1:22:57.86) bagging the silver and bronze respectively.
 
 "This is my first national level gold medal after 2014 and I am very happy to have won the race. I have not won an international medal till now and I hope I can do it at the Asian Championships in Japan next month," said Irfan, who had finished fifth at the 2014 Asian Games.
 
 "I am hoping that I can time below one hour 20 minutes and that can fetch me a medal even in the World Championships. In 20km race walk, the competition is very tough at the Asian level. Most of the top competitors in the world are from Asia."
 
 Irfan received a winner's prize money of Rs 50,000 while Devender and Ganapati received Rs 30,000 and Rs 15,000 respectively.
