MADURAI: A petition has been filed in the Madurai bench of the Madras high court seeking to set aside the   (TRB) proceedings on February 9 at which it cancelled the written examination held for recruiting teachers to various disciplines in government polytechnic colleges in the state. 

 According to the petitioner, M Ilamathi of   district, the TRB conducted the examination on September 16 last year to fill up the post of lecturer in various disciplines in government polytechnic colleges. It released the results after publishing the final key of answers on November 7 and conducted certificate verification on various dates in November and December. On December 11, it said the scanned copies of the original OMR sheets had been uploaded on the official website. However, it also said that due to complaints from some quarters, it had withdrawn the results and would publish new results soon. Though it did so, there was no difference between the old and new result. 
 
 The petitioner said that it appeared that there had been some irregularities in evaluating the answer (OMR) sheets as there were discrepancies in the marks of around 200 candidates. The school education minister made a statement that the TRB had retained the original OMRs and given only scanned copies to the private agency for the purpose of evaluation. According to the minister, mistakes had crept in at the data entry level. Following this, the TRB on February 9 cancelled the   and said that it would conduct fresh recruitment in August this year.
