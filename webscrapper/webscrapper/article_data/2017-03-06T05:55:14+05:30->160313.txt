BATHINDA:   provided two guards for the security of a member of Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda’s political wing on Sunday, seven days after a father-son duo who were members of the   were gunned down at Jagera village in Ludhiana on February 26. 

  senior superintendent of police (SSP) Swapan Sharma said they had provided security to dera follower Shinderpal Singh, a native of Pakka village in the district and the owner of a marriage palace at Sangat Mandi in Bathinda, after he complained that some people had been following him in an SUV and enquiring about him. “Shinderpal has apprised us of some people enquiring about him for two days. Sensing trouble, we provided two security personnel to him. We have also visited his marage palace, which the men had visited on Saturday night,” he said. 
 
 Shinderpal said there were four men in the SUV that had been following him. “They reached my marriage palace late on Saturday night and asked the watchman about me. This spooked me, so I approached the police and the dera management,” he said.
 
 The development has come close on the heels of the double murder of the father-son duo in Ludhiana district. Ludhiana range DIG S K Kalia had said on Sunday that the main purpose of killing the two Dera followers at Jaghera was to “disturb peace in the state” and had appealed to the public to help policy identify their attackers.
 
 Police on Sunday visited the marriage palace and enquired about the unidentified persons. The Dera had announced support to Shiromani Akali Dal for the February 4 assembly elections.
