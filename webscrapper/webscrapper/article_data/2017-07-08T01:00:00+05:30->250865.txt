Kanpur-born filmmaker   is all set to begin shooting his next, 'Hotel Milan Khilte Hain Gul Yahan Khil Ke Bikharne Ko', in Kanpur from next week onwards. "The story of the movie revolves around the anti-Romeo squad. In May I visited Kanpur for the recce of the shooting locations. Finally we have decided to start the shoot from July 18. We will be shooting in the city for a month on locations like Ganga barrage, Birhana Road, Motijheel, Phool Bagh and Swaroop Nagar. Some sequences of the film will be shot in Chitrakoot and Khajuraho too," shares Vishal.
In the past too, Vishal has shot   and   starrer 'Hum  ' in Kanpur. "This time too Kunaal is playing the lead role in the movie which also has actors Sanjay Mishra,  , Rajesh Sharma and   in important roles," says Vishal. 
 Ask Vishal what brings him to Kanpur again, and he says, "As I said earlier, the film's plot is of a small town. Also, cities like Varanasi and Lucknow are overexposed in films, so our search for a new backdrop brought us to Kanpur."
