CHARMINAR: Months after the   (SSA) scam on madrassas led to arrest of officials for corruption, the state government is in no mood to take chances with funds earmarked for these Islamic schools. Money flow is being strictly monitored, including the flagship midday meal scheme. The SSA provides mid-day meals to madrassas which are recipients of its aid. One of the key reasons is to increase enrolment and also to get students into mainstream.

 One such case -that of   in Falaknuma - came to the fore on Wednesday when its management told TOI that the government has stopped the midday meal scheme last month. “We spoke to the deputy inspector of schools (DyIS) and apprised her of the issue. For many years our students have recieved mid-day meals and now it has been stopped.We have requested her to look into the issue,“ said  .
 
 For her part, the DyIS,  , said that the madrassa management had not furnished a full list of students along with their Aadhaar card numbers, as mandated by the SSA guidelines. Further, the school has not enrolled its students into schools, which is another requirement.
