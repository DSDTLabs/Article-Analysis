ALLAHABAD: The Allahabad high court on Monday rejected bail application of Dr  , one of the nine accused in the death of several children at   (BRD) Medical College,  , allegedly due to disruption in oxygen supply, in August last year.

 
 Dr Shukla is the wife of former principal of BRD medical college Dr  , another accused in the case, who was denied bail by the high court April 30.
 
 Dr Shukla was an homoeopath attached with the medical college and had allegedly interfered in its functioning.
 
 Justice   said order for the release of the petitioner on bail cannot be passed at this stage keeping in view the present facts and circumstances of the matter.
 
 The petitioner took the plea that she had been languishing in jail for the last seven months. Further, other co-accused have been released on bail in this matter.
 
 However, opposing the bail application, the state counsel pleaded that the case was a very serious and it was due to the alleged role of the petitioner that the oxygen supply to the hospital was stopped.
 
 He alleged that the petitioner had played an important role in the functioning of the college.
