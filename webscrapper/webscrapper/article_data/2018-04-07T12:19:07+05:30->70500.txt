 Neha Jangra, 21, represented Haryana at the 10th National Level Open Karate Championship 2017 held in Margao, Goa, in December last year and had won a gold medal.
  
 She was going home after attending classes at the   around 7pm when the cop in uniform, identified as constable Yaseen, boarded the same auto-rickshaw. The constable started harassing Neha as soon as he boarded the auto-rickshaw as she was the only other passenger.
  
  
 “Instead of being wary of his position as a policeman, he immediately asked me for my phone number. When I refused, he targeted me and said he was asking for friendship only and there was nothing wrong. This infuriated me and I thrashed him twice and pushed him to the corner of the auto so that he couldn’t escape,” Neha told TOI.
  
  
 Although the constable struggled to escape, Neha with help of the auto-rickshaw driver managed to drag him to the nearest women’s police station.
  
  
 “To my surprise, the woman SHO, inspector Sunita Devi asked me to not escalate the matter and offered to humiliate the cop for sexually harassing me in uniform,” said an angry Neha. Her father,  , who is a mason rushed to the police station after that.
  
  
 Neha and her father were taken aback that the SHO was trying mediate on behalf of the errant constable instead of filing their complaint, telling them that the cop’s career and married life would be marred if an FIR was registered.
  
  
 
 The matter was finally resolved on Friday afternoon when a case under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code was registered against the constable, who was also placed under suspension and arrested.
