Mumbai: The Indian Navy is set to sign a contract with a foreign   firm for around Rs20 crore to make the frigate-class warship   Betwa upright and get her back floating. The   had toppled in the dry dock on December 5, killing two sailors and injuring 14 others. 

 “There are damages to the hull and side wall. But we are not going for salvage. The agency has been asked to repair and refit the ship to make her float by February-end,” a Navy source said. The warship is rested on the newly built blocks and the ingress water has been pumped out from it. “More than the outer damages it is the inner machinery damages that have to be known. This will be done in the second phase,” said an official. 
 
 Though a Board of Inquiry will establish the exact reason for the mishap, officers say it could have happened due to the failure of the “dock block mechanism” or miscalculation of the “load distribution equilibrium” required in the complex undocking procedure.
