GURUGRAM: The   has opened a median cut on top of the   underpass so that commuters can take a free right turn while going towards Delhi from Huda City Centre.

 This right turn is currently operational. Similarly, commuters going towards Delhi from Sohna Road can take a right turn at the   underpass from Tuesday. 
 
 At the Signature Towers underpass, commuters from Huda City Centre earlier had to take a U-turn near Atul Kataria Chowk to go towards Delhi. At the Rajiv Chowk underpass, commuters going towards Delhi can presently take a U-turn at Civil Lines only. 
 
 NHAI had planned the layout of these   as part of the underpass project. The underpasses at Rajiv Chowk and Signature Towers were opened to public on Monday by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. 
 
 Saurabh Singhal, traffic transportation expert at Bloom Companies, the NHAI consultant for the project, said, “We have made provisions for commuters to take a right turn towards Delhi at the Rajiv Chowk underpass. We have also made a median cut for commuters going towards Delhi from Signature Towers. This will enable commuters to easily travel to Delhi. We saw that during the peak hours, people moving towards Delhi were facing huge traffic jams. So, we planned the right-turn to ensure ease of traffic movement at Signature Towers and Rajiv Chowk.”
 
 According to Singhal, traffic police have been informed about the cuts. With the Signature Towers right-turn becoming signal free, NHAI can now open the second unidirectional flyover and another straight flyover at Iffco Chowk for free flow of traffic on the stretch. One unidirectional flyover is already operational at Iffco Chowk and the project is fully complete but is being held up due to some towers of high-tension wires coming in the way of the other flyovers. TOI has learnt that a new price has been quoted to the consultant for transferring the towers and talks are still going on.
