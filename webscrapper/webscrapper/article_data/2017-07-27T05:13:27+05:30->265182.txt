GURUGRAM : The   and the state government are planning to widen the service lanes of the   to ease traffic congestion. Officials said the two-lane 18km stretches of service lane on either side of the expressway from   to   would be upgraded to four lanes.

 At present, the service lanes on both sides are of two lanes. “We are exploring all possibilities to widen the service lanes since the intra-city traffic flow in Gurgaon along the expressway is huge. We are assessing the land availability and the expansion of service lanes will depend on how much land we get from the city authorities,” an   official told TOI on Wednesday.
 
 “The local authorities have land under them and we have asked Huda, MCG and HSIIDC to share the details of the same,” he said.
 
 Gurgaon is developed along the expressway due to which many city roads and areas are connected to the service roads, often leading to congestion on it. During peak hours, service lanes often get choked which also disrupt the traffic flow on the expressway.
 
 “NHAI will soon hold a meeting with GMDA, MCG, HUDA and HSIIDC, and discuss the possible ways to widen the service roads,” said senior town planner of MCG, Sudhir Chouhan.
 
 “NHAI has asked all the agencies to share the details of their respective land along the expressway. After getting the details, it will find out the details of private land along the expressway. If required, private land will be acquired for widening of the service lanes. Widening of the service lanes will help in reducing traffic congestion in the city,” he added.
 
 However, another official said that though widening of service lanes from Sirhaul to Iffco Chowk might not create any problem, it would be challenging to get land from people for widening of service lanes between Iffco Chowk and Kherki Daula. 
 
 “There are several fuel refilling stations and commercial establishments right on the service lanes on that stretch. It would be a very challenging project,” said the official.
