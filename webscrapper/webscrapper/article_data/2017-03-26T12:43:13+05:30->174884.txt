NAGPURr: Akash Bharadwaj, 27, was slapped with charges of  , torturing and criminal breach of trust by   station on Friday, following complaint of his wife. The woman, who had tied the knot with Akash in 2014, approached police after Akash and his family started mounting pressure on her for money and other demands. 

 Apart from Akash, police have also booked his brother Nitesh and mother Kavita in the same offence. It has been reliably learnt that Akash, a real estate dealer, has been physically and mentally harassing Sunita (name changed) since their marriage. Even after becoming parents of a son, the situation did not change. Besides making monetary demands, Akash would also harass Sunita for unnatural sex. Akash would also thrash Sunita under influence of alcohol. 
 
 Akash started torturing Sunita more after demanding to get divorced. He had even clicked a nude photograph of Sunita threatening to make it viral. It was after such a threat that a panicked Sunita approached cops relaying them about her being tortured by Akash. As Sunita was not shielded from being tortured by Akash, the cops also ensured that his family members too were booked as abettors.
