GURUGRAM: The crime unit of Sector 39 foiled a robbery attempt by arresting two armed thieves near the Ansal University campus in Sector 55 off   on Wednesday night.

 Around 9pm, the unit got a tip-off about the whereabouts of the two criminals, wanted in several cases.
 
 Accordingly, a team from the crime unit drove a private car to the location where the duo was scheduled to arrive and waited at the spot. Soon enough, the two robbers reached there and on seeing the car, stopped their bikes. One of them, armed with a gun, started moving towards the driver of the car while the other one with an iron rod, approached the vehicle from the co-driver’s side. They asked the cops sitting in the car to hand over whatever valuables they had.
 
 But as soon as they realised that the people they were trying to rob were in fact cops, they tried to flee. They were, however, caught. Inspector Raj Kumar, in-charge of the crime unit, said that Arshad, 25, and Asam, 28, are from Sikri, Bharatpur and Tijara, Alwar, respectively and were wanted in several cases in Rajasthan and Haryana.
 
 “They were wanted for over 10 cases of loot and robbery in Rajasthan, and three cases in  , Manesar and Sadar in Gurgaon,” said Kumar. The duo is part of a larger gang, but other members were not present at the time of raid,” the police said.
 
 An FIR was registered against them under sections 398 (attempt to commit robbery armed with weapon) and 401(punishment for belonging to a gang of thieves) of IPC and sections 25, 54 and 59 of the Arms Act. Arshad and Asam were produced before the district magistrate and sent to judicial custody. They will be taken on remand by Rajasthan police on Friday. The police also recovered a country-made pistol with several live rounds, a stolen motorcycle, a car and an Eicher canter from accused.
