If something rib-tickling is what you’re looking for, then Sunday looks promising. It took a while, but the students of  , Mumbai (DSM) have finally found their way to Pune (and the hearts of the city’s theatre aficionados) with their annual student production, The Mule’s Foal. Being staged at   in Shaniwar Peth at 11 am, this will be their first performance in the city.

 Primarily based on a novella by Fotini Epanomitis, and adapted into a stage play by Australian playwright Alan Becher, The Mule’s Foal is a story about love, gossip and longing, all set in a village where sense doesn’t prevail. The production will feature nine students of acting and theatre making from DSM, and has been directed by   and  .
 
 Sheena says, “Getting the play together has been quite a journey. The production you will finally see, is combination of the novella and the stage play script, the Hindi translation by Neha Sharma.” 
 
 Interestingly, much of the play’s scenes and characters have been devised by the students themselves. “The story is what interested us. Along the tone of magical realism, it allows for many possibilities. Hence, when we read scenes out together, Puja and I would coax the students to look beyond the text. What the audience will finally see is a real mix and match - of formats, scenes and characters created by the students themselves,” Sheena adds.
 
 As part of DSM’s Pune journey, theatre professional Deshik Vansadia will also work with aspiring theatre-makers to help them discover honesty and vulnerability in acting through the use of body and breath, at TIFA Working Studios, Camp, on Sunday, 
 at 4 pm.
