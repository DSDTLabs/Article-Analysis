BENGALURU: The list of visitors who called on Mohammed Nalpad Haris in jail has exposed violations of the  , RTI activists have alleged. 

 The prisons’ department, which had initially declined to divulge any information in reply to an   about Nalapad’s visitors citing ‘privacy’, has now revealed that the youngster was allowed seven visitations between February 24 to March 7, three of them in one week (Feb 24-March 3), which violates the Karnataka Prison Manual. A visitation is an occasion where an inmate is allowed to meet one or more visitors.
 
 RTI applicant and advocate T Narasimha Murthy, who had raised the query, said in reply to another RTI application filed by him in 2014, the department had said undertrials are allowed to meet visitors only once a week, while convicts are eligible for interviews once in 15 days. The copies of the RTI replies are in possession of TOI. 
 
 M Somashekar, chief superintendent,   (Parappana Agrahara), did not respond to calls. 
 
 Nalapad has been lodged in the jail since February 20. The number of his visitors ranged from one to four. Murthy had filed an RTI application seeking information about Nalapad’s visitors in March. In reply, Parappana Agrahara prison authorities said they were unable to provide information as it would amount to invasion of privacy of the person concerned. 
 
 TOI had reported the same on April 13 (‘Jail officials deny information on Haris Jr’s visitors citing privacy concerns). Murthy appealed against the denial of information and the prison officials were directed to reply appropriately within 15 days.
