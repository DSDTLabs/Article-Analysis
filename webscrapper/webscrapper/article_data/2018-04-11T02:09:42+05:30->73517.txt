THANE: After eight teens from the lake city had lost their way for seven hours during a   at   on Monday, many hiking clubs have advised amateur   to take along professional guides with them.

 This is the second such incident in the city in the last six months. From carrying a first aid kit equipped with a Swiss knife, asthma inhalers and medicines, to stocking up on water and dry snacks and remembering emergency contact numbers (as they don’t require a network range), storing a contact number of a villager, adventure groups have advised nature lovers to take the necessary precautions.
 
 An adventure enthusiast who also conducts treks,   (22), said, “It is a very bad decision to just casually go about exploring the hills as we don’t know what could happen. If trekkers are going in groups, at least there should be one person in the team who has visited the place before. So, if people are unable to trace the routes, the rest of the members can depend on the person for help. If not, the group could approach villagers who are more than happy to show you around. The most important thing is to stick to the original path and not explore the untaken routes which are more often than not dangerous.”
 
 Some professional trekkers and nature trail organizers in the city also said that they make it a point for participants to connect with villagers in the area so that they can rescue trekkers if need be. “Before our trek begins, all participants are called for a session. We ensure that everyone knows the emergency contact numbers like fire brigade; police local disaster management unit. We also connect them to the villagers and share their contact numbers in case of an emergency,” said an adventure enthusiast.
