GUWAHATI: Hundreds of   from the northeast   on Monday and   for almost an hour in protest against the   

 Former chief minister Tarun Gogoi, who also joined the protest, said demonetisation was an anti-people measure, and caused misery to common people. State Congress president Ripun Bora was also among the Youth Congress protesters who came from Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Assam. 
 
 Raising slogans, they marched from the Dhighalipukhri area and tried to gherao the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) office here. But security forces prevented the protesters from reaching the RBI office which is situated less than half a kilometer from Dighalipukhri. This led to arguements with policemen. Movement of vehicles was hit for almost an hour.
 
 In the meantime, Mahila Congress activists marched to the Kamrup (Metropolitan) deputy commissioner's office to register their protest against demonetisation. 
 
 Assam Youth Congress secretary Imdad Hussain said many protesters were detained, while some sustained injuries when police used force against them. Youth Congress national general secretary Indrani Mishra was among those injured. 
 
 "The outcome of demonetisation will be very grim. Countries like Myanmar, Nigeria and the former USSR had faced food scarcity because of demonetisation. Modi should apologize to the people of the country for the misery caused by demonetisation," Bora said. 
 
 Gogoi said people should stand up against the BJP government's draconian policy. Congress, in a memorandum to the Prime minister, said demonetisation was a surgical strike on India's poor farmers, labourers, shopkeepers, small businessmen, middle class and the entire unorganised sector.
 
 "By taking away 86% of currency in circulation on November 8, Modi has hit 99% honest hardworking Indians, while presumably targeting 1% black money hoarders. India's wheel of development has come to a standstill plunging the country in a state of anarchy," the memorandum said.
