KOLKATA: A massive fire broke out inside the compound of   on   near EM Bypass on Saturday afternoon. No one was reported to be injured or stuck inside one of the oldest jute mills of the city.

 Around 10 fire tenders, along with the Kolkata Police’s disaster management group and fire officials doused the flames within two hours. Though the exact cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained, fire officials suspect it was triggered by a short circuit.
 
 
 The fire broke out around 1pm. According to locals, the fire spread from some leftovers of the mill stacked in the premises and spread rapidly as there were inflammable objects inside the factory. Soon, smoke engulfed the area causing panic among the locals. What added to the panic was that there are several commercial establishments beside the mill and a residential complex opposite the factory.
 
 However, the firefighters used water from a pond inside the mill’s compound to bring the   under control before it could cause severe damage.
 
 According to the mill spokespersons, there was not much damage caused to the factory as the fire did not break out inside the mill.
 
 Established in 1930, the jute factory is one of the few mills within the city and also the smallest one in terms of production capacity. It has a generation capacity of 25 metric tonne per day. The mill employs 650 workers and is spread across 10 acres.
 
 The jute mill was initially owned by the   family but a year ago, it was bought by the Hooghly group founded by late jute barron Arun Bajoria.
