CHANDIGARH: While accusing the Punjab government of betraying farmers on debt waiver issue, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has decided to gherao the   on the opening day of the forthcoming budget session on March 20.

 “The government must honour its commitments to the poor and innocent farmers,” said SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal at the party core committee meeting held on Wednesday. The core committee in its resolution said, “They (Congress government) said they were not aware of the financial position of the state when they made the promises. But, they had been issuing white papers on its fiscal state before the elections. If they were unaware of the monetary position, then how could they make a provision of Rs 1,500 crore for debt waiver in the budget?”
 
 The committee observed a two-minute silence to pay homage to former minister Ajit Singh Kohar, who had passed away recently. In another resolution, the SAD committee thanked the Canadian prime minister   for his expression of profound love and respect for the people of Punjab in general and the Sikhs in particular with his visit to the state and by paying obeisance at   in Amritsar.
 
 The SAD has constituted a committee, led by its president, to go into the entire gamut of problems faced by the farmers and suggest ways to make farming a lucrative profession. Its other members include Ranjit Singh Brahampura, Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, Balwinder Singh Bhunder, Tota Singh and  .
 
 The party also decided to approach Jammu and Kashmir chief minister   to seek redressal of problems being faced by Sikhs in that state. It was decided that a party delegation, led by the SAD president, will meet Mufti soon.
