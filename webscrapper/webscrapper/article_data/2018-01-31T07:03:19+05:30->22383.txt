AHMEDABAD: A metropolitan court on Tuesday dropped a 22-year old case against   (VHP) leader   and 40 others, including   Babu Jamna Patel and other BJP leaders, in connection with the stripping of a minister.

 Criminal proceedings were initiated against them in 1996, when they allegedly assaulted the then minister Atmaram Patel, who had sided with   at the time of the rift between Vaghela and the then chief minister Keshubhai Patel. These 41 persons were also accused of trying to strip the minister — by pulling off his dhoti — at a BJP function at Sardar Patel Stadium, where BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee had just completed his address. The accused were slapped with charge of attempt to murder apart from other charges.
 
 The additional chief metropolitan magistrate No. 11 put an end to criminal proceedings, taking into consideration a proposal mooted by the state government in 1998, to withdraw charges against all the accused in this case.
 
 According to Togadia’s advocate Chetan Shah, the state government sought withdrawal of the case, but the magisterial court refused to intervene on the grounds that charges of attempt to murder were invoked and it was beyond his jurisdiction to decide on the government’s proposal. The magisterial court’s order was challenged before a sessions court, which said that the magisterial court was competent to take a decision on the application to withdraw the case. Meanwhile, the former minister and the victim in this case, Atmaram Patel, passed away.
 
 The case came to the limelight earlier this month, when the metropolitan court issued arrest warrants against all the accused persons for not attending court proceedings. Most of the accused persons, including Togadia and Babu Jamna Patel, marked their presence in court the next day and got the warrants cancelled. The court granted them bail and posted a hearing for Tuesday. The accused had been alleging political vendetta.
