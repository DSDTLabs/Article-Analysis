LUCKNOW: The findings of the fresh investigation ordered by the state government in the   could turn out to be embarrassing for UP Police and jail authorities. 

  Having accessed two sets of medico-legal documents, forensic experts told TOI that either doctors at Unnao district hospital misrepresented  's condition in April 3's examination, or he was beaten up inside Unnao jail. 
 
 The experts, retired expert of UP state medico-legal cell Dr   and head of forensic medicine department at a university Dr  , said that the government should take opinion of an expert medical board to find out how simple wounds turned into serious injuries in jail.
 
 A day before Devender was taken to jail on April 4 at 7.30pm, he was attacked by accused   and four others. Makhi police booked Devender, a listed historysheeter of Unnao, and he was taken to hospital.
 
 The doctor noted 19 injuries but dubbed them as simple, referring an examination by a dental surgeon. Devender was sent to prison the next evening.
 
 When Devender complained of acute pain in abdomen, he was sent to district hospital on April 6 for ultrasound and X-ray. When his condition deteriorated on April 8, he was rushed to hospital again where he succumbed.
 
 Devender's internal injuries were undermined by doctors while injuries that were simple earlier became grievous. Two stitches, one over left eyebrow and second below right knee, were also found.
 
  "It is at this point that I was startled. No such injuries had been noted at district hospital earlier," said Dr Amar Singh. 
 
 "The position and nature of injuries in the autopsy report are inconsistent with the ones mentioned in the April 3 report. It shows Devender was beaten up again later," said Dr Abhas Singh.
