CHANDIGARH: After the fatal accident involving a 28-year-old motorcyclist on the road dividing sectors 48 and 49 on the intervening night of March 8 and 9,   have decided to install an iron railing on all road dividers.

 
 A call centre employee was killed after being hit by a speeding SUV. This is not the first time a speeding car hit a vehicle coming from the opposite direction after crossing the median.
 
 
 Shashank Anand, SSP traffic, told  , “We have sent a proposal to the administration to install iron railing on all the dividers of the city. At places where the railings cannot be installed, the height of the divider will be increased.”
 
 
 Although dividers have been constructed on almost all roads, the height of the central verge is so low that any motorist can cross it without difficulty.
 
 
 A traffic police inspector said they plan to construct road dividers so that pedestrians use zebra crossings. He said this will help reduce the number of fatal accidents involving pedestrians in the city.
 
 
 The police official also said they have another reason to construct a central verge. “It will not provide easy passage to traffic violators and miscreants after committing crimes,” he said.
 
 
 Traffic violators and miscreants would escape to other sectors on being chased by the police. Dividers were constructed on almost every major road in the city but their height was too low to be of any use.
 
 
 The administration has also started railings on dividers. The entire Madhya Marg has been covered. The UT administration is also installing railings on a few roads of  . Last July, a speeding car jumped the divider and hit a scooterist on the road dividing sectors 16 and 17. The scooterist died in the accident.
