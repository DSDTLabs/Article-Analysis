Vadodara: A Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) demolition squad met with resistance during a razing drive in the Navayard area of the city. Peeved residents of the area threw rubble on the street to protest the move.

 The VMC had taken up a drive to remove encroachments along the road. The structures included temples made in shades as well as parts of a couple of dwellings.
 
 VMC officials said that the local residents were peeved at the move and entered into an argument with the members of the razing team. Following this, the VMC teams decided to leave the area and let tempers cool down.
 
 Officials, however, said that no stones were pelted on the team. “The operation was peaceful. Some stones are seen lying on the street, but videos do not show anyone throwing stones on the demolition team,” said VMC’s encroachment and security director Mangesh Jaiswal.
