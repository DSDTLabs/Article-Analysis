VADODARA: M S University students will receive their degree certificates and mark sheets in de-materialised format in future. The   (UGC) and the   (MHRD) have directed the university to take part in the   (NAD) project which has been established by MHRD to ensure that educational institutions across the country post their academic awards, degrees and certificates in this central database.

 Once the project is fully implemented the university will no longer issue degree certificates and mark sheets in physical forms. 
 
 NAD will not only benefit students but also the education institutes and employers as they will have online access to academic awards, eliminating the need for persons to approach educational institutions for obtaining transcripts of awards or mark statements for verification. The project was conceived by MHRD digitization of education records. It promises to do away with difficulties of collecting, maintaining and presenting physical paper certificates. It is not only a database copy of the certificate records for academic institutes but a complete system for issuing online certificates to registered students. 
 
 “It will be an active online place for students, academic institutes and verification users. At the same time, it will deter the chances of paper certificates getting forged or faked by miscreants,” said MSU’s deputy registrar  . 
 
 “All the students including former students of the university will have to register through Aadhar number of NAD id after which the university will upload their data in pre-fixed format in the NAD system through a secure online process,” said Maru. 
 
 “Records can be accessed by the students, the verifiers, the prospective employers or background checkers based on the consent of the student,” he added.
