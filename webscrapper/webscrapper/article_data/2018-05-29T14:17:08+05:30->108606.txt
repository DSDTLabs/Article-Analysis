COIMBATORE:  , the   will be using treated water to clean coaches at the   yard, a measure that is expected to reduce freshwater consumption.

 Towards this, construction of an effluent treatment plant had started about two months ago, using Rs 1.17 crore sanctioned by the railway ministry.
 
 The yard has been drawing over three lakh litres of groundwater a day to clean the coaches and the platform. The used water is let out to the corporation sewage lines. Once the plant is established, gallons of underground water could be saved and could be utilised for some other purpose. 
 
 The plant can treat about four lakh litres of used water per day, a railway official said. “After treating the used water, the treated water will also be purified using a unique technology so that the tanks of the train compartments could also be filled,” he said, adding that the water would be used in toilets, apart from using it for maintenance work at the yard.
 
 The project was envisaged after the department received complaints pertaining to water shortage in long-distance trains, the official said, citing that each train contains about 24 compartments.
 
 The construction of the plant was bestowed to a Chennai-based company. “The work is expected to be completed within six months. The company has completed the procurement of the required machineries,” the official added.
 
 Next, the   Division is planning to establish a similar treatment plant at   and Mettupalayam Railway Station.
