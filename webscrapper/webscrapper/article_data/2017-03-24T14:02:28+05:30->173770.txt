NEW DELHI: This is a visit that has raised a lot of eyebrows - SP founder  's younger son Prateek and the latter's wife Aparna met early this morning with 
  , who dethroned Mulayam's other son Akhilesh.

 The couple met with   at the 'VVIP Guest House' in Lucknow, where the Uttar Pradesh CM has been staying since he was sworn in on Sunday.
 
 The SP-Congress combine was definitively routed by the BJP in the recently concluded Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls. Aparna was roundly defeated by Congress-turned-BJP candidate Rita Bahuguna Joshi. 
 
 With the air thick with such political rivalry, what explains this bonhomie, people are wondering.
 
 Still, what has been known for a while now is that Aparna and   are   fans. Last year, a selfie they took with the PM was widely circulated. This was after Modi attended a religious event at the Yadavs' residence.
 
 As well, in January 16, Aparna was a guest at a Modi event at Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University. At the time, she said no political inference should be drawn from her presence there, according to a PTI report. 
 
 "I have been invited here by the Vice-Chancellor. There is no politics involved in it. The Prime Minister of the country is for everyone," she added.
