 It’s a place where you can talk all things food for hours and nobody cares, a place to celebrate local suppliers and encourage people to experiment at home.
 
 
 
 
  At the end of the day, food is art and we all need to eat.
 
  I think the exposure of home cooking through the above platforms absolutely played a part in encouraging people to experiment. 
 
 However, deep down I think cooking is inside all of us, if we properly give it a go.
 
 
 
 Absolutely. I think it’s great to encourage kids from a young age and not only is it fun for them but it also teaches them respect for produce, and to also know what they are putting into their bodies.
 
  
 
 
  First, test your passion and love of food. Get out there, work in the industry, work in a restaurant, travel, get inspiration, and if it’s a true passion and you’re cut out for the hard work, then go for it. For me, ‘Antares’ has been a dream project and extremely rewarding.
 
  
 
 
 I wouldn’t say almost a second home, it’s as home to me now as Australia is! This question I used to be able to answer, but the more time I spend in India the more favourite Indian dishes I have. Kheema, aloo-gobi, coconut chutney, fish xacuti, and so many more – the list goes on. My new-found love is for anything rice based – masala dosa, idli, appam, they’re all filling but feel so light in the tummy. Definitely a new fave!
 
 
 
 
  It’s got to be a home cooked meal from my mother or Nan – there’s no place like home.
