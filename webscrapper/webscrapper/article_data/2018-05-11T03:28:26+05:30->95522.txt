NAVI MUMBAI: Three youths have been arrested for stabbing to death their 17-year-old friend after a spat during a drinking session in Ulwe. The   coastal police are looking for a fourth accused. 

 The incident occurred last Saturday night at one of the arrested youth's salon. The victim,  , resided with his parents in Sector-2, Ulwe. He used to help his mother at their vegetable shop in sector-17.
 
 "The accused (the arrested trio: Sultan, Lakhan and Gani, all aged 20-22 years) have stated that while they were drinking, Vishal started behaving abnormally as he had consumed a cocktail of bhang and liquor. He boasted he would become a dreaded don and turned violent," said senior inspector Smita Jadhav. "Hearing this, Lakhan picked up a knife from the wall and threw it at Vishal. The knife pierced Vishal's thigh and he started to bleed profusely. His friends panicked and took him to the nearby   around midnight, from where he was taken to Terna hospital in Nerul."
 
 Jadhav said, "Vishal wasn't admitted there as his friends couldn't pay the Rs 65,000 deposit. He was then taken to the civic NMMC hospital, where doctors said he was critical and asked his friends to inform his family members. Vishal succumbed early morning on Sunday. He lost excessive blood from the wound. His life could have been saved had he received treatment fast."
