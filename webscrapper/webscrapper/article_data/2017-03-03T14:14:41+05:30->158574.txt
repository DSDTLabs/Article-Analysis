 Ariana   says pop diva   inspires her to stay strong and believe in herself. The 'Break Free' singer said she loves Madonna "with every ounce of her being".

  
  
 "I have the utmost respect for that woman. I love her with every ounce of my being, and not just because I'm obsessed with her entire discography" she said. 
 
 "I'm so inspired by her bravery and her strength. I can look at her and not be scared to be strong," Grande said. 
 
 The 23-year-old singer also went on to slam those who judge   for being strong. "Women are judged for having a vision and being strong and using their voice, and it's just not the case. You can be strong and be friendly. (We) don't have to be just one thing," she said.
