Panaji: In view of the global safety week (May 8-14), traffic officials have been cracking a whip on violators with an extensive drive against rash and negligent driving.

 “Since it is holiday season, a lot of tourists are in town owing to which rash and negligent driving is taking place which could lead to serious accidents. The traffic police is, therefore, on the road engaged in a drive against all those who are violating traffic rules. I have directed my staff to conduct this drive extensively,” said deputy superintendent, Dharmesh Angle.
 
 Besides the traffic police personnel, the enforcement section of RTOs across Goa have also tightened the screws around riders and drivers taking things like wearing of helmet, putting on seatbelt etc, for granted.
 
 Sources from the state transport department informed that officers have been deployed for longer hours. Directions have been given to them by the higher-ups to be on duty from 8am onwards till 9pm everyday in order to detect violations.
 
 “There should be fear of the law among citizens and this will not be instilled unless officers are seen on the road doing their duty,” a source at the transport department said.
 
 “We are staying longer by increasing working hours for the drive. We are trying to impose traffic rules, but things have to work out from the citizens’ front as well,” said an RTO official from Vasco.
 
 In Vasco alone, over 30 violations a day are currently being detected. Otherwise, on an average, the RTO staff would challan approximately five violations a day.
 
 Ever since traffic and RTOs have started, the extensive drive to observe global road safety week, discipline among commuters has increased on the roads, officials stated.
 
 The full report of the number of violations will be shared with the transport department by individual RTO officers across Goa and the North and South Goa traffic cell by next week.
