GREATER NOIDA: Taking the Noida international airport project at Jewar further on track, the civil aviation department of Uttar Pradesh government on Friday wrote to the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority ( ) asking it to define the ‘land use’ for the proposed airport. Currently, the land falls in agriculture zone and will have to be earmarked as one meant for an ‘airport’.

 According to YEIDA officials, public objections and suggestions for change in the YEIDA Master Plan 2031 will be invited soon.
 
  Once these are cleared, the YEIDA board will clear the change in ‘land use’ before forwarding it to the state government for final approval. Though the   (NCRPB) also has the plan for the airport in its documents, a fresh nod from the board will also be sought by YEIDA. The process for initiating the change in the Master Plan will be completed in the next fortnight, YEIDA officials said.
 
 In 2001, YEIDA had earmarked nearly 10,000 hectares of land in 35 villages for the project, when it was first proposed. This site already has in place key no-objection certificates needed for the construction to start.
 
 In December 2015, 5,000 hectares, spread across a dozen villages, was set aside for the airport. The current plan is to use 3,000 hectares for the aviation project. However, according to officials, once a techno-feasibility study is done for the project, a projection of predicted passenger traffic will determine how much area shall be used for the airport.
 
 The   had cleared the way for the international airport at Jewar last month. The site for the proposed airport was granted clearance by the steering committee for greenfield airports, which is the first step for the proposed project.
