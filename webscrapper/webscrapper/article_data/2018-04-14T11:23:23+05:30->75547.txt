CHENNAI: When assistant commissioner of police H   agreed to be the chief guest for a programme organised by the   at Tambaram, he did not expect the occasion to be especially memorable. After all, the event only called for a routine speech. But there was a late twist to the tale which led to the 49-year-old being crowned with the Mr Madras title in the masters category. 

 Krishnamoorthy was preparing to deliver his speech when his bodybuilding mentor   suddenly signalled to him. Mani is a former   soldier who created history by winning the world bodybuilding and physique sports championship in the men’s 90 kg event in Hungary in 2013. The assistant commisioner was asked to apply colouring cream and get ready to compete in front of two state ministers. 
 
 “This is the first time I climbed up on a stage to compete for a title,” said Krishnamoorthy. “I was of course a bit nervous but the applause was overwhelming and boosted my confidence. But I was surprised to win the title,” he added.
 
 Krishnamoorthy says he is passionate about bodybuilding and finds time in the midst of his hectic schedule to train at the gym. “I never choose a regular time to go to the gym as my job requires me to be on the field 24/7. But I do my best to ensure I get some time to pursue my passion,” he said. Now, the assistant commissioner has set his sights on victory in the Mr Asia event, which is coming up soon. 
 
 A 1996 batch officer, Krishnamoorthy, a native of Ooty, started his career as a sub-inspector and spent time in the special branch CID and as a deputy superintendent of police in the DVAC before taking up his current position as assistant commissioner, Selaiyur. He has completed degrees in chemistry and criminology. 
 
 He hit the headlines soon after assuming charge as assistant commissioner last July when he instructed his men not to demand anything free of cost from shops or restaurants.
