LUDHIANA: A 40-year-old man from  , who was admitted to Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH), died of swine flu on Sunday.

 Though the district health authorities acknowledged the fact that the swine flu virus (human influenza A H3N2) has undergone genetic changes, the state health officials did not confirm the presence of H3N2 in Punjab.
 
 The Hoshiarpur man was admitted to DMCH with swine flu symptoms for the past one week.
 
 In July, as many as five cases of swine flu out of 9 samples sent for testing in Chandigarh have tested positive.
 
 A data collected by the World Health Organization (WHO) between September 2016 and February 2017 has already revealed that H3N2 had undergone considerable genetic changes.
 
 Dr  , district epidemiologist, said, “Definitely there has been genetic modification. The vaccine for this virus of swine flu is different, which we are yet to receive from the state health headquarters.”
 
 “Vaccine which was earlier administered for H1N1 cannot be given to tackle H3N2 virus,” he said. But the common anti-viral medicine ‘Tamiflu’ can be given, he said. 
 
 “The new virus of swine flu is a cause of concern. Cases are being reported from all over country. But no guidelines have been issued to us,” he said. 
 
 He said, “Earlier, swine flu cases were reported from November to February and this year, 5 cases were reported from January to March.” 
 
 In April to July, 8 cases have been reported for the first time. And the number is increasing as we are getting samples from hospitals, he added. 
 
 Dr Gagan Deep Singh Grover, state epidemiologist, said, “It’s H1N1 only. Till now, 18 cases have been reported in Punjab. Alerts have been sent to all the districts and guidelines will be sent soon. Cases are being reported from all over India and the number is higher in south India than in North.”
 
 Out of 18 cases reported from Punjab, 13 patients (from Ludhiana and other districts) are admitted to Ludhiana.
