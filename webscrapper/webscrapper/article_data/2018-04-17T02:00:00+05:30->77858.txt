PATNA: The state government has been sluggish in releasing funds for reimbursement to the schools against admissions taken under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009. 

 Private schools in the state complain that they are yet to receive RTE reimbursement money of the past two academic sessions — 2016-17 and 2017-18. The respective funds for the previous two academic sessions (2014-15 and 2015-16) were released only in March this year.
 
 State education minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma told this newspaper that funds to the tune of Rs89.99 crore were released in the last week of March for reimbursements under the 25% seats reserved under the   in 2014-15 and 2015-16 sessions. “The reimbursement process has already begun. All private schools will get the money within a month,” he said.
 
 The minister said the department would ensure that the private schools that claim to be following the RTE Act are really giving seats to the poor kids. “The department will seek data from private schools to ascertain whether they were following the mandatory RTE guidelines as they are supposed to reserve 25% of the seats for poor students,” said Verma.
 
 According to rules, schools are supposed to reserve 25% of their seats for such children and their fee is to be provided by the state government. The government, in turn, has to provide Rs444 per child per month to the school concerned.
 
 For session 2018-19, the admission under RTE Act would be conducted by the district administration and education officials through lottery system on April 23, while the last date of submitting the admission forms in private schools for underprivileged kids was April 16.
 
 According to the education department’s record, only 122 out of 389 schools in Patna are following the RTE norms and 1,482 underprivileged kids got admission in LKG in 2017-18 session.
 
 Private school and children welfare association president Shamael Ahmad said the government should increase the RTE funds to Rs1,000 per child as the Rs444 amount is not enough to meet the requirements and the schools have to shell out from their own pocket.
