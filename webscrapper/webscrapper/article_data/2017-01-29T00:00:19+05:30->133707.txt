 is a product of experiences. What attracted me to spirituality was the fear of in-the-moment insecurity and uncertainty. Since meditation is the act of practising control over one’s focus, I realised that I needed something to bring a wandering mind in order.   works for me and my overall lifestyle as it helps me to counter stress while strengthening the immune system. Even recalling how well-documented these effects are helps me to relax. I never looked at myself as a guru, just as someone who wants to share her experiences with other people, and learn from them.
 
  I’ve seen people quitting because their minds constantly wander after five minutes. I started meditation to control the wandering mind. I would commence the practice the moment I became frustrated with innumerable thoughts clouding my mind. This frustration was a signal to begin mediation, which is the practice of calming and refocusing the chaotic, monkey mind. I don’t know about ‘higher’ but maybe I’ve become more ‘deeper’ or ‘clearer’. A spiritual person is just someone who has a firm grasp on the truth: that there really are no separate objects, and there are no separate entities – we are fundamentally connected. This simplicity helped remove the emotional clutter and fear of insecurity and uncertainty people tend to feel in the moment.
