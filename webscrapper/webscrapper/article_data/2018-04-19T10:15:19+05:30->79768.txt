LUCKNOW: The draft policy for rehabilitation of sick industrial units prepared by the   government is asking sick industries to pay for their own rehabilitation, drawing sharp criticism from industry representatives.
 
 The  , which has submitted a list of recommendations to the government, said the policy defeated its purpose by asking sick units, forced to seek help because they are not making money, to first pay to be eligible to seek help from the government.
 
 “It is a welcome step that the government is formulating this policy. However, the policy itself is poorly drafted and seems to lack any knowledge about industries. We met senior officers from the   department and the infrastructure and industrial development corporation on Wednesday and discussed key points with them. The officers were receptive to our suggestions and we hope that the changes will be incorporated in the final draft,” said   president Suneel Verma.
 
 Sources in the government said the issues raised by IIA had been taken note of and changes, if any, would be incorporated in the final draft.
 
 Among the points raised by IIA is a proposal to ask sick units to deposit a non-refundable processing fee. “The sick industry which is already in financial stress will be required to deposit exorbitantly high processing fee of Rs 1 lakh for micro and Rs 5 lakh for small and medium industries ” said the association’s letter.
 
 Among various measures to help a sick industry, the government has proposed exception from paying 85% of the state GST for five years. However, this exception will be in the form of a refund made annually to the sick unit. “IIA has proposed that instead of charging   and than refunding it, the sick industry may be allowed to deposit 15% of the SGST for the stipulated period of five years,” said IIA executive director DS Verma.
