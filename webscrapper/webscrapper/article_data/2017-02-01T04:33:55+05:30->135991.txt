GURUGRAM: An accountant of a transport firm has been arrested for allegedly duping his employer of Rs 1.25 crore. He was produced in a city court on Tuesday and sent to police custody.

 According to police, 25-year-old Manjinder Singh from Jalandhar, who worked for Madan Lal Baweja’s transport firm in Udyog Vihar Phase 5, allegedly stole a signed blank cheque, filled a sum of Rs 1.25 crore and asked a known person to deposit it in his account in Punjab National Bank’s Jalandhar branch. The incident took place in the first week of January, cops said.
 
 To ensure that the owner’s bank (HDFC) did not call him to verify the transfer of such a huge amount, Manjinder, using the company’s letterhead, wrote to Baweja’s service provider to block the SIM card, claiming he had lost it and asked to be issued a new one. The next day when the bank called on the number, Manjinder, who had the new SIM, confirmed that a transfer of Rs 1.25 lakh had been made from the account. 
 
 But the day the money was transferred to Manjinder’s account, Baweja happened to check his bank statement online and on seeing the Rs 1.25-crore transaction, filed a complaint against an unidentified person on January 12 at Udyog Vihar police station. Police, in turn, froze the PNB account in which the money had been transferred. Manjinder was finally arrested from Delhi on Monday night. He has been taken to Jalandhar for further investigation.
