Singer   has split from her boyfriend   after dating him for 21 months.

 
  
  This comes just few days before the first anniversary of the   bombing, which killed 22 of Grande's young fans at her concert on May 22.
 
 Reportedly, the pair, who first started dating in September 2016, have ended their relationship due to conflicting work commitments, but they remain close friend.
 
  Less than a month ago, Miller expressed his admiration for Grande on   when she released her first new track since the bombing, "No Tears Left to Cry".
 
 
  
 
  The song is from her upcoming album,   set for release in July.
