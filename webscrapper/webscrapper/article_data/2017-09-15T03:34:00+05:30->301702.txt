Panaji: Fisheries minister Vinod Palyekar has recommended the   of fisheries director Shamila Monteiro, over alleged irregularities in the issuance of radio-frequency identification (RFID) cards to fishermen.

 Sources in the secretariat said Palyekar has forwarded the file recommending Monteiro’s suspension, pending a vigilance inquiry, to fisheries secretary, Govind Jaiswal. Jaiswal, however, declined to comment on the matter. “It’s a departmental issue. No such file ordering her suspension has come to me yet,” he said. It is believed that the government will decide on the matter in consultation with chief minister Manohar Parrikar. 
 
 According to sources in the fisheries department, there has been friction between Palyekar and Monteiro for a while now. Palyekar, they said, hasn’t been satisfied with the functioning of the department under Monteiro’s directorship and has been targeting her since. They added that the fisheries minister felt the department was backing the bull-trawling lobby and the use of LED lamps on fishing vessels.
 
 TOI had reported last month that the government had issued a showcause notice to Monteiro demanding the reason for delay in issuing RFID cards to fishermen.
