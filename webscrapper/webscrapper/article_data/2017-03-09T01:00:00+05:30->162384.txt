 is in a happy space these days. She has been soaking in the appreciation that has come her way for her short film, 'Peanut Butter'. While she will be seen in a cameo appearance in ' ', her big release for the year is ' ', in which she plays Vidya Balan’s close aide. Excerpts:

 
 Web content is accessible to all, but there are only a few scripts that make an impression. So, when people offer me challenging roles, I don’t think twice before accepting. In 'Ek Dopahar' and 'Peanut Butter', I’ve played characters that I haven’t played before. In the latter, I play a mother who is not yet one. My role should be impactful, length doesn’t matter.
 
 
 
 When director   offered me a cameo in 'Badri'…, I wanted to know why he chose me for just a guest role. But I was convinced when he told me that my character is crucial in shaping Badri’s viewpoint. 'Begum Jaan' is close to my heart. One day, I received a text from Vidya (Balan), saying both she and director   wanted me to play  . I was so happy that I told them I would even do 10 auditions to land the role. But turns out, Srijit had me in mind while writing the script because he’d liked my work in ' : Salesman of the Year'. The fact that a National Award-winning director has given me this film without even auditioning me makes me feel that I’ve credentials as an actress.
 
 
 I’ve no backing in the industry, and like every newcomer, I’ve to time and again prove myself. Right after 'Rocket Singh', I did ' '; I’ve to my credit 1,200 shows of the biggest live Bollywood musical ever. I am hungry for good roles; I chose the best projects because I didn’t want to be just a prop in films. I want people to remember me for my character.
