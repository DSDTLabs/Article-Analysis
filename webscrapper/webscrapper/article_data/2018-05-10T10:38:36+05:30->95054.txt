AMRITSAR: Cabinet minister   had a narrow escape when a stray bull attacked a group of people standing with him outside the Durgiana Temple on Wednesday. The minister had gone there to inspect the ongoing beautification project when the incident occurred.

 According to an eyewitness,  , who was accompanying Sidhu, “When we came out of the briefing room of Durgiana Temple, Sidhu was putting on his shoes when suddenly from nowhere a stray bull charged towards us.” Sidhu’s security personnel immediately whisked him away to safety.
 
 Though Sidhu escaped unhurt, three journalists sustained minor injuries.
 
 Terming it as a routing matter, a resident of Durgiana said, “It is not the first time that a stray bull had terrified the people. You (media ) people are writing about it now because a cabinet minister and a celebrity is involved in it. Otherwise no one even writes such news,” he said.
