The Gandhipuram Mofussil bus stand that usually is abuzz with commuters wore a deserted look on Wednesday as the state-wide transport workers’ strike entered seventh day. Even though many private buses were operating on busy routes, apprehensions over the strike and worry over their safety stopped many commuters from boarding the buses, which were driven by inexperienced men.

 Seventy-year-old S Kaliathaal, who was travelling from Kovilpalayam to Gandhi Park on Wednesday morning, said she got injured because of the driver’s rash driving. Showing her swollen hands, she said, "The government bus in which she was travelling was driven by a private driver. He drove so rashly that I fell and injured my hand. Another woman in front of me also fell. I am really worried about our safety," she said. Many other shared her apprehensions and said they often asked the drivers to stop at the bus stops as many of them did not even know the routes. 
 
 Ramesh A G S, a commuter at Gandhipuram Mofussil bus stand, said even mini bus drivers had been replaced by private drivers. "Most of these new drivers are not willing to drive to remote areas. We have no other choice but to walk or take auto rickshaws," he said.
 
 Lakshmi, a college student, said after reading many reports of accidents, she was worried about getting into a bus driven by a new driver. "Most of them do not even know the routes. Yesterday, while travelling to Saibaba Colony, we had to tell the driver to stop at many bus shelters as he was not aware of the route at all," she said.
 
 RTO officials said that they conducted tests and scrutinised their documents before letting them drive the buses. TNSTC officials said that they gave the buses to these private drivers only after a mandatory test.
