Amritsar: The SGPC president, Gobind Singh Longowal, held a meeting on Sunday to discuss the preparations being made for Trudeau’s welcome and also issued dress code instruction for its officials and members of SGPC’s internal security task force.

 Stating that Trudeau should be welcomed and honoured as per Panthic traditions, Longowal said all members of the task force would be attired in a specific uniform and would support saffron turbans while all officials of the SGPC would wear blue turbans. About security arrangements during Trudeau’s Golden Temple visit, SGPC’s chief secretary Roop Singh said the SGPC would deploy its own security personnel besides Trudeau’s own and government security.
 
 On the other hand, many Sikh hardliners are using social media and internet to cause ‘bitterness’ between Indian and Canadian governments during Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s visit. In a recent move Sikh separatist Gajinder Singh, wanted by the Indian police, on his Facebook page uploaded a message saying “Friends, let’s welcome Canadian PM , his family members and cabinet through Facebook”. He himself had on January 23 posted posters of Indian militants (including him) wanted by Delhi police on his Facebook page ahead of the Republic Day. Gajinder had earlier appealed to hardliners to put up boards in Amritsar, saying that ‘Khalistan welcomes you Mr Justin’.
 
 Meanwhile, intelligence sources informed TOI that security forces were keeping a watch on Khalistani sympathizers.
