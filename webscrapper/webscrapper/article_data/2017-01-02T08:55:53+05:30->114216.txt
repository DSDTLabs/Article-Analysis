CHENNAI: After eight years, five surgeries and unmitigated suffering, a woman was awarded a compensation of over Rs 6.5 lakh by the North Chennai district consumer disputes redressal forum for negligence by two hospitals.

 According to V Visalakshi, she was admitted to   in   in labour pain on August 24, 2008. A doctor there, Dr Balamani Mugian, said she would have a normal delivery , but Visalakshi later learned that he had conducted an episiotomy (a surgical cut doctors make at the opening of the vagina to help in a difficult delivery). Mugian, however, made the incision too deep, which resulted in a gash in the anal canal. The hospital suppressed the fact.
 
 After her discharge the next day, Visalakshi discovered that the sutured area was secreting pus and faecal matter. Her family then admitted her to SKS Hospi tal in   (extension), where she was diagnosed as having undergone a forceps delivery, because of which there was a complete tear of the perineal area (the surface between the pubic symphysis and the coccyx) and a wound. On the doctor's advice, she underwent two surgeries.
 
 In October, Visalakshi again developed intense pain. Doctors at CSM Nursing Home in West Mambalam found a fistula extending from the anal wall to the vagina. The nursing home discharged her after 10 days and advised another surgery. Visalakshi then issued a legal notice to Raghavi Hospital, alleging medical negligence, and subsequently approached the consumer forum. At the forum, Raghavi Hospital stated that pus was normal after an episiotomy , while SKS Hospital said Visalakshi had failed to follow the doctors' advice. But the forum held them guilty -SKS Hospital because it just sutured an infected wound.
