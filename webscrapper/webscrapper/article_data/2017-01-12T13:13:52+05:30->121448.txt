VADODARA:   will not be alone any more as Dimpi arrived late on Tuesday night to give him company. This is not about children, but hippopotamuses at the Sayajibaug Zoo.

 The hippos are the only major attraction to be added to the zoo in the recent past. The male hippopotamus Chunnu was brought on October 16 from the   in Indore. The pair of hippopotamuses was to be exchanged against exotic birds from the Sayajibaug Zoo.
 
 Sayajibaug Zoo curator Dr Pratyush Patankar said that Dimpi was aged nine years while Chunnu brought earlier is a 15-year-old. Chunnu and Dimpi were a pair at the zoo at Indore as well. They were amongst six hippopotamuses at the zoo.
 
 While both were kept separately on Tuesday night, the pair was united on Wednesday morning. “They recognised each other and have been kept in the same enclosure,” said Patankar.
