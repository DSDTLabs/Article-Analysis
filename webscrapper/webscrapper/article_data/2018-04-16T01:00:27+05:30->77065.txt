Madurai: Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Sunday laid the foundation stone for the new collectorate complex to be built at an estimated cost of Rs 26.98 crore in Madurai. Palaniswami, along with deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam and others who attended the function, said prayers after the foundation stone was placed. The government had in the state budget for 2017-2018 fiscal declared that an integrated collectorate complex would come up in Madurai under the Assembly Rule Number 110. The government order to this effect was passed on October 30, 2017 and an administration sanction was given for Rs 20.98 lakh. The new collectorate complex is coming up on the premises of the existing collectorate which was constructed in 1916. The new four-storey building will cover over an area of 4.43 acres.  The ground floor will have 30 rooms spread over 3,105 sqm while the first floor will have 33 rooms over a 2838 sqm area. The 2,572 sqm second floor will consist of 25 rooms and the third floor will have 26 rooms over 2389 sqm. It will have separate offices for collector, public relations, special tahsildar (airport expansion), treasury, district adi dravidar welfare, branch manager Elcot, special tahsildar Arasu (govt) cable television, special tahsildar for refugees, assistant director of town panchayats, among others. Meanwhile, many have alleged that the function, despite being organised by the government, did not follow any protocol as there was no singing of the Thamizh Thai Vazhthu before the meet began or the national anthem at the end of the programme.  After the function, the chief minister, deputy chief minister and other ministers moved to a makeshift stage and distributed welfare measures worth Rs 3.99 crore to select beneficiaries
