" " star   escaped unhurt in a late-night car crash last week after a reported 16-hour shift on the set of the drama. 

 Apa plays the role of   on the crime drama. 
 
 He fell asleep at the wheel during his almost hour-long drive home, according to The Hollywood Reporter. 
 
 The accident allegedly occurred after midnight outside of Vancouver, Canada, where the series is filmed. 
 
 Apa's vehicle reportedly struck a light pole, destroying the passenger side. 
 
 Cole Sprouse, who stars as   on the series, was originally going to ride in Apa's car but changed his plans as per the report. 
 
 The THR reported that despite the long hours that actors are required to be on the Riverdale set, cast and crew are not provided transportation either to or from set and Warner Bros Television's policy is that actors must coordinate their own transit. 
 
 WBTV, however, disputed parts of THR's account in a statement to People, saying the conditions on the set of 'Riverdale' were not a cause of concern. 
 
  
  
 "First and foremost, we are extremely grateful that KJ Apa was uninjured during his recent accident. Secondarily, we want to specifically address the characterisation that conditions on the set of Riverdale are of concern. 
 
 "We have a large cast of series regulars, and our actors do not work every day. On the day of the accident, KJ worked 14.2 hours. The previous day he worked 2.5 hours, and the day before that he worked 7.7 hours," the statement read. 
 
 The WBTV said "KJ has repeatedly been informed about making production aware if he is tired or feels unsafe, and if so, either a ride or hotel room will be provided for him." 
 
 "The safety of the cast and crew on all of our productions is of paramount importance to the Studio," WBTV added. 
 
 The company said that they followed the Screen Actors Guildmandated turnaround time of 12 hours from wrap time to next day call time for cast members and had conveyed the same to the cast and the crew.
