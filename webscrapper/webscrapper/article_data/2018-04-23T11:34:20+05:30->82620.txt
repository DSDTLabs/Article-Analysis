LUCKNOW: In a move which would make forgery of an applicant’s details impossible, Dr   ( ) has set up a three-layer security mechanism for screening candidates applying for admission.

 In a first, BBAU will use a scanning security device to verify candidates’ thumb impressions, signatures and photographs during the three-step admission process.
 
 
 “Chances of ‘Munna Bhais’ appearing for the examinations will be zero with the university adopting an advance mechanism of verification of candidate identities. While applying, a candidate has to upload a scanned photograph and thumb impression which would be cross-checked thrice,” said BBAU admission coordinator  .
 
 Once the candidate uploads the required documents along with the application form, a database with a unique registration number will land in BBAU’s data bank. The stored information will be verified again when the candidate appears for the examination.
 
 “The candidate’s thumb impression and photograph would be taken again during the entrance test and be matched with those submitted earlier,” Khan added.
 
 In the third step, the details will be matched once again after a candidate clears the entrance test and reports for counselling.
