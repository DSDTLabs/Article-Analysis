Jaipur: Unidentified thieves made away with cash and jewellery worth over Rs 3 lakh from the house of a mining businessman in   on Saturday.

 The police said that Jitendra Ponia had returned to his house at 12.30 pm when he found his house ransacked and completely shaken. “He said that his parents were in Ramdevra and he had left his home at 9.20 am. When he came back he found his house was searched by somebody,” said a police official.
 
 The official said that Poonia searched his house where he found that cash locker and closets were open. “There was cash worth Rs 2. 5 lakh that has been stolen, also, some gold and silver ornaments are also missing,” said the official.
 
 The cops suspect that somebody from inside the house may have carried out the crime. “It seem that accused knew that house was empty and where they could find cash. They touched only those closets where there was cash,” said cops.
 
 The CCTV footage of Vistar Nagar to Vaishali Nagar has shown some suspects in the area but cops have yet to zero in on some particular criminal. The police said that they have also asked special branch to get the details on the criminals.
 
 The FSL has collected samples from the room and would be matched with the existing record.
