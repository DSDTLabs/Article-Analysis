HYDERABAD: Rules framed by the government six years ago in the undivided state to hire private buildings have now emerged as a major obstacle to take on rent private buildings for the purpose of accommodating nearly 200 new BC   and colleges.The rates fixed by the state government for hiring the buildings were revised way back in 2011. Though the market rental values have multiplied upwards since then, the government have not revised it from its side.

 Due to urbanisation, the rental market varies from one town to the other, and from one building to the other depending upon its location and character. So when the officials started their hunt to identify buildings to be taken on rent, they were told blatantly by the owners that they cannot let it out as the government rate fixed was far less than the prevailing market rental value. What's more, the officials found themselves cornered when the owners of buildings too demanded an upward revision. “It took lot of effort on the part of officers to impress upon the government to be flexible in finalising the rentals and finally the government agreed.The government has issued orders to hire buildings as per the prevailing market rental values. Recently, the   was given the green signal to hire buildings for its residential schools as per the prevailing rental values,“ said an official from the BC welfare department.
