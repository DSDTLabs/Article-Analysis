NAGPUR: Police have booked a 32-year-old man for allegedly trying to kill his wife at their residence near   in Bhande Plot on Friday afternoon.

However, Chhaya was fortunate to survive as her daughters alerted locals, who immediately informed the Sakkardara police.

A sole breadwinner of the family, she has to pay the school fees of her daughters Prachi (15), Pallavi (13) and Deepali (10). Naresh used to assault her severely as she always refused to give him money.
