AGRA: Entry tickets to the   will be valid only for three hours from April 1. If tourists exceed the time limit, they will have to pay for another ticket. The move was taken in order to streamline crowd at the world heritage site.
 
  Tickets at present cost Rs 40 for Indians and Rs 1000 for foreign tourists. Talking to TOI, superintendent archaeologist of ASI (Agra circle), Bhuvan   said, “If tourists exceed the time limit of three hours, they will be charged an extra amount equivalent to a ticket, which will have to be paid at the exit gate.”
  
  “Time slots will also be enforced and if tourists don’t arrive at the slotted time, they will not be allowed entry and will have to buy a new ticket,” added Singh. All tickets, including those sold online, will have a time specified on them. Tourists can book a visit for a time convenient for them. However, Singh also admitted that the new rule might not be easy to enforce in the beginning, which is why staff at the Taj had been asked go easy on tourists even if they overstepped the three-hour limit till the new system set in place.
  
  “The ASI is spreading information about the new entry rules through various media. Things will go smooth once the turnstile gates are installed,” he said. He also clarified that the opening and closing time of the monument will remain the same.
  
  In order to maintain a proper headcount of visitors, zero-value tickets will also be introduced for children below 15 years of age. However, no notification has been issued till date about the extra Rs 200 that is to be charged for visiting the Taj’s main mausoleum.
