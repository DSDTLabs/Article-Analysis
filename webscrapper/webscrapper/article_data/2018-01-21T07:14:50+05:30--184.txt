 Anandiben said that only BJP elevated common party workers to top posts.
 
 Speaking of her entry into politics, Anandiben said, “I never thought of joining politics, but destiny and Narendrabhai brought me into politics in 1985-86 as BJP’s women morcha president. I worked for six years in that post.”
 
 Narrating her journey onwards in politics, Anandiben said, “I then became   MP and the party asked me to contest Mandal assembly in 1998. I won and became education minister and then contested from Patan and then from Ghatlodia. I became revenue and urban development minister and also handled the portfolio for roads and buildings. When Narendrabhai began the women & child development department, I received a chance to work there.”
 
 On her life before entering the political arena, Anandiben said, “I first planned to become a doctor, but could not become so. Then I planned to become a police officer and also passed the exams but could not join as my family did not want me in a transferable job. Then I planned to become a professor, but I did not have sufficient marks. Ultimately I joined as a teacher in Mohina Ba school, from where I took early retirement.”
