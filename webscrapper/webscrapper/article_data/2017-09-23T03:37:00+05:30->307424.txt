Colva: Commuters queuing up at ticket counters in KTCL’s Margao and Panaji terminuses, have being rueing the “tardy and sluggish” service offered by the state-run corporation on the Margao-Panaji shuttle route for close to fortnight now. Many say they’ve sometimes had to wait for over an hour for a bus to dock at the stand. 

 KTCL’s website mentions that standing in shuttle buses is not allowed. Yet, several passengers say they have been forced to travel the 45-minute distance standing if they are to reach their destinations on time. 
 
 The Margao-Panaji shuttle service, which attracts hundreds of citizens on a daily basis, sees a surge in demand during the morning and evening rush hours. Of late, queues of pass-holders and even longer queues of ticket-holders have become a common sight at peak hours, with the corporation failing to press extra buses into service. Staff at the ticket counters say there is no dearth of buses, pointing instead, to traffic control personnel for mismanaging deployment of the vehicles. The latter, in turn, put the onus on traffic jams along the route. 
 
 KTCL’s managing director Derrick Pereira Neto, says the problem has stemmed from an insufficient number of buses to service the constantly increasing passenger density. 
 
 “We are in the process of purchasing another 55 buses, and in two-three months, the issue will be resolved,” he said.
