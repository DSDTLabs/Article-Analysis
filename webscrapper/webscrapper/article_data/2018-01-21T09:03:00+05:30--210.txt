RAJKOT: Three   MLAs on Saturday demanded that government reopen the groundnut procurement centres in interest of the poor farmers who are suffering losses. These procurement centres that purchased groundnut at MSP of Rs 900 per 20kg were closed following complaints of malpractices.

 MLAs   (Visavadar), MLA   (Mangrol) and MLA   (Junagadh) demanded an FIR against those who were found indulging in malpractices at the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (Nafed) run groundnut procurement centres in Junagadh. Nafed closed three centres in   after probe found wrong doing by some traders and farmers. 
 
 The legislators submitted a memorandum listing their demands to the Junagadh collector. 
 
 “Government has blacklisted those cooperative societies where malpractices were found but want an FIR against the culprits who were found indulging in malpractices. Closing down the procurement centres because of a few corrupt people is injustice to farmers. Government should reopen these centres,” said Ribadia. 
 
 He alleged, “Traders put stone and soil inside the groundnut bags. This appears to be a very big scam.   members are engaged in this fraud and that is why no Congress cooperative society was given the work of procurement.” 
 
 The MLAs further demanded that government purchase groundnut from open market through auction at minimum support price (MSP).
