Panaji: Minna Pirhonen, mother of the murdered Swedish national, Felix Dahl, suspects that her son was murdered by a Goan person after being poisoned for money. Dahl, 22, was found dead under mysterious circumstances at Patnem, Canacona, on January 28, 2015. Pirhonen, in a press note, stated ‘We think Felix was poisoned and killed by the Goan man, or the Goan man was hired to bring Felix to his killers.’ She said that the reason for the killing might be one or several which include that ‘the Goan man wanted to steal Felix’s computer worth 1800 euros. The scammer and his friends paid the Goan to bring Felix to them because they wanted to prevent Felix from telling police or their relatives about their crimes or the beach workers paid the Goan to bring Felix back to Patnem because they wanted to teach him a lesson.’ ‘We think the circumstances around Felix’s death show that it was not a simple natural death, but a planned murder. It needs to be investigated,’ she stated. Pirhonen said Felix met a Canadian man at the Dabolim airport. ‘This man had an Asian background. He had no luggage and claimed it did not arrive with the flight. We believe he was sent to look for an easy target,’ she added.
