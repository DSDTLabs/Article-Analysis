PANAJI: A sketch of   fort prepared by the famed 19th century Portuguese illustrator and cartographer, Antonio Lopes Mendes will come handy for the reconstruction of its old façade, as the monument is set for a significant make over soon.

 After a couple of false starts, department of archives and archaeology ( ) has finally allotted the work to a private firm for restoration of the 17th century fort, which stands on the banks of the scenic Chapora river. 
 
 “The work will start this week to conserve and restore the fort. The façade will be recreated as per Lopes’ sketch and one of the bastions will also be restored,”  , assistant superintending archaeologist, DAA, said.
 
 The Alorna fort was built by Bhonsales of Sawantwadi in the 17th century. The Portuguese seized control here when Marquis of Castello Novo captured it in 1746.   across   from the north-eastern tip of   was then not under Portuguese reign. The Bhonsles were back in 1761 but on August 25, 1781, the Portuguese had recaptured it and Pernem taluka was also added as a new conquest.
 
 Located over 40 km from  , the local panchayat had been pleading with the government to turn its attention to the crumbling monument. A task force (TF) on forts constituted by the government about two decades back had in its report also suggested various conservation measures for better maintenance of the centuries-old citadels.
 
 The restoration is estimated to cost approximately Rs 67 lakh and is expected to enhance its appeal with the reconstruction of the façade. 
 
 A proposal to bring it under tourism circuit is likely to cheer up heritage lovers, as DAA plans to set up an information gallery at the fort.
