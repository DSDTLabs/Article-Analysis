New Delhi: Alleging that the NGT-appointed expert committee is biased, an Art of Living ( ) member said on Wednesday, “The report has been leaked to the media even as we were getting hold of our copy. This was expected of them as their mala fide intentions to malign us has been evident since the beginning.”

 The committee members “who were supposed to be non-interested parties to the case and were to act as the eyes and ears of judges have given biased interviews while the case is sub judice”, the AOL member said. However, its “head who was not even a technical person noticed that the figure of Rs 100-120 crore (which was recommended by the committee after one cursory visit to the site) did not have any scientific basis and requested the chairperson of NGT not to consider it”. 
 
 AOL also alleged that the petitioner was close to some committee members, though it “was not disclosed to us when the expert committee was appointed by NGT... We have been victims of a conspiracy. And we will fight for the truth to come out,” said Kedar Desai, AOL spokesperson. 
 
 “Our legal team will study the report and decide on the appropriate course of action,” the organisation said.
 
 Emphasising that AOL is a responsible and environment-sensitive NGO, Desai said, “We have never caused any damage to the environment but have in fact worked for preserving and reviving it through various environment-related projects over the years. Our legal team will study the report and decide on the appropriate future course of action.”
