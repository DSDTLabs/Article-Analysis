KOLKATA: The   has rectified their database for as many as 22 selected candidates out of the  . These 22 candidates will be given appointment letters, said board chairman   as TET candidates continued with their agitation on Tuesday. 

 The board will examine all the complaints and take decisions accordingly. Bhattacharya is also ready to show the OMR sheets, which were filled up by the candidates after clearing the TET.
 
 The board chairman, however, made it clear that the verification of the testimonials will continue even during the counselling. Students have been complaining that that they were asked to show their testimonials for scrutiny even after they were selected in the interview after showing the same.
 
 The district primary education councils were asking for the testimonials because there was a mismatch between the data sent to them by the board and the testimonials that candidates produced during counselling.
 
 For instance, in North 24 Parganas and  , some of the selected candidates, who claimed to have applied under the general category, were clubbed under the para-teacher category according to the panel supplied by the board. DPECs then asked these candidates to make an application to the board for verification of the OMR sheets they had filled in. "We are in the midst of the verification process. I assure to take care of the genuine grievances. But nothing can be done in cases where testimonials do not match the OMR sheet data," Bhattacharya said.
