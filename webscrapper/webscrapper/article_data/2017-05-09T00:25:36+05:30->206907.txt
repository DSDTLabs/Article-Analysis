Master blaster Sachin   says 'Sachin: A Billion Dreams' helped him revisit the key moments of his life and share them with his fans, who have been an important part of his journey. 

 The movie chronicles the 44-year-old cricket icon's journey from a young boy to one of the most celebrated sportsmen of all time.
 
 "This film has helped me relive the important moments of my life through its making. I remain a private person but realised that there is much I have not revealed or spoken about to those who have been instrumental to my life and career, especially the fans.
 
 "I hope the film will be yet another avenue for fans who have showered their love and blessings on me to cherish the journey that we undertook together for over 24 years," Tendulkar told reporters at a promotional event here. 
 
 The film, directed by  , also features fellow team members such as M S   and   offering their insights into Tendulkar's life and legacy. 
 
 Erskine, who is known for directing several award-winning films on sports, says it was an honour for him to bring alive the story of a sports legend like Tendulkar. 
 
 "Directing the film was a wonderful experience. Coming from the UK, I knew that   was a cricketing legend but, even then, it was an eye-opener to see the adoration and respect that Sachin commands across the globe. 
 
 Erskine says he interacted with Tendulkar, his family and other cricketers to get an insight into his life. 
 
 "Sachin is both gracious and a perfectionist, and being able to make this film for the Indian people and many more across the globe was a true honour," he says. 
 
 A. R.   has given music for the film which is set to release on May 26.
