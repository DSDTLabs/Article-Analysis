RANCHI: Traders under the newly formed district unit of Simdega Chamber of Commerce on Saturdat protested against the transfer of deputy commissioner  . Shops and market remained closed as most of the traders joined the  . 

 Singh was transferred and posted as registrar of   with additional charge of Jharkhand State Cooperative Bank Limited administrator through a government notification late on Friday. He was replaced   Limited managing director Manju Nath Bhajantri, who earlier served as the DC in the adjoining Lohardaga district.
 
 Though movement of traffic remained normal in the district, the closure of shops and market had an impact on life. Vikas Agrawal, a loca trader, said the government's decision to transfer Singh in less than two years of his tenure did not go down well with the masses. "When some officer wants to deliver in a district like Simdega, which has always been considered a less motivating district, the government should allow them to work properly," he said. 
 
 Another trader, Ajay Sarawgi, member of the Simdega Chamber of Commerce, said crime rate had fallen significantly and the DC had was always available to the common man. "We had an opportunity to convey our grievances to him at the Janta Durbar and most of them were adressed properly," he said. 
 
 Simdega SP Rajiv Ranjan Singh said the bandh was limited to shops and market remaining closed during the day. "There were some protests by the traders and they closed their establishments, but in general there was no bandh," he said. When asked about Janta Durbar being organised in past, Singh said the police and civil administration on several occasions have organised public meetings to imbibe a sense of confidence and security amonfg the people of the district, which has otherwise been affected with Left-wing extremism in the past.
