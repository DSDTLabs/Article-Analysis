CHENNAI: The Madras   is set to induct seven new judges, whose names the Union   has cleared. The judge-designates are scheduled to write their name in Devanagari   on Tuesday, as required by law. 

 They are expected to complete the procedure in the presence of   Indira Banerjee on Tuesday.
 
 Originally, the names of 11 lawyers were recommended for elevation by the collegium headed by the then Madras high court Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Koul on December 19, 2016. Of these, nine were cleared by the apex court collegium in December 2017.
 
 The ministry has now invited seven of the nine — Subramanium Prasad (additional advocate-general for Tamil Nadu in the apex court), P T Asha, Ilavazhagan, Saravanan, Anand Venkatesh, Nirmal Kumar and Ramaswamy — to sign their names in Devangari script, which precedes release of their warrants of appointment.
 
 Two other names on the list of nine — additional public prosecutor Emiliyas and Senthil Kumar — have not been cleared so far, without any reason being assigned. There are at least two other candidates, whose names had also been delinked from their respective lists and decision deferred by the apex court, are awaiting clearance.
 
 With the appointment of the seven new  , the sitting strength of judges in the high court will increase from 56 to 63, against a total sanctioned strength of 75.
 
 The latest list has been delayed by more than a year due to unforeseen developments in the apex court, including an open revolt and a press conference by four senior judges led by Justice J Chalameshwar. It also got stuck due to a tug of war between the apex court and the Centre over the memorandum of procedure in appointing new judges.
 
  Bar leaders expect disposal of cases to pick up pace when the court reopens after summer recess on June 4.
