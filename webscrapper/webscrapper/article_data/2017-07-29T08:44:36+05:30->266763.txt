JHANSI: Advanced   from   will participate in 'Tank Biathlon' in   to be held from July 29 to August 12. 

 Around two dozen countries, including China, Israel and South Africa, are participating in the event, which is being conducted as part of International Army Games to be held at Alabino Range in Russia. A tank biathlon is a mechanised military sport developed by the Russian military. 
 
 The Army Games will have 28 events to be jointly organised in Russia, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and China. 
 
 The   team has been participating in the competition since 2014. The team stood sixth in 2016 out of the 17 countries that participated in the event. 
 
 This year, the team would participate with T-90 tanks which have been shipped to Russia on July 20.
 
 A senior army official said that the competition involves firing by tanks on the move by conventional machine guns and anti-tank projectiles from a range of 2 km and negotiating rugged obstacles. The competition simulates actual battle field conditions involving driving at high-speed and entails switching from one mode of operation to another at a fast pace, which requires mental agility and exceptional phys ical fitness and training, he added.
 
 He said that the team has been selected after a rigorous selection process on the basis of technical expertise, physical fitness, mental endurance and consistency in accuracy of firing the tank weapons while driving the tanks through a replica of the original range in Russia. 
 
 The practice sessions were held at Babina field firing range near Jhansi.
