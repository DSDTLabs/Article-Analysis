Jaipur: Ancient   at Choti and Badi Chaupar, which were demolished for the construction of underground Metro stations, will be restored soon. Jaipur Metro Rail Corporation (JMRC) has awarded the work to Amer Development and Management Authority (ADMA) to restore these heritage structures in the Walled City area. “We have transferred the money in ADMA’s account to restore these structures. The agency has already begun restoration work at Choti Chaupar,” said Ashwani Saxena, project director, JMRC.

 Taking a cue from foreign countries, JMRC will develop museums at underground Metro stations in the Walled City area. Old items found during digging in and around the Walled City area will be displayed at these museums. The rail corporation will also restore stepwells at the chaupars and cover them with glass, for residents to see the original forms, as they were during ancient period. 
 
 “Historically, the chaupars were outlets for social use with water structures connected by underground aqueducts, supplying numerous sources of drinking water at street level. Before digging, the centre of each chaupar had square enclosures with ornamental fountains,” an official said.
 
 “While digging at Choti Chaupar, we found a stepwell that had been constructed during ancient times. We decided to restore this site and open it for the public ,” he added.
 
 As per the reports, the project called for deconstructing Badi and Choti Chaupar which then had to be restored to their original condition. All this will be done under the supervision of state Department of Archaeology and Museums and JMRC will ensure that the original look is retained.
 
 The restoration work will be completed by August 2018. The three-level stations will also be completed around the same time. “After Choti Chaupar, the restoration work of Badi Chaupar will start. The work was hampered due to delay in felling of trees. Now, the trees have been removed and the work would begin soon,” the official said.
