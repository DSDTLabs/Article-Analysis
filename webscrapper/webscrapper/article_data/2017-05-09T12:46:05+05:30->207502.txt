 CHANDIGARH: After school buses, auto-rickshaws ferrying schoolchildren are under the scanner. While the state transport authority ( ) has already started inspections, the Chandigarh Commission for Protection of Child Rights is also planning to begin their inspection from Tuesday.The aim is to discourage autos from ferrying schoolchildren beyond the permitted limit.

 “We are checking autos since last week for overloading and other violations. On Monday, eights vehicles were challaned. Main violation was overloading. Autos can ferry a maximum of four children while minivans as per the seats in the vehicle,“ said  , additional secretary, STA.
 
 The commission will begin inspections from   at 7.30am, sources said. City-based advocate   had written to the commission to take action against overloaded autos in August 2016.He sent repeated emails thereafter to know what action has been taken. He again wrote an e-mail on April 20 asking about the action taken.
 
 TOI has also repeatedly carried reports of school children in the city being subjected to unsafe rides with parents and schools with state transport authority and the traffic police turning a blind eye towards the problem. Despite the ban, auto rickshaws continue to ferry much more than the prescribed number of schoolchildren. It is common to see students sitting in front with the driver and hanging out from the back and sides of autos.
 
 On April, the commission along with traffic and STA officials had inspected school buses.
