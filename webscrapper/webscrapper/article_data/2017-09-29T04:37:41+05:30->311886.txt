New Delhi:   came out in support of   secretary Ashwani Kumar, who has been under fire from AAP government allegedly for non-performance, and slammed Delhi CM   for harassing “sincere officers” on Thursday.

 This comes days after Burari MLA Sanjeev Jha accused Kumar of delaying several projects, including setting up of CCTVs, and trying to benefit certain private companies. Jha wrote to the CM demanding action against the secretary.
 
 Hitting out at the CM, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari said, “On the one hand, Kejriwal favours and protects dishonest officers like Rajender Kumar. On the other hand, he is trying to obstruct transparent development work being carried out by sincere officers like Ashwani Kumar.”
 
 The government has accused Kumar of purposely delaying its work, including redesigning of roads, a pet project of the PWD minister Satyendar Jain. He has been pulled up by a Delhi assembly committee for delay in sanctioning projects related to road repairs. Tiwari said that AAP government is harassing Kumar who has being working for the city’s development.
