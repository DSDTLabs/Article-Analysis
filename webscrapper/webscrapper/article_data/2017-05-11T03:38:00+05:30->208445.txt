Panaji: Expressing concern over the financial strength of the Goa Urban Cooperative Bank, the newly elected Anil Gaunekar-led panel said it would focus on returning the bank to its profitable ways.

 “The mining ban hit the bank’s finances. There is a need to resolve the non-performing assets (NPA) crisis to get the bank back on track,” Gaunekar, who is expected to be the financial institution’s chairman, said.
 
 The Gaunekar-led panel won the Goa Urban Cooperative Bank election by 5:4. Three candidates of the Govind Kamat-led panel managed to clock win, while another was elected unopposed. Results were declared late Tuesday night at Curti. 
 
 “Advances to the mining sector were adversely affected due to the erstwhile ban on the activity. Recovery was hampered, too. The gross NPAs as of March 2016 were 18%. This position needs improvement. Advances have to go up. If we lend to some good sectors, the percentage will improve,” Shivaji Bhangui, one of the bank’s new directors, said.
 
 According to the new panel, the bank will focus on improving its business mix, while also bringing in professional management. Digitalization is also expected to receive major focus.
 
 “We have to explore the larger model of banking. The bank has a robust base but we want business to go up, and also want earnings to improve,” Bhangui said.
