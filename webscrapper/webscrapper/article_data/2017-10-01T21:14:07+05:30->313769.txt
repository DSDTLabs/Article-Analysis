Agra: A fortnight after the cantonment board dismantled unauthorized mobile towers from the cantt area for posing a threat to defence establishment, telecom operation were again found operating out of the military sensitive area.   There are six unauthorized towers in the cantonment area of Agra, according to cantonment board.    In his written complaint to the police, board’s CEO Venkat Narasimha Reddy has asked them to file an FIR against mobile operators and property owners on whose land the towers have been set up. TOI had earlier reported about the menace, caused by unauthorized towers in the cantonment.    Speaking with TOI, CEO Reddy said, “We had disconnected the power cord of the tower and even dismantled two mobile towers, but private mobile network companies in collusion with property owners in the cantonment area have reinstalled the towers on private building rooftops and are posing a threat to military establishment.    “These companies are behaving as if they are above the law. They are illegally operating in the cantonment area,” he added.    Reddy said, “Last month, I wrote to police and marked copy to Army station headquarters, Agra, to take legal action against the mobile operators and property owners but nothing happened. Iam sending a reminder again in this regard.”    DSP and circle officer Udairaj Singh said, “We are yet to receive the complaint from CEO. Once they send a written complaint, we will file an FIR against all the persons concerned who are violating norms and risking the security of the cantonment area.”    Bir Bahadur Singh, coordinator of Voice of Ex-servicemen Society, Agra Cantonment, said, “The cellular companies have paid good amount of bribe to cantonment board engineers, otherwise no one can dare to disobey the orders of the CEO. These towers installed on rooftops of private properties are posing a threat to locals as well.”
