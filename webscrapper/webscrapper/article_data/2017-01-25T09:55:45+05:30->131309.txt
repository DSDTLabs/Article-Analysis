ALLAHABAD:   (Krishna Patel faction) would go it alone in 150 selected constituencies from across the state. The party would release the lists of candidates on January 26 and 27.

 Party’s national vice president Pallavi Patel made an announcement to this effect on Tuesday. The party has decided to field candidates in the 13 Kurmi dominated constituencies in Allahabad, neighbouring Kaushambi and Pratapgarh. On three seats, Pallavi Patel faction would be in direct contest with the Anupriya Patel faction. 
 
 She said the party would not form an alliance with any political party. Pallavi also came down heavily on   (RSS) chief   for his statement on review of reservation policy. 
 
 “There are 26 crore other backward castes (OBCs) and Dalits in the state and his comments and also those of Union minister of state VK Singh come as a blow for these deprived classes. Quota is not given to us as alms (bheekh) but it is our right,” said Pallavi Patel.
 
 She said, “RSS raises the issue of reservation just before elections which shows that they use Dalits and OBCs as a tool to garner votes from upper castes. Apna Dal will have to take to the streets if RSS and BJP leaders continue their rant on reservations.”
 
 Commenting on whether there was any similarity in the infighting within   and that of Apna Dal, she said there was no comparison. “We have ideological differences as Anupriya Patel has compromised with the ideals of party. But the Samajwadi Party’s infighting was for political power,” she added.
 
 She claimed that there is no issue of symbol in Apna Dal also. “The Election Commission has not alloted a permanent symbol to us. In  , Anupriya Patel contested on a symbol of cup-plate while at other constituencies, the symbol was given to  ,” she added.
