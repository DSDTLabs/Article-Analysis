JODHPUR: Condition of cows at Asia’s largest gaushala and its branches spread in Jalore and Sirohi districts continues to raise concern. The death toll at these gaushalas, badly affected by the recent unprecedented rains, crossed 900 and counting. Water from Jalore’s   had entered these gaushalas after it was damaged early this week due to heavy rains in Sanchore. 

 According to controller of Pathmeda, Punam Singh Rajpurohit, the deluge led to flooding of the   shelters and damaged its basic infrastructure. The stored fodder has been destroyed. “The total loss is yet to be ascertained but it must be in crores,” said Rajpurohit adding 3,000 more cows are battling for life and entire staff of the gaushalas and cow-loving volunteers endeavouring hard to save them. On the other hand, the gaushalas is badly in need of fodder, medicines and other resources but government is yet to act despite the ministers having visited these gaushala and experienced the loss and death of cows.
 
 According to him, about 150 more cows reportedly died on Friday at different gaushalas in Jalore due to sickness and hunger caused by flood.
