CHENNAI:India has doubled its   and loans to   from Rs 75 crore in the revised estimates for 2017-18 to Rs 150 crore in the latest budget.

 The increase in grants to Sri Lanka comes against the backdrop of China expanding its role in the island nation. Recently, while in Kanyakumari, defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman spoke warily about China not restricting itself to the development of Hambantota port. “Whether China will confine itself to only port activities in Hambantota remains to be seen and I do not want to say anything further,” she said.
 
 Foreign affairs experts say that India and Sri Lanka had agreed to several projects in the island nation during the visit of Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe last year and the increased allocation was a follow-up to the agreements. “During the Lankan PM's visit, development of Trincomalee oil storage tank farm and other developmental projects came up. The extra allocation must be to fulfil these commitments,” said Sri Lankan affairs expert Col (retd) R Hariharan.
 
 Afghanistan, which received increased grants and loans in the last few years, has seen its allocation come down by Rs 25 crore. While the war-torn country received Rs 350 crore in the 2017-18 budget and revised estimates, this will be reduced to Rs 325 crore.
 
 Nepal continues to be the most favoured nation based on the volume of allocation. While in 2017-18, the Himalayan kingdom received Rs 1,779.07 crore in grants and Rs 800.67 crore as loan, in the next financial year, the country will be getting Rs 1,813.50 crore in grants and Rs 836.50 crore as loan. The budget has also increased money to Seychelles and to the Chabahar port in Iran. Seychelles has received a bonanza this year as the grant has increased from Rs 200 crore in the current year to Rs 300 crore in the next financial year.
