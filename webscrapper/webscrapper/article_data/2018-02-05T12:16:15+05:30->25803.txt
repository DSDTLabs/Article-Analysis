PATNA: The   was finally aborted at the   (AIIMS)-Patna on Saturday. Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh of the Patna high court had passed the order in this regard after marathon hearing till 10pm on Wednesday. Generally, termination of 24-week pregnancy is not permitted under the law. 

 Head of the   department, Dr Hemali Sinha, said the 16-year-old Miss AB (the victim’s alias as per the court order) is physically well after the medical  . 
 
 Dr Sinha told this newspaper that the girl was depressed when she had come to the hospital with her parents after the court order. “She has been fighting to get justice, running around and going to court. It is only natural that she was depressed. She has been undergoing counselling at the hospital. It is up to her to decide if she wants to receive further counselling after being released from the hospital or not. At present, she is stable and will be released in a day or two, depending on how fast she recovers,” said Dr Sinha. 
 
 AIIMS-P sources said the medical abortion was complicated as safe abortion is feasible only till 10 weeks of pregnancy. In this case, the abortion was conducted by augmenting and accelerating the labour with the help of a combination of drugs just like in a normal delivery.
 
 Sources said the rape survivor was first examined on January 13 by a medical board of   (PMCH), which had ruled out the medical termination of her pregnancy by citing the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act. On Justice Singh’s further order on January 23, an eight-member AIIMS-Patna team examined her and found the fetus normal. The team also suggested the termination of pregnancy through medicines and the court allowed it.
