Panaji: Goa-based National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) has invited applications for shrimp farmers, brackish aquaculture farmers and aquatic microbiology lab assistants, who will be trained in a skill development programme in aquaculture. The programme, which is open to unemployed youth, particularly Class X and XII dropouts, will provide hands-on-training in different fields of aquaculture technologies. Faculty for the course will be drawn from the vast multi-disciplinary expertise of NIO, local institutions, farms, agriculture skill councils and organisations with whom NIO has an active MoU.  Depending upon the number of applicants, the selection process will comprise entrance tests and interviews which would judge the general aptitude of the candidates. As part of the programme, students will undergo theoretical lessons at NIO, Dona Paula. Applicable National Occupational Standards (NOS) as specified for each qualification packs by the Agriculture Skill Council of India (ASCI) will be followed. The medium of instruction of the course will be English, but if there are several participants speaking only in their native language, translation would be provided. Certificates will be issued by the ASCI. Dates of commencement of the courses and their duration are yet to be announced. Constituting about 6.30% of the global fish production and 5% of global trade, India today has attained the status of the second largest fish producing and second largest aquaculture nation in the world.  The development of human resources, both in quality and quantity, is pivotal to sustaining the aquaculture industry in the new millennium, especially so, in the climate of changing paradigms affecting the sector.
