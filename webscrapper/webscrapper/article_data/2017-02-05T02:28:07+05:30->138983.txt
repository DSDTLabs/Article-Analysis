Vasco: The port town witnessed some tense scenes on election day, with party workers allowing their enthusiasm to get the best of them. Skirmishes were reported at Sada and in the heart of Vasco town, with anxious moments witnessed at Zuarinagar too, prompting CISF and Goa police to intervene.

 “Soon after polling closed in the Mormugao constituency and election staff left the area, there was a clash between supporters of arch rivals, BJP candidate Milind Naik and Congress candidate Sankalp Amonkar, at Sada junction,” South Goa district collector Swapnil Naik said.
 
 Sources said Amonkar staged a rally from Baina, while Naik led a victory rally from Sada. When both groups met at Sada junction, tempers and egos took centrestage, and in the chaos that followed, a supporter of Naik is reported to have assaulted Prashant Manjrekar, a supporter of Amonkar. Manjrekar was seriously injured and received four stitches on his forehead. He was later shifted to Goa medical college and hospital, Bambolim. 
 
 According to sources, earlier in the day, a presiding officer was also threatened by supporters of a party, but there was no official statement to confirm the incident. 
 
 BJP and Congress supporters were seen wandering around St Andrew's High School, Vasco, and CISF officials had a tough time dispersing the crowd. Extra policemen were deployed in Sada and police vehicles were patrolling Baina and Sada all evening.
