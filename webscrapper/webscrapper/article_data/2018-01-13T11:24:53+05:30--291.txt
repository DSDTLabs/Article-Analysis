COIMBATORE: After the RS Puram (B2) police station won the ministry of home affairs’ award for the best police station in the country, the police department has decided to spruce up the   police station and make it a citizen-friendly facility.

 A meeting convened by deputy commissioner of police (law&order) S Lakshmi on Thursday, attended by assistant commissioner of police (law&order-south sub-division) R Rameshkrishnan and other officers, also decided to upgrade one police station in each sub-division in the city. “I instructed them to solve the pending cases and advised them to keep the station premises clean. We plan to upgrade some infrastructure here. Not only this station, all the police stations will be made citizen-friendly and waiting halls for visitors will be set up,” Lakshmi told TOI.
 
 At the Podanur facility, the law & order police station as well as the traffic police station is functioning on the ground floor of the building. The crime police station and the Perur all women police station, which comes under the Coimbatore rural police, is functioning on the first floor. However, the office of the assistant commissioners of police (ACPs- law& order and crime) is located in some other place at Podanur.
 
 According to a recent proposal sent by the south sub-division police officers to the commissioner of police, the law & order police station and office of the assistant commissioner of police (law&order) should be functioning in one building and the crime police station and the office of the ACP (crime) should be in another building. The officers also want the Perur all women police station to be shifted to the office of the present ACPs office near the   at Podanur.
 
 After winning the prestigious award, in a meeting with deputy commissioners Lakshmi, P Perumal (crime),   (traffic) and   (headquarters), police commissioner   had laid out plans to develop infrastructure at other stations also.
