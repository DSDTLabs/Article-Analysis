MYSURU: Chief minister Siddaramaiah on Tuesday claimed the charges against his son Dr   are false and politically motivated.

 Siddaramaiah, who held a janata darshan at his residence in  , later told reporters the complaint with the income-tax department that his son was involved in benami transactions is false and baseless.
 
 Just two days ago, Varthur   filed the complaint with the I-T department that Yathindra had gone on several foreign trips for investments.
 
 Siddaramaiah said Yathindra had accompanied him during his recent foreign tour. “That's the first time he has come on a foreign tour with me. There is no truth to the charge that he has invested in businesses in a foreign country. I don't know the person who has filed the complaint or who is spreading false information,“ he said.
 
 The CM remained silent on the is sue of   senior leader and former MP A H Vishwanath, who had rebelled against the state leadership.
 
 “The Congress high command, which is closely monitoring the developments, will take a final decision regarding A H Vishwanath. Neither has he communicated with me nor have I spoken to him. Moreover, I will also not convince him not to leave the party. The high command will decide whether my attitude is right or wrong.I won't speak on this issue,“ he said.
