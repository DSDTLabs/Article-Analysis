HYDERABAD : The Telangana government may have created a record by unfurling the largest tricolour in the country, but is now finding the task of maintaining it cumbersome and a drain on finances.

 On state foundation day on June 2, 2016, the TRS government hoisted the largest national flag in terms of width (108x72 inch) at  . A year-and-half later, the flag had to be replaced 35 times after it got torn due to unfavourable weather. And at a cost of 1.12 lakh per flag,   ( ) that was entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining the tricolour has spent over 40 lakh in multiple replacements.
 
 Starved of funds to maintain the flag, HMDA is now looking for financial support from the state government. Apart from procuring flags, an agency has been engaged for regular maintenance work.
 
  
 “Earlier, the authority wrote to the state government to provide funds for maintaining the flag, but the government is yet to reply,” a senior HMDA official said.
 
 Initially, the Roads and Buildings (R&B) department maintained the flag for a month. Later, it was handed over to HMDA for maintenance as  , where the flag post is located, comes under its jurisdiction. The flag tore within a week after it was first unfurled by the chief minister and immediately replaced. Later, an agency was roped in to take care of the flag.
 
 To reduce maintenance cost, HMDA chose a Khammam-based Philvex   over a Dubai-based firm due to low cost. While the Khammam firm pegged its fee at 1.12 lakh per flag, the Dubai based firm quoted 3.2 lakh per flag.
 
 “Although it costs more, the Dubai-based firm flag can withstand strong winds. Besides, it has a ultraviolet coating that prevents fading. However, it weighs more than the Khammam flag,” another senior official of HMDA said.
 
 Meanwhile, beautification and security work, including a grille around the flag were taken up at a cost of 50 lakh. Landscaping work was also taken up, an engineering official said.
