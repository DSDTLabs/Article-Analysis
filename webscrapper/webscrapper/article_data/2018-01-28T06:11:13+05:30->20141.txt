AHMEDABAD: While Indian   is admired by people across the globe, little does one know about the contribution of   in Indian classical music. Noted journalist and writer,  , recounted the contribution of various women musicians across the Indian subcontinent, in the formation and sustenance of Indian classical music at a talk ‘Dhwaniyon ke Aalok Mein Stree’ organized by Swaraalay music academy at Sabarmati Ashram on Saturday.

 “Professional women musicians – courtesans have a vast contribution towards the formation of   classical and semi-classical music. Most of these women who unfortunately went unmentioned even by their gurus – Ustads – continued to practise music which has kept it alive today,” said Pande.
 
 She referred to a number of women musicians such as Gauhar Jaan, Begum Akhtar, Mogubai, Kurdikar and  , among others and said, “During those days, when gender discrimination was at its peak against women, these women singers might have made lot of money and had achieved fame, but they never got the social respect they deserved. Yet, they continued to keep the lamp of music burning.”
 
 According to Pande, music is something that flows and constantly reinvents itself. “However, to be able to reinvent, one cannot practise music as a hobby undertaken in free time. It requires devotion and concentration – it’s like an all-consuming practice,” she added.
 
 Pande also recounted the various landmarks in history that paved way for the recognition of several women musicians. This included the decision by BV Keskar, the Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting, in 1952 who overturned a 1946-order that debarred women singers who were tawaifs or courtesans, from singing for the all India Radio.
