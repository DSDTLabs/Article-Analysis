Coimbatore: M  , 45, was a happy person on Monday as she received the one-gram   from the commissioner for municipal administration G Prakash for collecting 190kg of dry waste, maximum for the week in ward number 100 that comprises Kurichi housing unit Phase II area. 

 Palaniammal is a contracted worker and was employed five years ago. “But since 2013, we have been segregating the waste. I just love this job and my aim is to keep my city clean,” she said. Her supervisor E Kaliappan said that she was the most hardworking among the 48 workers of which 13 were permanent employees. “She has successfully achieved 100% source segregation in her area and is extremely hard working. She works even after her duty time and whenever I go on inspection, I have noticed that even the road side bins in her wards are so clean,” he said.
 
 Palaniammal who has worked as house- keeping was hesitant to take up this job in the beginning as a sanitary worker. “My family was upset that I had to do this and clean up garbage. But once I understood the concept of segregation and Kaliappan sir’s awareness programmes and guidance have motivated me to do better every week,” she said. She also added that this success did not belong to her alone as her colleague Vasantha equally contributed. “Two workers are responsible for each push cart and she helps me equally,” she said.
