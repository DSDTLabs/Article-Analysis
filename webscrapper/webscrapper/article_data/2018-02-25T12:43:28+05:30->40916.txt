At a time when Dalit agitation is at its peak, retired IAS officer, Pravin K Gadhvi, narrated the tale of   and how it originated in Gujarati literature. He addressed a talk on ‘Dalit Sahitya in Gujarati literature’ organized by Gujarati Book Club and Karma Foundation, in Ahmedabad on Saturday.

 “The peculiarity of Dalit literature is that it was initiated by Dalits themselves, narrating their plight amid rampant discrimination and issues such as untouchability they faced. It depicts not just their plight but also their quest for equality. In India, it initially began after the death of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar. Dalits – particularly mill owners and workers – began singing hymns and praises in his name as a tribute to Ambedkar,” said Gadhvi, talking to TOI. 
 
 Speaking specifically about Gujarati literature, Gadhvi said, “It actually began in the late 1970s, when people began penning poetries and short stories and proses to describe what they faced. These were mainly blank verses and not formalized works. The main inspiration behind   in Gujarati literature was works in Marathi literature. Right from novels to short stories to poems to even ballads, it was visible in various forms.”
 
 Gadhvi himself has penned several poetries and short stories on Dalit community highlighting various issues. He also spoke of various other poets including Sahil Parmar, Raman Vaghela and Neerav Patel, among others.
 
 “A turning point came when there were major revolutions for reservation in 1981 and 1988. Eventually, it gained significant traction, so much so, that it is recognized by various literary academies including the Sahitya Academy,” he added.
 
 The retired IAS officer also touched upon the present socio-political scenario in Gujarat and said agitations are a reflection of social dissent and it is at such times there is scope for literature to grow.
