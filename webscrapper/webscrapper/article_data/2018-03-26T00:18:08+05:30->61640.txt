Pune: The civic administration will pilot the new parking policy on five roads after due consultation with the traffic police department. The policy was approved on Saturday by the general body of Pune Municipal Corporation with six suggestions including one to do away with a plan for charges to park on the road between 10pm and 8am.  The basic document of the policy that was approved by the standing committee, had contained the suggestion for night parking charges. The suggestion attracted sharp criticism from NCP, Congress, MNS and Shiv Sena, which claimed that it would increase the financial burden on citizens.  The five roads will feature the new pay and park service. A proposal was also tabled to constitute a committee comprising the mayor, deputy mayor, leaders of the parties in the PMC and heads of departments to conduct a detailed study of the six suggestions. The committee will submit its report in six months. However, certain elected members from the BJP opted out of the committee. “We have approved the proposal. Selection of the five roads is next on the cards. The civic officials will consult the traffic police department on this,” said Shreenath Bhimale, leader of the house in PMC. “A committee of traffic police and PMC officials will be formed to select the roads. They will set the parameters for selection and the PMC will enact the new policy on those roads,” he said, adding that a fresh review of the proposal will be carried out, since it was cleared with new suggestions. “It will be communicated to citizens,” he said. The BJP, which stormed to power in the PMC with a majority a little over a year ago, had tabled the policy before the general body on Friday, for discussion and approval, only three days after the standing committee had greenlit the plan. The discussions, which lasted well into the night, finally ended in the approval of the policy and its six suggestions around 1.20am on Saturday.
