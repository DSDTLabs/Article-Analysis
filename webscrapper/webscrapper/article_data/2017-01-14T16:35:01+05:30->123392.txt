KOLHAPUR:   have appealed to citizens not to use the Chinese ‘maanja’ or the razor-sharp string used for flying kites for the   on Saturday.

 Chetan Kokatnur, member of non-government organisation (NGO) – Inside Nature – said that these sharp strings can prove life-threatening to birds.
 
 “This is the season for various migratory birds to arrive in different parts of the city. The killer thread, however, can play spoilsport for these birds. We witness many birds receive serious wounds and sometimes even deaths because of the  . The injuries are mainly caused as the birds get stuck in the maanja on some tree or during kite flying,” Kokatnur said.
 
 Areas like Jayanti nullah are known for scavengers like kites and Town Hall area is known for bats. 
 
 Kokatnur said that citizens who wish to fly their kites from the terrace of their apartments are likely to cause more damage to the birds. The kites and the maanja get stuck in the old trees, especially in the main city area, where scavengers have nested.
 
 He said that the main solution to the problem is to use simple cotton thread, which is thicker. “These threads can be easily removed and don’t have much strength and so may not injure the birds too much,” the environmentalist said.
 
 If a bird’s wings are damaged then they suffer permanent injury and the bird will eventually die, Kokatnur added.
 
 Pramod Shitole, who is the part of these activities with Inside Nature, said that he has been delivering lectures across the city colleges about how birds are injured because of flying kites and how it can be avoided.
 
 “Many of the students have come forward to be part of this activity and we will be look into the complaints about bird injuries during this festival,” he said.
