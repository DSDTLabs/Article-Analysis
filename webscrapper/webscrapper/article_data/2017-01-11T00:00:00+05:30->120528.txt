The next time you are on a beach and miss your daily workout, try this form of yoga, which tests stability and posture like none other. It is not fun and gives you freedom, but also also pushes you to be in better control of your poses. The possibility of falling gives you an adrenaline rush, while helping you get over the fear of doing so. If you do fall, you are forced to overcome the setback, climb back on to your board and try again — which is a valuable life lesson. Also, since the platform is unstable, you have to engage your core for better balance, leading to a toned midriff. What should also encourage you take up this form of yoga is that since it’s done over water, the soothing sounds will help you relax.
The quicker you feel OK with falling in the water, the better you will feel and the easier this yoga will become.
