KOLKATA: A childless elderly couple were found dead at a guesthouse near   temple on Saturday morning, suspected to have taken their lives by consuming poison. 

 The police are finding it difficult to contact any close relative to hand them over the bodies after postmortem because the couple had checked into the guesthouse by providing a   address, where they no longer lived. They reportedly sold the house two years ago.
 
 A source said 78-year-old Subrata   and wife Kakan (72) checked into   on T H   at Dakshineswar on Friday evening. "The couple came to our hotel around 8.30pm and checked into Room 5. They said they would offer puja at the Kali temple early on Saturday. Our staffers knocked on their room door around 6am but did not get any response. It was locked from inside. We then called the police," a guesthouse employee said. 
 
 A   police team arrived at the lodge and broke open the door to find the couple dead on the bed. The bodies were sent to Kamarhati Sagore Dutta Medical College and Hospital where they were confirmed dead. 
 
 The police said the ID cards that the couple showed at the guesthouse while checking in showed the address as 11A/1B/ 2, Brajendralal Ganguly Lane, Charu Market. Going by the address they found in the boarders' register, the cops from the Belghoria police station contacted their counterparts at Charu Market police station to get details of the couple and to contact their family members. That is when the police learnt from the neighbours that the Niyogis sold off their house two years ago. The residents said the couple were avid travellers to pilgrimage spots across the country. 
 
 "Initial probe showed the two were childless. We managed to trace some distant relatives but are yet to find anyone close who could claim their bodies," said Dhrubajyoti De, DCP Zone II, Barrackpore Commissionerate. He added they suspected the couple consumed poison but were waiting for the autopsy report.
