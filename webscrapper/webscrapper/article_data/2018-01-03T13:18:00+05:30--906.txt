CHANDRAPUR: With water crises looming large over city,   (CMC) has decided to curtail the water supply in city by half by mid January. Chandrapur   has closed down three of its power generation units as a crisis management measure following low water storage in the Irai dam. 

  has received only 53% of total rainfall and water level in Irai dam is only 203.125m. With just over 30% of water left in the dam, both Mahageco and CMC officers are under pressure to survive the crisis. “We have held three rounds of meetings and bowing to our request, CSTPS has closed down three of its generation units. The situation is going to worsen if water level in dam goes further down. We have planned curtailment of water supply by 50%. There will be alternate day water supply from mid January,” said city commissioner  . 
 
 He informed that presently there is 41mm3 water in Irai dam. CSTPS requires 7.5mm3 water per month. By closing down three units, the authorities have curtailed their water usage to 5mm3. “We still want CSTPS to close down one more unit to ensure water supply to city till June,” Kakde said.
 
 Severe water crisis will set in when water level in dam will reach 202mm3. Both CSTPS and CMC will be able to draw water from dam till water reaches to the level of 198mm3 in dam. Anticipating the crisis, CMC have already made arrangements of 10 pumps to bring the water to the jackwell in dam during coming days. 
 
 Kakde said that the water requirement of Chandrapur city is mere 1mm3 per month. With 50% curtailment, the city will need only 0.5mm3 water in a month. If only 3mm3 water could be spared in the dam for CMC, then Chandrapur can survive the water crisis. District collector Ashutosh Salil said that he is well aware of crisis situation and will not hesitate to order closure of power plant if situation requires.
