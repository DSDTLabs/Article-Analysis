TRICHY: Frustrated with frequent   and irregular voltage fluctuations in the vicinity of Andanallur and Manikandam panchayats, villagers laid siege to the office of assistant engineer,   (TNEB) in Allithurai on Wednesday. The protesters claimed that TNEB officials were not paying heeds to the grievances raised by them about the irregularity in power supply.

 About 40 panchayats in and around Andanallur and Manikandam have been facing frequent power outages for the past few months, villagers said. With the agrarian hamlets relying on borewells to irrigate the paddy, banana and vegetable crops, frequent outages are affecting the yield in cultivable lands, they added. Besides, voltage drop and outage during night hours were said to be quite common in the hamlets around Allithurai at least once a week. Meanwhile, officials from TNEB,   regional office rushed to the Allithurai TNEB office to pacify the protesters, but they sought a written assurance from the officials .
