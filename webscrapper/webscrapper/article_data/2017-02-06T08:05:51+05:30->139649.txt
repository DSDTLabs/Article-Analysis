LUCKNOW: The panel of doctors which conducted autopsy on 91-year-old Mona Zabin Khan has found two injuries on her skull. Zabin was found dead at her   house on Saturday. ASP trans-Gomti   said as per autopsy, Zabin slipped into coma after being hit on the head and did not recover. No treatment was provided to her, he added.

 Zabin was allegedly murdered about a month back and her   Firoz, who is said to be of  , stayed with his mother’s corpse in the house. On Saturday, some neighbours complained of foul smell emanating from Firoz’s house and informed Hasanganj police it. 
 
 Zabin stayed with her son Firoz and daughter Huma. Her husband Rehmat passed away about a decade ago. 
 
 Firoz and daughter Huma are being questioned. The needle of suspicion is on Firoz, who, police said, suffers from psychological disorders.
 
 “Firoz behaved when he was asked to open the door. He has been detained for questioning,” said ASP. Though Huma was not found at the house, police traced her at a relative’s house. 
 
 As the family stayed in untidy conditions and did not interact much with neighbours, nobody suspected Zabin was killed till foul smell started emanating from the house.
