AHMEDABAD: The   has quashed an order passed by the   by which it had dropped   booked under Section 188 of the IPC for  .

 The metropolitan court dropped proceedings in over 600 cases in which Section 188 of the IPC was invoked on the ground that the procedure adopted by local police was not according to law, and the prosecution could be started against the accused persons only after the city police commissioner files a complaint against the violator of his notification.
 
 Looking at the possible neutralizing impact of policing work, the state government rushed the city sessions court and challenged the lower court’s decision. On Monday, the principal sessions judge, P B Desai, quashed the metropolitan court’s order and asked the concerned magistrate to hear the matters afresh by remanding back three of those cases. In nearly 400 cases, people booked under Section 188 of the IPC had admitted being guilty and prosecution against them ended with imposition of penalty.
 
 In quashing the metropolitan court’s order, the sessions court observed that by dropping the cases, the accused were given a kind of clean acquittal. Moreover, by allowing the police to initiate fresh prosecution by following a certain procedure, the metropolitan court permitted a second trial against the accused persons. This would practically amount to double jeopardy.
