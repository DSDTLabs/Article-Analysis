LUCKNOW: Launching a scathing attack on the state government for the rising crime graph,   chief   on Thursday accused it of harbouring criminals. 

 Slamming the police for failing to curb crime,   said the men in uniform were too busy chasing workers of the opposition to keep their political masters in the government in good humour.
 
 Accusing   leaders of sheltering criminals, Akhilesh said a criminal wanted by Punjab, Haryana and   police had been spotted at a gym in   enjoying the company of a BJP leader. "It is for the government to explain how this criminal was in Firozabad and with whom was he spotted at a gym. He was with a BJP leader," said Akhilesh while showing the photographs of the duo to the media here.
 
 Taking a jibe at the state police for its failure to arrest criminals involved in some sensational crimes, including the Meerut double murder and dacoities in Lucknow, the SP chief said the police has time and resources to scan 10,000 calls to arrest farmers who had dumped potatoes in Lucknow to protest against government apathy but the same police fail to nab criminals who commit dacoities.
