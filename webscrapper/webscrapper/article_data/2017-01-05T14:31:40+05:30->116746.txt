HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad High Court on Wednesday sought to know from the   (ED) as to why it dispossessed Bharati Cements of its assets when the latter had not yet availed all appellate remedies. 

 The bench of Acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice A   posed this question to additional solicitor general KM Nataraj who was defending ED. The ED had attached 860 crore worth of movable and immovable assets of the company and its management. 
 
 The ED, which is probing the disproportionate assets case against YS  , made these attachments under the provisions of the   ( ). 
 
 It also transferred 177 crore lying in the form of deposits with various accounts of Bharati Cements and several Jagan firms into the ED account as part of the dispossession proceedings. When a single judge stayed the process, the probe agency filed an appeal challenging the single judge order. 
 
 When the bench started hearing the appeal, the additional solicitor general told the bench that the single judge has asked the company to avail of the alternative remedies and in the meantime restrained the ED from acting further under the Act. The bench too sought to know from him as to why the dispossession proceedings were launched. "Courts have repeatedly held a view asking you to keep your hands off till the appellate remedy is exhausted", the bench said. Nataraj, however, said that they have the power to take into possession the attached assets once the adjudicating authority confirms the action. The bench posted the case to Thursday for further hearing.
