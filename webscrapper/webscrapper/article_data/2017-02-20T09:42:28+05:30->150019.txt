 Enjoying the dance on Happy Streets, Jay Das from Bhubaneswar, who was on a vacation to the port city, said, “I was actually surprised to see so many people visiting Beach Road. It was really amazing to see so many families gathering here and enjoying time together. Even my daughter liked the Zumba dance. More such activities need to be organised, because nowadays many of the people are more focussed on spending time on mobile and computer rather than going out and playing in the open.”
