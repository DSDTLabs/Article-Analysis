RANCHI: It was a working Sunday for top bureaucrats and cops of   and the venue for the global investors’ summit, Khelgaon, was abuzz with activity. 

 Among the first to visit the venue was the chief secretary   who along with several top bureaucrats and organizers took stock of the final phase of arrangements. She held a string of meetings with the organizers at the venue. The home secretary SKG Rahate too reached the spot with a large team of top cops from across the state.
 
 People who are working at the venue and different parts of the city were busy providing finishing touches. The approach road to Khelgaon is now well lit-up with all streetlight poles being draped with red and white decorative lights and all roundabouts and empty spaces between roads decorated with flower plants. Along the route large posters of top   leaders and other dignitaries who are expected to attend the event have been put up on streetlights while the road dividers and metal grills along pavements are sporting cutouts of Momentum Jharkhand’s mascot – the flying elephant.
 
 Inside the venue, the air was charged with expectancy and anxiety among bureaucrats and organizers who followed Verma as she went into nitty-gritties of decoration at the Harivansh Tana Bhagat Indoor Stadium which will host the inaugural event on February 16. The indoor stadium has been decked up with gold-white streamers as the main stage is being now under-construction. The team headed by Verma focused on the decorations and sitting arrangements.
