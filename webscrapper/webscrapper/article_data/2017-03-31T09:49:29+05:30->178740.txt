MEERUT: Despite earmarking Rs 6 lakh for a   track to make driving test tougher and transparent, the project hangs fire as no land has been allotted for the project so far. The construction work was to be completed in 2015-16 financial year, but after the fund remained unutilised, the money had to be returned to the treasury last year. In the current financial year, too, the money will have to be returned to the treasury as the project did not start due to lack of land.
 
  Initially, the regional transport office (RTO) authorities had planned to build the driving track in the office premises itself, but later it was decided that a five-acre plot of land for the track will be taken elsewhere, where the license office will also be shifted (at present it is in the RTO office premises) to avoid any anomalies in issuing  .
  
  As of now, the driving skills of licence seekers are tested manually, but the process is set to get computerised soon after the driving track is constructed – in the shape of the number 8 – wherein those seeking licence will have to pass a driving test without any human intervention.
  
  When asked about the matter, assistant regional transport officer (ARTO) Ranjeet Singh said, “We are still in the process of getting the plot of land in the name of the RTO. A piece of land in Modipuram has been okayed but the paper work still remains and, hence, the fund will have to be surrendered again this year.”
  
  When TOI reported about the driving track first in March 2015, a plot measuring 1,000 sq m was finalised in the RTO office itself, where two different tracks in the shape of number 8 were to be made. Now, the project has not taken off as the RTO is looking for a new plot of land.
