 just keeps getting interesting day by day. Apart from what happens inside the house, the opinions and discussions that viewers give out is one of the main reasons why the show has become the most talked about show in current times.
 
  Earlier this week we saw contestants   and   engage in a verbal and physical fight. After Lopa made some hurtful comments on Bani during the call center task, Bani couldn't control her anger.
  
  In a fit of anger, she grabbed Lopa by the waist and both of them exchanged mild blows. Bani went against the rules of the house and got physical with Lopa. Host   did not like her behaviour at all and decided to confront Bani.
  
  
 
  
  Salman supported Lopa throughout the episode as he somehow agreed with what Lopa said. Salman Lashed out at Bani and made her realize her mistake.
  
  But Colors's CEO  's daughter Atiya did not like the way Salman spoke to Bani. Atiya was on Bani's side this time and took it to twitter to express what she felt. Check out her tweet here-
  
  
  
  
  It is really difficult to understand who is right and who is wrong in Lopa and Bani's clash.
