Calangute: The main entrance to Candolim beach is set for a major facelift with the commencement of work on the ‘Candolim beach promenade’ beautification project.  Deputy speaker and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo on Wednesday carried out a site inspection of the area along with officials from the Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC) , tourism department, public works department and other departments. Candolim sarpanch Blaize Fernandes was also present. “The whole area will have a new look by December. We’re making a new pay-parking area, and next to that will be a children’s park on 2,500 sq m of land with facilities for senior citizens. The toilets and changing rooms facility will also be ready shortly,” Lobo told TOI. The foundation stone for the Candolim promenade was laid by chief minister Manohar Parrikar in June 2014. Besides the Candolim beach promenade, the parking area at Calangute beach near GTDC Residency is also being beautified with a new footpath and illumination. The total cost of both beautification works is Rs 10 crore, Lobo said.
