JAIPUR: Alarmed over the robbery bid by at least 13 armed robbers, commissioner of police   on Tuesday met regional director of   (RBI)   and discussed the safety and security guidelines for the banks. 

 Both of them will have a meeting with the regional managers and other bank officers of various banks in Jaipur on Wednesday.
 
 According to sources, the Jaipur police have pointed out various lacunae in security at the centralized chest branch of the private bank which was targeted by robbers on Monday late night.
 
 "The alarm did not ring even when the robbers jumped the first outside wall. It was also found that the cash was kept outside the strong room. We have also found other lacunae in the security measures. It appears that the guidelines by the RBI were not being followed by the bank," said a senior police officer on the condition of anonymity.
 
 Agarwal said, "We have some many chest branches of various private and nationalized banks in the city. Thus it becomes important for the banks as well to ensure proper security measures. Along with the regional director, RBI, and other bank officers, we will have a meeting on Wednesday. Discussions would be clearly on safety measures that are needed to be implemented," said Agarwal.
 
 Since Jaipur had also witnessed robberies at   loan banks and financial institutions, they are also being invited in the meeting.
 
 "The centralized chest branches and gold loan companies should have devices like alarms, time locks, proper shutters; the passages of premises should have cameras and the cash should be kept in strong rooms," said a senior officer of a nationalized bank.
