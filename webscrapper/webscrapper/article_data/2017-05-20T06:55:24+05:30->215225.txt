HYDERABAD: More than 30 workers from Telangana and AP have been allegedly deprived of food, basic necessities, and salaries by a company they have been working for in Kuwait. Without pay for several months, the workers decided to quit their   but the company has been refusing to settle their dues. Driven to despair, the workers have appealed to NRI affairs minister   to help them return home. 

 Shankar Prasad, a worker from Mahbubnagar, who is among the victims, told TOI that workers had not got salaries for seven to eight months. He said they had been employed by   at Kuwait. While Prasad went there to take up a job as a driver, others went as helpers. 
 
 "The company is not settling our wages and other issues. It is also not giving us a flight ticket to get back home. For the last two to three months, we have been staying put in our rooms," Prasad said. Apart from Mahbubnagar, there are workers from Karimnagar, Nirmal and Jagtial who are stranded. "Facilities here are not good. They are not providing us proper food and accommodation. We are unable to even go out," he said in a letter, drawing the attention of CM KCR also to the issue. 
 
 The workers have reportedly approached the Indian Embassy for help and repeatedly brought their problem to their notice. Their efforts have been futile till now, they said. Some of the workers are in Shuaiba camp 3 at Fuhaleel in Kuwait.
