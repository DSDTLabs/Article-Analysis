Colva: Keeping pace with the rising mercury, power outages are also on the rise throughout South Goa, affecting local businesses. Most of the services in Goaâ€™s commercial capital were hindered for long hours. Only some areas received power supply, that too through private operators.

 The effects of powercuts could have been worse had most of the households and businesses not have inverters or generators. 
 
 The electricity department announcing the shutdown almost two weeks in advance gave enough buffer time to the residents to come up with alternative coping methods.
 
 A large number of families took advantage of the weekend and flocked to the restaurants by the beach and picnic spots along the shoreline to beat the heat. One restaurateur from Sernabatim said there were more people at his restaurant, as compared to other weekends. 
 
 Internet services were, however, disrupted; most of the cyber cafes remained shut for the day. 
 
 Salons and beauty parlours could not provide services that required electricity, while car-wash service stations also remained closed. Most of the ice-cream parlours did not open for the day as well. 
 
 Many ATMs in the villages were not functional. But as the banks were operational, no inconvenience was reported. 
 
 Water supply was also not affected during the 8-hour power shutdown.
