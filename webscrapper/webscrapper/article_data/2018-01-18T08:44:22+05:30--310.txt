CENTURION: Left smarting after losing his first Test series as the full time captain of the Indian team,   hit out at critics for questioning his choice of playing XI.

 
 
 
 "If we had won this, was this the best XI? We don't decide the XI according to results. You are telling me that you could have played the best XI," said   after South Africa won the second Test at Centurion by 135 runs to seal the three-Test series 2-0 with another Test remaining.
 
 
 
 Since he took over from MS   in 2014-15, the 29-year-old Kohli hasn't fielded the same playing XI for 34 Test matches, which is unprecedented. The query didn't go down well with Kohli, who incidentally was fined 25 % match fees and handed a demerit point by the   for his on-field behaviour.
 
 "How many Test matches have we won out of 34? How many have we won? How many have we won? 21 wins (20 actually). Two losses. How many draws? Does it matter? Wherever we play we try to do our best. I'm here to answer your questions, not to fight with you," he countered.
 
 Later, a journalist asked if after the series loss and India's record being so poor away from home, he feels part of the No.1 Test side.
 
 Kohli said: "We have to believe we are the best side. If you don't believe you can win coming here, there is no point coming here. We have not come here to just participate. Answering your question, sir, how many times did South Africa come into the game when they were in India?"
