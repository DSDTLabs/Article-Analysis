MUMBAI: Union minister of state for finance   on Friday informed BJP   member   that the state anti-corruption bureau has not given a clean chit to any accused person in the irrigation scam. 

 Somiaya had raised the issue in Lok Sabha. He had sought information on whether the enforcement directorate has been asked to look afresh into the Rs1,000-crore irrigation scam, if ACB has given a clean chit to the persons involved in the scam, if ED is probing the role of dummy companies, if ACB has taken note of massive cost escalation and number of companies involved in the scam and present status of investigation.
 
 Gangwar informed Somaiya in a written reply that on the basis of an FIR lodged in August 2015, the ED is investigating. Following an open inquiry conducted into the Konkan Irrigation Development and Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation, so far seven criminal cases have been registered.
 
 Gangwar stated that FIRs pertain to irregularities in six irrigation projects. He added that the ACB has taken cognisance of the cost escalation issue and is probing it. "ACB has so far registered seven offences and charge sheets have been submitted to the trial court in two of the cases,'' he said.
 
  After taking over as chief minister in 2014, Devendra Fadnavis had granted permission to the ACB to conduct an inquiry against senior NCP leaders Ajit Pawar and  , for their alleged involvement in the irrigation scam and against   for his role in the construction of Maharashtra Sadan.
