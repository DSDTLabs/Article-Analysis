MUMBAI: The   (IMD), which gives up to a   for a cyclone, has started working towards giving an up to seven-day forecast. But it will take weathermen two years as they don’t want to compromise on accuracy. 

 As part of the forecasts, scientists at IMD predict the expected path of a cyclone, its intensity, landfall point and time, expected adverse weather and damage, height of the wave, heavy rainfall, where and when there will be winds and the expected weather. From 2003, IMD began giving 24-hour forecasts, which increased to three-day forecasts from 2009. Around 2013, IMD started giving five-day forecasts.
 
 Dr Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, scientist and head of the regional specialized meteorological centre-IMD, said, “The worldwide forecast model too is good up to five days only, but our objective is to improve. In fact, we have introduced modelling for a 10-day forecast, but it will take us two to three years, as we do not want to compromise on accuracy. Therefore, we first plan to increase it to a seven-day forecast.”
 
 “The live period of a cyclone is only 3-5 days, so one may say that a seven-day forecast may not be required. But in the case of some cyclones, from the time it develops, till it crosses the sea, it takes seven days. Therefore, we want to forecast that period with more accuracy,” added Mohapatra. 
 
 One challenge regarding cyclones, claim weathermen, is to forecast the direction; it can lead to an error in forecasting the track. Apart from it, a slow-moving cyclone and one with rapid intensification, are other challenges.
