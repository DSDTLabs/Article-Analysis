AHMEDABAD:   high court on Thursday asked hoteliers — who want the state government to revoke its decision to put liquor licences in abeyance — to place before it the   order prohibiting the sale of liquor within 500m of state and national highways.

 As some of the hotels petitioning the HC are in city areas, the court asked them to show whether the SC order gives specific guidelines for hotels within city limits but near highways and whether such hotels were granted exemption.
 
 Twelve hotels from state that have permits to serve liquor moved the HC against the state government’s decision to put their licences in abeyance.
 
 The government had renewed the licences of all these hotels earlier this year, but later suspended them indefinitely. The petition of the hotels contends that the decision was taken without fully appreciating the SC directives, because the diktat can’t be applicable to Gujarat, where the sale and consumption of liquor, particularly IMFL, is governed by the Bombay Prohibition Act and the Bombay Foreign Liquor Rules.
 
 The petition claimed that the sale of liquor has been regulated in Gujarat and the rules have been made more stringent. Alcohol is sold to only those with liquor permits, and nobody else can buy it over the counter.
 
 The court shall hear this matter on July 24.
