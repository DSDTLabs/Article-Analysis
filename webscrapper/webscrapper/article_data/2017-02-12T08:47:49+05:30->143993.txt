PHAGWARA: Leaders of the BJP and the Congress in Phagwara have demanded action against Phagwara City station house officer (SHO) inspector   Singh, now shunted to police lines, for allegedly roughing up a BJP activist’s wife and their two children when he raided their residence on Friday to arrest the activist in a case of assault.

 Several BJP and Congress activists gathered outside the residence of BJP activist Vivek   on Saturday and demanded that inspector Nirmal be placed under suspension and a case be registered against him, as the cop pushed Chadha’s wife, Monica, in a police vehicle even when no woman police personnel were with him. Her two children were also taken to police station. “I repeatedly requested the cop not to take away the woman as she had nothing to do with the dispute, but he rebuked me and pushed her into the vehicle. The SHO terrorized not just Monica and her kids, but the entire neighbourhood,” said Ram Teerath, who runs a school in the neighbourhood.
 
 Bitterness between two factions of the BJP led to assault on Bhartiya Janta Yuva Morcha former district president   on February 8 night. BJP former district general secretary Gurdeep Singh Dipa was named in the case.
 
 Deepa and his councillor wife Kuljit Kaur have claimed that he was not present when Duggal was attacked. Congress has also come to Monica’s support. Its candidate from Phagwara constituency,   Mann, staged a dharna outside Phagwara SP’s office on Friday after police picked up Monica and her chidlren.
 
 Duggal is son of former Phagwara municipal committee president Balbhadar Sen Duggal. Dipa owes allegiance to   president Vijay Sampla and he had been speaking out against local BJP MLA and candidate Som Parkash before the assembly elections.
 
 Kapurthala senior superintendent of police (SSP) Alka Meena said she was going to form a special investigation team (SIT) to probe into the entire sequence of events, including the SHO’s role.
