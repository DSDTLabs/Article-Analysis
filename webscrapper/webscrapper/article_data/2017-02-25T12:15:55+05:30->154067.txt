KOLKATA: A woman can't be charged with using criminal force against another woman with intent to disrobe her (Sec 354B of the IPC), Calcutta high court observed on Friday while granting anticipatory bail to   and actor   in a case lodged at the Harwood Point Coastal police station on May 24, 2016.

 "Section 354B of the IPC applies to a man who assaults or uses criminal force to any woman or abets such act with the intention of disrobing or compelling her to be naked. This doesn't apply to a woman. All other charges brought against her are bailable so we grant her anticipatory bail," the division bench of Justice Nadira Patherya and Justice S K Prasad observed.
 
 Roopa's counsel Phiroze Edulji submitted in court that his client had rushed to Kakdwip on May 22, 2016, after she came to know that BJP supporters were assaulted by Trinamool workers. "It was she who was assaulted by a mob when she went to the house of the BJP workers in Surjya Nagar, Kakdwip. Despite this, a complaint was lodged against her, charging her under Section 354B," he submitted.
 
 It was also pointed out by him that Roopa received a notice under CrPC Section 41A, asking her to appear at the Harwood Point Coastal police station on February 27. The court took the decision after hearing the arguments.
