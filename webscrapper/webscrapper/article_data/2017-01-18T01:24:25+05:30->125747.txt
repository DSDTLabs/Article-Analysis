Mumbai: A 31-year-old man was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly duping a   jeweller of nearly Rs4 lakh by showing a fake message to confirm   after buying over 106 grams of gold.

 Police said Rajat Nagori went to  , Sector 4, Shanti Nagar, Mira Road, on January 8 along with a regular customer of the shop, Shyama Shaikh. The jeweller, Ashok Bohra told police Nagori bought ornaments for over Rs 3.99 lakh and offered to make online payment. So Bohra gave him his bank account details. Within seconds, Nagori forwarded him a screenshot of a message that he claimed he received from his bank confirming transfer of Rs 3.99 lakh to Bohra’s account. 
 
 When Bohra checked his account and realized no money had been credited, he called up Nagori. Then Nagori said he would make the payment soon. As he failed to do so, Bohra lodged a complaint with Naya Nagar police on January 16. Nagori was arrested with help from Shaikh.
 
 Cyber expert   said the jeweller should have checked his bank account online before handing over the valuables. “Such fraud is committed through masking of mobile number or contact details. The fraudster may have got the bank details masked and used the same to send WhatsApp message showing the fake transaction,” said Mukhi.
 
 In October, the police had arrested a Mira Road woman Neha Kini who had cheated a couple of jewelers in Mira-Bhayander using a similar modus operandi.
