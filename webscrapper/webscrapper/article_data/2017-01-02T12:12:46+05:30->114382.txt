LUCKNOW: In his maiden address after being declared   national president chief minister   said whatever happened was necessary to protect the party and the 'pariwar' (family) as some people were conspiring to take control over both.

 “People have conspired to create a crisis for the national president,“ said Akhilesh, speaking at the special convention where he was declared the party's new chief. He said people will interpret the developments in their own way but that will not change his love and affection for his father. “In fact, I will respect him even more now,“ he said.
 
 “Sometimes, to protect the ones you love, you must take the right decisions. What I did today was a tough decision but one I had to take,“ Akhilesh tweeted later in the day.
