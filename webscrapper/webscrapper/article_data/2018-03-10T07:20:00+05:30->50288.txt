GURUGRAM: The government is planning to convert a total of 50 acres — 20 acres near   and another 30 acres near Damdana village — into two city forests, state forest and wildlife minister Rao Narbir Singh said on Friday during a meeting with a group of   who raised concerns about fast-depleting green covers in Haryana.

 The forest department will make provisions for water and fencing to ensure at least 80% sustainability of trees to be planted in the proposed sites.
 
 “At least 20 acres of land (in Bhondsi) will be handed over to a group of environmentalists who have shown interest in carrying out   drives to develop a forest there. The area will be fenced properly and provisions will be made for proper watering of the plants,” the minister said during a tree plantation drive by Dhyan Foundation in Bhondsi.
 
 This apart, sources in the forest department said, around 30 acres near   Lake would also be given for sapling plantations. “We are planning to carry out massive plantation drives near Damdama village. It will be turned into an important city forest, which will increase the overall green covers and help recharge the groundwater tables in the city,” said an official at the department.
