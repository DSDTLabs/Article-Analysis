MARGAO: The   has invited expressions of interest (EoI) from authorised agencies to prepare a biodiversity assessment of the Colva  , an area that encompasses close to 31,000 sqm. 

 The notice inviting EoIs has been issued in compliance with the order passed by the   in an appeal filed by the   panchayat against the board and others.
 
 Residents led by the   had objected to the reclamation of fields besides the lake for the construction of a multipurpose ground. The board had subsequently inspected the site in December 2013 and had issued a notice prohibiting reclamation of the fields and the lake until the biodiversity of the area was not documented across seasons.
 
 The inspection report had further stated that the ‘reclamation or filling of the plot could interfere with hydro-dynamics and also result in habitat loss for certain seasonal biodiversity’.
 
 The Colva panchayat had appealed against the board’s notice before the NGT, which had subsequently passed an order asking the board to undertake a specific study through an expert agency before taking a final decision in the matter. 
 
 “The (board) may consider undertaking a specific study through an expert agency before taking a final decision... Notwithstanding the fact that sports activities also should be given a booster dose for improving the health of the younger generation, but simultaneously, it cannot be forgotten that biodiversity improves environmental status of the area, which is also likely a booster dose to improve the health of younger generation. The state has to strike a balance between two such kinds of activities and therefore, an appropriate decision making is expected from the board,” the NGT had said in its order.
 
 The board has set a one-year duration for the study to be conducted.
