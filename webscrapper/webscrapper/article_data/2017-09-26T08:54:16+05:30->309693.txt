AGARTALA: Chief minister   has agreed to seek a Special Investigation Team (SIT) probe under state police into the murder of journalist   on September 20.

 A delegation of   called on Sarkar on Monday and demanded that an SIT be constituted for the investigation and the case be tried in a fast-track court. "The chief minister gave a patient hearing to the demand for SIT and fast-track court, and spoke to the Director General of Police (DGP) for the immediate arrangement to set up an SIT and to look into the demand for ensuring security of journalists," a government release said.
 
 The demand for an SIT probe did not go down well among all journalist bodies, with nine organizations of journalists in the state condemning the Agartala Press Club's demand, saying that it should have sought a CBI probe instead. "We are surprised with what the press club did. It has openly backed CPM since the beginning and goes against the journalist fraternity,"  , veteran journalist and convener of the joint movement forum of journalist bodies, said. 
 
 He accused the Agartala Press Club of trying to "shield" the actual criminals.
 
 Unhappy with either proposition, the   sought a judicial inquiry into the killing by a sitting high court judge.
 
 "We have no faith in either Tripura Police or the CBI. Both can be used for political purposes and there is no scope for justice. None of the murder cases in the state has been solved by the CBI so far and thousands of cases are pending with police despite there being solid evidence to bring the criminals to justice," Congress legislature party leader Gopal Chandra Roy said. Congress leaders are scheduled to meet DGP Akhil Kumar Sukla to demand an impartial inquiry into the murder.
