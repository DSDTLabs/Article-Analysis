RAIPUR: Social boycott drove a 22-year-old to   on Tuesday. Though   left behind a suicide note asking the local Patel community to treat his death as penance and end the ostracism, no one but his family turned up for the last rites. To add to the agony, the hospital where Patel’s body was taken for autopsy couldn’t provide a hearse van, and no one from the community stepped up to help, forcing the family to haul it home in a hand cart.

 The family, residents of Kurda village, was ostracised after   married outside the caste. Santosh had cut himself off from the family to save them from a boycott, but it didn’t help.
 
 The boycott not only created a hurdle for the marriage of the other siblings, but also made it difficult for them to repay loans. In his two-age suicide note, Patel said the social boycott had sought the community’s forgiveness, and pleaded with them to withdraw the boycott. Activists say   has more than 25,000 families living in ostracism for defying archaic traditions and marrying outside the caste.
