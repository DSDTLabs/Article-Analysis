MUMBAI: The BEST administration has decided to pay the salaries of 42,000 employees in batches of two on March 21 and 22. The decision was taken after the employees' union threatened to go on strike if payments were not made by March 20. 

 BEST had earlier said that salaries will be paid on March 24. However, the union refused to withdraw protests. On Saturday, an emergency meeting was held at   headquarters. The meeting was attended by BEST general manager Jagdish Patil, mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar and BMC commissioner Ajoy Mehta, among others. The BMC has agreed to help the BEST to tide over the crisis but after taking an assurance from the latter that it will tackle the problem areas.
 
 Patil said salaries will be paid in two instalments-non-officers like drivers and conductors will get salaries on March 21 and Class A and B officers will get it on March 22. "We are trying to disburse the salaries at the earliest. We are procuring two fresh bank loans of Rs 160 crore. I appeal to workers to refrain from any agitation," he said.
 
 BEST Workers Union's Shashank Rao said, "We will not withdraw the   if salary is not deposited by Monday."
