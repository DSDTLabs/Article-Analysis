PATNA: The Congress party on Wednesday split in   with four of its six MLCs announcing to join the JD (U) led by CM   Kumar. 
 
 The development took place hours after HAM-S president and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi quit the NDA and joined the Grand Alliance (GA) of RJD and Congress. 
  
 The ‘rebel’ MLCs late in the evening addressed a press conference. “More Congress legislators will quit the party and follow out footsteps,” said former state president  , who is believed to have led the split. 
  
 The Congress has 27 MLAs in the state and at least 18 MLAs will have to come together to engineer a split in the party without inviting disqualification as per anti-defection laws. 
  
 The MLCs — Dilip Kumar Choudhary, Ram Chandra Bharti and Tanvir Akhtar and Ashok — earlier in the day called on state legislative council’s deputy chairman   and gave it in writing that they wanted to be recognised as a separate group in the upper house. 
  
 The two other Congress MLCs are Madan Mohan Jha and Rajesh Ram, who are still with the party. 
  
 Ashok told newsmen Nitish had accepted the four MLCs’ request to let them join the JD (U). “I was being humiliated in the Congress,” he said and profusely praised Nitish for providing good governance in the state. 
  
 Ashok was the education minister in the Nitish-led GA government, which was formed after the JD (U)-RJD-Congress alliance trounced the BJP-led NDA by winning 178 of the state’s 243 assembly seats in November 2015. Twenty months on, the JD (U) with its 71 MLAs parted ways with the GA and formed a new government in alliance with the BJP in July 2017. 
  
 Son of late Congress minister Mahavir Choudhary, Ashok was the state Congress president from 2013 to 2017. He was unceremoniously removed from the party post amid reports of his opposition to the Congress’s alliance with tainted Lalu Prasad’s RJD.
