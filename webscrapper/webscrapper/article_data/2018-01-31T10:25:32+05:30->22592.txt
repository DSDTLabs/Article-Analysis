NOIDA: Ahead of the union   to be presented on Feb 1 by finance minister  , city residents and RWA federation give a wish list – that of income   of Rs 4 lakh for men and Rs 5 lakh for women, a check on increasing petrol and diesel prices and regulation of Good and   (GST).

 Foremost amongst this is an expectation on income tax rebates. “Though there are speculations that government may bring a new tax slab, we wish that this year the citizen is given income tax rebate of Rs 4 lakh for the men and Rs 5 lakh for women. The citizen is battle rising inflation and it’ll help a salaried employee to get some tax rebates,” N P Singh president Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Associations (FONRWA) told TOI.
 
 Apart from tax rebates, the rising prices in petrol and diesel is another matter that concern residents’ interest. The dynamic pricing scheme has increased petrol and diesel prices (which are revised on a daily basis in sync with global crude oil prices,) to a new high. As of Jan 30 petrol in Noida cost Rs 74.53 per litre and diesel price was Rs 64.33 per litre. “We have never had such high prices for fuel and its telling on household budget of late. We are resorting to car pool as well as opting for public transport more which is discomforting many a times,” said  , resident of sector 49.
 
 Singh adds that the residents across the city are tired of fluctuations in favour of only high fuel prices. “We hope that the budget addresses this issue and streamlines the fuel prices as well as regulates the GST in favour of industry/entrepreneur,” said Singh.
