GURUGRAM: Taps ran dry in several localities of the city on Friday as the relocation process of master pipelines at   and   entered the second day. Residents cried foul and questioned why MCG and   failed to make alternate arrangements for water supply.

 Some of the worst affected areas were DLF 1, 2, 3 and 4; Sushant Lok I, and sectors 21, 22, 27, 28, 30, 31, 40 and 47. While some localities received water supply in the morning, most localities did not receive any water supply till evening.
 
 While those living in residential societies maintained by developers were supplied water by the builders, residents in Huda sectors had to call for water tankers.
 
 “Neither the MCG nor Huda made any arrangements for water tankers. Even though some developers called tankers, the situation is just worsening. Water supply should be resumed at the earliest or there will be a major crisis on Saturday,” said R S Rathee, president, Gurgaon Citizens' Council.
 
 Col. Omed Singh, RWA president, Sector 21, echoed similar concerns. “A water tanker with capacity of 5000 litres costs Rs 1000. With daily disruptions, we have been compelled to call the water tankers almost every other day. Residents have been forced to shell out extra money,” he said. 
 
 It’s been two months that Gurgaonites have been affected due to the relocation of water pipelines. TOI reported in February how about two lakh residents were affected when water pipeline was being shifted at IFFCO Chowk. The master pipeline is being shifted to facilitate construction of underpasses on Delhi-Gurgaon e-way. Huda officials were not available for comment.
