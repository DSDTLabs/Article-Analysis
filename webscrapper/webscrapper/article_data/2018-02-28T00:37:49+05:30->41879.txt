MUMBAI: The city has lost a 1,097 sq mtr   near   to a builder as   allegedly failed to adequately represent its case in the  .

 Sena corporator Bala (Anant) Nar, chairman of Improvements Committee, slammed the civic body for its failure to protect the open space when BMC, on Tuesday, tabled a proposal to remove the playground (PG) reservation from the plot. "The civic body had paid Rs 2.8 crore out of Rs 14 crore to the land acquisition officer as per ready reckoner rates... but in 2008 the builder approached the HC and requested to change the reservation of the plot from PG to development. As the BMC advocates failed to represent properly in court, the set reservation of the plot was removed and the order went in favour of the builder,‚Äù he said.
