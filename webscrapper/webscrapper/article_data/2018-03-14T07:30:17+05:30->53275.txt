CHENNAI: About nine years after a woman sub-inspector of police slapped a   bar salesman, the   (SHRC) rapped the officer and awarded ?50,000 as compensation to the victim.

 SHRC member  , passing orders on a complaint lodged by C Muniasamy, also said the government may recover the amount from R  , sub-inspector of   police station in Ramanathapuram.
 
 In his complaint, Muniasamy, a salesman in a bar attached to a Tasmac outlet in Kamuthi, said that on July 23, 2009, around 9pm, sub-inspector Thilagavathy and two policemen entered the premises and asked for the bar owner.
 
 “She questioned why the owner of the bar had not called on her even a month after she had taken charge in the police station. She then dragged me out of the shop and assaulted me. This apart, I was taken to the police station and released only after the bar owner met the officer,” Muniasamy said.
 
 Denying the allegations, the sub-inspector, in her affidavit to the SHRC, submitted that the averments made in the complaint were not true and that she had visited the bar only to inquire about the complaints made against the bar.
 
 Recording the submissions, the commission held that the officer had violated human rights of the complainant and was liable to pay due compensation to him.
