NEW DELHI: After taking a round of nine ‘mandis’ (agri markets) across five states as part of their   Satyagraha during March 14-22, a group of organisations on Saturday claimed that farmers at not a single mandi were able to sell any crop at the minimum support price (MSP).

 They have now urged the government to open up sufficient number of procurement centres so that farmers are not forced into a situation of distress sale.
 
 The group, led by   of  , also released its interim report, recommending urgent to deal with farm distress. It is expected that PM   will in ‘Mann Ki Baat’ on Sunday refer to issues relating to farm distress, MSPs and his government’s efforts to deal with the problem. 
 
 Yogendra Yadav while addressing a press conference on Saturday said, “Leave alone the demands about increasing the MSP, even the MSP which is already guaranteed by the government is not being implemented”.
