NAGPUR: The decks seem to have been cleared for the launch of   ( ) Nagpur in the coming academic year. The ministry of health and family welfare has issued advertisements to fill posts of institute director and teaching staff, and also for admissions to the institute.

 JIPMER (Jawaharlal Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research), Puducherry, has been made the mentor institute for AIIMS Nagpur. It has issued the advertisement for 52 teaching posts for the Nagpur institute. The last date for filing applications for the posts is March 16.
 
 The posts include eight professors in basic non-clinical subjects like anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, community medicine, pathology, microbiology, pharmacology and forensic medicine and toxicology. The other posts advertised include eight professors, four additional professors, four associate professors, 16 lecturers or assistant professors, twelve residents and eight tutors or demonstrators.
 
 The advertisement mentions that four per cent or two of these posts have been reserved for persons with disabilities. All other posts have been advertised for the unreserved (UR) category. This has disturbed reserved category teachers in the city who want to apply for the posts, and they have expressed their dissatisfaction on the issue.
