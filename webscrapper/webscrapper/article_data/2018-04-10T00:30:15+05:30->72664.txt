Trichy: In order to enable students from government and government aided schools in the state crack NEET and other competitive exams, the school education department has started residential coaching for students at nine centres across the state. 

 Helping students ace NEET is the primary goal of the training programme which will be offered free of cost to meritorious students. 
 
 Amidst charges that the present curriculum followed in the state board schools does not equip students to take up central competitive exams including NEET, the government has introduced residential crash course across the state.
 
 Inaugurating the programme at the Shivani College of Engineering and Technology here, tourism minister Vellamandi N Natarajan said that nine such residential coaching centres have been set up across the state while only Trichy has been allotted two centres where 600 students would be trained for various competitive examinations especially NEET. 
 
 He further said that the course has been designed in such a manner to ensure that many students from the rural parts will benefit from it. He asked the students to focus on their future than getting disappointed over not being able to spend time with relatives during vacation.
