GURGAON: More than 500 trees have been cut in  , located about 45 km away from Delhi's  , in the last year and a half, to pave way for unauthorised construction of farmhouses. 

  TOI on Sunday found out these are the same plots that were sealed by a joint district administration team, comprising officials of the   (HSPCB), forest and mining departments, and over 50 cops. They had razed boundary walls and gates of nearly 20 plots in the village in March 2015. Illegal borewell connections and electricity connections were also snapped by the team. Google images also showed about 60 trees were felled on every plot. 
 
 Earlier last month, HSPCB issued a show-cause notice to a farmhouse owner, for illegal construction in the same village, after TOI reported felling of 200 trees. 
 
 "The authorities have failed miserably in protecting crucial green cover. Officials are hiding behind the excuse that the identification of the land under NCZ is 'status to be determined'. . Unless we provide 'forest' status to the entire Aravalis, such activities will continue," said colonel S S Oberoi, a city-based environmentalist and legal expert.
 
 Meanwhile, villagers blamed local property dealers. "Emergence of so many property dealers has led to a rise in illegal construction in the protected area. ," said a villager pleading anonymity.
 
 The district administration, however, blames lack of clarity on ownership of plots in Raisina village. "Tracking a plot owner is a Hercuelan task. Most of the area has collective land holding, so there are multiple owners," a district administration official told TOI.
