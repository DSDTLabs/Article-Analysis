Erode: Eight peacocks, two of them fully-grown male birds, were found dead in an agricultural field at Kanchikoil near Perundurai here on Saturday.

 Forest officials suspect that the peacocks might have been killed by some miscreant(s) after they raided the crop, damaging them.
 
 “Local villagers found the carcasses and informed us. We have collected samples of the carcasses for lab test,” a forest official said.
 
 The forest officials have registered a case under various sections of the Wildlife Protection Act. “If anyone is found guilty that person will be booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Wildlife Protection Act,” a senior forest official said.
 
 The carcasses were buried after the postmortem.
