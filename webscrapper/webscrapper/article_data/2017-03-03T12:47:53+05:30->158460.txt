Actress   says she eventually wants to focus on her a career as a director. The 38-year-old actress said she is busy with her acting assignments right now, but in future she will just work behind the camera.

 "This business is so unstable, and you never really know where you're going to be. For now I like acting and directing. Eventually I'll just direct,"   said. 
 
  
  
 However, the 'Dawson's Creek' star said her 10-year-old daughter  , who she has with her ex-husband  , is the most important person in her life and her biggest priority ahead of her job. 
 
 "My child is the most important person to me, and her upbringing is paramount to my work right now. It's very important that I'm present and she has a stable, innocent childhood. I feel so blessed to do what I do, but there's nothing in the world better than watching your child succeed," she said.
