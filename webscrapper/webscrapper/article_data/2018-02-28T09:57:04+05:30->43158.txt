CHANDIGARH: While paying condolences after the demise of a junior resident doctor at the  , the institute dean and director on Tuesday asked the students to come forward with any problems instead of taking the extreme step. The association of resident doctors has also asked all residents to talk about the issues troubling them and the same could be dealt with anonymously. On Monday, Dr  , a junior resident at the department of radio diagnosis, was found dead after he hung himself from a ceiling fan inside his hostel room. 

 "We have been mentoring new resident doctors at the beginning of academic session. There is also a helpline for resident doctors. Don't take any stress and talk about your issues to anyone of us. We are there to resolve it and bring it to the notice of the seniors. Suicide is not the solution to any problem," said a resident doctor. 
 
 Institute director   called Dr Krishnaprasath a brilliant student and said his demise was a loss not only to his family but also the PGI. While acknowledging that there is stress in the profession and the resident doctors share most of the burden of the hospital, dean academics Dr Rajesh Kumar said, "There is lot of rush in the hospital as compared to earlier times. However, Dr Krishnaprasath, as told by his parents, expected too much from himself. He was not happy with his performance."
 
 About 7,500-8,000 patients come to PGI OPDs on daily basis and the emergency is overcrowded with 200% bed occupancy. During their training, the junior resident doctors are posted in the emergency room under the supervision of senior residents and consultants. 
 
 "As the junior resident doctors are lowest in the hierarchy, even nurses do not listen to them. At times, they have to even pull a patient's trolley and take blood samples, which should be done by other supporting staff," said a doctor.
