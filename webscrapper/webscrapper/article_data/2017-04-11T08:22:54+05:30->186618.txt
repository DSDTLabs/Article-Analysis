NEW DELHI: India on Monday put on hold the release of around a dozen Pakistani prisoners, scheduled for Wednesday, in a move apparently prompted by the death sentence to former Indian naval officer   by aPakistani military court.

 “The time is not right for release of the Pakistani prisoners,” a senior officer said when asked the reason for the sudden change in plan.
 
 India and Pakistan have been releasing each other’s citizens –– including fishermen, convicts who had completed their sentences, people who had overstayed after expiry of their visa or had inadvertently crossed over –– from time to time as a goodwill gesture.
 
 In March, India had released 39 Pakistani prisoners in a reciprocal gesture after   freed 218 Indian fishermen in January.
 
 Islamabad had also released Indian soldier   who had inadvertently strayed into PoK in January. India later responded by dropping charges against two PoK youth arrested by the   for helping terrorists responsible for the   attack, and sending them home.
