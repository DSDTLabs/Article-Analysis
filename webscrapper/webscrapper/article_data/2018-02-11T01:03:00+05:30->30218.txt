Coimbatore: The forest department on Saturday put up three cages with meat as the bait to trap the leopard, which killed a a four-year-old boy on Thursday, at Nadumalai tea estate and Valparai town. They also installed 20 cameras to monitor the animal’s movement. 

  M Syed Islam, a native of Assam, was standing outside his house at Nadumalai estate quarters in Valparai on February 8 around 7.15 pm when the leopard attacked him and dragged his body half-a-km away from his house.
 
 Subsequently, to avoid any more untoward incident, Valparai forest range officer P Sakthivel and his team installed three cages with meat to trap the leopard. “We have also installed 20 cameras in different parts of the estate to monitor the movement of the leopard. After capturing the big cat, we plan to shift it to some other forest range in the Anaimalai Tiger Reserve,” Sakthivel said.
 
 Muhammed Shabab, district forest officer (incharge), Pollachi forest division told TOI he had asked tea estate workers staying in the company uarters not to come out of their houses at night, besides keeping their children along with them.
 
 “People of Valparai are also requested not to dispose of waste meat in the estate area or on roadsides. This could attract the leopard. We have formed three special teams to conduct patrol round-the-clock,” he said.
