Bhopal: A day after the carcass of a tiger was found near Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve (BTR), another critically injured tiger was found in the same area on Sunday evening. Like the decomposed carcass which was spotted near Damokhar, close to the farmhouse of a former BJP MLA on Saturday, the injured tiger was also found in the same area. Officials said that the carcass was of a two-year-old cub and it could have been injured in the fight between a male tiger and the T-16 tigress that took place in the same area on March 29. The age of the rescued tiger is yet to be ascertained by the park officials.  “During a search in the area, a team lead by an elephant found the injured tiger lying in a water body. It took a lot of time to rescue the animal, as it was in water had to be tranquilized and we had to ensure that it kept its head above water. The animal is presently in a cage. We are yet to ascertain the age of the tiger,” field BTR director Mridul Pathak told TOI.  He said, “The tiger has sustained critical injuries on his shoulder and back.” A total of eight tiger deaths have been reported in the state this year and 33 tigers have died in the state in the past 19 months, the highest in the country. Last week, a tiger was found dead in Raisen district of Madhya Pradesh.
