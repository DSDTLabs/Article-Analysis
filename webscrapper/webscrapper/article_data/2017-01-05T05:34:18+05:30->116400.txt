THANE: An Allahabad family, in a six-year legal battle against a transport firm and public sector insurance firm, was awarded Rs 22 lakh compensation by the Thane Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) for the untimely death of the family bread-winner in an accident on   in 2011.

 The family of Niyaz Ansari (42) had moved the tribunal pleading that his death deprived his widow, two minor sons, three minor daughters and father of a steady income.
 
 Ansari, who supervised labourers at a private firm in  , was riding a motorcycle on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad highway. As he reached the junction of Fountain Hotel at  , a dumper from the opposite direction dashed his motorcycle, causing grievous injuries. Ansari was rushed to hospital but succumbed that day.
 
 A case was registered against the dumper driver for offences punishable under sections 279, 337 and 338 of Indian Penal Code and under section 184 of the Motor Vehicles Act.
 
 The Ansaris claimed that at the time of death, Ansari's monthly income was Rs 11,200, and sought compensation from the dumper owner and insurance firm.
 
  appeared for the claimants, while advocate Kalpana Trivedi represented the insurance company. The case was decided ex parte against the dumper ow ner, as he failed to appear before the tribunal.
 
 Since Ansari's mother, who was also a claimant, died in July 2016, her name was deleted from the claim.
 
 MACT president and principal district judge S M   ordered Mahalakshmi Enterprises and New India Assurance Co to make the payment with 9% interest per annum, from the date of application in January 2011. The tribunal awarded a total of Rs 21.81 lakh, which included loss of dependency and funeral expenses. It directed that it be given to the victim's children, to be invested in fixed deposits for them.
