VELLORE: The picture of highly decomposed bodies of five men floating in   tank in   district brought back memories of the twin encounters that claimed the lives of 20 TN men deep inside the Seshachalam Reserve Forest in neighbouring  . The incident brought to the fore again demand of activists for a high level judicial inquest or a   into unreported killings and disappearance of tribals in the AP forest area.

 Activists claim that the special task force constituted to protect   from smugglers has resulted in the death of several tribals, who resort to felling of the precious wood to make quick money. “Poverty and lack of livelihood force the men from the tribal villages into the illegal act of smuggling. Many pay with their lives,” said A Chandramohan, vice-president of All India People Forum.
 
 Several men were killed while several more have disappeared in the Seshachalam forest of the Eastern Ghats after the twin encounters. The AP police, particularly the task force, has covered up the killing of woodcutters to avoid legal tangle, he said.
 
 The activist also pleaded with the National Tribal Welfare Commission and Human Rights Commission to take appropriate action. “We appeal to the high court of Hyderabad and the Supreme Court to take up the case suo motu to stop the policemen carrying out the spree of killings in the name of protecting red sanders trees,” he said.
 
 Kesavan of Irumbulli village on the foothills of Jawadhu Hills was lured by an agent into the AP forest along with 20 other men with big promises. They left the village in mid-December, but he did not return home. 
 
 “Within a couple of days, the men who accompanied Kesavan, returned. They said Kesavan was not lucky. He was killed along with three others by the task force,” said a man close to Kesavan’s family. The agent who took Kesavan hushed up the issue by paying his family “blood money” of Rs 1.5 lakh. Several men like Kesvan have been killed in the past two years.
