 Pawan Garg, deputy excise and taxation commissioner, Ludhiana, said, “The tax rate on finished sewing machine and majority of its parts is 12% only. The confusion about tax rate is only for one part as we have received a memorandum from some of the businessmen asking about the tax rate applicable on the shafts which are used in sewing machines and other industries as well. We are working on their query and they will be informed about the tax rate soon.”
