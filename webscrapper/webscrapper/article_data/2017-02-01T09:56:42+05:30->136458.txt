BENGALURU: While the nation was coping with   and its impact on the growth rate, which is reflected in the Economic Survey, Bengaluru has been lax in property tax collection.

 Outlining the failure of local urban bodies in cities in mobilizing resources, the survey gives details of an exercise undertaken to assess the property tax potential of two growing cities ­­ Bengaluru and Jaipur. In its re mark, the survey said: “The results estimate that currently Bengaluru and Jaipur are collecting no more than 5% to 20% of the property tax potential.“
 
 This effectively means that the city is unable to mop up 80% of   through property tax. Chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian, while tweeting about it on Tuesday, said: “Property Tax Potential Unexplained: Satellite Data shows 80% untapped urban built-up.“
 
 The finance ministry used satellite images from Landsat, and took extracts of building agglomerations and arrived at an aggregate built-up estimate for the city.
 
 The survey said: “The building density on the ground provides an estimate of total built-up area (in square feetkm), which when interacted with zone specific guidance value of property tax per unit area gives an aggregate sum of potential property tax to be collected.“
 
 Using this methedology for 784sqkm of the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), the ministry estimated that a whopping 50% of the city is under the builtup area category .
 
 Studying images in conjunction with BBMP data, the Economic Survey estimated that Bengaluru has a potential of collecting up to 4-7 times ts current property tax revenue. The tax collection for 2016 has been estimated at Rs 3,151.23 crore, which includes Rs 1,952 crore tax collected in the current year and Rs 1,199 crore through arrears.
