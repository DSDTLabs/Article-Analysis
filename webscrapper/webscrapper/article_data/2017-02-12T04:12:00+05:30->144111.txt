Ahmedabad: One or more gangs of thieves managed to target seven shops in three commercial complexes at Balolnagar, Akhbarnagar and Nirnaynagar in a single night. Vadaj and Ranip police stations registered separate complaints for these attempted thefts.

 City police officials said one commercial complex near Akhbarnagar reported three incidents of locks on shutters broken whereas two complexes in Balolnagar and Nirnaynagar reported two attempts each. Police claimed nothing was reported stolen by the owners of the establishments. “The modus operandi is the same in all three incidents. It is possible that the same gang started off on an almost-straight path and tried to steal valuables,” said an official. tnn
