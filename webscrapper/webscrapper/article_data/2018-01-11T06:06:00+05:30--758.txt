Nagpur: After granting enough time to schools to submit fitness certificates of buses ferrying pupils, the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Wednesday directed the RTO to stop operation of school buses of eight institutions, which have failed to comply with directives. The RTO has informed that they have been unable to trace four of these schools.

 The court’s crackdown came while hearing suo motu PIL into the tragic death of nine-year-old Virat Zade, a student of Central India Public School, on January 9, 2011. Peeved with poor response from schools, the court had slapped 5,000 fine on 125 institutions during one of the hearings.
 
 Later, the HC issued a bailable warrant of Rs25,000 against 90 of 126 schools, which failed to respond. Some of them responded then, but a majority failed to comply with the directives. The HC then directed cancellation of warrants against those who submitted proper reply.
 
 After repeated directives and dead lines, these eight schools are the last of the 126 yet to submit replies, forcing the court to act strongly for disregarding its directives.
 
 Earlier, amicus curiae Firdous Mirza pointed out that out of 25,369 school buses in Maharashtra, only 13,440 had passed fitness test of RTO as per court’s orders. However, the rest 12,000 are still plying on roads, including in the city, risking lives of children. The schools were told to constitute ‘school bus committees’, which again are yet to be set up.
 
 He added that the Directorate of Primary Education’s circular of February 6 made it mandatory for schools to install CCTVs in buses and premises. It also prescribed police verification of the staff. He contended that CCTVs were neither fitted in any school bus nor school premises. Even women staff is not provided on buses wherever it is compulsory, he said.
