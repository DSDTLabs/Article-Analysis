Indore: Police on Wednesday solved the mystery behind the murder of a scribe and arrested two persons for slitting his throat after summoning him to an isolated spot in Kshipra area.

 The deceased, Shyam Sharma, a resident of Ansal township, was stabbed to death near a soy factory on May 15. His wife Simran had lodged a complaint and indicated that the murder could be a result of enmity with his tenant.
 
 Police followed the line of investigation and tried to trace down Jitendra Malviya, who had rented Sharma’s house in Manglia area. The teams raided his probable locations in Tonkkhurd, Dewas, Sanwer, Ujjain and Tarana, but he could not be traced down.
 
 After getting a tip-off that Malviya had committed the crime with his brother-in-law Uday alias Uddu, a resident of Baroli, teams traced down Uday and took him into custody, Kshipra police said in a release.
 
 During interrogation, Uday confessed having slit Sharma’s throat and escaped with Malviya on the latter’s morotcycle from the crime scene.
 
 The accused had summoned Sharma on the pretext of paying his rent. As he reached the designated spot on a car, Malviya and Uday asked him to open the car window. They then slit his throat and fled the scene, said police. 
 
 A man passing through the area in a truck saw Sharma lying in a pool of blood and rushed to his help. He took him to a private hospital nearby from where he was referred to MY Hospital where he was declared brought dead.
 
 Police have arrested Malviya and Uday for murder. The motorcycle and the knife used in the crime were also confiscated.
 
 The murder had led to several protests in the city with demands being raised for quick and punitive action against the killers.
