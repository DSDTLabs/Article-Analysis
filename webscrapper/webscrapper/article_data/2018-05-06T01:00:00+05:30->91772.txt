The slice-of-life film is laden with tongue-in-cheek humour and revolves around members of a dysfunctional family and how they react in the face of an impending tragedy. The film has an ensemble cast including some of the popular names in comedy such as Manoj Pahwa,  ,  ,   and Sanah Kapoor among others. They promise to give cine-goers a glimpse into the lives of the most entertaining ‘Item Family’!
 
 Speaking about the film, actor-turned-director Harsh Chhaya says, "Khajoor Pe Atke is inspired by my own experiences with people around me – family, friends, neighbours and life in general. It is born out of incidences from within my family. In a way, one can say it is autobiographical and everyone can relate to it, as every Indian family has experienced such hilarity during an emotional crisis."
 
 Producer Amrit Sethia adds, "When Harsh narrated the film to me, we instantly fell in love with the story. We felt, if it sounds so good during the narration, then how amazing it will be when viewed on screen. Also, the fact that every single person will be able to identify with at least one of the characters and see them in some family member of their own, is what makes this film so relatable. It’s a complete family entertainer for all age groups. A subtle yet sensible comedy, the film celebrates life and death at its best."
 
 'Khajoor Pe Atke', presented by S.O.I.E, produced by Welcome Films Productions, and distributed by PVR Pictures, releases on May 18.
