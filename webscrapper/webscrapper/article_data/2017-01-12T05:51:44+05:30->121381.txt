NEW DELHI: A   report on the quality of food served to soldiers posted at the border has said that the daal which jawan Tej bahadur Yadav claimed to be “watery” was part of tinned rations, but failed to come up with a satisfactory explanation as to how the “parathas” shown in Yadav’s video were “burnt”. “The probe will find out if the paranthas were ill-cooked and burnt by the cooks or otherwise.

 There could be a possibility of them being extra-hauled over coal,” sources in the BSF said even as they denied Yadav’s charges that only one paratha was served to the soldiers posted at the line of control along the Indo-Pak border.
 
 The BSF submitted on Wednesday a report to the home ministry on allegations made by constable Tej Bahadur Yadav’s in a series of videos uploaded on a social media site which later went viral. Officials said the report has found certain deficiencies that need to be corrected vis-a-vis cooking and supply of food in hygienic and stipulated quantity as per established rules. BSF director general K K Sharma himself submitted the interim report to the   . T
