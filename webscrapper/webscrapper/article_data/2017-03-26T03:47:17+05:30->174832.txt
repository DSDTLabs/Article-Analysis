KOLKATA: Embarrassed with the role of ace lawyers and AICC leaders   and   who took the Mamata Banerjee government's brief in the Supreme Court, Pradesh Congress president Adhir Chowdhury took out a protest rally in the city on Saturday demanding removal of the Narada accused from their posts to reassure Congress ranks that the party's Bengal unit isn't going to spare the state government on this issue. 

 "They are professionals. It seemed that they had put professionalism ahead of their political identity," said PCC president Adhir Chowdhury. "We have already clarified that none of them would be invited in any of the   here," he said. Chowdhury had made the same remark when Kapil Sibal had come down to Kolkata to argue for Saradha scam accused Trinamool leader Madan Mitra's bail plea. To some of the Congress seniors, the repeat of such a stance appears to be a calculated move by the Congress high command.
 
 In a bid to shrug off the embarrassment, Chowdhury said Mamata Banerjee she was now trying to curry favour with L K Advani who is the chairperson of the Parliamentary Ethics Committee. " The reason is that the Ethics Committee has been sitting on the Narada tapes, even after some of the senior Trinamool MPs were seen taking money," Chowdhury said.
