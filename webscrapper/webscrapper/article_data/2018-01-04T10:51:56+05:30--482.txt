RAJKOT: In a bizarre incident, as many as 10 girl students of a private school in Bhuj inflicted injuries on their wrists and   even as the reason for such a step remained a mystery. 

 All these girls are studying in class X at the  , one of the reputed educational institutes in the town.
 
 The incident came to light on Tuesday when one of the class teachers got to know about a girl who had slit her wrist. She called her and the girl revealed that nine others had also done the same in the last three days. The shocked teacher immediately informed the principal who then called the parents of the girls. The injuries were inflicted using the blade of pencil sharpeners, sources said. 
 
 Principal   was not available for comments despite repeated attempts. The school is run by Jain Medical and Educational Trust.
 
 Sources said that the girls started weeping on being questioned about the injuries. Therefore, they were allowed to go without further probe. However, it is strongly suspected that the girls inflicted the wounds under the influence of Blue Whale game.
 
 Kutch’s in-charge district education officer (DEO)  , who also visited the school, confirmed that the girls had slit their wrists. “The injuries were not serious and none of them had to be hospitalized. But it is still a mystery as to why the girls indulged in such an act,” Vaghela told TOI.
