BENGALURU: Access to very foundational amenities — potable water, power, better schools and roads — is what matters to voters in the upcoming   elections, according to a survey by civil society research organization  .

  
 For both urban and rural voters, poor access to potable water seems to have irked the people, thanks to consecutive years of drought in the state.
 
 The survey spoke to 13,300 respondents in the 18-45 age group across Karnataka’s 224 constituencies. The respondents were picked randomly — about 50 from each constituency, and that included students, farmers, housewives and professionals.
 
 Eight of 10 respondents called water supply the hotbutton issue. They flagged power and schools as the next big ones. People across the state were more concerned about water drains and sewerage, food distribution subsidy and job opportunities.
 
 On the ground, though, the   and   are focusing on corruption as the main poll plank, with CM Siddaramaiah claiming to have delivered 99% on his party’s manifesto. The BJP has been attacking the Congress on law and order too; the Congress, in its fightback, has been lashing out at the   government for doing little to generate jobs or boost the economy.
 
 The survey’s objective was to find out voters’ expectations, perception and evaluation of important issues in their constituencies to improve their living conditions, a Daksh spokesman said.
