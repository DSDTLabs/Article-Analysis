Pune: A 40-year-old fabrication and civil contractor hailing from Beed in Marathwada region was found murdered under mysterious circumstances in the bathroom of his house at Sangvi here on Monday morning. A Sangvi police team which arrived at the scene of the crime found chilli powder strewn all over the house. Police said, prima facie, circumstances have indicated that the victim, Kailas Taur, was bludgeoned to death by unidentified person(s) after throwing chilli powder in his eyes. Senior inspector Ajay Chandkhede told TOI, “It is suspected that Taur was having an extra marital affair. We suspect that the person(s) not happy with his illicit relationship killed him. Taur was assaulted with some blunt and heavy object. There were injury marks on his forehead above his eyes and another one behind his ear. A post mortem report has confirmed use of heavy and blunt object for killing him.”  Chandkhede said, “Taur had returned home alone after dropping his children and wife at Beed, their native place, for some family function. The Taur family had shifted to Pune about five years back. Prior to the murder, which is suspected to have taken place on Sunday night, Taur and four others, including his two workers, had drinks at his residence. We have obtained some important leads from the scene of the crime and are questioning the workers and other people, who were present at the drinking party. We hope to arrest the suspects soon.” Chandkhede said that Taur used to take contract jobs for fabrication and civil works in Pimpri Chinchwad and adjoining areas. The incident came to light on Monday morning after Taur did not respond to the knocks on the door by milkman and neighbours, who, in turn, alerted the police. “Taur was found lying motionless in the bathroom when the police moved into his apartment. He was rushed to a hospital where he was declared dead. We suspect that something went wrong in the party, which may have resulted in the murder,” he added.
