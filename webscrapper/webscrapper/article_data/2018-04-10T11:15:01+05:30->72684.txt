PUNE: A sessions court here on Monday rejected the anticipatory bail plea of Amol Ghule, a trader from Gultekdi Market Yard, who has been booked by the Bund Garden police in a case of attempt to murder on a rival panel member during the   state cooperative federation polls on March 19. 

 According to the FIR lodged by the victim on April 2, Ghule put his licensed revolver on the victim’s stomach and threatened him with dire consequences during a commotion that prevailed at the cooperatives federation building on March 19. Ghule had since moved an application for anticipatory bail which was heard by additional sessions judge Dilip Murumkar. 
 
 Additional public prosecutor Premkumar Agarwal had opposed the   citing a report submitted by the Bund Garden police’s senior inspector M M Mujawar. The police stated in the report that Ghule’s name figures in the FIR and that they wanted to recover the revolver used in the alleged crime and also verify from where he had sourced the firearm. 
 
 The police report further stated that the investigators wanted to establish involvement of any other person in the crime and, if released on bail, the accused might influence or pressurise the witnesses and desist them from speaking the truth. Also, the possibility of danger to the life of the victim from the accused cannot be ruled out, the report stated. 
 
 Ghule’s lawyer Prasad Kulkarni told TOI, “The anticipatory bail plea has been rejected after a hearing on merits, but we will move an appeal against the same in the Bombay high court as our case is that our client has been falsely implicated in the case by a candidate who lost the polls. We had brought to the court’s notice the inordinate delay in the registration of FIR for an incident that is alleged to have occurred almost two weeks back.”
