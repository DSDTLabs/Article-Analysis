Popular comedy show 'Khichdi' recently returned with a second season, but it hasn’t been able to rekindle the old magic. The show, which was launched amidst much fanfare on April 14, will air its last episode on June 22. '  2', starring  ,  , Rajeev Mehta, Anang Desai and Vandana Vaidya opened well, but couldn’t sustain the ratings. One of the main reasons for this was the recently-concluded ' ' (' ').
 
 Producer JD Majethia told BT, “IPL this year has affected ratings of TV shows, especially the weekend programmes. I wish we had stuck to the original launch date of our show, which was supposed to be in June.” He adds, “Our viewers have appreciated the show and we are happy with their response. This was planned as a finite show and we will wrap up later this month.”
