NEW DELHI: Admitting that money power is a malady which sometimes reduces the election process into a “mere farce”, the   has told the Supreme Court that it must be made mandatory for   to disclose their   along with that of their spouse and dependents. 

 In an affidavit, the poll panel said it is necessary for “healthier democracy” that voters get to know the source of income of aspiring candidates and family members. Under the present law, a candidate is required to disclose details of assets and liabilities for self, spouse and three dependents in Form 26 while filing nomination paper but not the source of income. 
 
 “The information about source(s) of income of candidates, their spouses and dependents will be a step in the direction of enhancing transparency and should form part of the declaration of Form 26. The commission has already requested the ministry of law and justice to consider the proposed amendments,” it said. 
 
 The Commission filed its reply on a PIL by NGO Lok Prahri seeking the court’s direction to amend the   to make it mandatory for candidates to disclose the source of their income and that of their family members. “The increasing role of money power in elections... is one of the maladies which sometimes reduces the process of election into a mere farce by placing some privileged candidates with financial resources in a distinctly advantageous position.... The result of such an election cannot reflect the true choice of the people,” the panel said. 
 
 The commission also told the court that the law should be amended to provide punishment of a two-year jail term to candidates for filing a false affidavit, enhancing it from the present six-month period. The panel also suggested that a provision should be made for disqualification of an elected representative in the event that his family member or any of the companies associated with him has business interest in government.
