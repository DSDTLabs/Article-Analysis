  Frequent shampooing has no effect — positive or negative — on hairloss. Hereditary  , in fact, is not because of hair falling out, but because of hair being replaced by finer, thinner hair. 
 
 
 
 Untrue. Because hair is thicker at its base compared to the tip, so hair will appear thicker for few days after a cut. It has no effect on the number of hair sprouting from your follicles.
 
 
 
 As much as you’d expect it to be that way, it’s not the truth. There’s no drug that will change the number of follicles in your head. 
 
 
 
 There’s no gold rule to the number of hair strands lost daily. It’s normal only if you are suffering from male pattern baldness. 
 
 
 
 Yes, blow drying can damage your hair and it can fall out eventually, but it also grows back. It does not cause hairfall. 
 
 
 
 Hair treatments such as colouring or bleaching are hard on your hair. But they won’t result in hairloss. If the chemical is strong, hair can break out from the scalp but that’s all. 
 
 
 
 Once hairloss begins, it progresses over a person’s lifetime and never really stops. The rate at which your hair will begin to shed depends from person to person.
