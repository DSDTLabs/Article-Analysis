LUDHIANA: A youth was killed and seven relatives were injured after three persons attacked the family with sharp-edged weapons at   village on late Wednesday night.

 The deceased was identified as Chandar Bose, 27. Those injured in the attack were Chandar’s father Paleram, sisters Lakshmi, Sumitra, Sonam, Seema and brothers Monu and Ashu. The family members, who worked at a brick kiln in the village, were having dinner when the attack took place.
 
 Sources said on Tuesday, Chandar’s sister Sonam had told him that one  , who worked at same brick kiln, had often been teasing her. Later, Chandar had an argument with Yashpal.
 
 In a revenge act,   accompanied by his sister-in-law Sudesha and niece Alka attacked the family on Wednesday night.
 
 While Chandar suffered serious head injuries, his family received minor injuries.
 
 Despite repeated attempts, neither 100 police helpline nor 108 ambulance responded to the calls made by Paleram. Meanwhile, a truck which was crossing the spot took the injured to the Ludhiana civil hospital where Chandar was declared dead.
 
 Father Paleram said, “Yashpal used to tease my daughter and when she complained to Chandar, he had a fight with Yashpal. On Wednesday, the matter was resolved after Yashpal apologized for his act before Chandar. However, in the night Yashpal came with several persons and attacked us.”
 
 He also alleged, “We dialed 100 and 108, but nobody responded to the calls. I was standing on the road with my injured son to seek help.”
 
 On the complaint of Paleram, the police booked Yashpal, Sudesha and Alka under Sections 302 (murder) and 34 (act done by several persons) of IPC. The assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Sahnewal, said, “The accused carried an axe and sticks when they attacked Chandar and his family.” 
 
 The accused have been arrested, the ACP added.
