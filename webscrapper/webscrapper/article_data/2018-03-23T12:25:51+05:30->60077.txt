NAGPUR: The mismatch of roll numbers belonging to medal winners remained unchanged on Thursday, even as   (NU) organized a press conference to announce the names of toppers for its 105 convocation on Saturday.

 TOI has been highlighting how NU goofed up in the merit order and medal list, indicating they were prepared hurriedly. Confirming this, director of board of examinations and evaluation   said officials got only seven days to prepare the merit order and medal list. “March 14 was the cut off, but objections and complaints kept coming in till March 17,” Khaty said.
 
 On Wednesday, it also came to fore that the online result gazette for 2017 summer examination, degrees for which would be awarded at this convocation, was not on the website. The gazette link is active but no result is displayed when it is clicked.
 
 Khaty said, “Marksheets of only previous two examinations are made available through the gazette.”
 
 Some teachers had said earlier marks of toppers could be checked by referring to online gazette. “It was important for NU to come clean before the convocation,” they said.
 
 On March 20, TOI had reported the controversy over MA (English) topper. In the latest review of final medal list, it was found that the topper’s   and total marks are the same, despite objection by another student who scored more marks but less CGPA. The declared topper would be receiving four gold medals.
 
 Khaty said he will get the corrections done. However, till late on Thursday evening no new file was uploaded by NU regarding merit and medal list.
