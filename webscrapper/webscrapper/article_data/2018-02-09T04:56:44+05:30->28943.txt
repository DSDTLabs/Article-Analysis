The director general of police's (DGP) office has decided to act tough with personnel using alternative channels to get transfers and postings of their choice. 

 An internal communication was issued after the office received recommendation letters along with applications of officers in the run-up to general transfers, for which the establishment has started collecting lists from across the state. The development stunned many in the police department as it is probably for the first time that such a communication has been issued along with names of persons who made recommendations.
 
 The home department, along with the police establishment, have decided to complete this year's transfers by April 30. The office also issued a list of 42 inspectors who have approached them through others, while dubbing the action as a violation of service rules.
 
 The communication to unit commanders was attached with names of officers, their postings and names of VIPs whose letters and recommendations they have used to get their choice postings. The VIPs who have made recommendations include women and child welfare minister Pankaja Munde, education minister Vinod Tawde and several MLAs, MLCs and   office-bearers. 
 
  told the commanders to issue the inspectors show-cause notices as to why action should not be initiated against them for violation of service rules. The February 2 letter told officers to get clarifications and send detailed reports to the DG's office by February 15.
 
 A senior officer said the officers had tried to influence higher-ups for postings, transfers, departmental inquiries and other things. An additional DG told TOI, "The department is serious about keeping a check on attempts of external influence, especially when it comes to administrative subjects like transfers and postings." The communication was sent to eight of 10 police commissionorates, including Mumbai city, Thane,  , Pune, Mumbai railway police, Amravati, Nagpur and Solapur.
