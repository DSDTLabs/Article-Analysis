PATIALA: Punjab's police officers knew that there might be an attempt to free dreaded gangsters from the Nabha high security jail a good five months before the jailbreak took place. And it wasn't just a vague intelligence input. This was stated in an FIR registered on June 3, 2016. 

 The FIR, registered at the Kotwali police station, clearly states that the jailed gangsters' aides, Harminder Singh Romy and three others, may try to free their associates. The cops made the observations after spotting Romy in and around Nabha along with three others. The police station is 1.1km from the Nabha jail.
 
 Interestingly, the FIR adds that this information had been wirelessly communicated to the district headquarters and a copy of the report had been sent to the area magistrate. TOI has a copy of the June FIR which states that the men were moving around in a white Honda City car bearing the number PB 11 AX 9515. It was also established that the number plate was fake and that the car could have been stolen.
 
 On November 27, 2016, gangster   and four others had escaped from the jail along with alleged Khalistani terrorist Harminder Mintoo after their aides had stormed the jail. This had created a major security scare ahead of the Punjab assembly elections. While Mintoo was arrested the next day, most of the other escaped gangsters had remained out of reach all through the election until Sekhon was nabbed on Sunday.
 
 TOI had reported on Tuesday that Romy, who has jumped bail, is living in Hong Kong and had coordinated between the escaped jailbirds.
