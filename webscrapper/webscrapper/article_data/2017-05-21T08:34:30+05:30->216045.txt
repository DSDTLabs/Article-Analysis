PUNE: For  , the   is not between  . For her, it is between her and her grandfather.

 “It is a battle between me and my grandfather this Sunday. He is a Sachin fan and I love Dhoni, so we have our teams sorted. The three times that Pune and Mumbai have faced each other, it was all about taunting and teasing. 
 
 I expect more taunts in the final. After all the matches that Mumbai has lost, my grandfather is still hopeful that they will win in the final. We have also agreed on a ‘mastani treat’. If Pune lose, I shall have to treat him and if Mumbai lose, he will treat me,” said the 20-year-old, who lives with her grandparents in Narayan Peth.

 “The madness of IPL started long ago in my house as it was the first time Pune was performing so well. Though they played in the last season, they performed poorly. 
 
 Every time Pune plays, my kids get all dressed in their jerseys and act like they are in the stadium. Since it is a Sunday, my sister and her kids are coming over to watch the finals with us. So, I am expecting a lot of fun,” said   (32), a resident of Camp.
