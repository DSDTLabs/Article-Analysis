GURUGRAM: A nine-month-old   that was rescued from Old Gurugram on Friday is being treateated for its wounds under the watch of the district  . 

 Anil Gandas, a wildlife enthusiast, had rescued the cat when he was told about it by a resident of Laxman Vihar. “It is a young Indian Palm Civet Cat, and it was found stuck inside a car that was parked outside a house in Laxman Vihar. As it looked very different from other stray animals, people called me to rescue it. We immediately reached the spot and recognised it to be a civet cat. We then called the wildlife department to treat the cat.”
 
 “We saw that a strange looking animal was stuck in the car. It looked very different from the stray animals we usually find in the area. Initially we were very scared, but we found that it was injured and weak. So, we called the wildlife activist,” said a resident of Laxman Vihar who saw the cat first, requesting anonymity.
 
 Dr. Ashok Khasa, a veterinarian surgeon, told TOI: “The treatment of the cat is going on as it had some injuries near its tail. However, the animal is recovering very well. We have fed the cat two eggs today and thankfully the animal has taken the feed. I think we will be able to rehabilitate it into the wild by Friday.” 
 
 When asked how the wild animal could have strayed into Laxman Vihar, Gandas said: “The Palm Civet cat feeds on birds’ eggs. It is possible that the cat came to the area for looking birds’ eggs. Sometimes, they find nests in vacant plots in the area.”
