LUCKNOW: While water scarcity has turned into a big issue in the city, chronic leakage in water pipeline at three spots has resulted in wastage of hundreds of litres of water daily. So acute is the problem that candidates coming for campaigning are being asked by residents to first get the leakage fixed. 

 The three spots are the main road in Bulaki Adda, near   at Munshipulia and outside the mini stadium in Rajajipuram. Water has been pouring out of the broken line constantly for months. “Because of the continuous leakage, a puddle has formed on the main road. Apart from water wastage, it makes the road slippery,” said  , a resident of Aishbagh.
 
 “We have decided that we will question all the candidates. They make multiple promises ahead of elections but later, do not pay attention to even the basic issues,” said  , a resident. Ravi Sinha, a trader from Sukh Complex in Indiranagar, says that water leakage outside his shop has been on for over eighteen months now. Corporation workers have fixed it temporarily a few times but the repair lasts for a maximum of four days. “Shopkeepers have got it repaired at their own expense many times but the leakage doesn’t stop permanently. Because of so much leakage, there’s waterlogging. Garbage is also dumped in the stagnant water that breeds bacteria and mosquitoes right in the middle of the market.” Jal Kal general manager Sanjay Sinha said, “We do not get information about all the leakages. I will enquire and get the pipelines fixed.”
