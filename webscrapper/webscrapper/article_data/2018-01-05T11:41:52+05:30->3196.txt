SURAT: Rumours have been rife since Thursday morning that   MLA from Choriyasi in Surat Jankhana Patel has sought ministerial berth in the Vijay Rupani-led government in Gujarat. Patel, however, denied that she has demanded any ministerial berth.

 The senior BJP leaders in Surat feel that Surat has not got adequate representation in the Rupani government. Only Varachha MLA Kumar Kanani has been inducted as minister from the Diamond City. BJP had won on all the 12 seats in Surat city. Chief minister Rupani has been in fire fighting mode ever since he took charge for his second innings. First it was deputy chief minister Nitin Patel who did not mince words in expressing his disappointment over portfolio allocation. Then came minister of state for fisheries  , backed by Koli community leader, demanding bigger ministry. Even before Rupani could resolve Solanki’s grievance, there were rumours that five-time MLA from   and Choriyasi MLA Jankhana Patel have demanded ministerial berths. Patel, who belongs to the Koli Patel community, had won her second term with a huge margin of 1.10 lakh votes. She was elected for the first time in 2016 byelections after the death of her father  . 
 
 Talking to TOI, Patel said, “I have not made any demands of this nature. I am happy that people are with me. This is enough for me. I have not asked for ministerial berth and won’t ask for it in future.” 
 
 However, senior BJP leaders in Surat said that they expected at least three ministers, including one woman, from Surat as two BJP women had won from the Diamond City. “It is not fair that state BJP ignores Surat’s right to proper representation,” a senior BJP leader from the city said.
