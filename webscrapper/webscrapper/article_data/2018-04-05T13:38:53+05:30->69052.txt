PATNA: Two days after Bharat bandh called by   organisations against alleged dilution of the SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, former   minister   Ram on Wednesday threatened to raise the demand of a separate country for dalits, which was once envisioned by B R  , if the Centre and state governments failed to protect the rights of dalits.

 “Prior to Independence, there were demands for separate countries for Muslims and dalits. Pakistan was created, but Ambedkar agreed to join the Jawaharlal Nehru cabinet only after the then top leaders assured that dalits would be provided opportunity to live life with dignity. But today, the statutory provisions meant to protect SC/ ST members are being snatched,” Ram told TOI over the phone.
 
 A senior functionary of the   faction of JD-U, Ram also said nine dalits died during the bandh on April 2. “They should be declared martyrs,” he demanded.
 
 Ram said he would talk to the RJD, Congress and JD(U)’s Sharad faction on the issue and urge them to launch a joint campaign to protect the rights SCs and STs.
 
 On March 20, the Supreme Court ruled that the arrest of an accused under the SC/ST Act won’t be mandatory and any coercive action would be taken only after preliminary inquiry into complaints and sanction by a competent authority.
