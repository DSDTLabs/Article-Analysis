MUMBAI: A   employee who allegedly stole Rs 28 lakh from an   belonging to his own branch in   (E) was arrested after an 18-month police chase. Hitesh   (32) was found in the Naxal-hit   district in  , where he had started a fairground stall rental business presumably with the stolen money.

 Pathak, who hails from UP and holds an MA degree, worked in the bank’s technical department, where he gained the confidence of his senior to work as a cash custodian, said DCP (zone X)  . In that capacity, he was assigned the job of refilling cash in ATMs. On July 26, 2016, he went to refill an ATM in the evening and deliberately created a fault. The next day, he was asked to check the fault. He used this opportunity to steal Rs 28 lakh. The ATM room’s   camera recorded him stuffing a bag with cash, which he had filled the machine with just the evening before.
 
 
 An Andheri police team almost zeroed in on Pathak’s location in UP in 2016, but he gave them the slip. A few days ago, he was traced to Garhwa on the basis of his cellphone’s location. A police team, led by senior inspector  , kept watch on him for a week before nabbing him on the evening of January 16, when he arrived to get the day’s collection from vendors to whom he had rented out stalls at a mela (fair).
