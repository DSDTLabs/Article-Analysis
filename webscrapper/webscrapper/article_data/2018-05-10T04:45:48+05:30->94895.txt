The   on Wednesday denied bail to Mumbai jeweller,  , whose threat note aboard a Mumbai-Delhi flight in October 2017, had sparked a hijack and bomb scare. Salla had allegedly placed a chit containing a threat in a dustbin in the plane’s toilet. 

  The threat led to an emergency landing at Ahmedabad airport, following which he was booked by authorities. Investigations by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) later revealed this was Salla’s desperate attempt to revive a relationship with an employee of the airline. He became the first person in the country to be booked under the Anti-Hijacking Act and now faces life imprisonment, if convicted. 
 
  A special NIA court had rejected Salla’s bail plea in November last year. The probe agency later filed a chargesheet and Salla filed a second bail application before the high court. However, a bench of Justice S R Brahmbhatt and Justice R P Dholaria refused to grant him bail. 
 
  While Salla’s counsel argued that there was not enough evidence to implicate Salla on the basis the mere recovery of a chit with a typed message from a toilet, the NIA submitted that the investigation revealed that the chit was made at Salla’s Mumbai office. 
 
  The NIA court had denied Salla bail with the observation that using words like ‘PoK’ (Pakistan Occupied Kashmir), the use of Urdu in the chit and the indication that 12 persons were involved would naturally cause panic in the minds of the cabin crew. The threat was taken seriously and the pilot diverted the flight from its original path to make an emergency landing at the Ahmedabad airport.
