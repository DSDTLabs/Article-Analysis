NEW  : In one of the biggest heists at city showrooms in recent times, over 700 luxury watches worth Rs 2 crore were   from a shop in   on Sunday night.

 The incident took place at Gangoly Brothers showroom, situated barely few metres from Connaught Place police station. Owner of the shop, Mayank Barodia, said that the thief had knowledge about watches as he picked only high-end brands like Rado, Longines, Victorinox, Tag, Omega, Fossil and Guess.
 
 Initial probe revealed that an object was inserted as a lever beneath the shutter and was later lifted to gain entry into the showroom.
 
 “A security guard informed me about the incident. When I reached the showroom, most of the racks were empty and everything was scattered,” said Barodia.
 
 “An unclear footage was captured in a CCTV camera installed nearby. We are trying to ascertain the sequence of events,” said DCP (New Delhi) Braja Kishore Singh. Cops said that teams from forensic department visited the shop to gather evidence.
 
 Police suspect the involvement of an insider who was aware of the security lapses at the showroom. “A case has been registered under sections 457 (Lurking house-trespassing or house-breaking by night in order to commit offence punishable) of the IPC. We are also questioning the employees of the showroom,” added Singh.
