MUMBAI: The   on Thursday announced that byelections to the   and   constituencies and the Palus-Kadegaon assembly constituency will be held on May 28. Counting will take place on May 31.

 
 The bypoll for Palus-Kadegaon, which is in Sangli district, has been necessitated by the death of Congress leader Patangrao Kadam and for Palghar, which is close to Mumbai, by the death of BJP member Chintaman Wanga. Bhandara-Gondia, which is situated along Maharashtra’s border with Madhya Pradesh, will go in for the bypoll following the resignation of BJP’s Nana Patole.
 
 The BJP is likely to nominate Chintaman Wanga’s son Shriniwas from Palghar, a seat reserved for Scheduled Tribes, and the Congress may field Patangrao Kadam’s son   from the Palus-Kadegaon assembly seat.
 
 The byelection in Bhandara-Gondia is significant because Patole, who quit the BJP following differences with the party leadership and especially with PM Modi, has joined the Congress. In the 2014 LS polls, Patole had defeated NCP’s   by a huge margin. Subsequently, Patel was nominated to the Rajya Sabha. Patole has said he will not be a nominee for the bypoll. It remains to be seen if Congress and NCP will contest jointly and if BJP and Sena come together. In 2014, Sena and BJP contested LS polls jointly, while Congress and NCP had fought against each other.
