BENGALURU: Latha R came to   for Women as jail superintendent last June. Her earlier stint was with   which did not have an enclosure for women.

 “We have convicts and undertrials from across  , facing jail terms for offences ranging from murder to dowry torture. About a month ago, 26 women came here from Ballari. There are nine undertrials at present, none in solitary confinement, not usual in the case of women,“ Latha says.
 
 She ensures that the 88 inmates are on their best behaviour and remain busy.
 
 Mother of two-year-old twins, Latha spends her day juggling family and work. Her day starts with the process of unlocking prisoners' cells at 6am. The inmates assemble in the courtyard for morning prayer. While the women get busy preparing for their day, Latha remains occupied with paperwork and other administrative tasks till late in the evening.
 
 Having dealt with both men and women inmates, she says women are more tenacious in spirit. “The scope for reformation is much more here. Women tend to adjust better and like to remain busy . A majority of them are into some activity or the other ­ be it packaging spices or enrolling for a beautician's course,“ Latha says.
 
 Latha says many, in fact, save their earnings and send it home or give it to their visiting family members. “They will come to us with their savings that they would give to their visiting family members. Some send as much as Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 home,“ she says.
 
 Keeping these women busy , away from disturbing and depressing thoughts, is her what she does. “In their initial days here, they keep thinking of their families, finding it tough to reconcile with the life in jail. Vocational or livelihood training gives them a purpose and confidence to face the outside world once they are free,“ she says.
