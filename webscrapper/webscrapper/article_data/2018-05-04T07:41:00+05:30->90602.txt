Ludhiana: In a setback for city industrialists, the transporters have decided to hike freight charges by 10% owing to sharp rise in rates of diesel in the past six months.

 Appealing to manufacturers and traders to cooperate with them on the hike, terming it as unavoidable, transporters said they would soon announce the date when new rates would be applicable.
 
 Avtar Singh Grover of DS Transport said, “During the past six months, diesel prices have gone by more than Rs 9 per litre. For us, fuel is like a raw material and it has increased our cost of operations by more than 15%. But even then we have proposed a hike of only 10% as we do not want to put a huge burden on our clients.”
 
 “The government must do something to control rising fuel prices, else it will be difficult for us to continue with the transport business in the coming days,” he added.
 
 Harjinder Singh Sandhu, president of NPC transport union, said, “The hike in freight rates is unavoidable as we are already suffering huge losses every month due to rise in prices of diesel, which have now shot up by almost 18%. We have not implemented the hike as we want to give time to our clients to fix rates of their products.”
 
 Rohit Kapoor, a city-based transporter, “There is no solution for the problem of fluctuation in the rates of fuel except for bringing petrol and diesel under GST and waiving off all other taxes being charged by government. We request the Union government and GST council to work in this direction and save the transport industry.”
