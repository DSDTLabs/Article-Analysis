CHRISTCHURCH:   sauntered into the ICC Under-19 World Cup final by halting  's dream run with a six-wicket victory, built around Jack Edward's half-century after a splendid bowling show on Monday.

 
 Electing to bat, the strife-torn nation, put on board a modest 181, which was never going to be enough for the three-time champions.
 
 It was wicket-keeper batsman Ikram  , who resisted the Australian attack with a brave 80 off 119 balls, helping his side put on board something to fight for.
 
 Australia had no trouble in knocking off the required runs with opener   producing a solid 72-run knock at the top. They won by 75 balls to spare.
 
 Off-spinner  , picked up by IPL franchisee Kings XI Punjab for the next edition, had provided an early breakthrough by dismissing opener   (4) but Australia had more than able line-up to handle Afghanistan challenge.
 
 Captain Jason Singha (26) was caught and bowled by leg- spinner   after a good start and Jonathan Merlo (17) also got out cheaply after getting his eye in but by that time they needed less than 60 runs.
 
 Ahmad denied Edwards a century by cleaning him up and it was pair of   (32) and Nathan McSweeney (22) that took the side to finish line.
 
 They added 53 runs in their unbeaten fifth wicket partnership.
 
 Earlier, Afghanistan struggled to create steady partnerships. Ali Khil held the one end tight with his fighting 80-run knock, which came off 119 balls and eight boundaries, but did not get support from the other end.
 
 Seven Afghani batsmen could not manage a double-digit score as pacer Jonathan Merlo ran through the middle order.
 
 After Khil, the biggest contribution came from opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz, who scored 20 off 37 balls.
 
 Merlo accounted for four batsmen and conceded just 24 runs in his 10-over quota while his pace colleague Zak Evans scalped two batsmen for 26 runs.
 
 Australia will now take on winner of Tuesday's semi-final between arch-rivals India and Pakistan.
