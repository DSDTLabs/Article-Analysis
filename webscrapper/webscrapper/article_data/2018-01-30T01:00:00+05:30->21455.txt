In an industry where diplomacy is the keyword,   is an exception. In fact, she and her bhai Saif Ali Khan are known to speak their mind. 

 While various actresses would die to be tagged on online portals that gush about how good they look without make-up,   disagrees and calls a spade a spade. During a chat with BT, when asked about her giving audiences ‘no make-up look goals’, she said, “Rarely are there no make-up looks. When I went to the airport the other day, I had quite a bit of make-up on. So I was like, ‘I don’t understand that’ (what people are talking about).” Makes us wish if only more actresses were as outspoken as her.
