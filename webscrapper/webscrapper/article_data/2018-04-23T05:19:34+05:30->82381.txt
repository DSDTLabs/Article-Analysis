NEW DELHI: A hunt for a copy of a 1967 certificate recognising   as the ruler of Hyderabad showed many documents were missing from the government’s archives.

 
 The   ( ) has now urged the home ministry to set up a committee to identify “such files of historical importance” and ensure they are handed over to  .
 
 The order came on an   application to the home ministry, asking for a copy of the certificate issued on February 27, 1967, under Article 366(22) of the Constitution, which recognised the Nawab as the ruler of Hyderabad in succession to his grandfather. However, months after the RTI plea failed to get a response, the applicant, Sayed Khaliq, moved the CIC on the complaint.
 
 During the proceedings, the central public information officer (CPIO) of the home ministry claimed that files before 1981 had been handed over to National Archives, and thus the information request had been forwarded to the Archives. 
 
 The latter’s officials however, said the file was not available as per the list of transferred cases received from the home ministry. The transferred files had been digitised and were available on the website of the National Archives, the officials added.
 
 Coming down on the home ministry for its failure to keep track of files of “such historical importance”, information commissioner   said, “Since the certificate is present on record, there can be no doubt that the file did exist with the ministry of home affairs. The  , which is a repository of rare and priceless information, like in the instant case, is expected to be much more diligent in their record keeping.”
 
 Azad directed the CIC’s registry to mark a copy of his order to the home secretary with the recommendation that a committee be constituted to identify such files. “It would also be in order that the process of transfer of files to the Archives, which was initiated in 1981, is monitored in the correct fashion so that chronology is maintained in the transfer of files,” Azad said.
