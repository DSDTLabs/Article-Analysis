SURAT:   in   of   (SMC) have complained of getting   in their taps.   too had faced a similar issue a few days ago.

 Low water levels at the weir-cum-causeway and use of stagnant water after a long time could be the possible reason, claimed SMC officials. Nearly 1 lakh citizens are affected by the smelly water in Adajan and Pal, they said.
 
 Every summer, the issue of foul smelling water crops up. However, Surat has not faced these problems persistently. With sufficient water being available, the issue of smelly water has never been felt regularly like this year. 
 
 This year, the water levels are quite low compared to the previous ones at the weir-cum-causeway which have gone down from its full level of 6 metre to 4.8 metre at present. With shortage of water in Ukai, release of water is not possible till fresh arrival of water in the dam over Tapi river. Still, Ukai authorities released 5,000 cusecs of water recently but it didn’t help raise the water levels. 
 
 “It is probably for the first time in last five years that stagnant water of weir is getting used. Hence, it might smell a little different,” said an SMC official and added, “however, the water quality does get affected when water from the inner portion of weir is used.”
 
 M N Chaudhary, executive engineer at Rander water works, said, “We have reduced water supply to city from 1,250 MLD to 1,150 but still Rander waterworks supplies nearly 200 MLD of water regularly. It seems to be mixing of drinking water and drainage line due to low levels near drawing location. We will get it checked.”
