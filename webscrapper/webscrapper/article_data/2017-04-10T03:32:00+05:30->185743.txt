Margao: The Aquem-Baixo gram sabha members, on Sunday, demanded that names of the service voters be deleted from the villageâ€™s electoral rolls before the forthcoming panchayat polls. Sources told TOI that angry villagers questioned sarpanch Sharon Quadros as to how names of these voters were included in the electoral rolls. Quadros also received flak from the villagers over garbage issues. The gram sabha members inquired as to why the garbage trucks, that had been provided to the village panchayat by former Navelim MLA and former fisheries minister Avertano Furtado were lying unutilized for the past three years.
