NAGPUR: Around 2am on Monday, TOI staffers Vinay Pandey and Rakesh   were on their way home when they saw that an under-construction building at   had caught fire. The building is about 100 metres from Times Square where The Times of India office is located. Few other people too had gathered at the spot.

 Roshan immediately called up colleagues Anjaya   and Amit  , both of who rushed to the spot. Anparthi, who writes on civic issues, alerted the fire department as well as chief fire officer Rajendra Uchake and the police control room.
 
 The first fire tender took around 15 minutes to reach the spot. In the meanwhile, the TOI staffers alerted the residents of the neighbouring two bungalows and got it vacated. At around 2.25am, the first fire tender arrived and in five more minutes a few more were pressed into service. Uchake too reached the spot from his Mahal residence.
 
 The TOI staffers assisted the firemen to divert the traffic before the police, led by Zone 3 DCP Rahul Maknikar, reached the spot. In about 45 minutes, the 10 fire tenders managed to control the fire. With the help of the 42-meter turntable ladder the fire was more or less extinguished. 
 
 While the firemen were struggling to push the hose pipe, Anparthi assisted by giving them a hand.
 
 “Positive public participation is crucial in any disaster situation and the TOI staffers did the same. All these came handy as the firemen were able to focus on the core work of extinguishing the fire,” said Uchake.
 
 Anparthi and Sampat waited with the fire tenders till about 5.45am.
