MUMBAI: The civic education department has issued a notice to Shardashram Vidyamandir in   asking its authorities not to shut down the   and start the   as a separate entity. The school has also been asked why students were being given identity cards and uniforms with   written on them, when the BMC education committee had rejected the name change proposal. 

 In a   to the school management, BMC education officer Mahesh Palkar said the school’s SSC wing has 777 students in classes I to IV . “Since the school has permission to run up to 2020, it cannot be shut down. The state board wing...must be called Shardashram Vidyamandir (SSC). The school can start SVM International English Primary School (ICSE) in a nearby space as a separate school and give admissions from class I onwards,” said the letter.
 
 Parents of class IV students have been protesting against the school’s decision to migrate from SSC to ICSE board. Following protests, the school decided to allow class IV students to continue with SSC in class V. But it stayed firm on its decision to migrate to ICSE for classes I to III. “The education department had earlier issued all permissions for ICSE section without checking the papers. They are now changing the permissions given. Hence, we have demanded that the officials concerned be suspended,” said Sainath Durge, member of the BMC education committee. 
 
 Subhash Jadhav, the school’s administrative officer, said: “We have made the decision consulting all parents. We will appropriately respond to the letter, when we get it.”
