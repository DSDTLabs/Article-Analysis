COIMBATORE: Here is some good news for the city police personnel, who complain that they don’t get to spend time with family and friends due to work load. They will be now given leave on their   day and birthday.

  K Periaiah said the personnel, who work   to maintain law and order, were unable to spend quality time with their family. “We will grant leave to unmarried police personnel on their birthdays. Married ones will get leave for their wedding anniversary. This is introduced so that they could spend at least a day with their family members on the auspicious day,” said Periaiah.
 
 “I used to send birthday and wedding greetings to the police personnel when I was the superintendent of police of Dharmapuri. I am doing the same to Coimbatore city police personnel now,” Periaiah said.
 
 The city police has a data base of more than 2,000 police personnel’s birthday and anniversary, which was handed over to the commissioner. The commissioner will wish all personnel regardless of rank on the auspicious day.
