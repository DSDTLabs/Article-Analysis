CHELLANAM: Septage was the primary problem of residents in coastal areas after the cyclone Ockhi had destroyed their homes. Though the collector had sent several trucks to collect the waste in December, it hardly resolved the problem. 

 Though the trucks come to collect the waste, they could not enter the settlement as the roads were too narrow. It was nearly impossible for the big vehicles to access the area, especially homes closer to the sea. 
 
 "There is nothing much that can be done. The only thing possible is for the residents to make another pit when the septage cannot be contained," said  , president, Chellanam panchayat.
 
 Deepening the pit is now a daily ritual for   A H, a fisherman who lives by the coastline. Every morning he has to make his septage pit a little but deeper so that his family can use the washroom.
 
 District collector   said that he is aware of the problem. Temporarily, locals in the affected areas may have no other option but use pits. 
 
 Houses in the region that had septic tanks in place prior to cyclone Ockhi did not face any issue after they were cleaned following the flooding caused by the cyclone.
 
 Mary Varghese, who had a septic tank in her house said prior to cyclone Ockhi said the facility was set up using Rs 15,000 received from the   Bharat scheme under the central government. "Under this scheme, we were also supposed got Rs 10,000 from the fisheries department, which we haven't got till date. We completed the septic tank after borrowing money from our relatives," she said.
