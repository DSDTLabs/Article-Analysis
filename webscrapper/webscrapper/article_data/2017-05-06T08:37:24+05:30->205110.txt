PANAJI: A   on your   is  ? Just send a   and help will be on its way.

 Drishti Lifesaving Pvt Ltd, an agency engaged in collecting waste from beaches, is all set to roll out a new initiative along with the tourism department to keep the state’s beaches clean.
 
 One would just have to inform Drishti Lifesaving on +91 9225580100 via a WhatsApp message about garbage strewn on the beach by sending a picture of the waste followed by a WhatsApp text stating the location, the agency said in the press statement issued on Friday.
 
 The beach cleaning agency said it will take action against the complaint within the next 24 hours and a   from the agency’s end would also be sent to the sender.
 
 The agency has collected and transported 3,30,000 kg garbage from along the state’s coast since December 2016 when it was hired to do clean the beaches.
