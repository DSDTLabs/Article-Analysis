Ever imagined how   sounds on a guitar? Or   on a violin? Presenting instrumental version of raagas in a new avatar with the help of electronic soundscapes and hypnotic grooves, this ethnocentric music collaborative does just that. The brainchild of   (flutes, electronica) and   (tabla, percussionist and electronica), they combine electronic soundscapes and cool hypnotic grooves. A mix of Indian classical and contemporary, they consider their style of music to be their USP.

 Talking about the mix of their composition, Swarupa says, “We are a mix of ethnic and electronic (ethnotronic). While the ethnic bit is who we actually are, electronic is a reflection of the times we live in.” The two consider Indian classical compositions as their inspiration because, “It has this incredible ability to transport us to another dimension and instrumentals and allows the listener to paint their own picture and story,” she adds.
 
 Travel, they believe, is the highlight of their career. “We always keep talking about how we’re fortunate to travel and experience the same music in different environments. We have travelled to some fascinating remote corners of India and the world to showcase our work,” emphasises Shriram. Having spent most part of the last two years touring and playing at music festivals around the world, they are a huge fan of the time when Indian crossover music was being explored. “We would love to bring it back and see how it works with modern day music technology,” says Shriram.
