NAGPUR: City-based bullion trader Deven Kothari, owner of   MB Jewellers situated at Kothari arch in Sitabuldi, has claimed to have been one of the victims of the fraud perpetrated by   (CG), promoted by Mehul  , who is prime accused in the   ( ) scam that rocked the country a few days ago.

 Addressing a press conference at Tilak Patrakar Bhavan on Monday, Kothari, accompanied by his counsel,  , said he had entered into an agreement with Gitanjali Group for getting distributorship of the company for Nagpur, Wardha, Chandrapur and Yavatmal in 2014. GG had asked Kothari to submit three undated cheques, issued in the name of ‘Asmi Brands Limited’, of Rs 30 lakh each as security deposit. Later, Kothari was asked to issue the cheques in the name of ‘Nakshatra Brands Limited’.
 
 After an annoying delay, the first consignment of articles from CG valued at Rs 95,923 was received by Kothari on June 9, 2014. Kothari was dissatisfied with the delivered articles as he had paid Rs 47 lakh separately for it. Kothari even lodged complaints regarding the quality of the goods sent by the GG but his grievances remained unaddressed.
 
 Kothari sent several mails to the CG expressing proclivity to discontinue business terms as distributor of the GG. However, Gitanjali Group neither returned the amount deposited by him nor agreed to take back goods worth Rs 72 lakh. On finding that the group was not ready to refund the money he had paid and instead using it for promotional activities, Kothari lodged a complaint at Sitabuldi police station.
 
 It was also learnt that CG also lodged two counter-complaints against Kothari in Mumbai under questionable circumstances.
