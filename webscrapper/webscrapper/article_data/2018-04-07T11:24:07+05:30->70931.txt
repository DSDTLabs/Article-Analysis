RANCHI:   police on Friday arrested four persons with opium from   area when they were about to sell the product. Police seized over 2kg of opium, some cash, a motorcycle and a weighing scale from them. 

 The arrested persons have been identified as Ram Narayan Munda, Badai Munda, Ganesh Singh Munda and Lakshman Munda. Lakshman is a resident of Ranchi district while the other three are from Khunti district. 
 
 Khunti superintendent of police Ashwani   got information that smugglers have come to a forest under   police station to deal in opium. A police team was sent to the spot to carry out raids. As soon as the police team reached the spot, the accused persons started escaping. They were, however, nabbed by the police after a chase. A case has been registered against them under relevant section of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.
 
 Kumar said, "Interrogation of the people arrested with opium in the recent past has established that smugglers are coming from different districts to purchase products from here. Though the district police has carried out extensive drives to destroy opium crop in the district it however could not cover some areas under the operations."
