TRICHY: Condemning the arrest of anti-methane protesters in Tiruvarur district, PMK founder Dr S Ramadoss insisted on abandoning the projects of oil extraction wells and declaring   delta areas as a protected zone. 

 “ONGC is in full swing to dig oil and natural gas wells in Tiruvarur district despite vehement opposition from the people. Instead of stopping the project by respecting the sentiments of the people, the state government unleashed violence through the police, which is condemnable,” said Ramadoss in a statement issued on Thursday.
 
 The PMK leader’s statement comes in the wake of the arrest of 129 anti-methane activists including anti-methane project movement leader professor   in Tiruvarur on February 10 and another 300 protesters on February 14.
 
 It may be pointed out that the Koradacheri police had arrested them during their attempt to besiege the work site of oil well at   village in Tiruvarur.
 
 Ramadoss also blamed that the state and central governments for turning the delta districts into a petroleum zone to extract crude oil, hydrocarbon and methane. “The process of digging the well at Kadambangudi had been temporarily suspended following protest from people in 2016. ONGC resumed work on February 9 without any notice. It is learnt that the ONGC is yet to obtain the clearance from the   Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) for this project,” he said adding that the company was not even bothered to seek the opinion from the people in the area.
 
 Going hard on the state government, he said, “Tamil Nadu government is acting according to the direction of the oil companies and threatening the people by arresting them for staging protests. The attempt of the state and central governments to turn the Cauvery delta a petroleum zone at the cost of agriculture cannot be allowed. Both the governments should drop the plan and let off all the protesters,” said Ramadoss.
