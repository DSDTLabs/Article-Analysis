Madurai: A plea has been filed at the Madurai bench of the Madras high court against the screening of actor Arya’s reality show ‘Enga Veettu Mappillai’ in Colors Tamil television channel.

 The bench headed by justice M Sathyanarayanan ordered notice to the ministry of information and broadcasting secretary and central board of film certification (CBFC) chairperson. 
 
 Southern districts women federation and Aadhi thamilar peravai member, Janakiammal filed the plea stating that the programme has put women’s dignity in question and such show would only promote and accelerate crimes against women.
 
 When the case came up for admission, the petitioner’s counsel said the show is being screened from Monday to Friday, in which actor Arya is searching for his bride while actress Sangeetha is anchoring it. About 18 women from various backgrounds have participated in it. To choose the bride, many events like dance, fashion show, writing love letter and games are taking place. 
 
 Conducting such a programme is a violation of the Indian Constitution. If this programme is allowed to continue, it would tarnish the image of women in the society. To promote the television channel, such programme are conducted. The petitioner sent a representation to the secretary of ministry of information and broadcasting and chairperson of CBFC chairperson on March 7 requesting not to telecast the show. But, there was no action from them, the counsel said. 
 
 Following it, the bench ordered notice and adjourned the case to April 18.
