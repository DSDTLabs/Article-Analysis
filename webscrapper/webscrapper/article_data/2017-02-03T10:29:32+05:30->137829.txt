HYDERABAD: The Centre seems to have backed out of the   at the   in Nellore district even as the state government gave its nod for technical studies to identify new potential sites. This means that N-plants may come up at any “potential place“ along the 974-km-long coast.

 The Centre seems to have backed out from setting up six nuclear units at Kavali following protests from   who fear loss of livelihood due to nuclear waste discharge into the Bay of Bengal. The proposed plant at Kovvada, Srikakulam district too was kept in abeyance following protests. In this backdrop, the state nod for exploration of new sites gains significance.
 
 “The AP government has given its consent to carry out technical studies to identify potential sites for nuclear plants,“ said Dr Jitendra Singh, Union minister of state for personnel, public grievances and pensions, and PMO.
 
 Replying to a question by YSRCP MP V Vijayasai Reddy in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday , Singh said the Centre has not taken any decision on the N-plant by Rosatom of Russia near Kavali. “ At present, the Centre's site selection committee is exploring the possibility of identifying a suitable coastal site in AP,“ he said.
 
 Referring to protests against the Kavali plant, Singh said that certain groups “expressed their opposition“ due to apprehensions about safety and loss of traditional means of livelihood. “ An extensive public outreach programme (hearings and consultations) to spread awareness about nuclear power and related aspects has been instituted in a structured manner,“ he said.
