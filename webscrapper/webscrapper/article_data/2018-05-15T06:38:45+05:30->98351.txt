JAIPUR: An 18-year-old girl arrived at the   in   police station near   on Monday, complaining of physical torture at home. The girl said she had long hair down till her waist, which her parents and brothers forcibly chopped off, in hope that she will then grow too ashamed to step out. She was also administered electric shock at home, she said. She had earlier approached police near her home in Jhotwara, but they had sent her home. 

 Sub-inspector   of Jhotwara said, “Who beats people these days, in times of human rights? The girl’s father is a poor labourer who makes Rs 300 a day. We sent her home. Where else would she go?”
 
 “I would speak to a young man I met a few years ago at a religious event whom I intended to marry. That enraged the family,” the girl told TOI. The girl belongs to a scheduled tribe and the 22-year-old youth she hopes to marry is from a scheduled caste. “Police would just speak to my parents and then assure me that all would be well. I had earlier approached police in Jhotwara and got no relief. Instead, they blamed me for causing trouble,” she said. 
 
 Nisha Siddhu, who runs the counselling centre for women in distress at the Sadar police station said, “The girl is over 18 years old, and if the man is willing to marry her, we will go ahead and help them get married. If she wishes to register an FIR and pursue a case, we will help with that too.”
 
 “I don’t think I can go back to the house,” the girl told TOI. Siddhu said the girl could be accommodated in a shelter home.
