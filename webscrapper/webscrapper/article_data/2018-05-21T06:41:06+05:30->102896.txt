NEW DELHI: Japanese electronics giant Sony is going local in India. Having appointed an Indian to head its operations here, the company plans to enhance local sourcing. 

 
 Sunil Nayyar, the newly-appointed MD of  , told TOI that the company is looking at a deeper engagement in India as part of a larger plan, that will include more local sourcing, in view of the duty that the government has imposed on imports to encourage the 'Make in India' programme. 
 
 "After local manufacturing of TVs and phones, we are now exploring audio products. The market is big and growing," Nayyar, who has previously worked with Sony India as head of sales, said.
 
 The company currently sources products from Taiwanese contract manufacturer  's India factories. Nayyar did not specify whether the same supplier will be tapped for audio products that include headphones, bluetooth speakers, and home-theatre systems. "It is too early to say anything on this. We are still studying." 
 
 Facing stiff competition from traditional rivals such as   and  , apart from Chinese companies like Xiaomi, and following withdrawal from categories such as laptops, Sony India has seen a sharp contraction in its India revenues to Rs 7,182 crore in 2016-17, from the high of Rs 11,010 crore achieved in 2014-15. 
 
 Speaking about the benefits of sourcing from India, Nayyar said it helps control costs by avoiding the import duty, while pushing research that makes the products more suitable to local conditions. However, he said that there are no plans to open a Sony production facility in India as of now.
