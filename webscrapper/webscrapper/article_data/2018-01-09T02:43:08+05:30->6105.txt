Sangli district   Vijaykumar Kalam-Patil and superintendent of police Suhail Sharma came under social media fire after a photograph of theirs returning a namaste from Shri Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan chief   went viral. 

 Leading the charge was   politician from Thane  , who on Twitter said: “The same Bhide against whom a crime is registered for Koregaon Bhima riot summoned the Collector and SP of Sangli in a dilapidated building and they were seen standing in front of him with their hands folded.” 
 
 Kalam-Patil said they were only responding to a greeting. “We folded hands as I believe it is part of our culture,” said Kalam-Patil. On Thursday, Bhide’s followers held a rally that culminated at the collector’s office, where Bhide met the officials. tnn
