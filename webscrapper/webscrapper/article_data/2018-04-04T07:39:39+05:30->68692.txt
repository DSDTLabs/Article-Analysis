 The FIR, registered on Monday after a detailed inquiry, has named T Balamurugan, the former tahsildar of Ambattur between September 2015 and August 2016, as the primary accused. Dr U  , the trustee of Pakkkurali Pasumpon Aacini Arul Trust and managing director of the eponymous higher secondary school is the second accused.
 
 The DVAC said the trust had requested the government to allot land for the purpose of a school, which was granted and 2050sqm was given for a period between July 1993 and September 201. It was given on the condition that it should not be given on lease, rent, mortgage or sale.
 
 The DVAC said Arivaruliyar violated these conditions and entered into a lease agreement for a period of 33 years from June 2015 to 2048 with M/s   educational society of   district,  , represented by Mannuru Subramanyam through a letter in September 2014 to run a CBSE school in the name 'Ravindra Bharaty global school'. A monthly rent of 4,300 with 5% annual increase was set and Subramanyam constructed a building and started running Narayana e-Techno school, the DVAC said. 
 
 The value of land was 50.28lakh, the DVAC said and a cancellation deed was registered on August 11, 2015 to make others believe that there was no violation of condition under which land was granted. Arivaruliyar obtained a building license on August 2016 from tahsildar Balamurugan for the Arul Aacini trust school though Narayana school was continuing in the premises, the DVAC said. "Balamurugan knowingly violated the laws which resulted in conversion of the property for benefit of others," the DVAC said. An FIR has been registered for criminal breach of trust and corruption by S John Clement, the DVAC DSP.
