MUMBAI: The crime branch on Saturday busted a gang of seven persons who allegedly manufactured and distributed duplicate cosmetic products in the city. The branch’s property cell raided godowns and arrested manufacturers, stockists and dealers of Hindustan Unilever products, including   (32), Rajesh Desai (44),   (57),   (41), Kishore Tamanekar (30),   (44) and   (48).

 Police said Sayyed is the key distributor of Hindustan Unilever products in Crawford Market.
 
 The complainant,  , brand consultant for Hindustan Unilever in India, alleged that some persons were violating copyrights of their products. “The company collected products with logos and packaging similar to theirs and sent them to the forensic laboratory, which found they were fake,’’ said an officer, adding that the company then filed a case.
 
 The court in March, through its receiver, raided six places and seized products worth around Rs 5 crore which were found to be fake.
