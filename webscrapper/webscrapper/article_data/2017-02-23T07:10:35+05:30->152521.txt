KOCHI: A petition has been filed before the   seeking a ban on operation of temporary   with dangerous rides as part of Aluva Shivaratri festival. 

 The petition was filed by   questioning Aluva Municipality's move to give on lease the vast extent of property lying adjacent to Siva Temple for commercial activities, including temporary amusement parks with rides such as Columbus, Slam Boat, Well of Death, Giant Wheel, Tora Tora, and Dragon Train.
 
 Large mechanical devices and power generators are used for operating the amusement rides but they are operated without adopting any measures to ensure safety, the petitioner has alleged. News reports about the death of two children on September 8 last year when they fell from a giant wheel at a temporary amusement park set up at Chittar in Pathanamthitta as part of Onam Celebration has been produced before the court.
 
 It is alleged by the petitioner that the main reason for the accident in Pathanamthitta was absence of safety measures and regulations regarding the use of such rides in temporary amusement parks. Though the need for setting up a legal mechanism to ensure safety of users of such rides was mooted following the incident, no action has been taken yet, the petition said.
 
 The petitioner learned upon inquiry that the operators of the   have no understanding of the safety measures required and they are operating without the licences required under law, it is alleged.
