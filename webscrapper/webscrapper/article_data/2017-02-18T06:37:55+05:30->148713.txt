LUDHIANA: The   seems to be missing its punch this year, with fewer sports enthusiasts, especially  , coming to watch the famed games. With two more days to go, orgnanisers have their fingers crossed.

 “A few years ago, more than 100 foreign tourists came to watch the game on the first day. But this year, there are less than 10 foreign trourists. Despite its rural background, the games have a large international following. I think the absence of bullock cart races have affected the popularity of the games,“ said Manjeet Singh, a resident of Qila Raipur village.
 
 Many village residents agree that the rural Olympics will regain its popularity after the resumption of bullock cart races. “After the Tamil Nadu government passed a bill allowing Jallikattu, we hope the bullock cart races will also be resumed. The race has been the centre of attraction in the games for people in the country and abroad“, said Jassi, a village resident.
 
  
  
 
 
 However, organisers say the footfall will increase soon. “The number was not high on the first day but more than 100 people from outside India are supposed to reach soon. This was the first day of the games and still a few foreign tourists were here to watch,“ said Balwinder Singh, secretary,  , which organised the three-day   Rural Olympic games. He said most of the international visitors are from the United States, United Kingdom, China, Korea and Japan.
 
 Meanwhile, on day one of the games, a village resident lifted 91 kilograms weight with his ears.
