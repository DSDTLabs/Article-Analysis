KOLKATA: Clinical trials done in India should be guided by local concerns and have a strong local participation, felt Roy Rampling, eminent neuro-oncologist and researcher. Delivering the Tata oration in clinical oncology on Friday, Rampling -a professor at the   -said he was surprised to find that clinical trials in India were often controlled entirely by foreign agencies and local investigators had no say in deciding their courses. “All trials are done in India should include local advise. It should be designed for the gain of the local community,“ said the Malta-born Rampling.

 Describing India as the ideal venue for clinical trials, Rampling said the country was ready to take off in medical research. “Oh India! What a country. You have two-anda-half times the population of  . All speak English, you have a good medical infrastructure, skilled manpower and a strategic location. Prior to 2013, 1300 trials were done in India every year. The number dropped sharply after the implementation of stringent clinical trials laws, but picked up again after you implemented a few alterations in 2015. So, now you have all the advantages and the right legal framework,“ said Rampling.
 
 There is no reason why Indian investigators should play just a passive role in trials, he said. “No clinical trial can be complete or effective without local inputs. You should assert your presence in collaborative research. Along with a strong scientifc voice, the local investigator is also vitally important in clinical trials,“ Rampling said. He added that India should also decide whether it will choose industry-sponsored studies which are market-driven or patient-driven research.
 
 He went on to stress that all clinical trials should be strictly driven by science, controlled by ethics, locally sanctioned and should benefit everyone.
