CHENNAI: The 3,170 surplus teaching and   from Chidambaram-based Annamalai University will be redeployed in various government colleges and departments, including the Madras high court, said an order issued on Friday. 

 These staff will be appointed on an agreement basis for three years. Vacancies already reported to the Teachers Recruitment Board and Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission and reserved for compassionate ground appointments will be excluded in the process, the order stated.
 
 It was issued by higher education secretary   based on recommendations of the administrator of the university, which is under a severe   due to years of mismanagement. The re-deployment is part of correction measures taken since the government took over the university in 2013.
 
 About 211 lecturers and 40 physical education directors have been appointed in government polytechnics, 86 assistant professors in engineering colleges and 208 assistant professors in arts and science colleges. Besides, 2,635 non-teaching staff, including assistants, clerks, drivers and programmers, will go to the secretariat and other departments. 
 
 For instance, 500 staff have been allocated to the high court, 551 to state transport authority, 452 to the directorate of technical education and 367 to directorate of social welfare.
 
 They will have to submit fitness certificates while joining. For professors, principals of the respective colleges will verify the genuineness of their qualifications.
 
 The redeployment of 3,170 staff is the first phase of a project taken up after a government report identified 5,755 excess staff, including 1,031 lecturers, professors and librarians. The government releases 40 crore every month just to pay staff salaries in the university. 
 
 A fortnight ago, state universities were directed not to fill any staff vacancies until the entire Annamalai University surplus was re-deployed.
