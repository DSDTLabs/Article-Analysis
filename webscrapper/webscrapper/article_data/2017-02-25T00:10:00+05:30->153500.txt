Navi Mumbai: Travelling by   between   and Belapur is likely to be a reality soon. The   near   has been identified for the services and the proposal is awaiting the nod of the   (NMMC) general body. 

 According to sources, around Rs 8crore will be allocated for the waterway project in the NMMC 2017-18 budget.
 
 Initially, water transport service will be provided between Belapur and South Mumbai (  and Gateway of India) as well as Uran. Later, Vashi node will be included in the services. 
 
 NMMC additional commissioner, Ankush Chavan said, “We have also included Vashi in the project. We will initially purchase two or three 70-seat AC boats and study the operations and the prospect of running it profitably from Belapur jetty. We will start the operations from Belapur first, and then Vashi.’’
 
 In the mid-1990s, hovercraft used to operate from Sagar Vihar, Vashi, to the Gateway on India and many office goers used to commute by that.
