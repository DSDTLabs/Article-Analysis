PHAGWARA:   (Mool Niwasi) president   walked out of the jail on Tuesday, a day after his arrest by Phagwara police, after he was granted bail by a local court. The case against him fell flat after complainant Pawan Kumar recorded his statement that Suman was not involved in the attack on him following which the court of sub-division judicial magistrate (SDJM) Rajwant Kaur ordered his release.

 
 Suman was arrested on Monday after Pawan, resident of Jagat Ram Soondh Colony in Palahi Gate area where Suman also lives, lodged a complaint against him. Pawan had alleged that he was assaulted by around a half dozen persons on Sunday. He had alleged that he was dragged out his home and thrashed. He had also accused Suman of instigating the attack. His family had also produced a video clip which showed Pawan being assaulted in the street.
 
 However, after his arrest on Monday evening,   activists staged a dharna in front of the office of Phagwara SP and demanded his release. Dalit leaders, including Lok Insaaf Party leader  , pleaded that Suman was not even present there and was wrongly implicated.   SSP Sandeep Sharma entrusted an enquiry to ASP Sandeep Malik, who recorded statements of eyewitnesses and also of the complainant.
 
 While Suman’s counsel filed a bail application, sources said police submitted that the complainant had retracted his statement and that he could be discharged from the case. While well placed sources confirmed it, SSP Sharma said Suman was out on bail and the decision to discharge him would be decided by the court.
 
 Suman was leading the Dalit activists on April 13 when a violent clash had taken place between right wing Hindu groups and Dalit activists, largely from his outfit. One Dalit activist had died after a bullet hit him in his head. General Samaj Manch has already been demanding Suman’s arrest.
