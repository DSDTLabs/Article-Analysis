PUNE: Each year, the state government spends more than Rs1 crore from the corporate social responsibility funds that it gets for  . However, there still isn’t a clear picture on whether or not students and parents convert the results into admissions to the designated stream. 

 Educationists have called for an immediate impact assessment study of the programme to fix this and other such loopholes. Officials that conduct the aptitude test said such an assessment is on the cards next year. 
 
 “We spend about Rs10 per student, which includes operational cost,” said Shaymchi Aai Foundation chief Sheetal Bapat.
 
 “Around 17.4 lakh students appeared for this examination, so we spent about Rs1.74 crore on the project,” said state commissioner of education  . 
 
 “The mentality of the society needs to change. Instead of going by what’s popular, we need to understand the capabilities of the student and his/her interests. Only then can we see a clear conversation rate of aptitude test results into admissions,” Bapat added. 
 
 Education activist Matin Mujawar says without an impact survey, the money would have been wasted. “If not a full-fledged survey, the government needs to conduct a pilot test to see how many students choose the same field of study as the result of this test. Why they don’t choose the same stream, how this can change, etc,” said Mujawar.
