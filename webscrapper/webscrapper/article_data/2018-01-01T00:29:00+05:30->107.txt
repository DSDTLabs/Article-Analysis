Tirupur: Following a request from the city corporation, a few business organisations have come forwarded to give Rs 50 lakh for the fourth water scheme. 

 Tirupur municipality was upgraded as corporation and six villages in the surrounding areas were annexed. The corporation has been struggling to supply water to these areas with the existing three water schemes. “So, the state government has approved the fourth water scheme at a cost of Rs 834 crore, which would be contributed by the central and state governments,” said an official.
 
 “Though funds were provided for purchasing land, as per the guidelines, the landowners need to be paid at market price. So, about Rs 3 crore of extra funds are required for purchasing the land. Hence, the business community was invited to contribute to the scheme,” said a corporation official.
 
 The civic body along with local MLAs held a consultation meeting with the representatives of various trade bodies recently. The trade bodies, which could be benefitted indirectly due to the scheme, have formed a committee to collect the required funds. So far, they have agreed to give Rs 50 lakh, the official added. 
 
 As the civic body has obtained the required clearances for the project, it is expected to be started soon. The corporation has selected six acres near Bhavani River in Mettupalayam for setting up a pumping station for the project, said a higher corporation official.
