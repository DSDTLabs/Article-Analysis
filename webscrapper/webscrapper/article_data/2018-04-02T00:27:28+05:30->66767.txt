Indore: Gobbling onto different delicacies after an abstinence of 40 days, the Christian community across the city continued the celebrations of   with their beloved ones on Sunday. Following the yesteryears tradition of attending the midnight mass, the relatives and community members greeted each other over coffee provided by most of the churches.

 Many people prefer cooking before going for the midnight mass so that they can relish it with their families after returning from the church.
 
 Benjamin D’Souza, a resident of Nanda Nagar said, “After the mass, we went to our brother’s house and hogged on some delicious food at 3am in the morning. It has become like a ritual for us to eat after mass.”
 
 While some people start the celebrations right at the wee hours and party till the dawn, most of the families start the festivity the next day, inviting relatives and close friends over for brunches and dinners. Going for brunches and dinners is one of the most traditional customs followed till date.
 
 Christina Anthony of Vijay Nagar, who has been hosting Easter   at her home for the past two decades said, “I’m the star chef in my family. It’s just due to a hectic schedule that throughout the year, I don’t really get time to invite relatives. It’s only on Easter that I prepare a large spread and invite all my dear ones for brunch.”
 
 Despite the fact that the Easter eggs had been an old tradition, but, only a few people have continued with this tradition of distributing it to their friends and relatives, and Sarah Paul (50) is one such. Paul, who has been doing this for over 10 years, prepares over 50 Easter eggs on which she writes different biblical quotes and gives it to all her relatives and close friends.
 
 “I take help from my husband and children to paint the eggs. It becomes a fun-filled activity for us as a family and we enjoy doing it,” said Paul.
