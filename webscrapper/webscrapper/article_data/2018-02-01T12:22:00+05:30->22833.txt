JAIPUR: New ration cards were distributed to   families in Baran district, but although rations have been made available to such families in other parts of the state, the   holding new ration cards have not received any rations at all.  , a social activist who regularly tours these areas, told TOI that in recent travels in Bakanpura of Kishanganj block of Baran district, he had found several people who showed him ration cards and complained that they got nothing at all.

 Khan said that as families grew, some of the younger members who had married and had families of their own had begun to live away from the parental homes. These units had acquired new cards, but since the government had only sanctioned   for old ration cards, the new card holders were not able to avail the benefits of the free rations made available by the state government to Sahariyas. At Bakanpura alone, Khan came across 198 card holders who had not been able to get free rations.
 
 Regardless of the type of ration card held by this aboriginal backward community, the government has assured them free rations – each Sahariya person is entitled to 5 kg wheat, half litre of cooking oil, quarter litre of ghee and half kg pulses each month. 
 
 In 2013, after many cases of child malnutrition and death were reported from the area,   and Ashok Khandelwal conducted a survey of over 200 households in the district to find that social indicators were indeed very poor – only 7% of those surveyed had over two bighas of irrigated land; of 760 people questioned, 58% had never been to school; 41% of those surveyed had outstanding loans.
 
 Food and supplies officer for the district   said the complaints were mostly from holders of new ration cards. He said action would be taken to ensure smooth supply of rations from next month.
