THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Latvian tourist  , whose decomposed body was found in a small wooded area near   in Kerala, a week ago, could have been murdered by strangulation, police have said. "The latest hints given by the forensic surgeons suggest that she might have died of 'manual strangulation'," said city police commissioner P Prakash, who has been heading the probe. 

 The police said the detailed examination conducted on the body revealed marks around the neck suggesting strangulation. 
 
 However, the police were yet to get the official autopsy report. 
 
 The police on Friday also found a piece of evidence that could support the theory that she might have been throttled to death.
