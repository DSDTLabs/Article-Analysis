Mhow: Amidst minor protest by a few local traders, the vegetable mandi was shifted from Haat Maidan to Krishi Upaj Mandi premises in Dongargaon area on old AB road on Monday morning. To reduce traffic load from the main road of the town, the administration had decided to shift the mandi but a few traders were against the decision. They had set the deadline to shift the mandi till Monday.

 Police forces were deployed at various places to stop the vehicles, carrying vegetables, enter the mandi premises. On this, few traders started chakkajam near Mhow railway station and police had to use mild force to disperse the agitating traders.
 
 Sources said as the vegetable mandi was being operated from the centre of the town, people had to face traffic congestion especially during peak hours. Many organisations had approached the administration regarding its shifting to Dongargaon where provision were made for vegetable mandi, a long back. Orders were issued by Mhow SDM Sandeep GR regarding this and the traders started protesting.
 
 The administration had made all arrangements on Monday in Dongargaon and also decorated the area to welcome the traders.
