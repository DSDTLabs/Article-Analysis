BENGALURU: In a bid to fight hunger,   Layout Residents (BLR), a group of volunteers, inaugurated a “community fridge” in Brookfield near   on Friday.

 Those living in and around the neighbourhood, can leave spare food or leftovers in the fridge, which can then be picked up and eaten by the poor.
 
 “Well-to-do people tend to have a lot of spare food, that then goes to waste. We wanted to provide good food to those in need, and thought this was a good way of doing it. BLR got together and raised about Rs 1 lakh for the fridge and the enclosure, and a nearby society will be funding the electricity bill,” said  , a  .
 
 The fridge will be accessible to all between 8am and 9pm, and is placed near the entry gate of Force Avenue, Brookfield Layout.
 
 Not only food, citizens can also donate clothes and blankets, and place them in the shelves built into the enclosure.
