JAIPUR: The district consumer dispute redressal   has asked   Pvt Ltd to pay Rs 20,000 for mental harassment and Rs 10,000 for legal expenses to a customer for issuing credit card without his permission and later harassing him for payment. 

 H R Kumawat, counsel for  , 68, said the petitioner in his complaint said that in 2008, a bank agent had approached him for credit card which he said was free of cost, so he agreed. 
 
 But, later the agent informed Lallulal that he would have to pay Rs 750 for the credit card, so Lallulal withdrew his permission.
 
 Despite Lallulal withdrawing his permission, the agent issued the card in his name and compelled him to accept it. The agent then sent a statement for Rs 1,123.60 towards the cost of the credit card. The petitioner refused to accept the credit card and the letter sent by the SBI Card and Services for payment.
 
 The agent was also forcing him for renewal of the credit card. Despite Lallulal's complaint to the authorities concerned, no action was taken. The complaint read that this comes under improper business practices.
 
 The company, as a part of the initiative to avoid unwanted litigation, has written off the cost of the credit card. 
 
 However, the forum said that the petitioner is a senior citizen and he has to be compensated for mental harassment and legal expenses.
