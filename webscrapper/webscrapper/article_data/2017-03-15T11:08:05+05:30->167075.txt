IDUKKI/ KOCHI: A major mishap was averted as a big   on three vehicles, used for  . 

  The incident took place at 11.30am on Monday. The rock fell from near the tunnels of Pallivasal power house, destroying the vehicles parked below and the security wall and stuck on a concrete block and a tree. 
 
  The residents of workers' settlements, 100-feet below where it had fallen, had a narrow escape. 
 
  In a report submitted by Devikulam sub-collector Sreeram Venkitaraman and tehsildar P K Shaji, who visited the spot, recommended to the district collector that urgent steps should be taken to evacuate the families from the area as there are still hundreds of vulnerable rocks in the area.
 
  The revenue department officials have blamed it on unauthorized construction works. The area has a resort and another two are under construction, for which the sub-collector has issued a stop-memo.
 
  The resort owners have moved the court which will hear their appeal on March 22.
 
 Meanwhile, experts have said that constructions were done without any scientific study of the region. "When roads are cut across the slopes, there will be an imbalance in the upper region which can cause the soil, rocks etc. to move downslope due to gravity. This phenomenon is called mass wasting," said environmental scientist and former VC of MG University, A V George. He said that a study was done under the Western Ghats Development Scheme for the state government in regions which were prone to such rock or boulder falls in the Munnar-Thekkady stretch. 
 
 Scientist   said that this phenomenon of rock fall was seen during summer when the air between the rocks expands disturbing the equilibrium. "There are regions which are unstable. A scientific study needs to be done to identify areas having such air pockets," he said.
 
 Environmentalist   said that ideally no concrete constructions should be allowed in Idukki which was an earthquake-prone region.
