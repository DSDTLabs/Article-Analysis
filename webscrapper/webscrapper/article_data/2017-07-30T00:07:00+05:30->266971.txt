 The incident came to light on July 16 when the Human Resource manager of the company lodged a complaint with the Hinjewadi police station. 
 
 The company officials were receiving calls from various candidates asking for their offer letters and that is how they came across the  .
 
 Police have booked the unidentified persons under provisions of Information Technology Act, 2000.

 They cloned it using the same logo, name, phone numbers and company’s address as on the actual website.
 
 The company is a world-renowned name and produces engines and generator sets. The fake website claimed that the company was hiring engineers for various positions and urged people to apply for jobs by hitting the ‘career’ link in the HR section on the website.
 
 Besides unemployed youths, those looking for a switchover applied for these posts. 
 
 The suspects then asked these candidates to deposit a sum of Rs900 (per head) as the application fee for the posts. Many persons deposited the said amount in the account number that was shared on the cloned website.

 Police said that the suspects behind the cloning and duping scam had already gained much momentum through social networking sites and enhanced the website’s reach so that individuals would apply thinking that it was an authentic job recruitment website.
