When you have a protective elder sister in the business, making inroads becomes relatively easier, or so they say. At least thatâ€™s what   aims to do for her younger sister  , who is aiming to hit the Bollywood movie marquee soon. After joining a bevy of beauties for a leading cosmetic brand, Isabelle has done an extensive photo shoot with Katrina, in association with a leading couturier. The bridal photo shoot, we hear, took place in the last week of February. According to a production hand from the set, the girls were shot in five different bridal looks. Given that it was their first official photo shoot together, Katrina was evidently protective about her sister and ensured that she grabs the spotlight in the campaign.
