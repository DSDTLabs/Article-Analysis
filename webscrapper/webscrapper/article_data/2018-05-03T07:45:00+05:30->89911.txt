GURUGRAM: Come June 15, all dark roads, which have for long been a bane for the city, will have   street lights as part of a long-awaited project.

 If   officials are to be believed, already 10,000 LED street lights have been installed in wards 1, 5, 33, 34 and sectors 21, 22 and 23, where work is currently underway.
 
 Under the Rs 96-crore project, at least 48,000 more LED lights will be installed across all 36 civic wards,   sectors and HSIIDC industrial areas in the city. Also, nearly 406 high-masts will be installed to make city roads brighter and safer for commuters. 
 
 Lalit Jindal, executive engineer, MCG, said, “We are expecting the entire work to be completed by June 15.” 
 
 Sources said the installation work kicked off in March, nearly five months after MCG signed an MoU with state-owned Energy Efficiency Services Limited ( ).   officials said they had installed nearly 2,000 LED lamps in some areas as part of a pilot and carried out a survey of city roads between January and March before starting full-fledged work. “We sought feedback from people and their inputs were incorporated in our survey report. We got the MCG nod in March,” said Venkatesh Dwivedi, chief general manager, EESL. 
 
 EESL will replace all 250 watt sodium vapour tubes with 110 watt LED lamps, cutting down power consumption by almost 55%. “The upfront investment is being made by EESL. We will also be responsible for on-site warranty and maintenance of the lights for the next 10 years,” he added.
 
 Dwivedi said initially, EESL was only supposed to replace the old yellow   with LED bulbs. “But later, the scope of the project was widened.”
 
 Officials said in the first phase, all city roads would be lit up with LED lamps by mid-June. The second phase will involve complete ‘overhaul’ of the street light infrastructure which will start in July and be completed by the year-end.
