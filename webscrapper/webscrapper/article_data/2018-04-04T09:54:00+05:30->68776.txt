 The lecturers who attempted suicide were among 16 lecturers who had been removed from various government polytechnic colleges a couple of years ago, when regular staff were appointed in their place “These lecturers have been trying to secure a job for the past two years. However, as there are no vacancies currently, they were unable to find any job. Recently, they noticed that some government colleges had vacancies. But when those colleges refused to hire them, the lecturers tried to kill themselves,” said S   of   government colleges’ contract lecturer association.
 
 Zabee added that eight of them were taken into police custody. A few onlookers said the eight lecturers climbed the BIE office building and started pouring petrol on themselves.
 
 The staff and public, who were at the office at that time, intervened and stopped them from taking the next step and alerted the police.
 
 The association members said that all these lecturers had completed eight years of service in government colleges and were hoping to get regularized when they were removed from their jobs.
 
 They further added that it was not just polytechnic lecturers, but that contract employees working in junior and degree colleges, too, were facing uncertainties.
 
 “Take the case of junior college lecturers. We have not been paid salaries for more than four months now and are facing an acute cash crunch. We don’t know what to do. The government should stop treating contract employees in this way and should try to solve our problems,” said   of the association.
