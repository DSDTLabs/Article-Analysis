JABALPUR/BHOPAL: The high court has issued a notice to   (MPBSE), seeking its response to a petition filed on behalf of two Class XII students, who say the ‘Ruk Jana Nahin’ scheme was proving counter-productive for them as they were not allowed to appear in the board exam in 2018 because they had passed Class X supplementary the same year as they passed their class XI exam (in 2017). 

 MPBSE rejected their exam forms on the ground that there must be a two-year gap after Class X for a student to appear in the Class XII board exam, they say.
 
 The ‘Ruk Jan Nahin’ scheme was launched by the school education department to curb exam stress following a spurt in suicides by high school students who failed the exam. Under the scheme, students were allowed to take supplementary exam in the subjects they had failed.
 
 The petitioners — Arti and Neetu Jharia of   village in   district — were students of Class X in the 2015-16 academic year and appeared in the final exam in March 2016. They failed but took supplementary exam in 2017 under ‘Ruk Jana Nahin’ scheme and got provisional admission in Class XI. They passed the Class X supplementary exam in 2017, and the same year cleared Class XI, too.
 
 In their petition, they say that when they filled the form to appear in Class XII exam in November 2017, their form was rejected on the ground that they had passed Class X only a year ago, and a gap of two years is mandatory. 
 
 Parents of the girls, who filed the petition, say it isn’t an issue involving only their wards as 1,800 students who took the opportunity provided by ‘Ruk Jana Nahin’ face the same predicament. The petition was filed earlier, too, but a single-judge bench had rejected it. However, a double bench comprising Chief Justice Hemant Gupta and   has issued a notice to MPBSE, seeking response by the next hearing on March 16.
