Nagpur: Having a conversation with a friend while driving their two-wheelers beside each other cost a 53-year-old teacher her life on Monday. Even wearing helmet could not save her life as Bharti Ranglani’s two-wheeler was dashed by a container from behind. 

 Police said Bharti was heading towards Tathagata chowk from Power grid chowk when the incident took place in front of Jagat Celebrations hall. The container driver had tried to flee with his vehicle but was intercepted by the traffic police deployed near Power Grid chowk. The traffic cop was alerted by a citizen after which he ensured the fleeing driver, Subodh Kumar Jadhav, was nabbed. The vehicle was later seized by Jaripatka police. 
 
 It was also learnt that Bharti’s friend was left so stunned that she could not even narrate the incident before the police before leaving the place. Police said Bharti’s skull was smashed by the impact of the accident. “The teacher was killed at the spot itself,” said a cop from Jaripatka police present at the spot. 
 
 Bharti’s body was later shifted to Mayo hospital where her post-mortem was conducted. Jadhav was later granted bail by the court on surety.
