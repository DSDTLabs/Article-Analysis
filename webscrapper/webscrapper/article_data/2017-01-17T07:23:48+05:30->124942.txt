Navi Mumbai: Taps ran dry in many areas of the city on Sunday as the   pipelines of   and   developed  . 

 While the officials claimed that supply at low pressure was restored by Monday morning, residents alleged that their ordeal continued on Monday. Residents in Cidco administered areas also suffered from the disruption.
 
 Many also asked how both the lines developed technical glitches on the same day. “We had no supply since Sunday evening till around 6 pm on Monday,” said Airoli resident V S Kulkarni. But Arvind Shinde, NMMC executive engineer (water supply), said that it was a coincidence. There was a burst in the   supply line at Kalyan Phata and NMMC’s line from Morbe also developed faults.
 
 Avinash Mali, deputy engineer, MIDC said that they fixed the problem and supply was restored after midnight. “However, building pressure for equitable supply takes a few hours,” he added.
 
 Shinde added that supply was disrupted due to technical fault in the pumping house which was rectified on Monday morning. But residents were still waiting for water supply to resume till Monday evening. 
 
 “It’s been 24 hours since the water supply stopped in our area. We thought it was a local problem but later learnt that the system collapsed,” said Turbhe resident Anil Mokal.
