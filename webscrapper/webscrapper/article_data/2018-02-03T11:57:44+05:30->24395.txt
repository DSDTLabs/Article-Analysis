NAGPUR: Nagpur University administration has geared up for elections to ten seats of its senate from graduates’ constituency on Sunday. It has made adequate arrangements for smoothing conduct of elections.

 Over 17,000 candidates would decide the fate of 37 contestants from various outfits. There would be a three-pronged fight this time with many parties forging alliances to bolster their chances. 
 
 NU has set up 81 polling centres across  , Wardha, Gondia and Nagpur city and rural areas and one in  . Equal number of in-charges, most of whom are principals of the respective colleges, have been appointed. About 185 officials, including those from NU, would help in-charges during the   period from 8am to 4pm.
 
 NU officials were seen preparing for the polls with ballot boxes and papers at convocation hall, one of the polling centres, along with Dr Ambedkar Law College and its city branch.
 
 “We have dispatched letters to police personnel to provide security at the centres during entire process. They have agreed to help us. At convocation hall, the   (MSSC) guards would keep a guard,” registrar Puran Meshram, also the returning officer, told TOI.
 
 To avoid voters taking ballot boxes away like happened in the first phase of polls on November 25, NU has instructed in-charges to personally ensure every voter puts back six ballot papers in the boxes. “Though it was claimed that over 400 ballot papers were missing last time, it was found only two to four were not returned. Still, we are not taking any chances and have asked the in-charges to keep a close tab on all voters,” he said.
 
  college at Bhandara has highest number of voters at 1,105 while Jalgaon would have only nine of them.
