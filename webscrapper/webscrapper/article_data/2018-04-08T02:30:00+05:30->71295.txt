Hyderabad/Guntur: Both the Telugu states — Andhra Pradesh and Telangana — are basking in the glory of Venkat   Ragala who won the gold for India in the 85kg category in the Commonwealth Games (CWG) being held at Gold Coast, Australia.

 The tricolour fluttered in the background of a thatched roof house at a village in Guntur district. A group of people hastened to the house to congratulate Rahul’s family. A cake was cut and the family was garlanded. Rahul hails from Stuvartupuram village of Bapatla mandal in the district though he has mostly stayed in Hyderabad for his studies and training.
 
 The family looked overwhelmed by the sudden attention, though the celebrations did not quite match Rahul’s big achievement. It was, nevertheless, a moment recorded by well-wishers with the cutting of the cake.
 
 CM Naidu was among the first to congratulate Rahul. AP sports minister Kollu Ravindra said the government supported him in all ways and the chief minister encouraged him by giving Rs 15 lakh for his training.
 
 YSR Congress president Jaganmohan Reddy too congratulated Rahul and hoped that he will continue his form in future tournaments.
