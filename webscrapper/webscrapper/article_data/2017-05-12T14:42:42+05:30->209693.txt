GHAZIABAD: The   on Thursday summoned chief secretary Rahul Bhatnagar on the issue of encroachments on ponds and other waterbodies in  . The tribunal directed him to be present before it on the next date of hearing on May 25.

 The order came on a petition filed by a city-based environmentalist, Sushil Raghav, who has claimed that nearly 2,403 hectares of waterbodies have been encroached to make way for buildings and other infrastructural projects thereby putting in jeopardy the fragile eco-system. 
 
 Raghav presented a list of the waterbodies which lie either partially or fully encroached. Worst still, civic agencies like GDA, GMC and UPSIDC themselves have encroached such waterbodies.
 
 The case dates back to December 2014 when the   had passed an order directing administration through chief secretary to restore and free waterbodies of encroachment in six months and file status report every month. “Since 2014 administration did not file a single status report forcing us to file a contempt plea,” said Sushil Raghav, petitioner. 
 
 As per the report prepared by the accountant which was in turn submitted in the NGT, there are 1,036 ponds which are encroached either fully or partially. “But despite having the list, the administration did practically nothing to free the waterbodies of encroachment and sought relief from the NGT on some ground or other. However, on Thursday, NGT took a serious view on the matter and issued summons to the chief secretary,” said Raghav.
