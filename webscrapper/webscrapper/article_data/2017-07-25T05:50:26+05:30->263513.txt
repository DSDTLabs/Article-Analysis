JAIPUR: The   party has questioned BJP’s attempts of reaching out to Dalits and alleged that having lunch at their homes by the leaders is just for political gains.

  spokesperson, Pratap Singh Khachariyawas attacked the ruling party for showing no concern for Dalits when six of them died in Dangiyawas. He claimed that after three years in power,   is now thinking of Dalit rights and respect.
 
 “Why did Amit Shah not show any concern when six Dalits died in Dangiyawas?” questioned Khachariyawas. He added, “I am surprised they went there for lunch but did not use utensils and used only paper plates and terracotta cups (kulhad). This shows it was an attempt to gain political mileage.”
 
 Shah on Sunday visited   member and booth level worker Ramesh Pacharia’s home at   for lunch. He was accompanied by chief minister Vasundhara Raje, state president Ashok Parnami, party general secretary and MP Bhupendra Yadav and others.
 
 Further attacking BJP, Congress spokesperson said that two children died at Sushilpura after drinking contaminated water but neither Raje nor the local MLA and minister, Arun Chaturvedi made a visit or gave any financial support.
