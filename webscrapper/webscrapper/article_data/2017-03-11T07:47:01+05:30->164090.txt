ALLAHABAD: With all exit polls predicting that the BJP would form the next government in the state and Holi coming soon after the results, a sweetmaker has been innovative enough to blend the two. So there's a special gujhiya, a Holi staple, on offer that has 'Modi', 'BJP' or 'NaMo' embossed on it. 

 This unique gujhiya, each priced at Rs 80, is available at a famous sweetshop of the Chowk area. These large gujiyas, each weighing around 250 grams, look like any other gujhiya but the difference becomes apparent once they're out of the fying pan. That's when the design shows. 
 
 "Now that the party of our choice seems ready to form the next government in the state, we have prepared this special gujhiya with the carefully drawn design, made in kesar (saffron), on one side. As the gujhiya gets fried the saffron words show up," said Subodh, the shop owner. 
 
 He said the trial was so successful that the first 75 pieces was sold off within a couple of hours. While some of these gujhiyas have khoya stuffing, others have pure mewa (dry fruit) stuffing while some others are stuffed with fresh coconut powder. 
 
 Talking about the idea of introducing this sweet, Sanjay Keserwani, another sweetmaker said, "Whatever be the result of the assembly polls, I am a diehard supporter of our PM which is why I am also making a similar gujhiya which would be sold in limited numbers." 
 
 "While shopping with my friend, this gujhiya caught our attention and we purchased six of these," said Shahabuddin.
