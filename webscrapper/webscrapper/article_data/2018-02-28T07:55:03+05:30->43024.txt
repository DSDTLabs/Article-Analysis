BENGALURU: In a big  , the high court on Tuesday dismissed a petition challenging a January 11, 2018 notification initiating a global tender to replace the existing 4.9 lakh streetlights with energy-efficient   across 198 wards in Bengaluru. 

  Dismissing the petition filed by BBMP  , Justice Vineet Kothari noted the apex court diktat to courts against interfering with policy decisions and also to keep any intervention to a bare minimum only where the decisions are unconstitutional or bad in law. The judge noted that BBMP had authorized reducing the minimum period for submitting bids from 60 days to 30 days of the notification, treating the case as a special one under Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement Act. 
 
  Regrading the petitioner's contention that they were kept out by the minimum requirement that any firm has to be worth at least Rs 100 crore to bid, the court said it cannot be grounds to interfere with the process. The court was told that under the new tender, BBMP will not incur any additional expenditure as the successful bidder has to instal the LED bulbs at its cost and will have to transfer 20% of the saved money due to reduction in consumption of power and operation and maintenance charges. 
 
  The court was also informed the new system can dim streetlights during non-peak hours and the selected company has to operate and maintain them for 10 years. 
 
  The petitioner claimed the tender was conditioned such that it would only help multinational companies.
