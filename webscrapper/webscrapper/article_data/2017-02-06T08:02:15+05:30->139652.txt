LUCKNOW: Forced by the lack of adequate number of candidates,   would offer only one  , in Hindi, this year. 

 LU had to cancel   courses in ancient Indian history, archaeology, anthropology, physical education, Sanskrit, social work and sociology as the number of applications was much lower than the number of seats available in these courses. 
 
 As per norms, the university could offer a course only if 40% of the total seats are filled. The criterion could be fulfilled only in MPhil Hindi (regular/self-finance) and English. However, after results of PhD entrance examinations were declared on January 27, four qualifying students, who had applied for MPhil as well, got themselves enrolled in the post-doctoral course. As a result,   was the only course which complied with the rules.
 
 In 2015-16, the university had invited applications for 10 MPhil courses. As no applications were received for Anthropology and public administration, LU cancelled the two courses and conducted the entrance examination for only eight courses.
 
 Over 250 candidates appeared for the entrance test, of which only 80 could avail the qualifying marks in the entrance test.
