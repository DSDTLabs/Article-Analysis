CHANDIGARH: After nearly 13 years of giving up the stage, Amabla City MLA Aseem Goel once again played the role of Lord Ram during Ramlila at his ancestral village Nanyola on Friday.

 In his early 40s, Goel had played the role of lord Ram for the episode of ‘Bharat Milap’.
 
 Goel is the first-time MLA from BJP who had defeated the   leader Vinod Sharma. He is one of active MLAs during the assembly sessions, especially when the opposition targets the treasury benches.
 
 The MLA also chaired the Dussehra celebrations at his village on Saturday, which are being organized by Jeevan Sudhar Ramlila Dramatic Club — a group formed in the early 1980s. Since 1989, Goel has been associated with the group and played the role of Ram between 2000 and 2004.
 
 A Nanyola resident Khem Chand elaborated that after being given political responsibilities, Goel headed the club but played only once or twice.
 
 “There is nothing odd about it. I was part of the club for more than two decades before I got occupied in party affairs and assembly responsibilities. One of my old colleagues asked me to join him on the stage so I did for this episode,” said Goel.
 
 “This not only keeps me modest but also gives an opportunity to visit my elders and fellow villagers,” he added.
 
 Mukesh Kumar, who played the role of lord Ram’s younger brother Lakshman in the episode said that the villagers were quite impressed with Goel’s skills.
 
 “He is famous for his dialogue delivery in the ‘Bharat Milap’ episode. We have a very beautiful chemistry and coordination, hence, I requested him to perform the role. We didn’t notice any change in him. He did not require any prompting as we do while on stage,” said Mukesh.
