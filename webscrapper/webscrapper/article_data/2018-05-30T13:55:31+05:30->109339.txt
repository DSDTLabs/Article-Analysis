TRICHY: After the death of 3-year-old P   in 2011, her parents constructed a small temple in front of their house believing that their daughter had reincarnated as god. Today, the temple has become famous among the people of   near Manapparai who worship her. 

 
 The yearly paal kudam ( ) procession festival at the temple ended on Monday and Dhanuja’s father   claims that the number of devotees to the temple has been on the rise every year. When Dhanuja fell sick on December 23, 2011, her parents Palanisamy and Lakshmi took her to a hospital on their bike along with their younger daughter. Palanisamy, who was riding the bike, lost control of it when a speeding milk van grazed against his vehicle which skidded. Under the impact, Dhanuja’s head hit the road and she died on the spot. The three others escaped with injuries. 
 
 The final rites of the child were later performed according to their custom. Her father Palanisamy claimed that the priest who was performing the puja spoke in the tone of Dhanuja and told them that she would be back home as a god in three years. He also said that three years later, his brother K Balraj “talked like Dhanuja” and asked Palanisamy to construct a temple for her. “We believe that my daughter reincarnated as a god. So, I constructed a small temple in front of our house in 2011. Since then, the people in and around the area have been worshipping her as their prayers are answered,” Palanisamy told TOI on Tuesday. 
 
 A one-foot-tall statue carved out of stone was installed in the temple. “I have to develop the temple in future,” he said. 
 
 The paal kudam procession was reportedly attended by people from Vellaiammapatti, Pinnathur, Pannankombu, Palavarapatti and Kalingapatti and is carried out from Vinayagar temple in   for half a kilometre.
