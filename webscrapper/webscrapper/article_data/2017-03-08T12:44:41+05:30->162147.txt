 1. Not in the mood to wash your oily locks or you are simply out of time? Fret not, just sprinkle some baby powder (inexpensive alternative to dry shampoo) on your scalp and massage it for a minute. And voila! It will absorb the grease on your scalp, and make them look fresh.

Sleeping with make-up on can lead to breakouts and skin infections, but this problem also has a smart hack. Just make sure to keep a make-up remover or wipes next to your bed. It will save you on the days you are too exhausted to get up from your bed, and keep your skin healthy.
