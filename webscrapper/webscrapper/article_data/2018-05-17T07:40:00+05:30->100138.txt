GURUGRAM: Two persons were arrested red-handed   on an   match between   and Kolkata Knight Riders, in New Palam Vihar on Tuesday night.

 
 Over Rs 14,000 in cash, two smartphones, an LED TV, a set-top box, a notebook with betting rates and a recorder were seized during the raid at the first-floor of a three-storey house that belonged to a third person.
 
 Police said the two men — Lokesh alias Mannu of Rewari and Raj alias Raju of Bajghera — had taken the first-floor on rent and had been running the betting racket for the past couple of months. “Two persons have been arrested and booked for   under relevant sections of the IPC,” said ASI  , spokesperson for the Gurugram police.
 
 Acting on a tip-off, a team from Bajghera police station raided the house around 10.30pm when the Rajasthan Royals-Kolkata Knight Riders match was underway.
 
 When the police team reached the house, Raj opened the door while Lokesh was discussing the current rates with one of the customers over phone and the cricket match was playing on the LED screen in front of them, said ASI Jasram.
 
 During interrogation, the duo revealed they would place bets on every ball, over and every win or loss as per the customers’ demand. 
 
 “They would note down the amount a caller wanted to bet and collect the money from him the next day. Profits used to be distributed on a weekly basis,” said a senior cop.
 
 The police said it was a well-organised racket and more people were involved in this. “Search is on to nab all those involved in this IPL betting racket. Also, we will question the owner of the property to ascertain whether he was aware of the racket being run from his premises,” said the officer.
