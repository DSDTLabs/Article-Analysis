While the teaser and first look of the film   had the audience wondering if the Mammootty- starrer is about all fights and no smiles. However, this poster that was out on social media is proof enough of the fact that   is not a grumpy and sulking man, but who has got a cheerful side to him too.

 By the looks of the poster, his character in the film seems to be a jolly good fellow as well. 'Puthan Panam' is a Ranjith directorial, and it is expected to be on similar lines of the movie Indian Rupee, with a different take on the issue of black money. 
 
 The film also has Ineya, Renji Panicker, Sheelu Abraham and Siddique, among many others.
