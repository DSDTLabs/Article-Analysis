LUCKNOW: A group of   MPs, including Brijbhusan Saran Singh, Raghav Lakhanpal, Jagdambika Pal,   and Kunwar Bhartendra Singh, has written to prime minister Narendra Modi and UP chief minister   for reinstatement of over 1.7 lakh shiksha mitras whose services as assistant teacher were terminated following  's order. 

 Addressing their demand to UP CM and PM, the MPs have sought assimilation of shiksha mitras as full-time teachers - a demand termed 'illegal' by the Supreme Court in July, 2017, when it quashed appointments of shiksha mitras as assistant teachers. Shiksha mitras were appointed as full-time teachers under the   regime in 2014.
 
  The MPs' letter stated that the SC's order has left shiksha mitras with an uncertain future. 
 
 After the SC judgement, the state government came up with two offers - to appear for TET to become eligible for the post of assistant teachers and get additional 2.5 marks for each year of teaching experience when they sit for assistant teachers' recruitments after qualifying TET. 
 
 The offer didn't go down well with the shiksha mitras who are demanding 'one work, one pay' and appointment as full-time teachers.
