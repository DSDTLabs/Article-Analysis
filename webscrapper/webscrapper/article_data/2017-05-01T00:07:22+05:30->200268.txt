New  : The crime branch has arrested two   and seized   Munger-made   from them. Police said the gang was operational for several years, supplying weapons to criminals in Delhi/NCR.

 Police said a .32 bore pistol, purchased for Rs 15,000-20,000, was sold off for anywhere between Rs 20,000 and 25,000. Similarly, a 9mm pistol, bought for Rs 20,000, was sold for Rs 30,000, police said. 
 
 According to DCP (crime) Madhur Verma, the weapons were manufactured with high proficiency and the makers imitated foreign brands with such skill that it was hard to differentiate between them.
 
 “In recent past, several incidents of firing took place in Delhi/NCR where illegal weapons were used. We found that firearms were being smuggled from Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. To unearth the nexus, a special team, led by ACP Sanjay Sehrawat, was formed,” he said.
 
 A gang involving Deepak Kumar, Sajjid and their aides was actively involved in smuggling illegal arms, it was found. Sajjid is a close aide of Ale Nabi, a notorious gangster of Meerut. A careful study of their modus operandi led to drawing up of a list of suspects. On April 29, information was received that Kumar and an aide would come to Anand Vihar via train to deliver a consignment of weapons to a local conduit.
 
 “Accordingly, a team led by inspector Sunil and SI Neeraj Kumar was formed and a trap laid. The accused were spotted with the help of informer and arrested. The pistols were seized,” the DCP added.
