PATNA: The number of women   four wheelers has witnessed a steep rise in the last few years in the city. People associated with some motor driving training schools claim that they have almost 80% women trainees in each batch.

 “Almost four years ago, we hardly had two to three women trainees. Now, there are batches in which nearly 80% learners are women. Of these, 30% are in their thirties,” Amit Gunjan, an instructor at a Boring Road training school, said and added, “Each batch has 40 to 45 students whose training lasts 18 days. 
 
 Gunjan also recalled that one of his students — a woman in her seventies — learnt how to drive because she did not want to be dependent on others.
 
 Binod Kumar Sinha, the owner of four driving institutes in the city, said there was hardly any woman trainee when he opened his first school in 1986. “Things have changed in the last five years. Now, whoever has a car at home wants to learn how to drive rather than hiring a driver,” he told TOI, adding at least 10 women visited his school per month.
 
 According to Amar Kumar Soni, who offers a 10-day driving crash course at Kankarbagh, “Of the 20 students I train every month, 10 are women. Most of them learn driving because they can either not afford a driver or want to bring their children back from school.” 
 
 Ashiana Nagar resident Mridula Pankaj Aggarwal said, “Learning to drive a car is important from security point of view. It is comparatively cheaper to drive around town in your own vehicle than in public transport.”
