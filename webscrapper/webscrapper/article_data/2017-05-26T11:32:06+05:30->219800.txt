HYDERABAD: Justice A Rajashekhar Reddy of the Hyderabad High Court on Thursday directed the   officials not to carry out any construction or activity that adversely affects the buffer zone, full tank level and the inflow channel of Malka Lake in Raidurg, Serlilingampalli mandal. 

 Presiding over a  , the judge heard a plea by   E Sudhakar, who said that the   would result in loss of livelihood for him. His counsel   told the court that the GHMC officials are filling the lake and its inflow channels with debris and are constructing a walk way. Killing a lake in the name of beautification is not good for the city, he said. 
 
 When sought an answer, the counsel representing GHMC denied the allegations and said that GHMC is only constructing a path for walkers without affecting the FTL, buffer zone. However, when the petitioner's counsel insisted that they are blocking the inflow channel, the GHMC counsel said that she has no instructions on this. 
 
 The judge stayed the ongoing works there. Don't take up any work that affects the FTL, Buffer Zone or inflow channels of the lake, the judge said, while issuing notices to the authorities and seeking their counters.
