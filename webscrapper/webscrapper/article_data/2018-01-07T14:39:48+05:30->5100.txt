Actor   has said she based her character in 'Molly's Game' on   West. 

 The 40-year-old actor took inspiration from the entrepreneur and her sisters to prep for the title role in the Aaron Sorkin-directorial debut film. 
 
  
  
 "To play Molly Bloom, I thought about what women have to become in order to find power in a society where men are making all of the rules. I was like, 'Oh, my gosh - the Kardashians are an incredible example of women who have their own sense of entrepreneurial power.'' 
 
 "And in real life, Molly looked a lot like them. For research, I actually watched Kim's tutorial on face shading and contouring," Chastain said.
