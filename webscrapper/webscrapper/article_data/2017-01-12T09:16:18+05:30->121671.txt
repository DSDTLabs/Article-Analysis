LUCKNOW: A 16-year-old,   of   branch, shot himself with a double-barrel licensed gun belonging to his father at his house under Husainganj police station area on Wednesday evening. 

 In the notebook in which he was solving a physics numerical, there was a suicide note scribbled by him that read: “I quit. Sabse Pyare Mummy aur Papa aur Bhai Dishu”. Shivayansh was to appear for the Chemistry paper of the pre-board exams on Thursday. This is the third such incident in the past two months in the city.
 
 According to police, Shivyansh Sahu lived with his parents and siblings at house number 58/232 close to Sahu Dharmshala (near Chhitwapur police outpost). He returned home after school on Wednesday afternoon.
 
 Around 5.46pm, his cousin Abhishek, who lives with the family heard a gunshot and ran into the room on the third floor of the house, where Shivyansh was studying. He screamed and fell unconscious on seeing Shivyansh lying in a pool of blood. Shivyansh’s mother Kamla Sahu, who had just entered the house after visiting a doctor, heard Abhishek’s scream and thought some monkeys might had entered the room. She sent a relative’s daughter Priya to inquire but the latter too was stunned to see the room splattered with blood. 
 
 Kamla climbed upstairs and went hysterical and on hearing the cries, neighbours rushed to the house. Some took care of the family, while others informed Shivyansh’s father, Om Prakash Sahu, a senior journalist in Akashwani, said police.
 
 Husainganj police station house officer   said, “The gun was found lying beside the body and a suicide note was recovered from the scene too.” 
 
 Police said Kamla Sahu runs a private school on the ground floor of the three-story house. Kamla told police that she had gone to see the doctor and Om Prakash went along with her and later dropped her home and left for his office.
