RAJKOT: A 24-year-old man was beaten to death by three persons over his extramarital affair with the wife of one of the assailants in   late night on Monday.

 Police arrested the three accused — Ketan Koli, Mehul Koli and Pradip Vastani — for killing   in Ratanpar village of Surendranagar following a complaint lodged by the victim’s brother Mukesh. Vastani is the president of Surendranagar   Baxi Panch Morcha.
 
 According to police sources, Nilesh had an affair with a woman named Babu Koli. However, they couldn’t tie the knot and she got married to Ketan. The duo, however, continued their relationship and Ketan had even threatened Nilesh of dire consequences over the affair.
 
 On Monday night, Ketan told his wife to call Nilesh home at around 9:30pm. When Nilesh reached there, Ketan, Mehul and Pradip brutally thrashed him. They took him on a bike to an open ground near Ratanpar bypass and again beat him up with bats. Pradip then called up Mukesh and told him to take Nilesh to the hospital. 
 
 When Mukesh reached there, Pradip brandished a revolver and threatened to kill him if he informed the police. Mukesh rushed his brother to the hospital but he died on the way.
