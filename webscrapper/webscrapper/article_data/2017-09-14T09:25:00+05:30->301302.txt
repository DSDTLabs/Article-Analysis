Just as his hit film 'Oppam,' the   film 'Villain' also has music by the team of composers known as 4 musics.

 The jukebox of the film is just out and it has five songs. While the tracks 'Kandittum Kandittum' and 'Pathiye Nee' and melodies, the 'Villain promo song' and 'Angakale' are fast numbers. B K Harinarayanan and Engandiyoor Chandrasekharan have penned lyrics for the songs. 
 
 
  
 
 The film is expected to hit screens in a few months and if the jukebox is any indication, it offers us everything ranging from romance to edge-of-the-seat thrilling moments.
