 doesn’t seem to be the kind of actor who believes in striking the iron while it is hot. 

 While most newcomers would be itching to sign their next, especially after a blockbuster debut like  , Antony has bucked that trend and waited close to five months to zero in on his second movie.
 
 The upcoming film is an action thriller helmed by debutant Tinu Pappachan, who was the chief associate director of Angamaly Diaries. It also has  , B Unnikrishnan and   backing the project.
 
 However, that doesn’t mean Antony was bidding his time only to collaborate with the same team again.“I listened to at least 200 scripts during the interlude. There were so many good offers but the characters of many of those didn’t fit my age profile. That’s one of the reasons why I chose Tinu’s film, because I was confident it’s a role that I can pull off. Also, the movie is completely different from Angamaly Diaries,” says the actor, adding that the familiar team is a bonus.
 
 Anthony plays a Kottayam-based youth who works in a finance company in the movie, says Tinu. “Certain incidents that happen in one night turns his life topsy-turvy, and how he tries to solve the problems takes the plot forward.”
 
 The yet-to-be-titled film, scripted by Dileep Kurian, will also have Vinayakan and Chemban Vinod playing vital characters. “We will be finalising a debutante as the heroine before the movie goes on floors in October,” says Tinu, adding that Kottayam, Mangalore and Australia will be the shooting locations.
 As part of preparations for his second movie, Antony says, “Primarily, I will have to get the Kottayam slang right. But apart from that — be it my second film or my 50th — I am always going to work as if it’s my first. I will be dedicated to this craft and work hard. What happens after that, I will leave to God and the audience.”
