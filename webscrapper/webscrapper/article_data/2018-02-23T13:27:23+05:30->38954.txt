PUNE: The Maharashtra State   of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education will send a team from Pune to Solapur to investigate reports about the HSC English   being circulated in the social media. 

 “Our Solapur division officials have been told to file a police complaint and they have taken necessary action. We will send a team from Pune to investigate the issue. Based on the probe, we will decide whether to approach the cybercrime cell,” state board chairperson Shakuntala Kale said on Thursday.
 
 Images of the “question paper” had purportedly gone viral on WhatsApp an hour after the official time of the examination from an exam centre at Barshi in Solapur. 
 
 Barshi education officer Vishnu Kamble, who filed a report after conducting an inquiry, insisted that the question paper had not gone viral from the examination centre there.
