 Police said several other unsuccessful attempts had been made by cyber cheats. “The only messages which Dr Shah received on his cellphone were of successful transactions,” a crime branch official said. 
 
 Sources in the police said Dr Shah had mentioned in his complaint that he had received the transaction messages when he was at work at the civil hospital.
 
 “It is not possible for cyber thieves to execute an online transaction without an OTP. This is a unique case and, hence, we have written to the bank to provide us with details of the transactions and also the reason why Dr Shah did not receive an OTP,” a police officer said. 
 
 Crime branch officials said they had also written to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to find out whether any norms or guidelines issued by the RBI to the banks had been flouted. 
 
 “We are also verifying with the companies from whom various services have been purchased through online transactions. We are also trying to find out the mobile number through which the transactions were executed,” said a police official.
