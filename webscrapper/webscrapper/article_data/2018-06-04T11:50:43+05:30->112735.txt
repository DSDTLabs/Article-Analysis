HYDERABAD: Anticipating a GO from the Telangana school education department,   affiliated schools already decided to introduce Telugu as a compulsory language for students of class 1 and 6 from this academic year.

 To review the implementation of Telugu as a compulsory subject in all schools, the school education department has also constituted state and district level committees. The committees have to conduct quarterly review meetings to ensure that the language is taught mandatory in all schools.

 Apart from this, the   of   will also conduct in-service trainings for all the educational administrators, teacher educators and heads of institutions every year. As per the GO, every school shall provide eligible teachers for teaching Telugu language. “For secondary school (class 6 to 10) there shall be minimum one teacher for teaching of Telugu language for these five classes.
