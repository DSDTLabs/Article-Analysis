CHENNAI: An engineering student was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly posting pictures of his former lover, a dental college student, on a social networking site and blackmailing the woman’s family.

 The man was identified as M  , 27, of Erode. He was studying in Chennai.
 
 Police said Raheem befriended a third year student of a dental college on OMR, when he happened to visit the college. The duo fell in love with each other. They visited several places last year and took selfies. 
 
 “After a while, they had frequent arguments over the woman being friendly with other men in the college. Raheem opposed her talking even with her classmates,” said an investigating officer. The girl was upset with Raheem’s behavior and decided to break-up with him. Since then she ignored him and did not attend his phone calls. 
 
 She also ignored Raheem’s warning that he would post her pictures they took on the social networking sites. Three months back, she was shocked to find her pictures online, along with abusive messages about her. Following this, she disclosed the matter to her family. The family called Raheem for talks. He demanded Rs 5 lakh to delete the photographs. The girl’s family told him that they could afford to pay only Rs 2.5 lakh, to which he agreed. He took the sum last month. Following this, the girl’s family lodged a police complaint. Raheem was called to the police station, where his family members apologised and agreed to keep him in control. 
 
 But, Raheem managed to collect the phone numbers of the girl’s relatives and friends and sent the pictures to them on whatsapp. “He used the money to buy an expensive mobile phone,” the officer added. Annoyed over this, the girl’s family lodged a police complaint with Mambalam All   Police Station. Police arrested him and remanded him in judicial custody.
