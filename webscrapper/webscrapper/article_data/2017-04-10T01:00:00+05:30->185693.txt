PATNA:   was celebrated all over the city to mark the triumphal entry of Jesus Christ into Jerusalem, the week before his death and resurrection. 

 Palm branches are widely recognized as the symbol of peace and victory, hence their preferred use on Palm Sunday. Churches around the city held processions and Mass to mark the occasion. 
 
 “On Sunday morning, a ceremonial procession was organized on the church campus followed by Mass celebrated at St Xavier’s Chapel,” said Father Robert Athickal, who is associated with the St Xavier’s Chapel and also the St Xavier’s College. 
 
 He said over 200 people took part in the morning prayers and offered their obeisance to Jesus Christ. “We get the palm leaves from our own trees. One must take care of the environment to avail the gifts of nature and carry on our age-old traditions in natural way,” he said. 
 
 Sister Shanti, who had come from Bangalore to attend a training programme at Atma Darshan, a centre for spirituality and counselling near Digha, celebrated Palm Sunday with other devotees. She offered her prayers for the first time in Patna and away from her native place. 
 
 “The atmosphere was quite homely as there were less number of people as compared to Bangalore. This day reminds us of the entry of the Jesus Christ into Jerusalem,” she said, adding, “We should practice the teaching of Christ and be humble in our daily lives.”
