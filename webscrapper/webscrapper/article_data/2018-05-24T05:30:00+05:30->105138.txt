 (Chikkamagaluru): With the new academic year around the corner, parents are busy giving final touches to the preparations to send their kids to school. With all Montessori and kindergartens reopening on June 1, many parents are rushing to Sringeri, a remote town of Chikkamagaluru district to perform aksharabhyasa (initiation of education) of their kids at the famed Sharada Peetham.

 Except on new moon days, this ritual is performed every day at the temple. According to mutt sources, all children in the age group of two and a half years and five are eligible for this ritual.
 
 Temple administrator VR Gowrishankar said there is no fixed day or time to perform this seva. "There is no advance booking and devotees can come any day and do it. Many come during Navaratri while other come on other days. Devotees are even coming now to do it,” he said.
 
 A common belief among parents is that the learning process must start at any temple of Goddess Sharada. "We could not perform this seva during Dasara. We’re sending our daughter to pre-KG this year. So we decided to visit Sringeri and perform this seva," said Anjali Rao, a resident of Vidyaranyapuram, Mysuru. "Everyone in our family has offered this seva,” she recalled.
 
 According to local devotees, with just a few days to go for the beginning of the new academic year, the number of parents offering this seva has increased over the past few days. "Parents offering this seva is a common sight at the temple. On Fridays, more people perform it. Last Friday, there was a huge rush at the temple. Hundreds of parents from across the state landed here to perform the seva and it continued till 2pm," said Raghavendra, a local resident.
