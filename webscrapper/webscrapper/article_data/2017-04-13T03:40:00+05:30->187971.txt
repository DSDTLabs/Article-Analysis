Panaji: Members of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) met chief minister Manohar Parrikar on Wednesday to seek justice for senior doctor, Dr Babu Redkar, who was allegedly assaulted by a woman at his clinic.

 “The CM was very sympathetic to our concern. We also met DGP Muktesh Chander. He assured us that a chargesheet will be filed within 15 days. We will follow up on this matter till it reaches its logical conclusion,” said one of the IMA members, oncologist Dr Shekhar Salkar.
 
 Redkar filed an FIR with the Colva police alleging that the woman had hit him and scratched his hand.
 
 The woman is said to have fled the country. IMA Goa demanded that a redressal committee be formed in the state to address patients’ grievances against doctors. tnn
