VISAKHAPATNAM: Stating that the   ( ) is looking at the east coast with great interest for firming up its business, its chairman and managing director   said the company was start trial runs for train services for its   (MMLP) in Vizag from Friday.

 Participating in the East Coast Maritime Business Summit in the city on Friday, Kalyanarama said the MMLP was being set up over an area of 100 acres with an investment of nearly Rs 450 crore. He said, "Concor has constructed a huge MMLP with 100 acres. The container freight stations are already functioning and we are adding train services. By developing MMLP on 100 acres, we will provide good processing facility and warehousing facility which will be required post GST implementation as warehouses are required for value addition."
 
 Furthermore, he said until now, industrialisation had been more towards the north and north western parts of India and the same is yet to happen in the east coast. "Planners can do a better job here by locating industries closer to the port. It will give greater advantage," he said, adding that Concor is also developing MMLPs at Krishnapatnam and Kakinada ports. 
 
 "We have a lot of expectation from the east coast. When we thought of developing MMLPs, we actually wanted a modal shift to happen. This is one of the important factors to look at as logistics players. Single mode of transport from hinterland to port and back is important." He said, "We are totally developing 15 MMLPs and 12 more on the drawing board." He also said Concor would be present at any new ports which come up in the state.
 
 Referring to the impact of GST, he said, "There will be a paradigm shift in how business is done. It will improve the entire logistics industry." He also said GST would help Indian companies become competitive and help the GDP grow.
