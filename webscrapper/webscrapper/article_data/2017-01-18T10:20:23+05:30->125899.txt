Visakhapatnam: Although experts have lauded the state government’s efforts to desilt over 3,200 small irrigation tanks in the district, they feel that encroachments on   is a cause for concern as they serve as a major source of replenishment for these tanks.

 A former advisor to the   on condition of anonymity said the main source of irrigation in districts such as   are   that have been justifiably built to sustain agriculture activity. However, he lamented the fact that the government was not keen on protecting the hill streams that serve as the chief source of water supply to these tanks.
 
 Former Soil Conservation of India field scientist K Bhusanam told TOI: “The problem with the irrigation tanks is that at least half of them are stream fed and this means that the streams must be sustained and protected. However, large scale deforestation on hill tops has resulted in drying up of these streams and in the process, the water tanks lie useless. Unless the state government does something to replenish these hill streams and protect them from encroachment, a vast majority of the irrigation tanks will not serve the purpose they were designed for and will fall prey to encroachers.”
 
 According to the former state government advisor, “Hill streams provide the requisite gush during the rainy season while in the off season, they maintain the moisture levels both down the hill as well as in the tanks, thereby maintaining ground water levels. However, if they are encroached upon or if the destruction of forest cover is not arrested, nothing can curtail the damage.”
 
 The experts believe that populism and lack of respect for the ecology is chiefly responsible for the environmental damage and pointed out that both farmers as well as the state government must realise where to draw the line.
