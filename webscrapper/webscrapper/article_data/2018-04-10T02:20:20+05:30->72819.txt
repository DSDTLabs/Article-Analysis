NAVI MUMBAI: A   demolition team razed   constructions in   on Monday that were also targeted last year. 

 A two-storied under-construction illegal building was the first to be targeted in the day-long drive in   area. 
 
 Besides, a plinth structure in the same locality was also pulled down by the team amid minimum police protection. Action was initiated earlier on both the illegal structures, almost a year ago, but the encroachers came back and set up shops despite an eviction notice under MRTP Act being in place. 
 
 Around 650 sqm was cleared at the plinth structure.
