PUNE: Intensifying its fight against  , the state government has procured 1.25 lakh   in the first phase for free immunization of high-risk individuals, including pregnant women and those suffering from diabetes and hypertension.

 “To scale up vaccination, we have directed health officials to start free swine flu vaccination of high-risk individuals even at railway and ESIC hospitals, government medical colleges and state-run healthcare centres,” M S Diggikar, joint director, state health department told TOI.
 
 The move follows death of three persons due to the disease in Maharashtra last month. “In rural parts of the state, we have also started free vaccination centres at rural and sub-district hospitals, besides district health centres,” Diggikar said.
 
 Going by the analysis, the swine flu (H1N1) virus hit the state harder in 2017 than in 2016. Barring 2015, when the virus had claimed 905 lives, 2017 recorded one of the worst outbreaks of the disease in Maharashtra since 2009. 
 
 “Incidentally, a large number of people who succumbed to swine flu also suffered from other associated illnesses (co-morbid conditions). Therefore, covering such ‘at risk’ people in the vaccination programme is a prudent step,” state surveillance officer Pradip Awate said.
 
 Health activists, however, said the vaccination alone won’t help. “The state health department should also focus on educating people about adopting precautionary measures, including frequent washing of hands and avoiding direct contact with people showing influenza-like symptoms. But not much is being done on this front,” activist Sanjay Dabhade said.
 
 Experts said personal hygiene is of paramount importance. “Regular washing of hands and timely vaccination can keep the disease at bay. People in the high-risk categories are recommended to take flu vaccines every year as the vaccine-induced immunity lasts from 9-12 months,” they said.
