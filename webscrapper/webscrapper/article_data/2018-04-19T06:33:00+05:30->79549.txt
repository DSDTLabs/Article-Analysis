Mangaluru: A day after members of the   District Youth Congress Committee tendered mass resignations over denial of party ticket to their leader  , members of the National Students’ Union of India ( ), on Wednesday followed suit.

 The members urged the party high command to reconsider its decision and issue the district Youth Congress Committee president a ticket.
 
 NSUI state general secretary Roopesh Rai told the media on Wednesday that office bearers of eight units – 15 from each unit – of the NSUI will tender their resignations to the District Congress Committee (DCC) immediately and they had the backing of all their respective unit members. However, they said they will not quit the primary membership of the party and would continue working for the Congress as party workers.
 
 “Though Congress has given us an identity, it is our leader Mithun Rai who stood by students during our time of crisis. He has been instrumental in building the youth Congress at the grassroots level,” Roopesh said.
 
 “ It would have been a moral victory to us if Mithun had got a ticket as he would be a representative of the youths and the students in the Assembly. The party has highly disappointed us by not issuing him a ticket,” he added.
 
 When asked if they would back Mithun if he decided to switch over to another party, Roopesh said all his supporters from the NSUI would tag along as a show of strength and to assert their allegiance to Mithun.
 
 The NSUI members said they had been trying to contact Mithun, but to no avail. They, however, were hopeful that he would appear before the public in a day or two.
