NEW DELHI: Another   jawan has spoken out against what he says are deplorable service conditions at the border, according to an English news magazine’s website.

 The jawan, whose identity has been kept a secret, has written a nine-page letter to Union home minister   alleging inordinately long spells of duty and inadequate food and clothing, according to India Today which said on Wednesday that it had accessed the letter.
 
 Among the more shocking complaints is his allegation that “the amount allocated for food is not spent on food but on other activities of the day”, according to the news magazine. This second salvo comes after BSF trooper Tej Bahadur Yadav’s video alleging poor quality food had gone viral a day before.
 
 The jawan’s letter spells out the problems of BSF personnel regarding “food, clothing, housing, deployment, duty hours and weapons”, the news magazine reported.
 
 The unnamed jawan claims they are made to do 20 hours of duty when the duty rule says eight hours. “We get only 30% of clothing items on time,” the letter, a portion of which is shown in a news clip on the website, says. It also translates another line of complaint from the jawan as, “Only the sky as a roof and a balcony to sleep”.
 
 “The letter also said that nothing is followed as per the rules of the Central Armed Police Force,” the news magazine reported.
