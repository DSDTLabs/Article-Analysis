Nagpur: Ranveer S Chauhan, chief security commissioner (CSC), South East Central Railway (SECR), Railway Protection Force (RPF), in a press briefing on Friday, stated that railway board was working on a measure to upgrade the intelligence wing to counter sabotage activities targeting long-distance trains. Chauhan, who also chaired a crime review meeting with his officers earlier in the day at SECR RPF office, said RPF’s intelligence earlier remained restricted to the political activities like rail rokos, but now it had to be extended to cover the sabotages too. “Training is being imparted with the initiatives of the railway board on the lines of Intelligence Bureau and similar agencies. Soon, RPF personnel would be trained in intelligence gathering,” he said. Apart from that, RPF personnel are also being groomed in bettering their communication skills.  Chauhan also said CCTV cameras for better surveillance were set to be installed at six railway stations in Nagpur division-- Itwari, Ramtek, Dongargaon, Rajnandgaon, Chhindwara and Chandafort-- using Nirbhaya fund. “The work of the installing cameras would be initiated this year itself,” he said. He also mentioned that Gondia-Durg section was considered one of the most sensitive due to Naxal presence in the belt.  “We are sending loco pilots before trains whenever there is an alert issued,” said the CSC. “We are also ensuring night security patrolling by gangmen and others,” said Chauhan when asked about measures being taken against sabotage. Chauhan also stated that personnel were being sent to villages along the tracks to hold meetings with school teachers and others to create awareness against stone-pelting on trains.
