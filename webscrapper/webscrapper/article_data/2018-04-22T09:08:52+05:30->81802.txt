ISLAMABAD: A court on Saturday directed the government to decide within 30 days the visa and citizenship status of an   woman who converted to Islam and married a Pakistani man during a visit last week. 

 31-year-old Kiran Bala, a resident of Garhshankar in Hoshiarpur district of  , was part of the   (SGPC) led Indian Sikh delegation, visiting Pakistan to celebrate the Baisakhi festival. 
 
 Four days after arriving in Pakistan, on April 16, she went to Lahore where she converted, got christened as Amna Bibi and married a local, Muhammad Azam. The same day, she wrote to Pakistan’s ministry of interior seeking an extension of her visa, alleging threat to her life back home. She also moved   for citizenship and visa extension. 
 
 The court on Saturday extended Kiran’s visa by 30-days and ordered the home ministry to decide whether she was eligible for the six-month extension as per her application sent to the foreign affairs ministry.
 
 Pakistan’s law now allows her to stay in the country for a month, and if granted the six-month extension, she would become eligible for attaining citizenship. According to an Indo-Pak treaty, the citizens of either country can attain each other’s nationality after seven years.
 
 Following her visa extension, Kiran would have to renew her visa every six months for seven years, and if no legal complaints or constitutional hurdles surface during her stay in the country, she can become a Pakistani national. 
 
 In her plea, she has stated that she married the Pakistani national on her own will and wants to live in the country with her husband. In Hoshiarpur, Kiran is known to be a widow and a mother of three children. She, however, has denied such claims.
