It is no surprise that actress   plays a suave character in the thriller, Imaikkaa Nodigal. Well, we witnessed this in the trailer itself. The movie also has   playing the role of Nayanthara’s brother and   as the main antagonist. Also in the movie is   Thilak. 

 Talking about the role, Ramesh says, “I have a few combination scenes with actress Nayanthara because I play Atharvaa’s friend in the movie. I first met her when the crew was shooting on the streets of Bengaluru. I then met her in Chennai as well. She is a professional and is clear about her role and delivers just that. She met me and told me that she saw some of my scenes that were shot for the movie, and that felt good. We have a few more scenes to finish.” 
 
 Besides Imaikkaa Nodigal, Ramesh will also be seen in Rajinikanth’s Kaala.
