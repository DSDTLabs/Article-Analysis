It’s unfortunate that the dog attack happened, and the production house is taking care of her medical expenses,” says a source.
  
 However, Reena tells us, “It’s true that I have not been happy with my track and had even shared my concern with the makers. My character was becoming a tad unrelatable.

My family is here to take care of me, as my husband is expected to travel abroad for work. A lot of painful things have happened to me and I don’t want to delve too much into it. I will speak at the right time.”
