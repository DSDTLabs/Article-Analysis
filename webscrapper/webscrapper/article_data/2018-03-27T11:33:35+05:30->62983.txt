LUCKNOW: Drawing a parallel with the Champaran   of 1917 when Indigo cultivators from Bihar revolted against the British, Prime Minister   will launch a campaign to set India free from open defecation and unhygeinic conditions. The event called 'Chalo Champaran - From Satyagrah to  ', would be attended by 20,000 swachhagrahis (sanitation motivators) who will take a pledge to push  . 

 Officials of UP's panchayati raj department said that UP will send 6,000 sanitation motivators who would join 10,000 swachagrahis from Bihar and remaining 4,000 would come from across India. The swachhagraha campaign aims to spread the message of   across the country.
 
 "The swachhagrahis coming from across the country would join their local peers to initiate a special drive adopting the Community Approaches to Sanitation (CAS) to motivate the communities to adopt collective behaviour change. In case of ODF panchayats, the swachhagrahis would work to sustain the collective behaviour change achieved by a community," said Swachha Bharat Abhiyan, mission director, Akash Deep. Water and sanitation for health (WASH) specialist at Unicef, Chiranjib Tiwari said that the event would positively impact the campaign in UP too. "The exposure will raise morale of swachhagrahis from UP which will reflect in their work back home. The event would also serve as a knowledge sharing platform. Besides, some outstanding swachhagrahis would be rewarded by PM which will set a benchmark for others," he said.
