Ponda: Though PWD minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar has maintained that the proposed sewage processing unit in Undir will not be shifted, the Bandora gram sabha resolved not to issue permission for the project. The panchayat had earlier issued permission to the plant, but Undir villagers had forced the body to revoke permission in December 2016. There was chaos at the meeting after a group of villagers expressed apprehension over the issue of a sewage processing unit at Undir. Brijesh Naik, a local, proposed the resolution that the panchayat should not permit the plant; Gurudas Naik seconded it at the gram sabha on Sunday.
