Madurai: The name of Tamil Nadu director general of police (DGP) T K Rajendran has not been mentioned in the report on a gutka   filed by former Chennai city police commissioner, advocate general R Muthukumaraswamy informed the Madras high court on Monday.

 The advocate general said the government had ordered a probe by the directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption (DVAC) based on the city police commissioner’s report.
 
 The court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a Madurai-based trade unionist challenging the appointment of Rajendran as DGP.
 
 The petitioner’s counsel A Kannan said the income tax on September 9 last year sent a report to the government regarding its raid in the gutka manufacturing company in Chennai and mentioning the names of officials involved in a scam. But, there was no action on the part of the government on the I-T department’s report.
 
 The advocate general replied that the government had not received any such report from the income tax. Following this, the bench directed the advocate general to put it in an affidavit and reserved its order. The court also directed the government to provide police protection to the counsel.
 
 It may be recalled that as per the earlier direction of the court, the Tamil Nadu chief secretary, the DVAC and DG I-T have already filed documents before the court.
