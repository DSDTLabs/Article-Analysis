NEW DELHI: Even as the Congress is coming to terms with the crushing defeat in Uttar Pradesh, chairman of the Congress SC department, K Raju conceded that it is the unexpected division of the Muslims and   votes that worked against the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance.
 
  “I think the communities we hoped would vote for us in full measure like OBCs as a bloc voting for the combine and at least non-Jatav Dalits voting for Congress and all the Muslims voting for the combine would have definitely secured us a victory, but this did not happen.
  
  The Muslim vote got divided, the Backward Castes vote got divided, part of the Backward Caste vote has gone to BJP. The Dalit vote also got divided. This is perhaps what went wrong,” Raju told ET.
  
  Raju also steered the ambitious Leadership Development Mission in Reserved Constituencies in both UP and Punjab ahead of the   to select candidates for these seats. None of the 28 SC candidates in the fray in Uttar Pradesh managed to bag a seat though in Punjab, the tally rose to 22 from 10.
  
  “Party has also learnt lots of lessons from these elections. We are confident with all these lessons together and our endeavour to strengthen through structural changes that   is talking about, we will move forward. It is not a doomsday kind of situation for the Congress party... I think these election results have not dented Congress party’s conviction in its ability to protect the idea of India,” he said.
  
  While conceding that the Congress does need to introspect why certain communities did not vote for it and how can the party ideologically win over all sections of society, Raju also alleged that the media and others were unfairly targeting the grand old party. He argued that the Congress with no more than 28 MLAs from 403 constituencies since 2012 was in no position to grab power in Uttar Pradesh.
