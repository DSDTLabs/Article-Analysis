BENGALURU: A 35-year-old woman has been arrested for allegedly kidnapping a three-year-old girl in April. Her 13-year-old son has been sent to the remand home.

 Two days after the abduction, during which police intensified the search, the accused handed over the child to a minibus driver, asking him to drop her at a prayer hall in Siddapura, the locality from where she kidnapped her. The girl was found near the prayer hall.
 
 In her confession,   Begum, a housekeeping supervisor with a private company in Electronics City, told police her affection towards girl children and her desire to have one prompted her to abduct the three-year-old. 
 
 “Fatima and her son who live in Shikaripalya, Electronics City, had come to Siddapura for work on April 29. While walking towards the bus stop, Fatima saw the girl playing outside her home. She asked her son to bring her near the bus stand,” police said.
 
 The boy lured the girl with chocolates and the duo took her to their house.   footage from the locality showed the girl being handheld by a boy.
 
 “Fatima’s husband and other family members raised an objection, saying she shouldn’t have kidnapped the child. Deciding to send back the girl, Fatima and her son returned to Siddapura on May 1. When they came near her house, they saw cops deployed at the spot and pamphlets with the girl’s picture being handed out. Fatima took one such pamphlet, headed to   4th Block and handed over the girl and the pamphlet to a minibus driver, asking him to leave her at the nearest prayer hall. The driver handed over the child to priests at a prayer hall,” police said.
