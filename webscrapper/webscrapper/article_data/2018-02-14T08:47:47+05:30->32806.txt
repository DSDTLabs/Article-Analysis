BATHINDA: Congress Sewa Dal member Raj Rani (46), a resident of Gopal Nagar in  , allegedly ended her life on Monday night by consuming a poisonous substance. Her husband,  , is in jail and serving a one-year sentence in a cheque-bounce case.

 Police have registered a case of abetment to suicide against four persons after allegations that they were harassing her to return a loan. Rani, a member of Congress Sewa Dal, had taken a loan of Rs 50,000 from a finance company owned by the four men.
 
 Canal Colony station house officer (SHO)   said they had registered a case under Section 306 (abetment to suicide) of the IPC, on the basis of the statement given by Rani’s daughter. “We have booked Amarjit, Munshi Ram, Mandeep and  , and are investigating the role of these persons. The viscera have been sent for chemical examination,” the SHO said.
 
 Owners of the company were pressing her to return the money. She was under stress for not being able to pay it and ended her life under duress, according to police.
 
 In December 2017, Raj Rani’s husband was sentenced to one-year imprisonment for a cheque given by him to a shopkeeper being dishonoured. As per Rani’s daughter, she consumed poison on Monday night and was declared dead when taken to the hospital.
