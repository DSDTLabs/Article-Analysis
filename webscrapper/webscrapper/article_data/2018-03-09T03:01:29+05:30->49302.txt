GURUGRAM: Nearly 500   sat on a   asking for   and working conditions on International Women’s Day on Thursday, claiming women’s empowerment does not make much sense with the government continuing to ignore their demands after almost three weeks of protests on the streets. 

 The women gathered outside the office of the Gurugram deputy commissioner around 9am on Thursday and protested till the afternoon. It was the 18th day of their protest which started in the middle of February. 
 
 Sarswati  , who is leading the protests, said, “On one hand, the government talks of empowering women and enabling them through government schemes and initiatives, and on the other hand, they let us sit on the streets for nearly three weeks.” She said there was no point of promoting the cause of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao if daughters had to struggle for their basic rights, such as equal wages and health benefits. 
 
 The anganwadi workers have been demanding for minimum wages of Rs 18,000 per month, retirement benefits, pension benefits, yearly holidays and increase in rental budget for anganwadi centres.
 
 Earlier last month, state minster for women empowerment Kavita Jain had agreed to some of the demands of the workers after they burnt her effigy in a show of protest. 
 
 She announced that the government would issue a notification for yearly summer and winter holidays for anganwadi workers and helpers.
 
 Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had also announced that the wages would be increased to a sum of over Rs 11,000 for all those working for over 10 years.
 
 The workers, however, said that they did not trust in such announcements and the least the government could do, was give it to them in writing. There are over 1000 anganwadi centres in Gurugram and over 2,100 work in these centres. All these centres have been non-functional over the past 18 days, causing inconvenience to villagers.
