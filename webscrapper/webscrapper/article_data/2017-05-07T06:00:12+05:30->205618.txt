THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Shunted out unceremoniously days after the   government came to power 11 months ago, T P   once again took over as state police chief here on Saturday after the   ruled that his removal was illegal. The government order (GO) issued on Saturday appointing Senkumar as   said the appointment is based on the   order dated April 24, 2017.

 Formally stating that he just wished to do his best for the state and was not interested in a confrontation with the government, Senkumar, however, left no room for doubts about who would call the shots in the police force.
 
 The government had appointed Tomin J Thachankary, who is at loggerheads with Senkumar, as ADGP (headquarters). Responding to the flurry of new postings made by the government at police headquarters ahead of his re-induction, and whose purpose was quite obvious, Senkumar told reporters, “At present, I am the senior-most officer in  .”
