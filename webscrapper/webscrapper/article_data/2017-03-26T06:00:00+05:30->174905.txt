Don’t be fooled by his chocolate boy looks. When he wants to,   champ   can seriously heat things up! Like he did, when he crooned the lines ‘Tell me what you really like, Baby, I can take my time” from   by   and posted the video on his social media page recently. And boy, can this boy sing! Needless to say, the girls have all been going gaga, especially about the parts where he makes ’em go weak in the knees by singing some very hot segments, looking totally at ease doing so. a completely new side to the boy-next-door huh? We like!
