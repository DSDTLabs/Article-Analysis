GURGAON: Around 100 members of the   protested in front of the revenue office in Gurgaon on Monday against the delay in the arrest of contractor Ishpal Bhardwaj, who had allegedly oversold flats in the project.

 The project started in 1996, but even after more than 10 years, only 60% construction work has been completed. Moreover, the society has in all 94 approved flats, whereas the contractor allegedly sold the same to more than 200 buyers. After society members raised the issue in the district grievance redressal committee last year, an FIR was filed against Bhardwaj, his wife and four others at the Sector 56 police station under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 406 (breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) in October 2016.
 
 Even three months after the FIR, the   said, police have not been able to arrest Bhardwaj and his wife. However, two of the four other accused — Amit Bhardwaj and   (from the management) — had been arrested, Arvind Dahiya, SHO of Sector 56 police station, told TOI.
 
 “It has been almost three months since the FIR was registered and Ishpal Bhardwaj, who is the main accused in the scam, has not been arrested yet. While the district grievance redressal committee is pursuing the matter, we feel lower-level officials are stalling the process,” said Bhupinder Singh, one of the society members. The homebuyers further complained that the delay in the legal process is keeping them from taking over the management of the society. 
 
 It may be mentioned here that the additional registrar had issued a newspaper advertisement on December 10, 2016, with a 30-day notice window to submit all records related to society membership in   for preparing a tentative list for conducting general body meeting and regularising the society by board of administrator.
