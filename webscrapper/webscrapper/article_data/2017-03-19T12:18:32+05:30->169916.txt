While on one side, the film ' ' and itâ€™s team has been flooded with compliments from all over, the cast and crew were apparently insulted by police in Muvattupuzha recently. The actors were on the go promoting the film in a vehicle, when a police officer quizzed them and asked them to step out, suspecting that an immoral activity was going on. 

  After the incident happened, a totally miffed director LIjo Jose Pellissery posted a video, in which he talked about the bizarre events that took place to the actors at a time, when the mettle of the new talents had gone on to become the talk of the town.
 
 Actor Sarath Kumar said that seeing a girl, along with a group of men, the police presumed that they were indulging in some immoral affair. Actress Binny Rinky Benjamin said that the police spewed out abusive language and probed if such lascivious acts are a norm in the film industry. 
 
 Both Lijo and Binny echoed similar sentiments by asking if the people, who are to provide people safety, are themselves making one feel unsafe, and are instead hell bent on being a moral police and were involved in harassment.
 
 That said, we also hear that apparently, they were initially fined by the police for not adhering to the rules of the Motor Vehicles Department and fixing the poster of the film on their vehicle, against the guidelines.
