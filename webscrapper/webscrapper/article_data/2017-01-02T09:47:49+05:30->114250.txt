  The Northern Inuit dogs Thor and Odin played the Stark companions 'Summer' and 'Greywind' and now get fans from all over the world coming to see them.
  
  William Mulhall, who runs 'Direwolf Tours', said: "I got a phone call one day from the breeder, who had owned them saying that some TV show wants to use my dogs in it.
  
  "So I brought the dogs up to the breeder's house where the trainers from 'Game of Thrones' were and they had pictures and then that was it, that's how it began."
  
  "Game of Thrones" returns in 2017.
