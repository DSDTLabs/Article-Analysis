Coimbatore: The fifth day of Coimbatore Vizha on Monday featured various programmes from a book art workshop to heritage walk of Perur to open air movie screenings.

 The book art workshop held at Art Houz, Jenny’s Club, where artist Raja Rajan, a former software professional, taught the art. 
 
 Raja Rajan, instead of clipping book’s pages to work on their edges, has modified the art form by folding the pages. “The process involves a lot of calculations. I thought calculations would put off the participants. But they enjoyed doing them,” said Briget, a representative from Art Houz. She added that students, homemakers and tourists had participated in the workshop with equal interest.
 
 The Vanavarayar Foundation has organised the heritage tour of Perur and Patteeswarar temple. Jagadheesan, a former epigraphist in the state archaeological department, led a group of students and people around Perur and explained them the historical and cultural significance of the place.
 
 “We explained the group about the temple’s history, legends, architecture and inscriptions. We also covered the social and economic setup of Perur until the 15th century,” said Jagadheesan. 
 
 At another event in Kumaraguru College of Technology, V R Devika, who runs Aseema Foundation for arts in Chennai, gave an interactive presentation on Gandhian principles and the significance of the spinning wheel. “She showed video clips of Gandhi and spoke about socio-political connotations of his principles,” said Jayasree Murthy of Sthayi School of Theatre Arts that organised the event.
 
 In addition, Kovai Movie Fest, the first open-air movie screening in the city, was held at 6.30pm at CODISSIA grounds. Rajinikanth’s 1995 blockbuster ‘Baasha’ was screened on an LED screen in an amphitheatre setting for about 300 people. 
 
 The movie fest would be held till Friday. Hits and all-time favourites like The Lion King, The Dark Knight and Baahubali 2 are to be screened in the coming days.
