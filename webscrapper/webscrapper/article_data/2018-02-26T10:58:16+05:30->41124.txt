TIRUPUR: The Tirupur district administration on Saturday imposed a   of about Rs 2.8 lakh on an importer for trying to illegally sell imported sand from   in  . 

 The administration had seized 31 units of sand from nine trucks and handed it over to the public works department (PWD). 
 
 On February 16, Udumalpet revenue officials found the nine trucks transporting the sand from the Cochin Port. “We believe the Kerala-based importer has bought the sand to sell in Kerala after getting due permission. But he did not receive approval from Tamil Nadu’s PWD to sell the sand here,” said a revenue official. 
 
 Each truck was carrying three and a half units of sand to deliver the consignment at Vayalur near Palani in Dindigul district. “Since Tamil Nadu has banned the direct sales of imported sand without approval only in the last December, Udumalpet revenue divisional officers had consulted the state’s geology and mining department before seizing the vehicles,” said the official.
 
 On Saturday, the revenue officials imposed a fine of Rs 31,000 for each truck and seized the 31 units of sand. They released the trucks after the importer paid the fine.
 
 “We have handed over the sand to the PWD, which stored it in its office on Sardar Road at Udumalpet. After conducting quality test, the PWD may use it for government sanctioned construction work,” said a senior revenue official.
