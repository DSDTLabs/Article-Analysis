NEW DELHI: The governmentâ€™s special rural outreach saw poor achievements in schemes to deliver electricity and LPG connections but posted a good show in immunisation,   (bank accounts for the poor) and enrolment of beneficiaries in two insurance-related programmes. 

 
 As the Gram  , launched by Prime Minister  , drew to a close Saturday, the targets under   scheme to provide electricity supply to households and   for LPG connections showed a low yield. The target achieved was a meagre 34% under Ujjawala while it stood at 26% under Saubhagya scheme. 
 
 Sources said the GSA has been extended by around a week to achieve the targets with an official saying there is a time lag between KYC (know your customer) verification of beneficiaries and connections given under the two schemes Under Saubhagya, households are electrified by drawing a service cable from the nearest pole to the target premises, installation of energy meter, wiring for a single light point with LED bulb and amobile charging point. 
 
 The Indradhanush scheme, seeking to vaccinate children and pregnant women, reached close to the campaign target. As many as 1,66,863 children and 42,610 women were immunised against a target of 1,75,880 children and 44,694 women. 
 
 The GSA also managed to enrol a good number of beneficiaries under Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana to provide life insurance cover of Rs 2 lakh at a premium of Rs 330 per annum. Against a target of 17,10,409 individuals, the campaign enlisted 11,91,604 or 69%.
