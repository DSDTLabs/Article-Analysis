INDORE: A major fire broke out in   on Saturday, destroying standing crop spread across over 26 hectares of farmland.

 “Prima facie, it seems sparks from a high-tension wire was the reason behind the fire that first engulfed a hut and then spread to agricultural land near it,” sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), Ravish   told TOI.
 
 In the accident, crops on an area of 26.153 hectares were reduced to ash, causing huge losses to 14 farmers.
 
 The flames broke out in the afternoon and soon turned into a massive fire. Traffic at   highway came to a standstill as a large number of commuters stopped their wheels to see the incident. The situation came under control only after several fire tenders were roped in to douse the flames.
 
 The incident created panic among people residing in nearby localities. However, as the accident occurred on farmland far away from residential areas, no casualty was reported.
 
 “No loss of life was reported in the incident. Under section 6/4 of ‘Rajasva Pustak Patrika’, we will provide financial aid to the affected farmers,” Shrivastava said.
 
 He added that those having their crops insured can also claim for their loss from the insurance companies.
 
  said that according to government rules, the worth of the damaged crops is around Rs 5 lakh.
 
 “According to the rules, we have calculated the loss at a rate of Rs 1625 per quintal. As 12 quintals per hectare is the average production of crops. Market value of losses incurred will be around Rs 5 lakh” Mourya told TOI. He added that the affected farmers will be compensated in the next 10 days.
