KOLKATA: Bengal has become the latest to join the bandwagon of states providing low-cost meals for citizens.

 Ekushe Annapurna, named after the typically Bengali lunch of dal, rice and fish curry that will come at a princely sum of Rs 21, will start as a pilot project at five places in the city from March. The final plan envisages having a total of a hundred such stalls across the state.
 
 “We have chosen five places — the Ruby crossing, Gariahat, DLF in New Town, Shyambazar and   — in the city, where people will get their lunch at Rs 21 only. This will start from March. There will be a hundred stalls across the state from May,” a senior state food department official said.
 
 
  
 “We will start with a set menu but have plans to give people more options at a later stage. The meals will be available at a specific time to start with but, at a later stage, we have plans to make this an all-day affair. We have tied up with the fisheries department and the agricultural marketing dep-artment for this,” the official added.
 
 States like Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Delhi and Rajasthan already have such schemes. Tamil Nadu was first to launch Amma Canteens in 2013, which provided wholesome meals at subsidised rates. Uttarakhand then started   that served a variety of local food at Rs 20 a plate. This was followed by NTR Anna canteens in Andhra Pradesh, Ahaar centres in Odisha, Aam Aadmi Canteens in Delhi and Annapuran Rasoi in Rajasthan.
