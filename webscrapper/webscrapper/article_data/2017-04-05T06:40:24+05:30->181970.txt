CHENNAI: With work on the integrated stormwater drain project in full swing in expanded areas of the city, officials are surveying families who will have to make way for it. But many 'squatters' living along the flood-prone   are unwilling to move as it will impact their livelihood and children's education.

 Daily wage workers have lived in places such as   and   in the interiors of this western suburb for at least two decades. “We hold ration cards and Aadhaar cards. Water pipelines were laid to our homes almost ten years ago. Why give us everything and now tell us that we are living on poromboke land?” asks a carpenter, P Subramani.
 
 “The Koyambedu market is close from here and every morning we buy fruits from there to sell in other places,” says a worried vendor, Parvathi Annamalai. “Many women here work as coolies and housemaids. Where will we find jobs if we move so far away? Our children also study in government schools which can be reached in ten minutes by walk.”
 
 Residents in organised colonies of Maduravoyal, however, have been demanding drains for long. A long-time resident, J Ezhumalai of MMDA Colony, says that polluted water bodies have given rise to health problems. “When I moved in here, the Nolambur canal carried only rain water. Now, all sorts of waste gets in and there is a severe mosquito menace. It constantly stinks and during the monsoon, our localities get fully flooded,” the resident said. 
 
 Civic officials say that the entire project has been planned surrounding drainage basins and watersheds and hence it is a network connecting Maduravoyal to East Mogappair, Nolambur and Ambattur. “The excess rain water will drain into the Cooum basin,” said an official, adding that they will not begin any work without the consent of the families who are impacted during construction.
