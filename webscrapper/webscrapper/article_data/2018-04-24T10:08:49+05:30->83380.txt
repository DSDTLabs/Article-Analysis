 “After going through the   footage available with the Jaipur metro and the statements of the girl we have found it to be a case of attempt to rape. Thus, we have registered a case under Section 376/511 (Attempt to rape) of IPC. The accused was detained late on Sunday evening and after a lot of paperwork he was arrested during the early hours of Monday,” said a senior police officer of Jaipur metro police station. 
 
 The officer said that they will suspend the cop for this kind of behaviour while on duty. When contacted, Gaurav Srivastav, DCP (headquarters) and In-charge DCP (Metro) said, “I have transferred him to police lines based on his misconduct. And as DCP (headquarters) the misconduct report has been received and the necessary disciplinary action would be taken on Tuesday.”
