ALAPPUZHA: Opposition leader   said on Friday the   has never sought or accepted RSS votes. Speaking to reporters, the Congress leader said said both the CPM and the BJP were trying to create communal polarisation in the Chengannur assembly constituency and that it will create serious consequences.

 
 He said the two fronts were focusing on creating a rift between communities for electoral gains.
 
 “CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said the other day that the LDF doesn’t have any untouchability towards the BDJS or KC (M) but that it will not accept RSS votes. However, CPI state secretary   had been saying that the front does not need Mani’s votes and that will accept RSS votes. It indicates that there exists a rift in the LDF,”   said.
 
 “It is the fight between the LDF and the UDF in Chengannur. BJP leaders have not been campaigning for their candidate P S  . The BDJS is part of the NDA. The Congress has never held discussions with any party which is the ally of other fronts. The CPM, which has laid foundation stones for many projects keeping an eye on the bypoll in Chengannur, has not taken any step for executing such projects,” he said.
