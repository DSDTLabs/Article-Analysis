CHENNAI: In the last four months since the city got its first underground metro line between Nehru Park and Thirumangalam, CMRL’s   hasn’t stopped ringing. Calls have gone up by three times as commuters seek help to board trains or to switch from one corridor to another.

  officials said their helpline – 1860 425 1515 – has been receiving an average of 20 calls a day to since the underground line became operational. A majority of the calls are from commuters asking about ticket fares and trains to board to reach their destination. “All these commuters call us even before they head to a nearest station. We give them the information they want and also encourage them to download our app, as it makes easier for them,” a metrorail official said.
 
 A staff member manning the helpline said commuters also call them for train timings, frequency, smart cards, to get back misplaced items, lack of lighting or air-conditioning at the stations or trains.
 
 Officials say the number of calls has gone up from the average five to six calls a day before the launch of underground line in May. The setting up of an exclusive cell when the underground line was opened came in handy to attend to the increasing number of calls. The cell has two staff members working in shifts, from 6am to 11pm, to attend calls at the helpline desk and maintain a call log. 
 
 “Earlier one staff member from the operations control centre used to man the helpline, but we decided to open a proper desk with staff deputed exclusively for the purpose after the underground line and it is helping us. We are expecting the calls to go up, when Phase-1 is completely operational,” said an official.
 
  An average of 30,000 people take the metro during the weekdays and 35,000 during the weekends.
