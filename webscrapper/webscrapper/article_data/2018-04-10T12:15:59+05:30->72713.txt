COIMBATORE: Around 150 sanitary workers and overhead tank operators who staged a sit-in   at the collectorate on Monday were detained by police.

 The workers who had come from across the district said they were not given basic pay as fixed by the state government. Also, even workers who had been serving for more than 15 years had not been made permanent.
 
 P  , 55, a sanitary worker from  , said he had served for 20 years now, but still had not been made permanent. “My salary is still Rs 6,000 and has not been raised as per the state government order,” he said. He added that sanitary workers like him had to gather waste from at least 150 houses daily. “We have to segregate the waste using hands. We have to start by 4am and have to work without rest. We don’t get days offs. Our salary is cut if we take a day off,” said Mariyappan.
 
 The protesters were from municipalities, village and town panchayats from the district. They said there were overhead tank operators, school sanitary workers and hospital sanitary workers. As per a government order, their basic pay had to be fixed in the range of Rs 9,723 to Rs 16,228 based on whether they worked in village panchayats, town panchayats, municipalites or the corporation. But this was not done and they were given salaries which ranged from Rs 2,000 to Rs 6,000, said Mariyappan.
 
 The workers said were still contract workers and given daily wages. “In the past, we have been promised that we will be made permanent by several officials, but nothing has happened so far,” said M  , 40, a sanitary worker from Kangayampalayam, Sulur. The workers said that because of this they were not given the pension of Rs 2,000 as prescribed in the Seventh Pay Commission.
 
 Police detained the protesters and let them off in the evening.
