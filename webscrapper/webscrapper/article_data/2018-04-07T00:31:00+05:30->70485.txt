Vijayawada: Andhra Pradesh chief minister N   on Friday hinted that Telugu Desam Party (TDP) MPs won’t resign in response to the resignations of YSR Congress MPs’ resignation. He said that TDP MPs will fight and agitate for the state being in the house instead of running away from the scene.

 Making a statement after introducing a resolution seeking the Centre to take up the review of the Supreme Court judgement on Scheduled Castes, Schedule Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989, Naidu sought to know and why the YSRCP Rajya Sabha MPs did not resign. “Is it because some people need to lobby with the centre” he said. He questioned that why did the YSRCP MP not join the human chain formed by the opposition in the parliament.
 
 Demanding that it is the duty of the Centre to take up the cause of SCS, Naidu warned that TDP will agitate more in the coming days. Naidu said that as the Centre had given the   to the other states. “I demand that why don’t they give SCS to Andhra Pradesh” he said.
 
 Indirectly hitting at, Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan’s criticism on the CM’s experience not helping the state, Naidu said that his experience only saved the state from more difficulties.
 
 Naidu accused the BJP-led government for mudslinging on the state government. “They have spread lies about the AP government in Delhi, I have explained the national media the reality.” There is no truth in the campaign that TDP will align with Congress. Naidu came down on heavily on the opposition parties saying they are acting like those locals who helped the British during their inhuman rule. 
 
 On the other hand, the assembly also made resolution demanding centre to convene a special parliamentary meeting to discuss the issues of Andhra Pradesh. Speaker Kodela Siva Prasad Rao adjourned the House sine a die.
