VARANASI: A statue of Lord Buddha became a bone of contention between two groups at Chhahi village in Sarnath area. They clashed on the issue of its installation on gram sabha land on Saturday. 

 Seven people of both the groups have been arrested for breach of peace. The statue has been taken to Sarnath police station. Heavy police force was deployed to avoid any untoward incident in view of tension prevailing there.
 
 The people of Maurya community of Chhahi village, who follow Buddhism, had installed a statue near   temple on gram sabha land on the occasion of   on May 10 by assuring other villagers that it would be removed after the festival. However, a day after Buddh Purnima they constructed a permanent platform and installed the statue of Lord Buddha on it. This move of Mauryas annoyed the other group, who raised objection over it.
 
 A panchayat meeting was convened by the villagers on Saturday morning to solve the dispute. During the meeting, a group led by Shamsher Singh asked Mauryas to remove the statue, which the other group refused to do so. After a heated arguement, both groups attacked each other. Several people, including Shamsher and   were injured.
 
 SP city   reached there with police force and dispersed the mob. SDM Sadar and other officials also reached the village. SSP Nitin Tiwari said that Mauryas were told that their act was unfair and no statue can be installed on gram sabha land or public place without prior permission of state government. Permission of the district administration is required in case of installing any idol on private land.
 
 The statue is now in the custody of Sarnath police. An FIR has been lodged and seven people of both the groups have been arrested.
