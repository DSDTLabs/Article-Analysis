ARA: An Ara court on Saturday granted permission to the   police to take on remand Dabloo, who is the second accused in the journalists   and Vijay Singh’s   case. 

 After hearing the arguments of both the defence and the prosecution sides, additional chief judicial magistrate-7 Pranaw Shankar granted police the permission to take Dabloo on remand for 48 hours for interrogation. Dabloo, the son of former mukhiya (village chief) of Garhani panchayat in Bhojpur district, is one of the accused along with his father Harshu Miyan in the two journalists’ murder case.
 
 According to the FIR lodged by Rajesh Singh, the brother of the deceased, Harshu and his son Dabloo chased and rammed their SUV into the motorcycle the journalists were riding, causing their deaths on March 25 night at   near Garhani. It was alleged that the accused had heated exchange of words with the journalists at the Garhani market the same evening. While Harshu was arrested on March 26 by an SIT, his son Dabloo surrendered in an Ara Court on March 28, but his bail petition was rejected by the ACJM-7.
