THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The southwest monsoon is expected to hit Kerala coast by May 30, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) announced on Monday. IMD officials also said that India would get normal rains during this southwest monsoon season from June to September.

 IMD director general K J Ramesh said that average rainfall, this year, is likely to be 97%. The officials indicated the need for caution as sea surface temperature (SST) is likely to increase along with thunderstorms and squally winds, along the coastal areas, during the pre-monsoon phase.
 
 IMD scientist VK Mini said studies indicate that pre-monsoon (March to May) and post-monsoon (October to November) phases are periods of cyclone genesis with increase in temperatures.
 
 Studies indicate that in the regions surrounding India and Bangladesh, four   have occurred since 2006 and a total of   were reported in the past 25 years.
 
 At present, neutral Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions are prevailing over the Indian Ocean. As the extreme sea surface temperature conditions over the Pacific and Indian oceans—particularly ENSO (El Nino–Southern Oscillation) conditions over the Pacific—are known to have strong influence on the Indian summer monsoon, IMD is carefully monitoring the sea surface conditions over the Pacific and Indian oceans.
 
 ENSO is an irregular periodic variation in winds and sea surface temperatures over the tropical eastern  , affecting the climate of much of the tropics and subtropics. The warming phase of the sea temperature is known as El Niño and the cooling phase as La Niña, IMD officials said.
 
 Thunderstorms accompanied by gusty winds are likely in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Idukki, Ernakulum, Thrissur, Kannur and Kasaragod districts, IMD senior scientist NT Niyas said.
 
  are expected in parts of the state for the next four days. In the last 24 hours Vythiri in Wayanad and Vaikom in Kottayam received 6cm rainfall, he said.
