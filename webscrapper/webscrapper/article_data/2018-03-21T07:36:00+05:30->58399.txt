AMRITSAR : No one trusted Harjit Masih’s version that 39 Indians abducted by the Islamic State in Mosul, Iraq, had been killed within days of their abduction.

 Neither family members of the Indian victims nor the Union government trusted his version of events.
 
 All this time, relatives of hapless Indian abducted by the IS banked upon external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj’s assurances and refused to hear Masih’s version of events in June 2014.
 
 At their last meeting with   in May last year, Harbhajan Kaur, whose son Harsimranjit Singh was among those abducted by the IS, had outrightly rejected Masih’s claim.
 
 The Bebowal village resident had said, “Why should I trust Harjit and not my own government?”
 
 Gurpinder Kaur, sister of Manjinder Singh, one of the killed youth, had also rejected Masih’s version that he had seen the abducted Indians being shot dead.
 
 She had indicated that she was confused which version to believe when the Union government failed to provide any proof of the abducted men’s well-being. “I don’t know what to do, whom to trust, I am extremely worried, the government had apprehended their presence in   jail, which was in ruins but Harjit had claimed that all of them were shot dead,” she had said last year.
 
 After Masih’s claims, Swaraj had said that she couldn’t believe his version. “Trusting his version would mean that the government should stop searching the disappeared Indians, which the government can’t do,” Swaraj had said.
 
 Most of the families of the abducted youth are illiterate and largely believed what Swaraj told them. “There was no reason to trust Harjit’s statement when our own minister was giving us hope of them being alive,” said Sonia, wife of one of the killed youths  , a resident of Chavinda Devi in Amritsar.
