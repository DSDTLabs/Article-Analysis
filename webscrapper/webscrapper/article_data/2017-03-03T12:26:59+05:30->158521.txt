LUCKNOW: The sixth and seventh phases of   covering 89 assembly seats in the politically crucial east UP region will not be just about political heavyweights pumping in additional  . The last two phases will also see a big set of defectors who will determine the fate of their respective political parties. 

 Leading the pack are loyalists of SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, including MLC Ambika Chaudhary, Ballia MLA Narad Rai and Ghazipur MLA Vijay Mishra, who all turned rebel to join BSP after being denied a ticket by the new SP president  . While Chaudhary and Rai have been given a ticket from Phephna and Ballia Sadar, respectively, Mishra has been roped in by Mayawati to carry out anti-SP campaign in and around Ghazipur.
 
 Mukhtar Ansari, his brother Sibgatullah and son Abbas are now BSP candidates after their Quami Ekta Dal merged with Mayawati's party. The proposed merger of QED with SP had turned out to be flashpoint in the raging SP feud that saw Mulayam and his brother Shivpal Yadav getting sidelined within the party.
 
 Mayawati, too, could feel the heat, as her once close confidante Padrauna MLA Swami Prasad Maurya, after accusing her of selling tickets, is now the BJP candidate from his home seat. His move sparked exodus of around six MLAs from BSP to BJP.
 
 Chillupar MLA Rajesh Tripathi rebelled against Mayawati and is now contesting on BJP ticket while Shivpur BSP MLA   quit BSP to join BJP but did not get BJP ticket.
 
 Mulayam's loyalists defecting into her camp are important for Mayawati as she finds herself on a sticky wicket in the eastern UP region, where votes of minorities and Most Backward Castes are a challenge.
