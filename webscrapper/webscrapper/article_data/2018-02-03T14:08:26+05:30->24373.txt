PATNA: One   (19) and his 16-year-old girlfriend allegedly consumed pesticide and committed suicide after marriage at village   under the   police station in Kishanganj district on Thursday. Kishanganj SP   said they were in love for the past several years. Rahul was from Jalalpur while the girl belonged to a nearby village under   panchayat.

 “Rahul, an Intermediate student, left home on Wednesday evening after telling his mother that he was going to visit a nearby fair. The girl, a Class IX student, had left home the same day for her tutorial classes,” the SP said and added their bodies were recovered from a field on the outskirts of the village. An empty plastic bottle of pesticide was lying beside them.
 
 Pothia police station SHO   said the girl’s forehead was smeared with vermilion (sindoor) and both were lying together.
 
 “They were spotted at   market place on Wednesday evening. It seems they got married before committing suicide,” he said and added that their family members feigned ignorance about any affair. No suicide note was recovered from the spot.
 
 “It is not clear why they committed suicide. Both belonged to the same caste,” the SP said.
