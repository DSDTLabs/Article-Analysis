BHUBANESWAR: The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Saturday slapped a penalty of Rs 1 crore on   ( ), a society under the ministry of petroleum and natural gas, for allegedly putting up hoardings for a cycling event without seeking its permission. The event, slated for Sunday, is scheduled to be kicked off by petroleum minister   and the BMC action has triggered a political row between the   and the BJD. 

 The Saksham Cyclothon, organised by PCRA, is to make people aware of the need for fuel conservation. The BJD-ruled corporation has sent a letter to Debashis Ransing, state coordinator of PCRA, citing that 2000 posters were put up within the BMC area without seeking its permission and paying the necessary licence fee. 
 
 "You are directed to pay Rs 1 cr under BMC advertisement regulation, 2006, within a week of issue of the notice. Failing to pay the amount, action (as deemed proper) will be taken under municipal corporation Act, 2003," read the letter.
 
 Minutes after the civic body slapped the fine, the BJP criticized it saying the BJD's intolerance towards the party has been exposed by this incident. 
 
 "The state government has used BMC to scuttle the programme that is headlined by the Union minister. Rather than viewing it as a proud moment for the state, the BJD has decided to stoop low," alleged senior BJP leader and spokesperson Sajjan Sharma. He wondered how come the BMC noticed the posters a day before the event when it had been up since Thursday.
 
 It must be mentioned that nearly a month back the BMC had met all the political parties and a consensus was reached to restrict putting up posters at no-hoarding zones and to crack down on those erected without permission. A day later, the BJD workers were seen pulling down huge posters of chief minister   as well.
