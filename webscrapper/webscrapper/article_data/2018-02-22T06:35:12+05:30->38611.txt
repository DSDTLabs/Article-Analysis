AHMEDABAD: If the proposal to increase   made by   while presenting the   on Tuesday is approved, spirits might become be a costly affair for   in the state. Rough calculations based on estimates of the additional fees and excise on alcohol sold in the state, provided by the prohibition and excise department, indicate priced will increase by between Rs 56 and Rs 874 depending on the type of liquor.

 “Health permit holders have alcoholic drinks for medical reasons and will do so even if they have to pay a little extra. The government however, should not have increased taxes to such a greater extent,” said Narendra Somani, president, Federation of Hotels and Restaurants Association, Gujarat.
 
 The price of strong beer will increase by 62% and those preferring single malts, aged wines and ultra-smooth vodkas will have to pay between Rs 650 and Rs 900 more for a 750ml bottle.
 
 “Excise on wine and spirits has gone up form Rs 100 per proof litre (alcohol content) to Rs 300 per proof litre. Special fees on spirits have gone up by Rs 90 per bulk litre (total quantity) on spirits. This will raise prices sharply and burn holes in consumers’ pockets,” said a city-based hotelier.
 
 Estimates by the prohibition and excise department suggest there are 37,766 liquor permit holders in Gujarat. These include an estimated 10,431 from Surat, 9,882 from Ahmedabad, 4,300-odd from Rajkot and 2,731 from Vadodara, among others, said a source.
