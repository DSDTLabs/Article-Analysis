MUMBAI: Taking lessons from the Elphinstone station foot over-bridge tragedy of last September that claimed 23 lives, BMC chief Ajoy Mehta has instructed all 24 ward officers across Mumbai to construct temporary shelters outside railway stations where commuters can wait on heavy rain days. 

 A ward official said, "We have been told to put up shelters outside railway stations where commuters can wait when it pours. The idea is to prevent people from gathering on the station and blocking exit/entry points." Officials have started identifying spaces where these shelters can come up. Another official said such shelters may not be required at all stations. "Shelters will be required only where staircases land directly into the open area. Stations like   and Mahalaxmi have space for commuters to wait if it is raining." 
 
  Activist Nikhil Desai said, "There is a possibility that when it is not raining, these shelters could be misused." -Richa Pinto
