Surat: Railway Users and Passenger Service Committee (PSC) has asked Western Railway (WR) general manager to provide a separate divisional office at Surat railway station.  The demand was made when WR GM G C Agarwal and Mumbai division DRM Mukul Jain visited Surat railway station on Friday to take stock of the situation and understand the problems being faced by passengers at the railway station.  Railway Station Development Citizen Forum (RSDCF) also made a slew of demands saying that Surat railway station was the highest revenue earner in western region with an annual income of Rs400 crore. Yet it is not being given a divisional office, it said. Around 1.20 lakh passengers alight and travel from Surat to various destinations in the country. Around 30,000 current tickets and 10,000 reserved tickets are issued for various destinations from Surat every year. RSDCF’s Sanjay Jain told TOI, “Surat is the fourth fastest growing city in the country, still it is being ignored by the WR in providing divisional office and stoppage of important trains like Duronto, Sampark Kranti etc. For even small issues and other official work, the railway officials have to visit Churchgate in Mumbai. If Surat has DRM office, then the issues concerning the stations from Ankleshwar to Umbergaon and Surat to Tapti line can be sorted out right here.” PSC member Rakesh Shah said, “The issue of Sahara Darwaja railway underpass is still not resolved by the WR. The GM has given strict instructions to the officials to resolve the issue during the meeting. The issues related to pass-holders were also discussed at the meeting.”
