Noida: A pilot project to reduce   as well as operating cost of   by running them on   ( ) and diesel in a 70:30 ratio was launched in Noida by Indraprastha Gas Limited (IGL) on Saturday. 

 The company will do so with the help of a dual fuel kit, similar to the ones used in cars. 
 
 According to officials, the use of PNG along with diesel for power backup will result in saving 20% operational cost as most residential societies in Delhi-NCR use diesel-run generators.
 
 IGL is the supplier of compressed natural gas (CNG) and PNG in Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad. Recently, it also got a retail licence for Gurgaon. 
 
 V Nagarajan, director (commercial), IGL, inaugurated the supply of PNG as a fuel to a dual injection genset at Victory Crossroads Residential Complex in Sector 143-B of Noida on Saturday.
 
 The installation of dual fuel kits in the already installed diesel generators has been undertaken by a private company, Control Infotech. Similar dual injection gensets are already in use in industrial and commercial units, but this is the first experiment in a residential society in NCR.
 
 “The performance of dual fuel generators would be closely monitored in terms of efficiency, performance, etc during the pilot phase. The learning from this project would be used to develop the road map for introduction of dual fuel generators in apartment complexes across the region,” IGL said in a statement.
 
 Jitendra Rathore, regional manager, Control Infotech, said, “We do not make any modification in the gensets. We just fix a dual-fuel kit. The kit helps the automation of PNG and diesel which is used in the proportion of 70:30.”
