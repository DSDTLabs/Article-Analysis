MUMBAI: On Wednesday, Shiv Sena   Anil Parab alleged that chief minister   had "encouraged scams and irregularities" during his tenure as the mayor of the Nagpur municipal corporation and that he had no moral rights to demand transparency in the BMC. 

 Parab said that the state appointed the Nand Lal committee to conduct an inquiry into irregularities in the Nagpur municipal corporation in August 2000. "The panel submitted its report on February 2001. Nand Lal in his report passed strictures over the functioning of the corporation, while Fadnavis was the Mayor in Nagpur," Parab said. Parab claimed various contracts were awarded to specific contractors only by "circumventing" the standing committee during Fadnavis's stint in 1997-2001. Parab said there was "corruption" during his tenure as the mayor. 
 
 BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari refuted the allegations against Fadnavis. "This is proof that the Shiv Sena and Congress, have a tacit understanding. Although the Congress gave information about the report to the Sena, it didn't informed them that the graft charges were rejected by the court as it did not find substance in the matter."
