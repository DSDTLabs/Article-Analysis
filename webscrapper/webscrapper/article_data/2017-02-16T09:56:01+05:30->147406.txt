HYDERABAD:   claimed two more lives in the city within a span of 48 hours, taking the toll to 10 since Januray 1 this year.

 Health department officials said a 68-year-old man from Kushaiguda and a 22-year-old woman from Prakashnagar in Begumpet died at the Gandhi Hospital. While the man died on Wednesday, the woman succumbed on Saturday last. “In  , we have had 52   positive cases so far this year, including 26 swine flu patients who were referred from private hospitals,“ said Dr  , superintendent, Gandhi Hospital.
 
 However, experts are stumped by the abnormal increase in number of cases. Only in 2015, H1N1 positive cases touched an all-time high number of 3,000. “Rise in H1N1 cases may be attributed to increased awareness levels among people, leading to more samples being tested,“ explained Dr Reddy.
 
 However, Dr Suneetha Narreddy , Infectious Diseases Consultant,  , sees other reasons for the spike in cases.“Studies in the temperate countries have shown that influenza virus survival and transmission are better when the temperature and humidity are low. Some of the reasons include rebreathing of air inside room as people do not go out much during the winter. Decrease in Vitamin D and melatonin due to lack of sun exposure may also be a contributary factor,“ she explained.
 
 Doctors warned that infected people should cover their nose and mouth with a mask. Others should wash their hands frequently to prevent the spread of flu.Drinking plenty of water is also recommended.
 
 High-risk populations including pregnant women, elderly people, diabetics, people with asthma, chronic bronchitis and kidney disease must take the vaccination for swine flu.
