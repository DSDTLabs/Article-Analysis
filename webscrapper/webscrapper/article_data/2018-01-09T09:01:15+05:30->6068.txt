CHENNAI: Municipal administration and water supply minister S P Velumani on Monday set a March 31 deadline for local bodies in Tamil Nadu to begin work on delayed and pending proposals under the smart cities project.

 The minister chaired a review meeting with bureaucrats at the   headquarters in   and discussed the status of smart city and Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) proposals. A statement from the corporation said 12 municipal corporations had altogether received clearance from the Centre to execute 173 proposals worth Rs 13,425.65 crore under smart cities project.
 
 “Out of 173 (proposals), three worth Rs 3.65 crore have been completed. Work is under way for 14 proposals of Rs 491.97 crore. Tenders will be called soon for another 37 proposals of Rs 1,795.92 crore. Detailed project reports (DPR) are being made for remaining 19 proposals worth Rs 11,134.12 crore,” the statement said.
 
 The minister told local body officials that bids must be invited for proposals nearing tendering stage by January 31. “Projects whose DPRs are being prepared must be ready for tenders by March 31. Priority must be given to drinking water and sewerage schemes, roads and storm water drains,” Velumani said.
 
 Under the AMRUT scheme, the Centre sanctioned projects worth Rs 11,489 crore for 33 cities in Tamil Nadu. These are 18 drinking water projects (Rs 6,508.73 crore), 18 sewerage line projects (Rs 4,757.60 crore) and 392 park projects (Rs 222.67 crore).
 
 “Of the total 428 projects sanctioned under AMRUT, 83 park maintenance projects, worth Rs 44.92 crore, have been completed,” the statement said, adding the remaining projects were under various stages of execution.
 
 The minister said the government is reviewing the cost estimate for a proposed 150MLD desalination plant at Nemmeli, on the outskirts of Chennai. The plant is estimated to cost the state as much as Rs 1,079.89 crore.
 
 The   too has encountered delay in execution of smart city proposals. Last week, TOI reported how theT Nagar pedestrian plaza has remained a non-starter even though trials were held 14 months ago.
