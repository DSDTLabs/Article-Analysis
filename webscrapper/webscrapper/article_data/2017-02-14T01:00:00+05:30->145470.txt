Imagine waking up one morning and being able to hear what’s going on in the minds of the women around you!
Life OK’s 'Har Mard Ka Dard' has a special surprise for all men this Valentine’s Day. The show, made in association with   and Tony Singh from DJ’s Creative Unit, revolves around a Punjabi family where   (Faisal Rashid) is struggling to keep his wife Sonu ( ) happy. He relentlessly prays to a Goddess and is granted a boon, which will enable him to hear the thoughts of every woman around him.
 
 Coming back to the show, the superpower will change Faisal’s life. Will it be a boon? Will he handle women differently? Will his love for his wife grow? Will he be the only man to live happily ever after? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I wish I had this boon when I wrote One Indian Girl from a woman’s perspective. I wouldn’t have had to go through a rigorous research of interviewing more than 100 women that took several months. If I had this superpower, I would have not only been able to do this, but also reach the moon.
 
 
 
 The first thing I would do is, meet all the grandmothers in the world. No matter how popular I get, I’ll never be able to cook like them. This boon will help me know some of the rarest recipes, and I will be sole bearer of their secrets. I can definitely say that it will revolutionise the food and beverage industry. 
 
 
 
 This superpower sounds very exciting. It will help me understand my wife better. A happy wife means a happy life and I’m hoping this secret power will help me achieve what no other man has.
 
 
  
 It’s very intriguing and fun to know what thoughts actually run through a woman’s mind. Be it professional, as in my co-stars, lady directors, producers or on the personal front. I would love to have this superpower.
 
 To know more, catch 'Har Mard Ka Dard' starting tonight at 8 pm on Life OK.
