MADURAI:   police in Sivaganga booked Naser Ali, son of   MP from   district, for allegedly cheating a Chennai-based woman of 50 lakh on Sunday. The accused, who was allegedly in a relationship with the woman, had also falsely promised to marry her. 

 A police officer said that Ali was booked under IPC Sections 417 (punishment for cheating), 420 (cheating) and 506(i) (criminal intimidation) and Section 4 of Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Woman Harassment Act. 
 
 The case was file based on a complaint by 35-year-old Robina of Madipakkam in Chennai. 
 
 Robina approached the Chennai commissioner's office to lodge a complaint against the MP's son, a couple of days ago, after she came to know about his marriage that was scheduled to take place on Sunday. She was directed to approach the Ramanathapuram police. When she approached the district superintendent of police, he assured action. 
 
 Meanwhile, she went to Karaikudi where Ali's marriage was scheduled to take place in a hotel and tried to barge in. As she was not allowed, Robina left the place and lodged a complaint with the Karaikudi police. She has stated that Ali took money from her to start a business, but did not return it.
 
  While he had promised to marry her, he went on to marry another woman. Robina claimed she had got the money by pledging her jewellery and by borrowing from relatives.
