NEW DELHI. BJP MP Nepal Singh said today “these things happen”, when asked about the country’s soldiers martyred recently in a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir, reported ANI.

 The BJP MP from the Rampur constituency in Uttar Pradesh also said that jawans are in the Army and thus should expect death because of the profession they’re in.
 
  “Soldiers in the army die every day. There is no country in this world where in a battle, soldiers do not lose their lives. These things happen,” said Singh when he was asked about the Pulwama, J&K terror attack of Sunday.
 
 Later, when asked about his allegedly insensitive comments, Singh said he didn’t mean to insult the Army.
 
 “I feel sad (about the martyrs), and I am sorry, but I didn’t say anything insulting”, he said.
 
 Singh was then asked why India allegedly doesn’t ensure the safety of its soldiers the way Israel does.
 
 Here was his reply to that: “Do you know of any device that can prevent death of a human? Please share with me one object that can render bullets ineffectual. We will make sure to use them in defence of our soldiers.”
 
 In addition, Singh compared Pakistan-sponsored terror attacks with village brawls.
 
 “Even when villagers fight among themselves, there are few who get injured,” said the BJP MP.
