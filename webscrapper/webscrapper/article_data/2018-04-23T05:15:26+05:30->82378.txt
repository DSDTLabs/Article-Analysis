NEW DELHI:   president   on Sunday slammed the opposition and individuals questioning the government over recent crimes against women and said the Centre had taken several measures for empowerment and safety of women.

 
 “The champions of equality should not teach us. In our culture, women have status of deity. Our culture is ahead of equality and women are seen as on the top of the social hierarchy,” Shah said while addressing the party’s women workers in Ghaziabad.
 
 He recalled the   government’s initiatives including death penalty for child rapists. “Modi government has made   Act more stringent now. Besides, several initiatives of the government are bringing positive changes in women’s lives,” he said.
 
 Shah said PM Modi had insisted on safety and empowerment of women. “Schemes like toilet in every household and LPG connections to all have been equally helpful in empowerment of the women,” Shah said.
 
 He said the whole world was acknowledging that India had turned into a global economic power and the country’s image had changed.
