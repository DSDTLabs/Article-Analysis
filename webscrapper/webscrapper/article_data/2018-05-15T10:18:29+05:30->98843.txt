NEW DELHI: State-run oil companies on Tuesday hiked petrol and diesel prices for the second straight day after a 19-day hiatus ahead of the   assembly elections.

 Before Monday, petrol and diesel prices were last revised on April 24 when they were hiked by 13 paise each. But prices were frozen thereafter. 
 
 This despite benchmark international rate for petrol going up from $78.84 per barrel, which was used for raising the price to Rs 74.63 a litre on April 24, to $82.98 now, according to sources privy to fuel pricing methodology.
 
 The benchmark international diesel rates during this period have climbed from $84.68 per barrel to $88.63. Also, the rupee has weakened to Rs 67 per US dollar from Rs 66.62, making imports costlier.
