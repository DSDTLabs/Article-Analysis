PANAJI: In a unique case, candidate Jose ‘Joseph’ D’Silva filed two nominations from the Fatorda constituency, representing two different parties, the Congress and the   (GVP).
 
  Depending on the adjudication of the returning officer (RO), D’Silva or one of the political parties can withdraw one of his nominations, failing which he stands the chance of being technically disqualified, Narayan Navti said, adding that a candidate can only have affiliation to one political party. The decision of the RO can be challenged, but only after the election.
  
  Sources said GVP will withdraw the ‘Form B’ given to Silva, making him the Congress candidate from Fatorda, who will take on the might of Vijai Sardesai of   (GFP). This will be in contradiction to the “understanding” between the Congress and GFP.
  
  Accusing the Congress of being controlled by the BJP, Sardesai said that D’Silva, who filed his nomination on the last day, is being helped by BJP leader Damodar Naik.
  
  “I have information that the Form B used to fill nomination was given to D’Silva by Naik. The main opposition party is being controlled by the ruling party,” Sardesai alleged, adding that the conduct of the oldest party of India shows that everything was pre-planned.
  
  Silva thanked AICC general secretary in-charge of Goa   and state Congress president Luizinho Faleiro for reposing faith in him.
