Pune: More than 70 sonography centres are under the scanner for violating the provisions of the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostics (PCPNDT) Act. If an inspecting team finds out a violation of Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostics (PCPNDT) Act’s norms, then a notice can be served on the doctor running the sonography clinic or the abortion centre as to why the centre/clinic’s registration should not be suspended under Section 20 (1) of the PCPNDT Act. If a violation of any norm of MTP Act is found, then the centre in question can be served a suspension notice under Rule 7 of the MTP Act, 1971.

 “Besides the month-long drive, we periodically carry out inspection of sonography centres. We have also sought explanation from erring centres in Pune city by issuing them showcause notices,” said Vaishali Jadhav, the appropriate authority entrusted to ensure effective implementation of the PCPNDT Act in Pune.
 
 The state family welfare department had issued a slew of instructions and a checklist to bring in uniformity in inspection of sonography clinics and abortion centres. The officials need to ensure that all inspections are carried out according to the action plan and doctors are not unnecessarily harassed.
 
 Within the municipal corporation limits, the medical officer of health or any civic health official designated by the ministry of health is responsible for supervising the effective implementation of the act.
