NAVI MUMBAI: More than 1 lakh residents of Turbhe and APMC market wards faced a four-hour   on Thursday from 8.30pm to 12.30am.

 The   was due to a spark in an outer supply box, causing a complete blackout in the node. Although the supply was restored at 9.30pm, another spark in the supply system added to the woes of the residents on a hot and humid day.
 
 Residents tried calling the local MSEDCL office but did not get any response as nobody attended to the complaints. “It took time to trace the fault line and frequent flash outs made our task more complicated. We left no stones unturned to get the supply back after three back-to-back sparks. Our team finally restored the supply by 12.30am,” an MSEDCL official said.
 
 Children and elders were the worst-affected. Shirish Borse, a local resident, said, “Those four hours were a nightmare because of the heat. Calling the local MSEDCL office was of no use as there was no attendant to answer the phone.” Residents alleged this they have suffered such power cuts before. “It has become a regular feature since the onset of the summer.”
