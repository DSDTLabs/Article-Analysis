PUNE: The   has dismissed a   (PIL) challenging a recent   decision pertaining to the   to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009. 

 On January 10, the government had passed a resolution to make the management of schools responsible for filling the 25% quota of free seats available to students from the economically weaker sections (EWS) under the RTE act.
 
 Earlier, the responsibility of filling up these seats lay with the state education authorities. 
 
 The petitioner had argued that the government resolution (GR) would result in the abuse of freedom by the school management, and cause injustice to deserving students. 
 
 The PIL also took exception to a clause in the GR allowing admission to eligible students who live farther than 3km from the school - provided their parents pay the transportation costs. This, argued the petitioner, would "dilute" the purpose for which the free seats were provided under the act.
 
 However, the bench comprising chief justice   and justice G S Kulkarni observed in a recent order that it was unable to agree with the contentions raised by the petitioner. "The decision in question is, admittedly, a policy decision," the bench observed, adding, "We do not find anything illegal or arbitrary in the state government having the said provision in the policy in question."
 
 The bench noted that allowing the school managements to fill up the quota of free seats would not cause any prejudice against or injustice to the children seeking admission under the EWS quota.
