 has wrapped up his  , which has Samuthirakani, Bharath Seeni, Subhiksha, Krisha Kurup and   (in a cameo) in crucial roles. Quiz the cinematographer-turned-director if he is cashing in on the success of his hit   by titling this film as Goli Soda 2, and he says, “Not at all. In fact, titling this way is a risky proposition. People watched the first film with no expectation, liked it and praised it. Now, they will be coming in expecting a film as good as that one, or something even better. So, it is not possible to cash in on a title. People come to a film only if they are attracted by the publicity desgins and trailers. Otherwise, such titles only add to the pressure.”

 He says that this film needed this title because it talks about a theme that the first film also talked about — identity. “Goli Soda was about youngsters who were trying to create an identity for themselves. But what do we do after creating an identity? Everyone from film stars to the common man tries to build upon that identity, so it is a constant struggle. The three protagonists in this film try to expand their identities, but face problems doing so. How they take on these problems is what the plot is about,” he elaborates, and adds, “In fact, if I hadn’t titled this film as Goli Soda 2 and gone with a different title, after watching this film, people would have commented that I have repeated the same story again.”
