PANAJI: Based on the approval given by the party's   (CEC), Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) on Thursday released the names of 27 candidates for the February 4 state assembly polls. 

 While the names declared by the party include the sitting MLAs, crucial constituencies where an alliance is expected were missing from the list announced.
 
 The names were declared after a marathon meeting with party president Sonia Gandhi in Delhi.
 
 The Party has yet to announce the names of candidates in Panaji, Fatorda, Calangute, Mayem, Benaulim, Vasco and Saligao.
 
 In a move that will irk party workers and the block committees, GPCC on has accommodated, former chief minister Ravi Naik, and former minister Filipe Nery Rodrigues in the list of candidates.
 
 The party is already facing strong resentment at the block level as party workers are upset over the alliance that appears to be brewing. Despite Congress block committees clearly giving the thumbs down to any alliance, especially with Goa Forward Party, it is now looks inevitable that the alliance will happen.
 
 Goa Forward Mentor and Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai is likely to be backed in Fatorda while the United Goans Party’s Atanasio Monserrate is going to stand in Panaji constituency with the Congress’ blessings.
