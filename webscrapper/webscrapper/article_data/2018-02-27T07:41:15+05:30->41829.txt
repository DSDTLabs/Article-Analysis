BHOPAL: Summer brings good tidings for fliers.   airlines will begin operations from   to Delhi, Mumbai, Nagpur and Ahmedabad in March.

 “The airline will start operations to these four cities by March-end. We will get the summer schedule soon,” said airport director, Flight Lt Akashdeep Mathur. These will be ATR flights (68-78 seats), he added. 
 
 With this, the number of flights from Bhopal airport will increase from 10 to 14. At present, Bhopal is directly connected to Mumbai, Delhi, Raipur, Lucknow and Hyderabad. Patna and Jaipur are also connected via a stopover at Lucknow. The airport director said that the management is looking at proposals to connect other cities too.
 
 “Over the last one and a half years, we have been trying to bring more airlines to Raja Bhoj Airport. Our focus has been to connect as many cities as possible,” he said. “The arrival of IndiGo is just the beginning. Our efforts have started paying dividends,” the director added.
 
 Mathur said that the main task ahead is to connect Bhopal with south India. “Our next target is the two major cities in the South — Chennai and Bengaluru. If we can manage to connect Bhopal with Chennai, it will make a huge difference,” he said adding that his plan is to woo passengers who have to travel on long-distances in trains.
 
 “Bhopal is very well connected by train. But once more airlines start operations here, airfares will become competitive. And because of that, we will be able to give tough competition to railways, as people prefer faster mode of transportation,” said Mathur.
 
 The airport authorities have been trying to attract airlines and improve passenger services. A swanky food outlet will be opened in a couple of months as a part of   ( ) scheme of master concessionaire. A team of architects and a Kanpur-based food company visited the airport to check the type of outlets that can be set up here.
