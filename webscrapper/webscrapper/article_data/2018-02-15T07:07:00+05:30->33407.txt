GHAZIABAD: A gang of   robbers, who used to loot passengers by posing as either crime branch officials or military personnel after offering them lifts in cars, was nabbed on Tuesday. 

 The police have seized a blue beacon from the gang members that they used on top of their cars as well as a pen drive that contained audio clips of wireless conversations among cops.
 
 Police said the gang members used to play audio clips of the wireless conversations inside their car thereby giving the impression to their victims that they were undercover sleuths on an operation. 
 
 The police have recovered two luxury cars — a Toyota Etios with a blue beacon and a forged registration number plate and a Chevrolet Aveo — from the three gang members. The three — Mukesh, Sanjay, Indrajeet — are in their late 20s and belong to   in Delhi.
 
 Police claim that the men have confessed to committing nearly 60 loots with the same modus operandi in NCR and also in western UP region. 
 
 “Some 30 incidents of loot have been committed by the men in   alone in the past few years on   and NH-24 besides other regions in the city. The men had trained themselves to talk in the manner and accent of seasoned military personnel and cops. They used to force passengers after giving them lifts into handing over all their valuables inside brown envelopes. They used to exchange empty envelopes with the passengers when dropping them,” said SHO, Masuri police station, Satyendra Singh.
 
 On January 18, the men had robbed a 53-year-old man on NH-24 after giving him lift in a car when he was going to   from his daughter’s house in Sector 82 of Noida. The police have recovered Rs 42,000 cash and some gold ornaments from the accused.
