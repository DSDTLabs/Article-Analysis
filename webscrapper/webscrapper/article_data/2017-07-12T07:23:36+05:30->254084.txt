Kolkata: Speaking at the Times NIE Principal’s Meet on Tuesday at The  , state IT and electronics minister   said, “School was a place of unlimited fun when I was a student but with the stress caused by increasing competition, the joy of learning is lost today. We need to make studying in school a joyful experience.”

 Basu’s audience included heads of over 90 schools from in and around Kolkata. He was among three speakers, including Debanjan Chakrabarti, British Council director (east) and Alokananda Roy, actor and danseuse, who spoke on “Learning for Success in a New World”, organised by The Times of India in association with Mindhour, KnwEdu and Kydsmart and hospitality partner The Lalit Great Eastern Hotel.
 
 Basu stressed, “We need to emphasize on learning beyond classrooms so that our students get equipped with skills needed to meet the the 21st century challenges.” Roy shared: “I was not really interested in studies and I hated maths. Yet, I did it as I had to.” She asked schools to give marks for creative activities so that parents would take it seriously. “It is not just through academics that you can give back to life. I gave a lot to society through dance,” she said. Chakrabarti also admitted to being hopeless in maths and his dreams when he was in school — playing cricket for India or tennis at Wimbledon.
