GURUGRAM: The department of town and country planning ( ) and   officials will prepare and submit a proposal to the state government for filling gaps in the cityâ€™s power infrastructure. 

 
 KM Pandurung, director-general, town and country planning, met with the district town planner and the   officials on Tuesday and Wednesday, working on a proposal for augmenting power infrastructure in privately-developed colonies in sectors 1 to 57. On Monday, he also met members of 16 RWAs and some private developers, including   I, Sushant Lok I, Palam Vihar, Suncity, Vipul, Vatika, Malibu Towne, Ardee City, Raheja Developers, Uppal Housing, JMD, Omaxe, Parsvnath Developers and  , to discuss the same. 
 
 The discom officials said nearly Rs 944 crore would be needed for the project. 
 
 DTCP has received several complaints against builders for over-calculation of load. Other RWAs complained that builders had not developed power infrastructure on the basis of the demand and hence, residents were facing frequent power cuts.
 
 Officials plan to expedite setting up of new substations to solve the problem of power cuts in private colonies. Soon, DTCP will be clearing land for the same.
