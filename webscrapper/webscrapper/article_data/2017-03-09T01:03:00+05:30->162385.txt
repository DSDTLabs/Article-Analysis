Karan Johar’s latest production   has generated curiosity since the time it was announced. After all, it sees   and Alia Bhatt pair up on screen again after their hit film Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania, which was also directed by Shashank Khaitan. Given the popularity   and Alia enjoy, more so among the youth, the anticipation around the film is high. And in keeping with the demand from their fan clubs, campus visits were incorporated into their promotional tours across India.

 The actors visited two colleges in Delhi, a college in Lucknow, a school in  , another educational institution in Jaipur among others during their city tours and got an overwhelming response from the youth. A source accompanying them said, “Varun and Alia were welcomed with such loud cheer that it would take a while to silence the crowd so that the two could interact with them. Considering the popularity of the songs, it was great to see collegians dance to Varun and Alia’s tracks like   Ki Dulhania and Tamma Tamma Again. The students were equally gung ho about Aashiq Surrender Hua, Roke Na Ruke Naina and Humsafar.” 
 
 Badrinath Ki Dulhania, produced by Dharma Productions, releases tomorrow.
