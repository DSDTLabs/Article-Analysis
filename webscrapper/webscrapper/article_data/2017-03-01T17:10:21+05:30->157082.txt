THANE: Dozens of hoardings with faces of political candidates and banners with Thank You messages for city voters seem to have cropped up in various parts of the city after a short break during the election code of conduct. While hundreds of Thaneites have been spending the last couple of weeks beautifying the walls around with colours and art, these political parties have negated the entire drive by putting up these eyesores in the public domain.

 Be it billboards of party leaders and winning corporators thanking citizens for their votes, flags outside the party offices or even banners promoting their future plans for citizens, these politicos have left no stone unturned when it comes to making up for their break from these activities during the election code of conduct. Residents said that these political advertisements and hoardings have ruined their wall painting and Swachh Bharat campaigns.
 
 Smruti Sawant, a   resident, said, “Over the past few months we have been participating in cleanliness drives and undertook wall beautification initiatives to help make the city look vibrant.What is the point of such citizen initiatives if the first thing I see after opening my window are the ugly hoardings of political parties.They could have used the money wasted in the hoardings to help residents.“
 
 Meanwhile, citizen activists asserted that as the   has released several instructions to curb the menace of illegal banners and hoardings in the past, these actions of the politicos are directly disrespectful to the government authorities and will only stop if the election code of conduct is applicable throughout the year.
 
 “The political parties don't seem to be afraid of any government organisation except the  , which could affect their candidates' coming to power.This is why all the illegal rallies, hoardings, etc disappeared before the elections. Now that they have secured their seats, they are back to their old tricks, as they don't seem to fear any authorities,“ said Dr  , citizen activist from Thane.
 
 Bedekar asked that if citizens' representatives don't obey the laws, how can people be expected to follow in their footsteps. “The only way to ensure the permanent removal of these hoardings is if the election code of conduct is made applicable not only before the elections, but also throughout the term of the elected corporators,“ said Bedekar.
