MUMBAI: The state government on Thursday said it had shown no   treatment to   in granting him 256 days of remission for his release from prison last February, but added if anything is found amiss it would be willing to send him back to jail. 

 Maharashtra advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni informed a bench of Justices R M Savant and   that the government released the actor "only on completion of his full sentence on calculating each and every day after following rules of furlough, parole and remission." 
 
 He, however added, "If after considering the entire material it is found that Dutt was released earlier than what is required under law he may be put back into the prison." One of the judges interjected to say, "We are not suggesting he be sent back to jail." The HC was hearing a public interest litigation filed by Malad resident   whose lawyer   has questioned Dutt's "early release due to special treatment".
