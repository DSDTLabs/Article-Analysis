CHANDIGARH: Empty shelves are greeting Bacchus lovers at shops across the city owing to the tardy  .

 Majority of the popular brands -- VAT 69, 100 Pipers, Black and White, Blenders’ Pride, Royal Stag, Signature, and Old Monk -- of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) are not available at the 89 liquor vends in the city.
 
 Non-availability is due to delay on part of the UT excise and taxation department in determining ex-distillery price (EDP) even after more than a month since the new excise policy came into force on April 1.
 
 Liquor cannot be sold until EDP of different brands is determined. Delay in determining EDP has become commonplace in the past few years.
 
 The old liquor traders are surviving on leftover stock of last year, while the traders who bought shops this year only have a handful of brands to sell. Krishan Garg, who has a shop in Sector 45, said traders were facing a loss of Rs 50,000 per vend per day. “We don’t have anything to sell as most of the brands are not available,” he said.
 
 Wine Merchants’ Association president Satya Pal said, “The department should ensure that EDP is fixed in time. Delay has become a norm due to which traders and customers face inconvenience.”
 
 Sources said the situation was expected to ease in a few days as EDP of almost all the brands has been approved by the department.
 
 Despite repeated attempts, UT assistant excise and taxation commissioner RK Chaudhary was not available for comments.
