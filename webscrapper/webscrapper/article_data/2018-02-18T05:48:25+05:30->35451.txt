CHENNAI: A day after the SC verdict on Cauvery water dispute,   chief minister   on Saturday said Karnataka would oppose setting up of the Cauvery management board as stipulated by the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K   said at Coimbatore airport that he was disappointed over the apex court cutting down TN's share of Cauvery water by 14.75tmcft. 

 The SC, while reallocating the share of Cauvery water among the riparian states, had directed the Centre to constitute the board within six weeks. Karnataka has been against the board as it would mean the state losing control of the reservoirs and dams that come under the Cauvery basin.
 
  Palaniswami, on the other hand, said, "We hope the Union government will constitute the Cauvery management board and water regulation committee soon. Our legal experts will go through the entire judgement and based on their suggestions, further action will be taken". P 4
