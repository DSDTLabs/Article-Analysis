MUMBAI: Two masked men barged into an e-commerce herbal products shop in Powai, confined the manager and fled with Rs 9.5 lakh on Sunday. Officials of Powai police station said that   footage shows the duo waiting for the complainant,   (22), to come out of the shop and overpowered him. 

 Deputy commissioner of police (zone X) Navinchandra   said the robbers seem to be aware of the daily collection and the complainant's routine. "The robbers gagged him and bound him before stealing the cash which he was to hand over to his employer," said Reddy.
 
  The two men fled with the cash in just 10 minutes. "Two masked men are seen in the CCTV footage, keeping a watch on Rathod. One of them charged at Rathod when they saw him coming out of the shop. The second too entered in and confined him and robbed the cash," said senior inspector Anil Pophale.
