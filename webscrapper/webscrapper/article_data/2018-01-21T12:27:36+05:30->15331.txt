 is in no mood to do cameos. The last time he did one, it boomeranged on him. Just before last Durga Puja, he found himself locked in a bitter battle with Dev. Both the heroes had a big release to their credit, but Prosenjit also did a cameo in Devâ€™s Cockpit after the younger hero reportedly turned up at his doorstep with the request. Back then, it was not decided that Cockpit would release with his Yeti Obhijaan.

So, this time around, when another commercial star asked our   to be part of his film, he quietly turned down the offer. Once bitten, twice shy.
