 says he would like his children to interact and spend quality time with singer Jennifer  's kids. 
The 45-year-old singer says organising a playdate is something which keeps their kids close to normal life. 
 
 "We must (organise something)! Some way, somehow, we need to get together. I'm sure that (their) kids go through exactly the same emotions my kids go through. It is a pretty unique lifestyle."
 
  
  
 "I  , this is what's normal for us and we wouldn't change it for anything, but I think that generation of children that have parents that are entertainers, they need to get together. We'll see what happens," says Martin. 
 
 Martin is father to twin sons Matteo and Valentino, eight with partner Jwan Yosef. While Lopez also has twins - son   and daughter Emme, nine - from her marriage with singer Marc Anthony.
