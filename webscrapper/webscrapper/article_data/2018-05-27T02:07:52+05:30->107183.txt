 MUMBAI: The Central Railway (CR) will spend Rs 30 crore to repair the foot over-bridge (FOB) at the   railway station. 

 The FOB remains unused as its iron flooring has come apart. Thousands of daily commuters cross the railway tracks to move from one platform to the other. The railway station is a part of Diva Panvel section. 
 
 A   Pachnand station official said that the FOB has not been used since 2011, as it has been completely damaged. This will prevent risky track crossing by passengers. All Konkan trains to Mumbai pass through the station. It can be noted that throughout the day 16 passenger and EMU trains have a halt at this station. CR will commence work after completing the procedure. 
 
 As the Taloja area is developing fast the number of commuters are rising. A local resident   alleged, “As the FOB is damaged the railway commuters are facing a lot of inconvenience.”
