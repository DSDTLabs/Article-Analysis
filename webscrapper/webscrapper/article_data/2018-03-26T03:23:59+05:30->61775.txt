MUMBAI: An   who slapped a flight attendant on board a flight last week has been grounded till further notice, said an   (AI) spokesperson. The supervisor was also AI's nodal officer for liaising with the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA). "She will undergo crew resource management training. She will be removed from her post as   nodal officer too," the spokesperson added. 

 Last week TOI reported that on board AI flight 121 on March 17, a flight attendant who mistakenly served a business-class flyer a non-vegetarian meal was slapped by the cabin supervisor. 
 
 The passenger, who was seated on 1D, saw that the meal served to him was the wrong one and pointed it out to the cabin supervisor who happened to be around. In the business class galley, the supervisor confronted the flight attendant about the mistake, only to lose her temper and slap the attendant. 
 
 "It wasn't the first time that this supervisor has hit a crew member. There have been written complaints against her in the past too," said a source. 
 
 The attendant later raised a report with the management about the incident.
