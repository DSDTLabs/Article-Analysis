AHMEDABAD: The state government has requested a city sessions court to issue warrant against Patidar quota agitation leader   and his close aide   for not remaining present on court dates in connection with a sedition case.

 Hardik and Bambhaniya were granted bail by the   high court last year on the condition of attending court proceedings without fail. The government has complained that the duo did not appear before the court during the proceedings and hence an arrest warrant should be issued against them.
 
 In another application, the state government has demanded speedy trial in this case citing security issue for Ketan Patel, a co-accused who has turned an approver in this case.
 
 Meanwhile, a   (PAAS) renegade and another accused in the case,  , too has urged the court for speedy trial. The court is yet to frame charges in this case. The court has posted hearing on these applications on September 20, said public prosecutor Sudhir Brahmbhatt.
