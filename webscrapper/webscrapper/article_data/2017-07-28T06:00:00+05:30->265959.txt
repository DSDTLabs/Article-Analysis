KOLKATA: A woman, driving a hatchback in an allegedly drunken state, hit a road divider at the   crossing on EM Bypass near Beliaghata traffic post on Wednesday night. Not only did she misbehave with the cops who came to her rescue, she even kissed one of them.

 Though no case was lodged in the case, the woman and her husband — who was in the rear seat with another woman — were taken to the   (south) police station and warned against creating any nuisance in public again. The duo were let go in the morning.
 
 Witnesses said, the car, with a press sticker on it, was moving towards EM Bypass at 12.15am when it hit the divider. When the cops reached the spot, the woman — a College Street resident — got out of the car and got hold of an officer’s collar. “Then, she suddenly kissed another officer. A cabby tried to help us but the woman scratched him. Finally, her husband helped us and we made her sit next to the traffic post. Within minutes, she lied down on the pavement and could hardly respond to our questions,” said an officer who was present at the spot.
 
 The car was towed away as its front portion was damaged. “The husband must have thought they would be prosecuted so he tried to defend his wife and take the onus on himself. He claimed he was the one who was drunk and would take the blame for the incident,” the officer added. The police they didn’t lodge any case in the matter as no one was injured. “We hope she will not repeat such behaviour,” said a cop.
