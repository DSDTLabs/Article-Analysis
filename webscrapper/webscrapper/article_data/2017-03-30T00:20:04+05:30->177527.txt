Panaji: Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) cracked down on illegal food stalls and confiscated 11 carts that were operating inside the capital without the requisite permissions. The temporary carts were attached for obstructing traffic movement and for setting up permanent locations, especially near Samrat theatre on 18th June Road. CCP has attached five illegal carts that were operating without number plates while the remaining have been confiscated for violating the terms of the licence, which required the carts to be temporary and mobile.

 Several stall owners objected to the crackdown and refused to cooperate with the CCP staff. In order to pre-empt any violence against the CCP staff, police protection was sought by CCP. tnn
