JAISALMER: In order to provide financial assistance to the martyrs, actor   in collaboration with the Central government will soon launch a website and app.

 An outcome of the joint efforts by Kumar and BSF (north) DIG  , who is also a friend of the actor, the website will have information on martyrs and their families along with bank details so that anybody willing to extend financial support can send money online. Government will launch the website. The website will also be connected to a mobile app which too will have all the information. A martyr’s family will be eligible for a total donation of Rs 15 lakh and once the family receives the desired amount, details of the family will be erased from the website.
 
 “The country has a population of 125 crore and if 15,000 people gove Rs 100 then the family will get Rs 15 lakh in just four hours. Moreover, without filling any form, future of children of a martyr would be secured,” he said.
 
 Kumar has always taken a proactive role in helping martyrs’ families and has extended financial assistance to several of them. Families of three martyrs from the state — Gurnam Singh,   and Narpat Singh — each received Rs 9 lakh from Kumar recently.
 
 Being an armyman’s son, Kumar is well versed with their life. 
 
 “Kumar has a high regard for men in uniform,” said Lodha. “Through the website, anyone can help families of martyrs. The objective of this initiative is to create a platform where people can come forward and directly help a martyr’s family. Several people want to contribute but they don‘t know how,” he said.
