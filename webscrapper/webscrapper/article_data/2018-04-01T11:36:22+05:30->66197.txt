AHMEDABAD: Procuring   has become costlier from Sunday for   across  , after deputy chief minister and state finance minister Nitin Patel announced a hike in the transportation fees and special fees on liquor in his budget speech.

 Sources in the prohibition department however, said that health/ tourist/ visitor permit holders purchasing liquor from permit liquor shops in Gujarat may not have to shell out more from Sunday itself if the concerned liquor shop has old stock purchased on or before March 31.
 
 “The impact will be visible to permit holders after a week or 15 days, as the stock purchased in April reaches the counters,” said a well-placed source in the state prohibition department. 
 
 However, permit liquor shop owners will have to pay more, as the newly imposed transport and special fees will now be applicable. Rough estimates based on the proposed increase in transportation fees and special fees on liquor and estimates provided by state prohibition department officials indicate that liquor prices will go up by Rs 56 to Rs 874, depending on the type of liquor. tnn
