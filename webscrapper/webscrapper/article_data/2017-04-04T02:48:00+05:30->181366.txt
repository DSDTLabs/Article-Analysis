NAGPUR: “The fact that the   won assembly elections in the state of Uttar Pradesh and formed governments in two other states does not say anything in favour of demonetisation. It does not mean that all the issues related to   are solved and everything is right. Demonetisation was the failure of   (RBI) as far as its implementation is concerned,” said  , vice-president of   (AIBEA).

 Utagi, who is also the leader of Kamgar Sanghatana Samyukta Kriti Samiti, and was speaking on the topic ‘Effects of demonetisation on Indian economy’ during a programme held on Sunday at Tilak Patrakar Bhavan, Dhantoli.
  
 He further said that the cooperative and district cooperative banks faced a lot of problems during the period. “Problems were faced especially because they were banned from exchanging old notes or accepting deposits,” he said. 
 
 “Also the recent decision of the government to extend the last date till when non-resident Indians (NRIs) can exchange money is a total injustice to the Indians residing within the country. It also raises doubt regarding the transparency of the process,” Utagi said.
 
 He also raised voice against the inaction of the authorities against a private bank. “Axis Bank played a false game. Their 19 employees were proved to be defaulters after transferring Rs 100 crore to some fake accounts. And later no action has been taken against them,” he said.
 
 Lawyer Anil Kale said, “All the chaos has been created because of fake currency of just Rs 400 crore. Small industries and many people suffered because of demonetisation process. The RBI has not uttered a single word till now and is unable to manage the implementation of demonetisation properly.”
 
 Vice-president of Janmanch Amitabh Pawade resented a vote of thanks. Manohar Raut, Rajendra Gangotri, NL Sawarkar, Kalyan Hirekhan, Shailesh Janbandhu, Sanjay Narkhedkar and others were present at the event.
