NAGPUR: Swami Vivekananda sowed the seeds of nationalism in the country. We may have been born in different religions but this is our country, so before anything else we are Indian first, said   while delivering a lecture on ‘Contribution of Swami Vivekananda to rebuild India’ here on Thursday. 

 If a person does something wrong, should his/her religion be blamed or the person for following the religion in a wrong way,” asked Swami Virabhadranand at the second day of the three-day RN Roy lecture series being held at Gramgeeta Bhavan, Nagpur University campus.
 
 Talking about reservation, Swami said that if everyone is Hindu, Muslim or of some other religion, then where is the real Indians? “People are fighting in the name of religion. This is the legacy of the divide and rule policy the British adopted to rule our country. So, if it comes to reservation, it should be given to only economically backward class people. Otherwise, all must see themselves as Indians.”
 
 Throwing light on various aspects of Swami Vivekananda’s life, Swami Virabhadranand said that for Vivekananda man was the greatest god. “Man has invented so many things, has the power of knowledge and also went to the moon. A man possesses love and infinite source of energy. A man can create and destroy anything in the world. If a dacoit can become Valmiki than anything is possible. We just need the right spirit,” he added.
 
 Vice-chancellor of NU   and pro-VC Pramod Yeole were present at the programme. DM Shende proposed a vote of thanks.
