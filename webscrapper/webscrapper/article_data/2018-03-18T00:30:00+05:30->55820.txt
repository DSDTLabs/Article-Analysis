Bengaluru: The state Congress unit on Saturday issued notice to party MP M Veerappa Moily’s son Harsha seeking an explanation on the controversial tweet of “road contractors dictating terms on the party’s selection of candidates.” 

 Though Moily’s twitter account had also carried the same tweet, sources said the issue is being looked into by AICC president Rahul Gandhi. The KPCC is not empowered to take action against the party’s MLAs and MPs.
 
 KPCC president G Parameshwara has asked Harsha to give an explanation. Moily and his son’s identical tweets late on Thursday night had caused embarrassment to the party, though both had claimed it had been deleted and their accounts had been hacked. Moily reacted in New Delhi saying they could never post anything anti-Congress. 
 
 The tweet read: “ INC needs to solve money in politics. We can’t afford to have road contractors and their nexus with the state PWD minister determine how candidates are selected for the upcoming assembly elections.” The tweet also tagged Rahul’s official twitter account, all-India and Karnataka Congress official accounts.
