AURANGABAD: Amid the garbage crisis in the city, a group of citizens undertook an awareness campaign against the use of plastic carry bags at the weekly vegetable market on Dargah Road from 10 am to 2pm on Monday. 

 Maheshwari Mandal, a community group, conceptualised the campaign and roped in members of civil society. More than 200 people, including students of government polytechnic, Vijendra Kabra College, Shri Vidya Primary School, Ulkanagari and   took part in the campaign.
 
 The campaigners reached out to the vegetable and fruit vendors in the market and shoppers and sensitised them about the problem of plastic bag in waste management. 
 
 Jamuna Mandhani, one of the organisers, said, “We appealed to people to give up plastic bags by bringing their own bags from home. The response was impressive. One of the woman shoppers immediately emptied the plastic carry bag and carried vegetables in her saree. The sight was heartening.” 
 
 Th schoolchildren displayed their handmade banners and raised slogans against plastic bags 
 
 The organisers had set up a sugar cane juice centre and and gave the juice and eco-friendly bags for free to people. 
 
 The move is significant and coincides with the state government’s plan to put a blanket ban on plastic bags and disposable cutlery. The ban is expected to be rolled out during the end of this month.
