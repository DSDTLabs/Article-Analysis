MUMBAI: Eleven years after a 45-year-old   assaulted and kicked his   in her private parts at their   home, the plucky housewife’s unwavering testimony led to his conviction and one-year sentence.

 The court refused to grant benefit of the Probation of Offender’s Act to the man found guilty of molesting the woman. The court said provisions of the Act, which allow for an accused to get away without a sentence on the assurance of good behaviour, could not be extended to him. “If benefits of the Act are extended to offenders, like those punishable for outraging the modesty of a woman, it would not only encourage escalation of crime, but it would also become difficult to check or arrest perpetration of such crimes and jeopardize modesty of women even at their own homes,” the Andheri magistrate court held. 
 
 A complaint was registered with police in 2006. The woman was at home with her children at 6pm on November 12, 2006, when the man came home and kicked the door. Seeing his state, the woman told him to sleep outside the house. But this angered the man, and he began to abuse her. He hit the victim on her chest and kicked her in the private parts. The victim slumped to the floor in pain and was unable to stand up. When she attempted to get up, he hit her again and she fell down. When her husband arrived an hour later, she narrated the incident to him. The accused abused her husband too. The victim was taken to hospital as the pain was severe and two days later she lodged a police complaint. 
 
 The woman was the only witness to depose in court but the defence did not cross-examine her. The court held that in its absence her testimony remained “intact and inspired confidence”. It also pointed out that the accused in his final statement before it accepted that he had accidentally kicked the woman. He had said it was not intentional. The court said that it showed he beat the victim and helped corroborate the prosecution’s case.
