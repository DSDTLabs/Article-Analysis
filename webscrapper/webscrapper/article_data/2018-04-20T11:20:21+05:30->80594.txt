NEW DELHI: Since he was handed a 12-month ban by Cricket Australia for his role in the ball-tampering controversy that erupted during a Test match in South Africa last month, and then had his IPL contract torn,   has been laying low. 

 
 
 
 On Thursday, however, his wife Candice posted photos on her Instagram account that showed the exiled Australia opener working on a construction site. In specific, Warner was seen working on his family’s new mansion situated in the beachside Sydney suburb of Maroubra.
 
  
  
 
 In her posts   shared a photo of Warner in a hard hat and with construction tools in his hands, captioned “D Warner, project manager, apprentice celebrity” and also the couple’s daughters hearing hard hats. 
 
  
  
 
 
 Subsequent videos doing the rounds of Australian media outlets show Warner in a black singlet and hard hat with the words “Project Manager” and “Celebrity Apprentice” interacting with a construction crew. 
 
 
  
  
 
 According to The Australian, the 31-year-old purchased the 900sq m property for AU$4 million in 2015 and the plot has been in development since May 2016. 
 
 
 
 For his leading role in the ball-tampering controversy during the third Test between Australia and South Africa in Cape Town in March, Warner has been suspended for one year and stripped of ever holding a leadership role within the Australian team. The CA investigation found that Warner was guilty of giving advice to a junior player on how to tamper with the ball "including demonstrating how it could be done” and for misleading the Newlands match officials by concealing his knowledge of and involvement in the plan and did not voluntarily report his involvement.
