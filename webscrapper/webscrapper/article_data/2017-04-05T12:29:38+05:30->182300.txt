AMRITSAR: Sikh top clergy on Tuesday released the list of 44   who had sought   Sacha Sauda’s help in contesting the Punjab assembly elections held on February 4. The high priests have now asked all of them to submit their clarification at the Akal Takht on April 17.

 Jathedar of Akal Takht Gurbachan Singh issued two lists — one has the names of Sikh leaders who had gone to Dera Sacha Sauda, and the other of those who had attended the workers meeting outside the sect’s headquarters in Sirsa. The two lists have names of 44 Sikh leaders, including 29 from SAD, 14 of Congress and one of AAP.
 
 Prominent among those who figure in the lists are: Sikander Singh Maluka, Janmeja Singh Sekhon, Parminder Singh Dhindsa and Surjit Singh Rakhra, all from SAD; Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, Amarinder Singh Raja Warring, Sadhu Singh Dharamsot and Khushbaz Singh Jattana from the Congress. Narinder Singh Sandha of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is also been told to appear before the Akal Takht.
 
 Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president   had constituted a sub-committee on the instruction of the Akal Takht to identify Sikh leaders who violated the Akal Takht directives issued in 2007, which prevented Sikhs to have any political, religious or social relations with Sirsa dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh.
 
 Earlier, on March 30, informal   appointed ‘jahtedars’ had also released the list of those Sikhs who had violated the 2007 directions of the Takht. Their list included 39 names, including 27 from SAD, 11 from the Congress and one from AAP. The parallel jathedars had announced to pronounce atonement upon them on April 20. They had also sought suggestions from Sikhs around the globe on the issue.
