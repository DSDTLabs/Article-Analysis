NEW DELHI : A seven-year-old boy, who was kidnapped from his house in northeast Delhi’s Gokulpuri almost two-weeks ago, was   on Tuesday from Bulandshahr in Uttar Pradesh. A former employee of the boy’s father has been arrested for the crime. 

 DCP (northeast) Atul Kumar Thakur said that the accused, Nawab, used to work at the factory owned by the boy’s father Trilokchand. 
 
 However, Nawab was fired from the job, following which he decided to kidnap his employer’s son in order to take revenge.
 
 Officers said that a neighbour of Nawab in Bulandshahr helped police in the case. “The woman told us that Nawab went to her house a few days back asking her to take care of the boy for some time, as his wife had been admitted to a hospital. He told her that the boy was his son,” an officer said. However, his wife later denied that the boy was her son, the woman told officers.
 
 Also, as police began investigating the case, Nawab came under the scanner as he used to visit Trilokchand’s house frequently. 
 
 Nawab told police that he intended to hide the boy at the woman’s place and later sell him off to make money.
