LUCKNOW: Students of Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) expressed dissatisfaction and anger over the board’s decision to hold re-examination of class XII economics and class X mathematics papers after both the papers were allegedly leaked.

 
 Class XII students said that reexam had doubled their tension as not only they have to reappear for the board exam, but have to also prepare for undergraduate admission entrance test for various colleges and universities.
 
 
 “Entrance test for admission to   in various universities is scheduled in April. My parents have booked the flight tickets in advance for the tests but now the trip has to be cancelled. Not only the money spent has gone waste, even the preparation for the entrance test has been disturbed,” said a class XII student Aparna Singh. “Economics examination was easy and I was expecting good marks which would have helped me score better and get admission to the desired university. I am now apprehensive whether I will be able to perform the same way in the rescheduled examination,” said class XII student Ankita Agnihotri. Students said that they were also afraid that the difficulty level of the examination might be raised due to the paper leak incident. “All of us were more stressed about the mathematics examination as compared to other subjects. The difficulty level of the examination was not so high and we were expecting good marks.
 
 
 The decision has not only come as a shock for all students but also the fear of tough mathematics paper is traumatizing us,” said   Pratishthi Agarwal.
 
 
 Another class X student   said, “All are upset as not only did we have to cancel our trips, we will again go through the same stress levels which psychologically affects our preparation.”
