HYDERABAD: Despite tall claims by the state government that it has established hundreds of residential schools and vastly improved the government educational institutions set up, 1862 rural habitations in   do not have a single government school.

 
 As many as 20,754 children living in these rural habitations travel over two kilometres every day to go to school and come back home. Most of these habitations in these districts are inhabited by tribals.
 
 
  
 
 These are the details revealed in a survey conducted by   authorities and Sarva Sikha Abhiyan officials. Enquiries by TOI revealed that schools won’t be set up in these habitations in the academic year 2018-19 as a result of which nearly 21,000 students have to go to schools located at least two kilometre away from their habitations next year too.
 
 However,the state govt has issued a GO providing free transport to all the students as per Right to Education Act.
 
 “One main reason is that these habitations have small population of five to 12 families with school-going children being very few. To establish a school, a building needs to be constructed, two teachers have be there and other infrastructure. Also, most inhabitants keep migrating. Only after a detailed survey, it was decided to provide free transport to the children as it is more feasible. The money would be reimbursed by sarva sikha abhiyan authorities, Government of India,” School Education Director   said, adding that free transport was provided last year as well.
