If the tune of   has been stuck in your head — and with good reason — rest assured that you’re not the only one. Such is the popularity of the   soundtrack that for the first time, a DJ night was held in the city recently at which the tracks of the movie were played. Despite its popularity, the man behind the music —   — is humble and gives all the credit to director  .

 “Suri has been very supportive and guided me throughout the process. He told me the basic storyline and asked me to compose based on human emotions rather than situations, such as love, anger and fear. He was very clear about what he wanted, so it made composing the tracks that much easier. At the same time, he gave me my space and was very patient. We cracked the songs in 4-5 months and producing them took another three months, so we took our time with it,” says Charan. And all the time invested in the album has certainly paid off.
 
 
  
 Considering the diverse nature of the album, how difficult was it to break away from one emotion and switch to the next when composing a new track? “It’s hard to break away from moods. But therein lies the challenge — to not repeat yourself and come up with something new. At the end of it, it’s like winning a war,” says the music director.
 Ask him about the popularity of the tracks and Charan says, “It’s very overwhelming. I am extremely happy; this is a very big break for me.   had a very urban soundtrack, and with Tagaru, I could reach out to the masses as well.” 
 
 And the fact that   appreciated all the songs only drove Charan to work harder. So, is he now taking a break to soak in the praise? “I get very restless when I take a break, so I’m full-on into work. I love working, so immediately after this, I will start on another score,” he says, singing off.
