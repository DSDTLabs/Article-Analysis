THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   Kerala unit has come out against the BJP leaders who have questioned the patriotism of film maker Kamal and writer  .
 
 Shiv Sena Rajya Pramukh   alleged that BJP leaders were infected by 'Modi mania', which according to him prompts them to brand all those who speaks against the interest of BJP leadership and Modi as 'traitors'. Shiv Sena and BJP were in loggerheads in the state for quote a long time and the Shiv Sena had even fielded candidates against BJP leaders in the last assembly election.
  
 “BJP leadership that come out against M T Vasudevan Nair for his comments on demonetisation is now questioning the patriotism of film maker and Kerala Chalachitra Academy chairman Kamal. The two and a half year rule by BJP has created an emergency like situation in the country. The economic emergency is more evident in villages. It’s a paradox to say that patriotism should fly high at a time when the country is facing the perils of economic emergency'', Shiv Sena said.
  
 Bhuvanachandran asked the BJP state unit to stop challenging writers and cultural leaders in the state. He also wanted the BJP to reveal the source of funding it received for the high voltage political campaigns of BJP in the state.
