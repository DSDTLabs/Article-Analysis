Tirupur: The farmers have urged the central and state governments to take steps to fix minimum support price (MSP) for shallots and help them export the bulbs as the market price has fallen steeply.

 The farmers placed their request at a grievance redress meeting held in the city on Friday. Along with Perambalur, Trichy, Dindigul, Namakkal, Thoothukudi, Tirunelveli, Virudhunagar and Coimbatore districts, Tirupur constitute more than 80% of shallot production in the state. This year too, the shallot cultivation has covered around 1,000 hectares of agricultural lands in Tirupur.
 
 “In cultivation, we bought small onion seeds for Rs 150/kg and 600 would be needed for sowing in an acre. With fertilizers’ cost and labour charges, total cultivation cost would come around Rs 1.3 lakh per acre,” said T Gopal of Parambikulam Aliyar Project.
 
 Since the market price has gone down steeply, traders were ready to procure the small onion, which was one of the important commercial vegetable crop, for Rs 12-15/kg. It was at least one and a half times lesser than what it was sold before three months ago. In many places, no buyer has come for the crop, said the farmers.
 
 Gopal said, “Even if the farmers could store the crop for few months, possibility for the price increase was seemed to be remote. So, the central and state governments should come forward to fix MSP for the crop and take steps to export them.”
 
 “Without such measures, there will be chances for increase in the price, and help the farmers to meet at least break even in the small onion cultivation,” he added.
