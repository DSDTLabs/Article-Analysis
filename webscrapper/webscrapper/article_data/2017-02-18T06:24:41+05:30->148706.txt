THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister   here on Friday reiterated his stand that isolated protests should not be allowed to decide the fate of   aimed at the overall progress of the state.

 The chief minister was speaking after inaugurating a two-day   here. “We should be able to go ahead with projects, even if there are isolated protests. If we fail to go ahead with the projects, the state would lose projects necessary for its basic development. Withdrawal from projects due to isolated protests had cost Kerala dearly in the past,” he said.
 
 It’s important to enhance the transmission capacity of power lines for distribution of quality power. Those who face difficulties due to the capacity addition of lines are being compensated.
 
 “It’s only a few trees under the power transmission line that are to be cut down. The land and everything else on the land would continue to be there without any issues. The government stand is that improvement of transmission line capacity and gas pipe laying is for the benefit of all. All should cooperate for the common good,” he said.
 
 PInarayi said the government efforts were to ensure quality power throughout the year. 
 
 “But the same cannot be achieved, only with a few small hydel power projects. Even  's power station at Kayamkulam remains closed down now. Such situations should change. We hope the proposed 200Mw solar power project in Kasaragod would be operational in this year itself,” he said.
 
 Pinarayi who prompted the use of energy-efficient and safer electrical equipment asked the power department officials to emulate effective models, from other states, to reduce electricity related accidents.
