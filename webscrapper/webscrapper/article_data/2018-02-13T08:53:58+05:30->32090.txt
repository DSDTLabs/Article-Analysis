KOLKATA: Four boys and two girls from four houses in the   area near   went missing on Sunday. They had left home around the same time on various pretexts like playing at the local ground or meeting friends. One of the boys, however, returned on Monday morning. He said he lost track of his friends at   station and returned home. His inconsistent statements, though, only deepened the mystery, said police.

 Aged between 7 and 17, the boys and girls reportedly made a meticulous plan without even letting their parents know what they were up to. The   footage at a Metro station showed the six in new dresses. They were also seen carrying bags on their back. A source said when they had left home, they were not carrying any bag.
 
 Police have already left for Burdwan along with the boy, who returned on Monday, after receiving some clues.
 
 Mother of a runaway boy and a girl was shocked. “On Sunday we had a guest at home. So, we had a late lunch. A little after lunch, my son said that he would go out to play. My daughter also said so. I asked them to return before evening. Alittle after they left home, my son came running. He was sweating. I asked him to take rest, but he left immediately,” she said.
 
 She was later shown the   footage to ascertain the identity of the boys and girls. She said the clothes her son and daughter were wearing while boarding a Metro were not the ones they were wearing while leaving home. “I had rebuked them on Saturday, but I don’t think they would leave for that,” she added.
 
 Aunt of another missing boy said, “My nephew had stopped going to school. On Sunday afternoon, he went out to play with a girl and didn’t return.”
 
 One of the girls had left a letter addressed to her mother. It read: “You did not allow us to talk to Mumpy and Mumpy did not speak to me. She said that she was going far and would not return shortly.”
