GHAZIABAD: In sporadic attacks against   in   on Wednesday, a mob vandalized a shop near Old Bus Stand while another shop was forced to down its shutters in Daulatpura.

They vandalised the furniture and smashed bottles on the ground even as staff of the outlet hid inside. Mobile phone videos that began circulating on social media showed several men scampering away with bottles in the melee.
 
 The women alleged that the wine shop has been encouraging men from neighbouring localities to take to booze. Late on Wednesday evening, Ghaziabad police arrested four men who were involved in the attack. 
 
 An FIR was also registered at Sihani Gate police station under sections 147 (rioting), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 352 (assault and usage of criminal force) of IPC besides relevant sections of Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013. Nearly 50 unidentified persons have been named as accused in the FIR.
 
 “The group comprised people mostly from Ghukna, Kaila Bhatta, Peera Garhi and other neighbouring localities. Women cops have been asked to nab women involved in the attack. More arrests are likely soon,” DSP Manish Mishra told TOI.
 
 At around 5:30 pm, another group forced a liquor outlet near the Daulatpura flyover to shut. However, there was no   or damage to property. Members of the group, who identified themselves as  , were pacified by police.
