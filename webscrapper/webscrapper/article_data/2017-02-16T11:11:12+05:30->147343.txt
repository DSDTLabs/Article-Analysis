IMPHAL: Senior   leader   has said the framework agreement signed between the Centre and   (I-M) does not contain any points which can harm Manipur's territorial integrity. 

 The agreement contains only three clauses, he told TOI. The first says the Centre will recognize the unique history of the Nagas, the second says the sovereignty of India lies with its people, and the third says a framework will be drafted under the flexibility system of India. The third clause refers to the possibility of modification of or amendment to the existing political system. 
 
 It is Congress, he claimed, which is indulging in politics for electoral gain. He said BJP will "safeguard the territorial integrity" of Manipur and  's "ploy" will not succeed.
 
 Joy said it would be wrong for Congress leaders to project BJP in a poor light on the basis of assumptions about the Naga agreement. He referred to the events of 1972. Three candidates, including Rishang Keishing, were elected on   (UNIC) tickets. UNIC was a regional party, which later merged with Congress after signing an agreement which said UNIC did not oppose the Naga movement. Joy asked if Congress had withdrawn from the agreement, adding that the state unit of BJP will not accept it.
