CHANDIGARH: Congress rebels who go ahead with contesting the assembly elections against the party’s candidates would be expelled for life and barred from making a re-entry, said the party’s Punjab chief, Capt Amarinder Singh, on Friday.

 Amarinder said in a statement issued here that he was committed to accommodating such rebels in key positions after the Congress formed the government, but only if they withdrew their candidature and supported the party’s choice. “Party discipline has to be maintained, and the interests of chosen candidates will be protected at all costs. Those who do not withdraw or retire from the contest will be thrown out and not allowed to ever come back,” he said.
 
 The former CM said he, along with Congress in charge of Punjab affairs Asha Kumari, had successfully quashed a rebellion in most of the 20 constituencies where there had been reports of problem on this count. “Most of the rebel candidates have, in fact, agreed to withdraw nominations they had filed as independent after being denied the official party ticket,” he said.
 
 The   chief made it clear that there was no question of showing laxity towards those who continued to violate party discipline, and it had been decided that strict action, including expulsion, would be taken against them if they failed to withdraw their papers before the last date of withdrawal announced by the   or to retire thereafter.
 
 It was important, he said, to set a precedent so that the party polity and propriety is not violated. Expressing his gratitude to those who had agreed to withdraw from the poll fray, Amarinder said as loyal soldiers of the party it was the duty of all to follow the policies and accept the decisions of the high command.
