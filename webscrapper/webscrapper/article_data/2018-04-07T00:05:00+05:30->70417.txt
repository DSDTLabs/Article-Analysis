Chennai: A Class XII student stabbed his classmate over a past enmity on Friday afternoon inside their school campus in Kovoor.

 The stabber who made a hacksaw blade into a knife threw the weapon after the incident and fled the spot. He was caught in the evening.
 
 Police said, S Sheik Sameeruddin, of Pattur is Class XII student at a government school at Kovoor. His father runs a grocery shop.
 
 On Friday, after his computer science exam got over he was talking to his friends near the school gate. His classmate Raghavan (name changed) of Thandalam asked him to come aside for a talk. As he came a few meters away from his friends, Raghavan pulled out the knife from his bag and stabbed him. The victim who was bleeding from his stomach, swooned near the gate. “The hacksaw blade broke while Raghavan stabbed. He left it and run away,” said an investigating officer.
 
 Sheik’s parents who had come to pick him up from school rushed him to the Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital where doctors said his condition was stable. 
 
 Based on a complaint from Sheik’s parents, The Kunrathur police registered an attempt to murder case and caught Raghavan. Interrogations revealed that the duo had separate gangs and were frequently fighting about establishing their supremacy in the area. They both picked up fights whenever anyone of them went to play cricket in their area. They attacked each other on several occasions, whenever the other gang entered the rival’s area, but sorted out the issue among themselves and never complained to the police.
 
 Raghavan has told the police that he was planning to eliminate him for long. He wouldn’t have been able to appear for his examination if he had done it before and decided to choose the last day.
 
 Police said he had hid the blade inside his bag and left it outside the examination hall. Police have sent the juvenile to a government observation home.
