GURUGRAM: Having watched the road to their school grow more squalid by the week and yet elicit no response from the  , a group of students decided to wear the civic gloves themselves. Armed with brooms and buckets, they cleaned up the road in Sector 57 on Sunday that connects their society, Nirvana Country, with their school.

 The students said every morning, stink and dirt greeted them on their way to school and they decided they would have to clean up the road themselves because civic officials did not seem interested. So they got to work around 9am, and accomplished their objective by 1 in the afternoon. “We had been planning this for a long time. Finally, we decided instead of waiting for the authorities to act, we will clean the road ourselves,” said Elina Singh, a Class VIII student at Lotus Valley International School in Sector 57.
 
 The students, right from Class II to Class IX, made small groups and reached out to people living in the neighbourhood for support. “We asked our friends and families to join us and put up posters across our society to inform people about our initiative,” said Shivali Mishra, another Class VIII student.
 
 The students’ enthusiasm spread like a contagion and many parents stepped out to help them. A local café also came forward to support the cause and helped purchase gloves, masks and brooms. 
 
 After cleaning the stretch, students handed over garbage-filled bags to MCG sanitation workers for disposal. “We requested MCG to put in place bins along the stretch so that people don’t litter the road,” said Alania Rara, a Class VIII student. The students now plan to put posters along the road to create awareness.
