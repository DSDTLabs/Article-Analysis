Actor   has refuted reports suggesting that he shares cold vibes with his 'Rangoon' co-star  , saying he would happily promote the movie with her, contrary to the speculations. 

 Much before the official trailer of 'Rangoon' released, there were rumors that Shahid and Kangana, who worked with together for the first time in the movie, didn't get along, to an extent that the 'Haider' actor even refused to promote the film with her. 
 
  
  
 However, clarifying the rumors, Shahid said, "There are no issues between me and Kangana. I also read a report that we might not promote the film together. (But) there is no problem. I will promote the film whenever, wherever happily with Kangana and Saif (Ali Khan), who is also a very big part of the film." 
 
 The actor was speaking at the red carpet of the 'xXx: Return of Xander Cage' last night. 'Rangoon' marks the 35-year-old actor's third collaboration with filmmaker   and that makes the film extra special for Shahid. 'Rangoon' is out on February 24. It is my third film with Vishal Bhardwaj. A large part of who I am as an actor is defined by him. So, all his movies are always special. 'Rangoon' is very different from 'Haider' and 'Kaminey'.
 
 "It's an original film. So, I am looking forward to it. Also, this is my first collaboration with   (producer), Saif and Kangana," the actor said. The romantic drama, set against the backdrop of World War II, features Shahid as a soldier, Kangana in the role of an action diva, and Saif as her mentor.
