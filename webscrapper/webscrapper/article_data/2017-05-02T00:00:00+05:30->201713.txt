A writer and theatre personality,  , in his debut film, is giving Kannada audiences something that has become a rarity off late — a film that talks about upholding family values.   is based on a novel that Yogesh wrote 20 years ago, which was later staged as a play. Many people who watched the play went back home to their parents, regretting the conflicts that they had at home, which inspired Yogesh to make it into a film to reach a larger audience. 

 “Filmmakers like  ,   and   are my inspirations — they made family dramas about upholding family values and stressed that there shouldn’t be any egos in relationships. And I believe that as well. We have to make our relationships strong on the basis of love, and only once you achieve that at home can you extend it to the society at large. So, my film is about ghar vapsi in the real sense; it’s about the need to reunite with the family, establish love in relationships and overcome egos,” says Yogesh. 
 
 But it was not easy for him to find someone to invest in his film. “Thanks to the current trend in films, people who heard the story and about my style of making thought that it was an outdated concept. But, in my view, family values can never be outdated. Makers these days want to appeal to collegegoers and the corporate audiences. I condemn people who exaggerate violence and lust. What is the point in studying the life of a goonda who has not contributed to the society and family values? Different experiments must be done in movies to trigger pleasant feelings and positive thinking, and that’s the intention behind Marali Mannige,” Yogesh says, signing off.
