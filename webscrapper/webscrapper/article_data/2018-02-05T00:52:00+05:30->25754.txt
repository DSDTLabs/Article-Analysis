Tirupur: The city police have busted a gambling racket functioning out of a leisure club at Nallur here with the arrest of as many as 30 people and seizure of Rs 2.52 lakh in cash.

 The club has been sealed and 10 cops attached to the rural police station at Nallur were transferred for their failure to take action against the gamblers, despite receiving several tips about the illegal activity going on at the leisure club for several months.
 
 “We conducted raids at the club and found many playing cards for money. We arrested 18 gamblers and 12 others comprising club owner and its staff. We also seized Rs 2.52 lakh and playing cards from the spot,” a senior police official said.
 
 Following this, rural police station inspector Dhanasekaran and 9 others were transferred to other police limits within the city, citing dereliction of duty. “Disciplinary action was taken against them not only because of their failure to take action against the gamblers, but also based on corruption allegations against them,” said a source privy to the development.
 
 In another development, two senior police officials were issued memos based on complaints against them for turning a blind eye to illegal activities such as gambling and banned lottery and illegal liquor sales in Avinashi and Dharapuram areas.
 
 At the opposition parties’ meeting in Avinashi, party functionaries had unanimously condemned the police for ‘allowing’ illegal activities there.
 
 When TOI contacted, a senior police official said, “Memos are generally issued to the officials if they didn’t do their works properly. In this case, no individual was targeted.”
