 Earlier, the posse of officials inspected   in JP Nagar and Talaghattapura Lake off  . While parts of the latter have turned into a dumping ground, fresh encroachments can be seen around Sarakki Lake, sources said. In mid-2015, authorities carried out a massive drive to remove encroachments from the lakebed. However, construction activity has resumed despite the drive as new buildings have allegedly come up in violation of norms. The inspecting team took note of the matter, sources added.
 
 The lake inspection commenced on Wednesday at   reservoir and Vrishabhavathi valley.
