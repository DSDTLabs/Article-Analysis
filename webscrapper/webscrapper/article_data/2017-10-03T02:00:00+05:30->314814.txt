 Lalu and his son and former deputy CM   Prasad Yadav have been accused in an FIR lodged by the central investigating agency of having benefitted from a contract to a private firm for the maintenance of two hotels of railways at Ranchi and Puri. Lalu was the railway minister from 2004 to 2009 when the alleged deal took place.
 
 The hotels, run by the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation, a subsidiary of the Indian Railways, were handed over to Sujata Hotels, a company owned by Vinay and Vijay Kochhar. The Kochars, in return, are alleged to have given a prime plot at Saguna Mor in Patna to Lalu’s family through a benami company.
 
 RJD’s   MP P C Gupta and his wife Sarla Gupta besides IRCTC’s then MD P K Goel also figure among the accused.
 
 Lalu and Tejashwi had earlier failed to appear before the CBI twice in August and September, citing their preoccupation with political enagagements. The CBI had on September 27 issued fresh summons, asking them to appear on October 3 and October 4 respectively.
 
 Sources close to Lalu’s family said Lalu and Tejashwi had sought 15 days’ time, but the CBI this time turned down their plea. “Lalu is already in Delhi and will appear before the CBI on Tuesday,” said an RJD source, adding based on the outcome of Lalu’s interrogation, Tejashwi would take a call on appearing before the CBI on Wednesday.
