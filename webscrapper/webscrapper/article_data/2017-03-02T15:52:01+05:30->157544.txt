A   (GU) professor’s   with a “friend” on   has set the gossip mills buzzing about the faculty’s alleged involvement in   with young girls. A snapshot of the conversation between the   in his fifties and his female friend in 30s is doing the rounds of the varsity. In the conversations that took place at different times, the faculty member on social media chat room not only asks the young woman to call him up but also asks her to share her “dil ni vat” (what is in her heart about him).

 He even informs her that he sleeps in another room because he doesn’t get along with his wife of many years and that he imagines the female friend being very beautiful. When contacted, the faculty member said that he is aware of this snapshot doing rounds of social media. “This is done with malicious intent. This is a month-old conversation and whoever did this with intention has also deactivated the account. The conversation made public is also presented in a way that puts me in negative light,” the faculty said.
 
 He said that he is also trying to find out the person who did this. This is not the first such incident at GU. In 2014, a faculty member Sarman Zala, the then political science department head, was also accused of writing lewd letters to three of his women colleagues. In 2015, GU dismissed Zala after filing a police complaint in the case. GU officials however said that they cannot take any action against the faculty member.
 
 “We have not received any complaint from any quarter against this faculty member. We will set up an enquiry if we get complaint and ensure fair enquiry. We can take action against him if he is found guilty. However, we can do all these if we get a written complaint. And so far, we have not received anything,” said in charge Vice Chancellor Himanshu Pandya who is also head of the   that probes cases of sexual harassment cases against women.
