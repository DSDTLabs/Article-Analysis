AHMEDABAD: An audio clip consisting of phone conversation between   Pushpa Mistry and a resident of Navapura over   went viral on   on Friday. 

 The conversation veers into an argument over why Mistry has been resisting fund allocation from her personal municipal councilor budget towards roads repairs, water and drainage issues in minority dominated Navapura area.
 
 Mistry is heard in the phone conversation asking the citizen which ward he belongs to and directs him to contact another councilor Jalpa Pandya of Azad chowk. “I won’t sanction my personal funds for your area, you better approach Jalpaben or go to the zonal AMC officer and get your work sanctioned under general budget. I have my own voters and area to care about,” said Mistry. When the caller said, “Madam even we have voted, can’t you hear us out?” Mistry immediately replied, “What community do you belong to?” When the caller said he was from the minority community in Navapura, Mistry said, “Did you vote, really? Look, I have no enough budget for your area, contact the local AMC official or Jalpaben.” Saying this, Mistry immediately disconnected the phone.
 
 When TOI contacted Mistry she said, “Yes, I won’t deny that the voice in the audio clip is mine.” She claimed that the caller had called her after 10:15 pm, on at least four occasions earlier. “How can I solve queries after 10 pm when no AMC official is around? I had asked him to contact another councilor Jalpaben who lives nearer to Navapura and seek her help. What has turned against me is that I asked him details of his community. But I was trying to explain to him to approach another councilor Jalpa Pandya,” she explained.
