BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh — that has over the years earned the dubious distinction of being the ‘rape capital’ of the country with high number of cases registered as per   data finds most of the complaints genuine. This is as per the MP Police data. Of the 5,310   registered in 2017 police filed expunged report 162 cases, the report says. An expunged report is filed when a complaint is found to be false. In such cases, the complainant can be booked, police officials said.

 The number of expunged reports has increased over the years, but the number is still small when compared to total number of rape cases registered. In 2016, expunged report was filed in 31 out of total 4,882 cases, while in 2015 barely 36 cases were found to be false against a total of 4,391 rape cases registered in the state.
 
 The   report would be released after a few months, but the figures compiled by the MP police for the year 2017 conjure up a grim picture. According to the data, at least 15 women were raped daily somewhere in the state in 2017. This increases the average number of rape cases in MP from 13 last year to 15 in 2017. In 2016, MP registered a total of 4,882 cases of rape, while in 2015, the total number rape cases in MP was 4,391 — a steady rise.
 
 Over the high number of rape cases in the state, the government has always come out with the argument that registration is more in MP compared to other states. All complaints are registered and probed.
