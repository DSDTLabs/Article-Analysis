PUNE: Miscreants with a clear understanding about the   (ATMs) stole Rs 7.88 lakh from three   of a bank in  .

 The incident occurred on June 14, but came to light only on Saturday after the bank failed to tally the cash they had put in these ATMs. Thereafter, bank staffers checked the CCTV camera footage of the kiosks. The footage showed two unidentified men withdrawing large amount of cash from these ATMs on June 14.
 
 Sachin Kalge (30) of Thergaon, an official of the bank, has lodged a complaint with the Sangvi police, following which the suspects were booked for stealing the cash from the ATMs.
 
 Police said such offences have taken place in the past at different ATM kiosks of Thane city and the district.
 
 Sub inspector Sambhaji Patil of the Sangvi police told TOI that police have retrieved footage of the crime from one of the ATM kiosks.
 
 “The footage shows one of the suspects inserting his card into the ATM machine. Subsequently, he pressed a combination of some keys on the keypad of the machine. He then plugged a key (suspected to be a duplicate one) in the key socket of the machine hood and opened the hood. After opening the hood, the suspect then pulled some key of the machine, following which cash started flowing out of the cash vending section of the machine,” he said.
 
 After this, the man put the hood of the machine at its place and locked it with the help of duplicate keys.
 
 Patil said cash was not debited from anyone’s account. “Neither did it get debited from the bank’s account. The study of the bank has revealed that the suspects might have tampered with the ATM machines. The theft took place on June 14 from 1am to 5am,” Patil said.
