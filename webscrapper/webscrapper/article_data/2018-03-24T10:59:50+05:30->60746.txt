HYDERABAD: In what could be a huge haul in recent times in the city,   seized 780 kilos of ganja worth Rs 93 lakh concealed in a secret chamber in a lorry at Abdullapurmet, on the outskirts of the city, on Friday. Two peddlers were arrested and cases were registered against five persons, including lorry owner.

 Excise Sleuths said the inter-state gang was planning to sell the ganja in Maharashtra and Goa. Acting on a tip-off, the enforcement wing of the excise department led by assistant superintendent   intercepted the lorry (registration No AP 28 U 5706) at an Indian Oil petrol outlet, near  .
 
 “The container and cabin were empty and driver and his associate seated in the cabin feigned ignorance of transporting any contraband. When our sleuths inspected the vehicle closely, they stumbled upon a secret chamber behind the driver’s seat. A specially-made cavity (hole) next to the fuel tank was found and 780 kilos of ganja stored in the secret compartments was recovered,” enforcement director Akun Sabharwal said.
 
 While 420 kilos of contraband was recovered from the secret chamber behind the driver’s seat, the rest 360 kg was seized from the compartment beneath the lorry’s fuel tank. Driver K Bichappa of   village in Zaheerabad and J Santosh of   thanda in Sangreddy district were taken into custody. The duo confessed to the sleuths that they procured the contraband from one Chanti at Tuni in   district upon instructions from the main accused, Hari Man Rathod, who hails from Gayaram thanda.
 
 Based on their confession, the sleuths booked cases against Rathod, Chanti and lorry owner Mohammed Nizam under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. The sleuths also said that Rathod had made plans to sell the contraband in various cities of Maharashtra and Goa and earn huge profits.
 
 Bichappa and Santosh will be produced before the court, while a manhunt has been launched for the other accused.
