NASHIK: Over 1,800   drivers have received stickers from the city   for carrying valied documents and papers over the past week.

 This is part of a special drive by the traffic   to examine the documents of autorickshaws. There are a sizeable number of autorickshaws that are unfit to ply on the roads and operate despite having valid documents. 
 
 A large number of rickshaw drivers who do not have documents of their vehicles indulge in criminal activities such as behaving rudely and robbing passengers and carrying them on front seats. 
 
 Many rickshaw drivers and their union leaders said the operators with valid documents never indulged in such activities, as they would never want the police or the   (RTO) to seize those. 
 
 On the other hand, autorickshaw drivers are bringing their vehicle documents and getting them checked by the traffic police as part of an ongoing drive. Assistant commissioner of police   said the vehicles unfit for plying and are not registered with the RTO would be seized and damaged for good.
