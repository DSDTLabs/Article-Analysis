BHOPAL: On the third day of cultural fiesta Lokrang, being organised at BHEL Dussehra ground, a six-member band ‘Cuba’ enthralled the audience, who, despite barriers, could not control themselves from moving around the stage to cheer the performers.

 There were performers from Bundelkhand, Mizoram, Odisha, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh who left onlookers enchanted amid the rustic ambience created by the state cultural department to give a feeling of homeland.
 
 “This year, Lokrang is grander than it had been in the past. It is on a large scale and performers are taking us on a nostalgic ride with every step and beat courtesy their performances,” said Shahida Parveen, who had come to see and enjoy.
 
 “It was late and chilly but my children didn’t want to leave the ground at all,” said Paritosh Parikh who has come with a team from Gujarat.
 
 Folk dances — Thatya, Saila, Thapti, Doha, Baredi from Madhya Pradesh, Jing Bihu from Assam, Rambha from Assam, Tipani from Gujarat, Chadya from Odisha and Muram from Kerala — were on show, on Saturday night.
 
 More sparkle is on the cards from Sunday. The day would start with ‘bamboo’ symphony, directed by Unnikrishna Pakkanar from Kerala. It is performed with musical instruments created out of bamboo.
 
 Loud Street Percussions Band from Russia and Belle dance by Ukrainian participants would also captivate the spectators.
 
 ‘Mandap’ created out of bamboo and its products, is a big draw. Around 50 bamboo artistes from Nagaland, West Bengal, Assam, Tripura, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala had been working for past one month to display bamboo artefacts.
