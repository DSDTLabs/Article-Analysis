Bengaluru: While the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) approved a Rs 5 crore incentive to Team Indus, a private aerospace startup, the move comes with a rider. The team will first have to write to the BBMP, outlining details of the project, and only then will the money be raised.

 “They will first have to write to us, and then we’ll raise the money” said mayor Sampath Raj.
 
 Team Indus was one of the five teams which qualified for the final leg of the Google Lunar XPRIZE competition, which was called off earlier this month. The competition would have been won by the first privately funded team to place a spacecraft on the Moon surface, travel 500 metres and transmit high-definition video and images back to Earth.
 
 “Very few teams were selected from across the world, and we are very proud that Team Indus, the only team from India, is based in Bengaluru. They have been facing a funds crunch, and it is our honour to support them,” he said. 
 
 According to him, the funds will be taken from the Palike’s research fund which has remained relatively untouched.
 
 Seer’s birthday 
 
 The Palike has also allotted Rs 1 crore to celebrate the birthday of Shivakumara Swami, Siddaganga mutt seer.
 
 "We’ll have zonal celebrations in each of the eight zones as this will be his 111th birthday. Since he is like a living God, many corporators even said they’re willing to give up one month’s salary for this celebration,” he added. The resolutions were approved during the monthly council meeting held on Tuesday.
