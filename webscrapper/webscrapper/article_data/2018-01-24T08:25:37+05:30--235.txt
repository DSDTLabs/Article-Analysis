CHANDIGARH:   chief minister   has written to the Union ministry of defence to set up a light combat vehicles (LCVs) manufacturing unit in Punjab, with the assurance that his government would extend all support, including land allocation, for such a project.

 In a letter to Union defence minister Nirmala  , Amarinder has stated that an LCVs unit would not only go a long way in promoting the establishment of ancillary units but also help provide jobs to the unemployed youth in the state. Further, the proposed project would help make LCVs readily available to the forces on the border, he said.
 
 The Cm drew Sitharaman’s attention to the ‘Industrial and Business Development Policy 2017’ recently launched by the Punjab government with many incentives for the industry. The policy, he said, was a holistic framework for the sustainable industrial growth of the State and was a part of the vision to put the state back on high trajectory of growth and prosperity.
