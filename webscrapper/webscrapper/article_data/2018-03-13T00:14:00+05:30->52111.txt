Pune: Keshavlal Mulchand Wagheri, 81, ignores his aching joints as he carries his harmonium in search of an audience for his art. A veteran musician, who had worked with illustrious Bollywood music directors of the past, Keshavlal is forced to sing for his livelihood today. But he never begs. “My joints ache if I move around too much. But I have to feed myself and my wife. So I go out with my harmonium to places like courts and railway stations and sing. I do not beg. I am an artist. If the people feel like giving money, they do,” he says. TOI had last met Keshavlal in 2015. At that time, he was invited to shows — to play the harmonium for the Bollywood classics he was once a part of, including the song Man Dole from Naagin (1954). Today, the flowing white beard can barely hide the years of struggle. “I met V Shantaram in Andheri after I moved to Mumbai from Chennai, in the late 1940s. He asked me to be a part of his film company. But I did not like living in Mumbai, and I was young and immature. I rejected the offer,” he recalls. Keshavlal moved to Pune shortly after, and his life has been a struggle since. He is thankful for the tiny two-room flat that he shares with his wife Sonibai, off the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass, that some benefactors had secured for him as part of a slum rehabilitation project. “Before that, my wife and I lived on the pavement for 25 years,” he says. But his deteriorating health is taking a toll. There is no elevator from his fourth-floor apartment and that has reduced the number of shows he can go to. The last big show he went to was in Dehradun, in October 2017. Also, due to deaths and strained ties, for Keshavlal, Sonibai is the only family left in the city. His married daughters live in Mumbai and sometimes visit him, as does a widowed daughter-in-law. “We do not have any relations with two of our sons. They are both drunks,” Sonibai says.
