HYDERABAD: Traffic in Hyderabad is literally crawling, but peeved motorists are being swift in sending feedback to the traffic police on congested areas. Their website is being deluged with grievances, suggestions and demands.

 From the responses that came in, one thing is clear: there is traffic congestion in practically every part of the city and citizens are wondering why they have to put up with it when solutions can be worked out. Exasperated motorists are also complaining that though they notified problems earlier, they were left unattended.
 
 On its Facebook page, the   (HTP) asked a question on January 10. “During your journey, which way did you feel congested and why?” they asked, explaining how the responses would help the cops solve the problems.
 
 Since then, hundreds of complaints have been pouring in. Surprisingly, the traffic police chose not to respond individually to any of the cases, making some motorists feel hopeless. “Nenu mastu sarlu pettina miru asslu reply ivvaru bye gdn8 (I have complained many times, but you do not give a reply. Bye goodnight)” said  , whose post did not evoke any response.
 
 A cursory analysis of the problems reveal that the major problems are bad roads, improper signaling, parking of autos and   buses, cars parked on the roads and unscientific traffic management. The problem areas include Ameerpet, Filmnagar, LB Nagar, Malakpet, Sangeet crossroads, Chutney’s at Nagarjuna circle, Musheerabad crossroads, RTC crossroads, Shanker Mutt, Koti, KBR Park, Khairatabad, AS Rao Nagar, Masab Tank, Begumpet, Hafeezpet, Tivoli, Bodduppal, Lakdikapul, Narayanaguda and  .
 
 “Oka sari enngg colleges daggara chudu ana telustadi (Take a look at the scene near engineering colleges, you will get to know the problem),” said one Radhakrishna.
