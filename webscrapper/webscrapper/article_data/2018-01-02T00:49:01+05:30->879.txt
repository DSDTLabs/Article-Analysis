Vellore: A 200-years-old panchaloha idol of Lord Vishnu that was found abandoned under a tree along Madhanur-Odugathur Road at Valayalkarapatti village was recovered by the police and revenue officials on Monday.

 Ambur Tahsildar Meeraben Gandhi said they received information from villagers of Valayalkarapatti in Thirumalaikuppam panchayat that they found the abandoned idol of Vishnu. The villagers also alerted Vellore district collector S A Raman and police department personnel.
 
 On receiving the alert, police personnel attached to the Ambur Sub-division went to the spot and recovered the 2.5 ft tall idol and handed it over to the tahsildar. “We have informed the Inspector General of Idol Wing (A G Pon Manickavel),” she added.
 
 According to Curator of Government Vellore Museum K Saravanan, the idol appeared to be less than 200 years old. The idol of Vishnu has four hands in a standing posture, seen holding Sangu (conch) and chakram, said the curator.
 
 Sources in the police department said they were questioning the locals to find out, if any person was found wandering in the vicinity in a suspicious manner. It may be recalled that sleuths attached to the Idol Wing arrested two persons, Thirulogachandar and Anbu of Kallpadi village near Latheri, and confiscated three panchaloha idols worth around Rs 4 crore n the second week of November.
 
 The police team is looking for the associates of the duo. On September 29, the special wing, acting on a tip-off, arrested seven persons, including an ex-serviceman, in Tiruvannamalai and seized several crores of rupees worth emerald Nataraja idol and five more idols dating back to the Chola period.
