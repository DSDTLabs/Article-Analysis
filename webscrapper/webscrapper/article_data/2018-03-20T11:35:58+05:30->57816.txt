CHENNAI: The city police on Monday said they had arrested two software engineers for calling the police control room and making bomb threats to   on Sunday night.

 The threats proved to be hoaxes and, when policemen tracked down the culprits to a house in Pallikaranai, they found them partying, reeking of liquor and completely plastered.
 
 All   Anand, 29, of Koppampatti village in Thuraiyur, Trichy, and K Sakthi Saravanan, 28, both of whom came to the city to find work in IT firms, could do once the police busted them late on Sunday night was to try to escape punitive action by blaming each other, a senior officer said.
 
 The two men are now sobering up in jail after a court remanded them in judicial custody. “Deepu, a software engineer, quit his job and started working as a librarian in his hometown while he waited for an opening,” the officer said. “He asked his friend Saravanan to help him get a job, but Saravanan demanded Rs 25,000 for the favour, claiming that he would have to bribe people to employ Deepu.”
 
 Even two weeks after Deepu paid Saravanan Rs 25,000, however, there was no sign of an opening for the unemployed techie. Deepu found, after a while, that it was increasingly difficult to contact Saravanan. He finally arrived in Chennai and took a house in   on rent.
 
 “Deepu and Saravanan met in the house of an acquaintance around 9pm on Sunday and started to have a drink,” the officer said. “Deepu demanded that Saravanan return his money and a fight broke out.”
 
 “Deepu suddenly snatched Saravanan’s cellphone and called up the police control room, stating that Saravanan was planning set off an explosion at the city airport,” he said. “Saravanan grabbed the phone back from Deepu and made the same allegation against him.”
 
 Officers at the police control room realised that the men were drunk. They tracked them down nonetheless and booked them under various sections of the IPC and the IT Act.
