KOLKATA: With the streets lined with red lanterns and chimes tinkling every where, devotees made a beeline for the Chinese churches to usher in the Chinese New Year on Thursday midnight. At the crack of the dawn, the entire   in central Kolkata reverberated with the beats of drums even as young boys and girls, decked in their festive finery, went knocking on the doors to collect their gifts in red envelopes. 

 "The New Year is the most important festival on the Chinese calendar. Families paint their homes in red, buy new clothes and gifts and make delicacies. New Year is an occasion to meet families and friends and celebrate together," said Li Han Kuang, secretary of Toong On Church on Black Burn Lane near Poddar Court. "Glittering fireworks exploded at midnight, lighting up the dark sky. It is a tradition that families visit the church together on this day," said   (62) from the area. 
 
 India's oldest China Town near Tiretta Bazar came alive with radiant colours on Thursday evening as churches were lit up and even non-descript eateries ladled out special dumplings to revellers. "People come from all over the city to watch the celebrations. They want to taste the local Chinese food," said   of   eating house. 
 
 Each Chinese New Year is characterised by one of the 12 animals on Chinese zodiac. This is the year of dog.
 
 Kolkata was home to more than 50,000 Chinese in the '60s and '70s. Migration to other countries for jobs and education has brought down the number to less than 5,000. To keep their traditions alive, the community now looks to the non-Chinese. "For Lion dance, we now have locals boys grooving to the beats, some of them even better than the Chinese," said Dominic Lee, a businessman.
