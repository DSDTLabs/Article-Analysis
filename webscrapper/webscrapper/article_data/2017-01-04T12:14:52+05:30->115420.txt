PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation’s decision of going ahead with concreting a stretch of road on a private land in Vimannagar has backfired with the land owner dragging the civic body to court for failing to take his permission before starting the work. 

 What used to be an evenly-metalled and busy stretch of road has now turned into a mess of concrete, debris, and domestic refuse, all because of the PMC’s unplanned concreting drive.
 
 The stretch, barely 500 metres, lies between the CCD intersection and the  , and leads up to  .
 
 The internal road is busy all the day and is lined with shops and establishments. Buses of PMPML use the stretch to reach the  .
 
 Local residents said the civic body went ahead with concreting work even though it was a private road and was in good condition. The civic body went ahead with the concreting, saying that it will provide a better drive quality and will not be affected by rains and other elements.
 
 However, just after the concreting work was started the PMC landed in a legal muddle after the owner moved court demanding compensation from the civic body.
 
 “The PMC had not sought permission from the land owner before starting the work. As a result, he has approached court to seek financial compensation,” a source said.
 
 Till date, concreting of the stretch remains half-done. A part of the road which has been dug up is barely usable. Debris and stones are dangerously spread on the road leading to minor accidents.
 
 An official at Ahmednagar Road ward office said: “We are aware that people are being inconvenienced. But unless the court case is settled, our hands are tied.”
