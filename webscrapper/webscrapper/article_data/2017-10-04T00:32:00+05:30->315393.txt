Tirupur: The culture of intolerance prevailing in the country has forced the people, who have belief in secularism, to protect religious harmony even if the country has numerous issues that need to be looked into, Tamil Nadu Congress committee leader Peter Alphonse said here on Tuesday.

 He was speaking at a   on social harmony organised by opposition parties including DMK, Congress, VCK, MDMK, CPM and  . Representatives of the parties claimed that the city, which hosts people from various States, is facing a serious threat from BJP and other saffron outfits, which are allegedly trying to create tension. “For political parties, it is not easy to describe difference between religious madness and religious-based politics. It is a wonder that while Chithirai-cum-Kallazhagar festival in Madurai is being conducted peacefully with participation of about 15 lakh people, the same is not the case with Vinayagar Chathurthi festival,” Alphonse said.
 
 “Defeating a political party in a rational way is democracy. But, BJP’s strategises to destroy opposition parties. It proves that the party does not believe in democracy,” said Suba Veerapandian of DMK. “It is important that all those parties that believe in secularism should weave an alliance for the upcoming elections,” he added.
 
 “The country’s culture and practices would differ from one place to other. But, many of the saffron party’s policies have become a threat to them,” said K Subbarayan, former CPI MP.
