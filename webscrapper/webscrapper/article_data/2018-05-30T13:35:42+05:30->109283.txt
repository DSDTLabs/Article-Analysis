PUNE: The state government’s urban development department has directed all local bodies and planning authorities to publish a list of all authorised and unauthorised constructions on its website by July end.

 Joint secretary, urban development department,   told TOI that all local authorities in the city and rural areas should implement the directive in the next two months. “They should put up a list on their website so that a common citizen can know about the authorised and unauthorised constructions. A designated officer from the local authority should take the lead and upload the details,’’ said Gokhale.
 
 
  
 
 As per the order, the local authority should upload survey numbers and names of the builders on the website. If there are any unauthorised constructions and litigations, their details should also be uploaded. 
 
 While the updation has to be carried out by the local authorities, the same file has to be shared with the property registration department so that details about the constructions are reflected in the system, added Gokhale.
 
 He said that property registration department officials should be aware of constructions that are authorised or unauthorised. It is the duty of the property registration department not to register properties that are unauthorised. 
 
 The developers’ body said the order will weed out fly-by-night operators who have mushroomed in the fringe areas. CREDAI   president   said that the list will benefit citizens who have invested their hard-earned money in various projects.
