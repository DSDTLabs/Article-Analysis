PANAJI:  , excessive   summed up the experience for Goa’s industries under the   (BJP) state government. 

 In a document released by the Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI), the state’s industries said that they expected uninterrupted power supply, rationalised tariffs, efficient public transport and traffic management from the next government.
 
 Pointing out that Goa’s rank on the ease of doing business scale fell from 18 in 2015 to 21 in 2016, GCCI said that Goa was lagging in transparent access to information and an online single-window systems for approvals and clearances.
 
 “When we invited suggestions for inputs from our members, an overwhelming number of members complained about politician-bureaucracy nexus and corruption,” GCCI director general Ramakant Kamat said.
 
 Given the pathetic public transport system and the location of most of Goa’s industrial estates, GCCI urged the next government to improve the mass public transport system. “Build a metro railway connecting business and commercial centres in the state,” GCCI said.
 
 The industries body also batted in favour of double line broad gauge rail link. 
 
 Kamat expressed alarm over the declining agriculture output in the state, pointing out that “at the time of liberation agriculture contributed roughly about 70%, today its share has declined to just about 6%.”
 
 CCI urged the government to bring in stringent provisions for enforcement or forfeiture of tenancy rights if tenanted land is not cultivated.
