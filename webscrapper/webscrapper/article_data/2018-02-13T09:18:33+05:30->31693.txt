JAIPUR: The Budget is a disappointment for the tourism sector that apparently is the mainstay of Rajasthan.

 Expectations of the tourism stakeholders did not see fruition in the last budget of chief minister   government. While the sector has been given industry status long back, no budget so far has passed on any benefits to tourism of an industry.
 
 Industry stakeholders had expected at least some benefits to the sector that is an industry in terms of the state providing electricity and land to the hospitality industry on industrial rate. But despite meetings none of this caught the budgets attention.
 
 However, for a change, a district that was lesser frequented by tourists, Banswara has got Rs 10 crore budget to develop 100 islands in the   area which would be a new attraction in Rajasthan. Besides, Rs 20 crore would be spent on developing Amber Fort as an iconic tourism destination.
 
 Besides for the religious sector, Rs 10 crore have been allocated for works at Vijaya Mata Mandir, Dungarpur, Lohagarl in Jhunjhunu, Murli Manohar Mandir and Raghunath Mandir in Ratangarh, Churu.
 
 Another Rs 10 crore have been allocated to develop six more panoramas of saints and local deities in Alwar, Bhilwara, Rajsamand, Sikar and Ajmer.
