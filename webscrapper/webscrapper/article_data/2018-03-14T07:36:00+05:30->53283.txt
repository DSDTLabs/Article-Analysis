CHANDIGARH: Punjab finance minister   Singh Badal’s remark that barring a few of IAS officers most do not have good command over English remained the topic point in the bureaucracy on Tuesday. Even   openly took exception to the minister’s views.

 Former chief secretary, Punjab, Rajan Kashyap, who has a master’s degree in English, said, “Officers in the Punjab government are well versed in both English and Punjabi and I do not agree with this observation.”
 
 “There has been a shift in trend with many IAS officers now coming from different streams like medicine and engineering and are good at many other things. The older lot from humanities may have been more proficient in using the language, but then English is not the only thing,” added another former IAS officer  .
 
 Author and former IAS officer   added, “Although the minister is entitled to his views, I have found that officers’ English is usually impeccable. However, there could be instances where they are careless, especially when a note or letter has been drafted by someone else and they are only approving it.”
 
 Manpreet’s remarks kept the WhatsApp groups of bureaucrats in the state alive but no serving officer was willing to talk on record.
