 India   captain   will be among those who will lustily cheer   as they attempt to defeat defending champions ATK for the first time in four years at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Wednesday.
 
  FC Goa need to win both their remaining matches to qualify for the semifinals of the Indian Super League and ATK, always Goaâ€™s nemesis, stand in between. Goa will play Jamshedpur FC in the concluding league clash in Jamshedpur on Sunday.
  
  Virat, FC Goa co-owner since inception in 2014, will arrive in Goa on Wednesday and drive straight to Fatorda. At the stadium, Virat will first unveil the new FC Goa jersey as a show of support for the launch of the Forca Goa Foundation and then take his seat in the VIP gallery to cheer the Goan franchise.
  
  This will be the first match that Virat will be attending since Goa dramatically lost the   final 2-3 against Chennaiyin FC in 2015.
  
  Virat co-owns FC Goa along with Jaydev Mody, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, Venugopal Dhoot, Ashish Kapadia and Akshay Tandon.
