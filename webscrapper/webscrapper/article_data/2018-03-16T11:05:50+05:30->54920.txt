TRICHY: There has been steep fluctuations in the price of jasmine flower over the past couple of months in the city. The cycle has been such that while the rates are low in a particular week, it doubles or even triples the next week .

 Jasmine which was sold only for around Rs 50 per kg till Wednesday registered a steep rise on Thursday as it was sold for approximately Rs 150 per kg. The recent rains and erratic jasmine supply over the course in the last few weeks are the main reasons for the unexpected price fluctuations, according to flower traders and sellers.
 
 “In the last two months, the jasmine supply has been very unpredictable. The supply was really good last week, but the farmers told us that the harvest was affected due to the recent rains,” said E  , proprietor of EAS flower shop at  .
 
 When queried if the price change had any impact due to the ‘Poochorithal’ festival at Samayapuram temple or due to high or low demand, Saibu said, “Mostly, the price is not determined by demand. It is purely based on the supply.”
 
 Jasmine supply to the city is mostly in and around Trichy district. 
 
 According to another flower shop owner   at Gandhi Market, the price of jasmine will be the same over the next few weeks before falling drastically again mid next month.
