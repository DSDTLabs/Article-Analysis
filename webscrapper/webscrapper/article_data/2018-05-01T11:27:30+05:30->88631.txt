 Women including Kavita Singh, Archana Sharma, Rita Singh and Usha Singh from C block of the sector collectively raised issues of security, encroachment, unauthorised parking by buses, no street lights and drunk brawls by anti social elements in the sector. "We are facing immense problems of unattended garbage and unauthorised parking by buses and private cabs in front of gate no. 4 of C block of the sector. Also, there are many non-functional street lights in the sector which leave dark unsafe patches at night," said Kavita Singh.
 
 Usha Singh urged MLA Singh to address the issue of safety in the sector. "Anti-social elements roam around drunk during night time often engaging in fights and brawls amongst themselves or local residents. While thefts are common, we feel unsafe to step out of our homes after dark," she said.
 
 MLA Singh directed   officials to take immediate action on the complaints put forth by residents and maintained that "no laxity would be tolerated when it comes to security of women, children and senior citizens. We will ensure all basic civic facilities to residential sectors."
