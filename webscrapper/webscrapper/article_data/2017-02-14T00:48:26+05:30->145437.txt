 “Commercial establishments conducting their business from residential areas should brace for stringent action by  ,” said an official from the encroachment department. He added that there were numerous complaints against establishments like hotels and parlours, stated to be functioning from residential premises. “The civic chief has taken these complaints seriously and ordered a survey,” he added.
 
 Following the survey report from all the eight wards, a decision will be taken on the course of action.
 
 A report has already been filed by Vashi ward last week. “The list of commercial establishments functioning from residential areas has already been submitted. There are 102 such establishments in the node,” said an official from Vashi ward.
 
 Ward offices are now conducting surveys to ascertain exact number of such violations in their areas as well, said officials. Officials from the town planning department said that in absence of any provision for parking or any of the norms stipulated by MRTP Act, such activities are illegal.
 
 “Notices will be served to every establishment which has violated the provisions of MRTP Act. If developers were interested in conducting commercial activities, they should have taken permission but now every such activity is illegal in absence of any such permission,” said a senior official from the town planning department.
 
 These violations lead to issues such traffic congestion, according to officials. “In case of residential areas, parking provision is usually for one car per house but when a hotel comes up or even shops are set up, it leads to multiple parking. This is just one of the problems, therefore all such violations have to be removed,” informed the official. —Sameera Kapoor Munshi
