RANCHI: Union minister   on Friday said the Centre would promulgate an ordinance for reservation in promotion of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe government employees. He said the ordinance would be brought if the   did not provide relief to   employees.

 
 Talking to mediapersons, Paswan said a committee under home minister   had recently agreed that the government would file a review petition in the SC. 
 
 The review petition has not been filed yet.
 
 “The court had issued a three-point guideline for reservation in promotion and we believe there is no problem with these points. But still, if the final judgment goes against the interest of Dalits, we are not going to shy away from bringing an ordinance,” Paswan said.
