PATNA: The Bihar   appears to be waiting for party president Amit Shah’s visit to energize its cadres, especially after the disastrous shot at the government formation in Karnataka.

 On Sunday, BJP state headquarters wore a sombre look. “Our party president is expected here next month, but the schedule of his visit has not yet been fixed,” state BJP spokesman and former MLA Sanjay Singh Tiger said, adding Shah’s visit was deferred in the past due to several assembly elections, including in the northeast and the one recently held in Karnataka. 
 
 No one seemed to be in any mood to discuss the Karnataka fiasco even informally. Yet, for a morale booster, they had the consolation in the fact that the BJP had done pretty well in neighbouring West Bengal, as it ended second to the Trinamool   (TMC), leaving the CPM and the Left behind, and pushing the Congress to the poor fourth, in the just concluded panchayat elections.
 
 “I think, come 2019, we should win 22 of the 42 parliamentary seats in West Bengal!” said a state BJP functionary. However, the party’s central brass, as if aware of the despondency that might have set in the state’s rank and file, decided to rejuvenate the party in right earnest. 
 
 Accordingly, an express instruction was sent to the state BJP to celebrate achievements of PM   in the fourth year of his being at the helm of affairs of the country. “We will take the achievements of PM   and also of the second NDA government in the state to each village and every household in the state over a fortnight beginning May 26,” Tiger added.
