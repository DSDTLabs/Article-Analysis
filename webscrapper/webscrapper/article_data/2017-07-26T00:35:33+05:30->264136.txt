NEW DELHI: A property dealer who knocked down a juice   with his speeding   on Saturday was granted   on Tuesday. The victim was hit at the Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg and had died on the spot. 

 The accused, Rajeev Malhotra, was charged under IPC sections for causing death due to negligence and trying to destroy evidence. However, police said that they were looking for further legal options.
 
 A source said the Malhotra admitted that he was drunk and was returning from a party when he lost control of the vehicle and hit the man.
 
 Police said that a broken piece of a mudguard with a unique number had helped them zero down on Malhotra. Malhotraâ€™s relative, with whom he had left the car, had taken it to an authorised service centre for repair. The service centre had uploaded the details of the car on their system, which had the number on the bumper missing. This led the police to zero in on the vehicle. 
 
 Investigators said that the CCTV footage recovered from the spot showed the white vehicle but the model and vehicle details were not visible. Detail investigation about the car led the police to Malhotra who was detained from his house on Greater Kailash-I house on Monday.
