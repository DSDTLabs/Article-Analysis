Forest officers have been asked to call the officials of   (PGVCL) to the spot of the accident and take necessary legal action. This is besides the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. At present, those farm owners where lions die due to their electric fencing are arrested but let out on bail. 
 
 "Lions are seen frequently in many villages outside Gir sanctuary and they often die after coming in contact with live electric farm fencing. This has become a serious issue. Therefore, we have issued a circular and asked concerned forest officers to follow the guidelines to prevent death of lions due to electrocution,"  , principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) and chief wildlife warden, told TOI.
