HYDERABAD: Amid tight  , students of the   (UoH), on Monday, held a massive protest in front of the   building even as the academic council meeting was under way inside. Hundreds of students congregated at the venue to raise slogans against the administration’s complete failure to secure the internal areas of the campus — days after two cases of assault against two female students were reported from the university.

 Apart from raising their voice against the security gaps, the students also protested against the administration’s decision to slash the seat count for PhD and MPhil courses, increase the fee for applications, resorting to arbitrary suspension of students on various disciplinary grounds , among other academic issues.
 
 
  
 
 Led by representatives of UoH students’ union, Monday’s agitation attracted the participation of members from other student groups as well — the Students Federation of India, Ambedkar Students Association and Other Backward Class-Federation, to name a few. The administration’s move to beef up security, failed to deter them.
 
 According to students, apart from 60 on-campus security personnel, as many as 40 Rapid   personnel along with local policemen were deployed at the academic council meeting venue. “Heavy security deployed by the university makes it clear that several anti-student discussions were being held at the meeting. Whether it is seat cut or arbitrary suspensions, the administration’s attitude towards various issues has been biased,” said  , a research scholar.
 
 Female students repeatedly highlighted the security lapses on campus. “There is an imbalance in the number of male security personnel and female security personnel. Women on campus are not looked at disapprovingly if they are spotted with men. It’s about time that the administration strengthened the internal mechanism,” said  , a student.
