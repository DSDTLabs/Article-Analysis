CHANDIGARH: An   may just end up endorsing a Congress candidate in the upcoming  . The SAD MP from Ferozepur, Sher Singh Ghubaya, is expected to campaign for his son Davinder Singh if the Congress allots him a ticket for the Punjab assembly elections.

 The party is expected to announce Davinder’s candidature in its third and final list to be tentatively released on Tuesday. However, there is no clarity on the seat from where the party is going to field the IIT-Roorkee graduate. “Being my father, he will definitely campaign for me if I get the Congress ticket,” Davinder said, while talking to TOI on Monday.
 
 Though 25-year-old Davinder has insisted that he wants to contest from Fazilka, the party could also give him a ticket from Jalalabad, Guru Har Sahai, or Jagraon. The four constituencies have a sizeable population of Rai Sikhs, the community to which the Ghubaya family belongs to.
 
 A source added that family wanted the party to expel Ghubaya for “anti-party” activities, as he would continue to be a member of the Lok Sabha that way. “He has no plans to put in his papers. We are not much concerned about how SAD leadership looks at it,” Davinder said.
 
 Ghubaya had felt sidelined in the SAD, especially after he had vacated the Jalalabad seat in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections for party chief Sukhbir Badal, the source said.
 
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the SAD had fielded Ghubaya from Ferzepur and he had gone on to defeat Congress heavyweight Sunil Jakhar in the contest.
 
 On his keenness to contest from Firozpur City, Devinder said, “It is an assembly constituency that has always showered its affection on our family. I do not want to go to a new area like Jalalabad,” he said.
 
 Davinder was inducted into the party by   president Capt Amarinder Singh last month in Delhi. Apart from him, the names of some more former Akali leaders, including Pargat Singh, are likely to be announced in the last list.
