RAJKOT: A court in Amreli on Thursday granted six-day police remand of the main accused in the brutally murder of a young dalit sarpanch of Varsada village near Amreli.

 Jaysukh Madhad (25), who was recently elected as sarpanch on the reserved seat for scheduled caste, was hacked to death by upper caste members of the village over recently held panchayat polls. Madhad’s younger brother Arvind had lodged complaint accusing Deep Dhandhal, his brother Yuvi and Madhu Vala for his brother’s murder. Dhandhal was arrested on Wednesday and produced before court on Thursday.
 
 “We sought seven-day remand. However, court granted six-day. We are probing all angles. Primary probe suggest Madhad was murdered over animosity during panchayat polls. Dhandhal and his men supported  , a dalit, but he lost to Madhad. This became bone of contention between Madhad and Dhandhal.” Rajesh Parmar, deputy superintendent of police, investigating officer in the case, told TOI.
