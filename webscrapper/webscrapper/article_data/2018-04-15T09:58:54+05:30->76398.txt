PATNA:   on Saturday accused the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre of “moving menacingly towards achieving its goal of depriving SC/ST and other backward communities from the benefit of reservation”.

 Addressing a function to mark the 127th birth anniversary of Dr B R Ambedkar here, leader of opposition in state assembly   Prasad Yadav alleged that the Centre is working on an agenda to change the Constitution and end the reservation policy. “They want to snatch away the rights granted under the Constitution to the dalits and backwards,” Tejashwi said, adding RSS chief   and   functionaries were hell bent on ending reservation.
 
 Tejashwi said if elected to power, the   government would make study of ‘Annihilation of caste’, a book by Dr B R Ambedkar, compulsory at college level. “The April 2 Bharat bandh by dalit groups gave a strong message to the Centre,” Tejashwi said. He added it was his father   who gave honour, dignity and voice to dalits and people from other weaker sections of society.
