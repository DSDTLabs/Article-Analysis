AGRA: In relief to as many as 8500 BEd   holders, the high court-monitored special investigating team looking into the Ambedkar University “BEd scam” has decided not to challenge the qualification of candidates who appeared in the   and cleared it.

  In 2004-05, while there were 8500 BEd seats, the university had declared results of 12500 candidates. The SIT, which has been probing the matter since then, had earlier demanded that the result of all 12500 candidates be declared invalid. It had also approached the university administration in this regard.
 
  However, during the course of investigation, some new facts surfaced after which the probing team has now decided not to challenge the degrees awarded to 8500 candidates.
  
  Earlier, the SIT found that 4000 candidates who never appeared for a BEd exam were issued high scores by invigilators. Besides, admission in 1332 seats was taken under the management quota in violation of norms.
  
  According to sources, statements of 132 degree holders have been recorded so far. Out of these, around 100 people have been able to provide a documentary proof of them taking the main BEd exam for the 2004-05 session. They have shown admit cards, receipts of the fee submitted to the college, apart from other documents.
  
  “Only those candidates who got a degree without appearing for the exam will be made accused in the scam. Such candidates don’t have any records of their admission,” said an SIT official.
  
  Sources said that a list of 4000 fake degree holders has also been prepared. The SIT is now working on putting together a district-wise list which will be forwarded to the basic education department for action.
