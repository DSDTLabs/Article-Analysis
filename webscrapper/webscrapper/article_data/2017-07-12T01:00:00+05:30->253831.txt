Shruti Haasan, who was recently spending some ‘me’ time in the city, is quite excited about Akshara’s Tamil debut,  . With the big sis already having an experience of working with   in  , what does she have to say about Akshara’s film with Ajith? “Ajith sir is a wonderful person to work with. I am really happy that she is getting to work with him for her next Tamil film,” says Shruti. 

 Does she offer her career advice? “No, she is an independent girl. Besides, it is so boring to talk about work, right? We keep asking each other ‘what are we doing’ and then it gets boring. We have typical sibling conversations, too. We talk about nonsensical stuff like sharing funny videos of cats, kids and all that. Then she will show me pictures or videos of these guys dancing. So, our chats are absolutely normal,” she laughs.
