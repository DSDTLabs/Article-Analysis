Hyderabad: Nearly 50 students of the   protested outside the office of the chief warden on Monday afternoon demanding that the temporary shifting of students to new hostels be stalled. They also demanded the withdrawal of Rs 1,000 hostel rent, which is charged from residents for staying during the summer vacation, as it is a burden on poor students.

 “Most students stay back for academics. Forcibly shifting them from their hostels in the north campus to the new hostel in the south campus would make it difficult for them to access library and reading room, which are nearly 3.5 km away from the new hostel. The new hostel also does not have internet facility. Also, the students will have to shift back after the vacation, which means another round of inconvenience,” said Kuldeep Nagi, president of UoH students’ union.
 
 The students also condemned the Rs 1,000 hostel rent during vacation, which is much higher than the Rs 500 normal rent charged for the entire semester. They urged the warden to reduce the fee or at least exempt economically backward students from paying it.
 
 Following an hour-long protest, the chief warden agreed to the demand of not shifting the students except those in the I & L hostels, which will be converted to girls’s hostels.
