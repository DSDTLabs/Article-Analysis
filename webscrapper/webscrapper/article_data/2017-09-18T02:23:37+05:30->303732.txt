NEW DELHI:   in the city are getting organised by the day. Police have stumbled upon yet another group which was snatching phones, changing its unique IMEI numbers and disposing them off in local markets. 

 Apart from a 19-year-old snatcher, Gulshan Kalia, police have arrested the techie of the gang, Surender Fauji (40). 
 
 “The arrested men belong to Mangolpuri. Twenty-five android phones, three laptops and a desktop loaded with software have been seized from them. Four bikes used to commit crime have been recovered as well,” said DCP (outer) Pankaj Singh. 
 
 After the gang snatched phones, they used to take it to Fauji and get the IMEIs changed. This used to make the phones impossible to track. 
 
 The gang got busted after a team led by inspctor Sukhbir Malik received a tip-off about them being in industrial area of Mangolpuri to snatch phones. The cops laid a trap and the accused, Kalia, was arrested. He disclosed that he was into drugs and committed crimes to fund his lifestyle. 
 
 Fauji has told cops that he would change phone’s IMEI for 1/10th of the price (Rs 1000 for a 10000 Rs phone) which could then be sold at half the original price. Out of these 25 phones collected from the accused in the fresh lot, the IMEIs of 4 of them have been changed. 
 
  The accused used to connect the phone to the computer, run the programme, erase the existing IMEI and assign a new IMEI. The IMEIs of the stolen Apple phones is not easy to change and they are often dismantled and sold in parts.
 
  has recently decided to book snatchers under MCOCA. Cops are preparing a list of active snatchers who have been caught earlier but released on bail.
