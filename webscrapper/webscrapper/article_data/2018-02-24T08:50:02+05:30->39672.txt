COIMBATORE: Inter-state movement of vehicles was hit on the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border in the district on Friday as farmers from the neighbouring state blocked roads demanding release of water from the Aliyar dam. Scores of trucks carrying vegetables, poultry and dairy products were halted along the road on the   side of the border from early Friday morning.

  farmers have declared that they will continue the protest and block trucks indefinitely until water is released by Tamil Nadu under the Parambikulam Aliyar Project (PAP). The farmers took a decision during a meeting a day ago convened by   in  .
 
 Police said the farmers from Palakkad had started blocking vehicles from Tamil Nadu around midnight itself. A few trucks that had entered Kerala were stopped at Athikod and sent back. Anticipating untoward incidents, a large number of policemen were deployed along the border points. By morning, more than 500 trucks were piled up on the inter-state checkposts in Velanthavalam, Gopalapuram, Govindapuram and Meenakshipuram.
 
 Police said stones were also pelted at a few Tamil Nadu vehicles at Gopalapuram. They alerted passengers in vehicles bearing Tamil Nadu registration numbers about the unrest.
 
 The protesting farmers said that Kerala was entitled to 7.25 thousand million cubic feet of water under the PAP agreement every year. But, only 5.5tmcft water was released by Tamil Nadu, which severely affected cultivation, they claimed. The farmers demanded that the remaining 1.75tmcft water be released immediately.
 
 As news spread about the blockade, members of Dravidar Kazhagam and   gathered near the checkposts and staged a protest against Kerala. They then blocked Kerala registration vehicles at Meenakshipuram.
