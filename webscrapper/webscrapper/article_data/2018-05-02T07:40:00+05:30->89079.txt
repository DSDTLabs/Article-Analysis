Mohali: Two Nigeria nationals, including a former footballer, were caught with 500 grams of  , worth Rs 10 lakh, and Rs 25,000 at YPS Chowk here on Tuesday.

 A team of Mohali police’s special task force (STF) nabbed former footballer Saibu Malik and former businessman Chukubike, who goes by his first name, after a tip-off about two men of African descent smuggling drugs into Mohali. Superintendent of police (SP) Rajinder Singh Sohel, who heads the STF, said Saibu came to play football in India in 2012. “He told us he played for small clubs in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Chhattisgarh,” the SP said. Chukubike came to India on a business visa in 2015, but soon entered a life crime and started peddling drugs, the SP added. “Their visas expire some time ago,” the cop said.
 
 Chukubike and Malik live in Chander Vihar, New Delhi. “Saibu’s wife also lives here,” the SP said. “We got information about the accused moving from YPS Chowk to Kumbra Chowk; that is when we nabbed them,” he added.
 
 The SP said the accused had told them that they had procured the heroin from New Delhi and were going to supply it peddlers here. They have been booked under sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act at STF police station in Phase IV.
