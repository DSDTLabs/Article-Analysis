AURANGABAD: The civic body has proposed to revise (reduce) water charges applicable for   (MES) that supplies water to residents of cantonment area and Chhaoni. The MES is an enroute water consumer of the   ( ).

 In place of the existing Rs 33 per 1,000 liter, the AMC may now collect Rs 14.50 per 1,000 liter if the general body approves the proposal in the meeting to be held on February 18.
 
 Om Prakash Bakoria, municipal commissioner, said the proposal has been placed before the general body considering the demand of the bulk water consumer. “It is a government body. Thus, it should get water at subsidised rates,” he said.
 
 For the past four years, the MES has been demanding it. In the general body meeting, held in 2011, the AMC had decided to collect Rs 33 per 1,000 liter from bulk consumers and accordingly the new rates came into effect from April 1, 2012.
 
 But the MES authorities have been opposing the hike saying that they should get water at the rate of Rs 14.50 per 1,000 liter.
 
 It should be noted that as per the agreement signed between the AMC and bulk consumers, the municipal body is supposed to supply 4.5 MLD water in the area. But considering the severe water scarcity in the city, the civic body is supplying 60-100 MLD water.
 
 As per the notification of the Maharashtra Jiwan Pradikaran ( ) issued on July 17, 2015, water for bulk consumers catering to the needs of domestic category should be charged at the rate of Rs 14.50 per 1,000 liter. However, the civic body is still collecting the charges as per the old rates.
 
 The civic body, which is drawing water from Jayakwadi water dam, located at a distance of about 45 km is also supplying water to 23 other bulk consumers including some of the other local bodies.
