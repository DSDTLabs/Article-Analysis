AURANGABAD: The demonetisation move of the central government and the ban on   along state and national highways have directly affected the revenue collection of the sales and service tax departments in 2016-17.

 In financial year 2014-15, the Aurangabad district had contributed excise duty of Rs 3,245 crore through liquor production. In 2015-16, the amount increased to Rs 3665 crore. However, in the last financial year, till March 30, the excise department could collect only Rs 3,422 crore against a target of Rs 4,326 crores. The district has six beer factories, four foreign liquor units and a couple of country liquor manufacturing units.
 
 The region has 702 shops which sell country liquor, 103 wine shops which sell country as well as foreign liqour and 1,984 bars and permit rooms.
 
 State excise superintendent   said, “As per our estimates, we are set to fall Rs 500 cr to Rs 700 crore short of the target for 2016-17. Demonetisation, followed by the SC directives played a key role in bringing down our collection.” 
 
 The officer said that perhaps this is the first time in the past few years that the collection of the excise department has declined.
 
 The revenue of the excise department from licence renewal fees has also fell sharply, with the figures not even reaching 50% of the target. In 2015-16, the amount was Rs 22 crores, but with a majority of the licence holders not opting for renewal, the department has suffered a loss of Rs 15 crore. 
 
 Out of the 689 licences in the district, 506 licence holders have stopped serving liquor as they have their set-ups within 500m of the state or national highways.
 
 Similarly, the revenue collection of the sales tax department also took a serious toll.
 
 The sales tax department, which had collected Rs 496.69 crore from liquor dealers till February end, was worried with the decline in collection in March.
 
 A senior officer said that in spite of the collections made in March, the department is set to fall short of at least Rs 80 crore from the target of Rs 602 crore set for the year 2016-17.
 
 Sales tax joint commissioner   said, “As per the standard formula, the revenue collection has to be 16% higher than that achieved in the previous financial year. We collected sales tax of Rs 519.90 crore in 2015-16 and we should have achieved a target of Rs 603.084 crore in 2016-17. But, we are likely to collect only Rs 520 crore.
