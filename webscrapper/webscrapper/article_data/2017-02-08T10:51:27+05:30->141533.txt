JAIPUR: A recent study by the   (SCRB) states that 7,329   that occurred in the state in 2015 involved  

 “Contrary to popular belief, the maximum traffic accidents on city roads occurred due to the mistakes of small vehicles as they try to overtake trucks and buses. They don’t know that a fully loaded truck cannot apply brakes, else it will turn upside down,” said a senior official of the Jaipur traffic police.
 
 The SCRB report states that 5,865 two-wheelers met with accident in 2015, compared to 1,586 buses, and 4,317 trucks. “If you notice, trucks move in a trail on city roads, as drivers know they cannot manoeuvre easily at a short notice. Other vehicles deliberately mender into their way which often causes the accident,” added police official.
 
 The state witnessed 23,066 accidents in 2016, compared to 24,072 in 2015. “While there is a decline in road accidents, the situation still remains grim as bad roads and unskilled drivers continues to shed blood on roads, especially on highways,” the official said.
 
 The maximum casualties due to road accidents were reported in the city. 1,406 people died in road accidents in Jaipur in 2016, compared to 598 in Ajmer and 563 in Alwar.
 
 “The number is certainly high in Jaipur. Most of these casualties were reported in areas such as Jagatpur and Sanagner which are at outskirts. We have put several interceptor vehicles here to check in increasing cases of over speeding,” the official said.
 
 The city police said that factors such as lack of speed breakers, inadequate street lamps and faulty roads are biggest contributor to traffic accidents.
 
 “All agencies such as PWD and JDA should come together to ensure better roads in the city,” the official said.
