Ahmedabad: Gujarat high court on Thursday ordered CID (crime) to take up the investigation into the death of two girls, whose bodies were fished out from Sabarmati river in 2015, and determine if it was a murder case.

 Trishali, 16, and Divya, 14, two friends from Rakhial, were found dead on November 26, 2015. Two days after their disappearance, their parents lodged an FIR. Police registered a kidnapping case and arrested five persons including one Bhagyesh Parmar, a married man who allegedly had an illicit relationship with one of the girls. The parents were not content with the police action. 
 
 After hearing the case, Justice J B Pardiwala said that though there are no allegations of bias against investigators, investigation has to be complete and fair for the purpose of a fair trial. tnn
