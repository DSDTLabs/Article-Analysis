MARGAO: A Curtorim-based non-governmental organisation ( ), ‘Goa Panchayat Raj Institution ( ) Union’, has announced that it will support young and sincere candidates seeking to contest the forthcoming state village panchayat elections scheduled for June 11.

 “As the polls draw closer, there will be a scramble by aspiring candidates. Our organisation has discussed this subject threadbare and has decided to support only those candidates who support devolution of power to panchayats, preferably younger faces, so they can become leaders of tomorrow,” convener J Santano   told STOI.
 
 Before extending support to an aspiring candidate, the NGO’s representatives will conduct a detailed analysis of his/her antecedents without considering political affiliations. “Only when we are satisfied the person is transparent, non-manipulative and sincere in putting the people on the right path will we back him/her,” Rodrigues said.
