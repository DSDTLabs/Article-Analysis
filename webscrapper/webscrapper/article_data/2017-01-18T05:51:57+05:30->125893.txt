NEW DELHI: The Centre told the Supreme Court on Tuesday that the process to appoint a new   chief has got under way amid indications that police chief of Delhi Alok Varma has emerged as the top contender for the leadership of the politically-sensitive responsibility.

 Attorney general Mukul Rohatgi told a bench, headed by Justice Kurian Joseph, that the high-panel committee comprising PM  ,   and leader of the largest opposition group in Lok Sabha, Congress's  , had met on Monday to sort out who gets to head the premier investigating agency.
 
 Rohatgi's statement came amid strong indications that the government will go by the seniority principle: a criterion which will work to the advantage of the Delhi Police chief who belongs to 1979 batch of IPS. Sources said the Centre favoured the seniority principle.There were indications that Justice Khehar could also go along with the preference for seniority being the main determinant and this will tilt the scales in Verma's favour.
 
 Kharge did not agree with the decision to privilege seniority over other considerations. The leader of Congress in LS is learnt to have strongly argued for giving more advantage: a pitch which could have helped former deputy chief of CBI, RK Datta. Datta, who has worked with CBI for 17 years in different spells, was serving as deputy director of the agency when ex-director Anil Sinha superannuated. However, he was shifted to the ministry of home affairs as special secretary (security) and additional director   was given the interim charge. The Gujarat cadre officer belongs to the 1984 batch of the IPS.
 
 With the court seized of a petition seeking its intervention to ensure early appointment of a full-fledged director, the government does not seem to have the leeway for expanding the zone of recruitment beyond the 1982 batch of IPS.
