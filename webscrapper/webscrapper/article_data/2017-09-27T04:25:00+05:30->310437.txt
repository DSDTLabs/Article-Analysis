Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Tuesday refused to stay framing of charges by a lower court against Tehelka former editor Tarun Tejpal in the alleged rape case, but directed that the trial could begin only after its consent. Tejpal had sought a stay against the Mapusa district and sessions court order of September 7, which has fixed Thursday for framing of charges against him. The high court adjourned the case to November 1 and directed the state government to file a reply. The high court also said examination of witnesses could begin only after it gives its consent. During the hearing of the petition in the high court on Tuesday, senior Supreme Court counsel Aman Lekhi argued that the “sessions court order shows non-application of mind”.Opposing the defence contention, counsel representing the state, Francisco Tavora, argued that there is enough material on record for framing of charges against Tejpal. After the hearing, Lekhi told reporters that they made a specific and vehement plea that the case is utterly false and that the state is working in a very partisan manner. He said the state is not supposed to take sides but far from presenting facts, it has been hiding them.  Tejpal was booked for allegedly sexually harassing and raping a junior colleague during an event organised by him in Goa in November 2013.
