Trichy: The district administration would build a terminal exclusively for trucks in a major move that officials believe would reduce the increasing traffic congestion due to unscientific parking in the city. The officials have also invited stakeholders to make it a fully-fledged terminal with all the basic facilities,

 “A   for Trichy is an essential one considering the number of trucks touching the district for transport of goods from across state and other parts of India,” Trichy collector K Rajamani told TOI on Sunday.
 
 The administration was working hard on the plan for setting up a truck terminal, for which the whole stakeholders would chip in to make it a reality, he said highlighting the necessity for a project of a new integrated bus terminal in Trichy.
 
 “The terminal would have all basic facilities including dormitory for the truck drivers. It will be equipped with a restaurant, petrol bunk, dormitory, first aid centre, ATM, service station and few other facilities,” said the collector.
 
 A junction district, Trichy sees hundreds of trucks carrying essential commodities, materials and all other goods to and from many parts of the state every day. Besides, four national highways – Trichy – Thanjavur, Trichy- Chennai, Trichy- Dindigul and Trichy- Madurai pass through the city. The situation has left truck drivers with no option but park their vehicle on roadside.
 
 As far as the Trichy city is concerned, the movement of the trucks to load and unload groceries and vegetables from the Gandhi market in the city is causing traffic congestion around the market. Most of the time, the trucks will be parked on the east boulevard roadsides which is close to the market.
