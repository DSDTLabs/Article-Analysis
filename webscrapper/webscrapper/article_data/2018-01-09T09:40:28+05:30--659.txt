CHENNAI: If the government is not able to run its transport corporations efficiently,   Chief Justice   observed on Monday, it could privatise the sector. 

 Industry and experts welcomed the suggestion - and the fact that it reopened the debate on privatisation of loss-making state transport undertakings (STUs). With the exception of the districts of Chennai, Madurai, Nagercoil and the Nilgiris, Tamil Nadu allows private firms to operate inner-city and medium-haul passenger services of up to 130km. Nearly 4,700 private buses ply on these routes.
 
 But the government, as a policy decision, in 1987 stopped issuing permits for new routes to private players. It has since allowed only STUs to augment services.
 
 Federation of Bus Operators' Associations of Tamil Nadu's D R   said private and public sector corporations would complement each other and result in better services.
 
 "Government or private (as in Madhya Pradesh) monopoly stalls growth," he said. "Private operators could share the rising transportat burden."
 
 The situation on the ground bolstered the argument: The effect of the strike was limited in Coimbatore and Trichy, where private operators ply large fleets. 
 
 But K Arumuga   of CITU said privatisation would lead to a rise in fares. "Private firms, guided only by profits, would leave people in interior areas high and dry," he said. Other union leaders said employees would lose job security.
 
 An expert, however, said the government could issue permits to firms on the condition that they would also operate a certain number of services on routes that may prove "uneconomical". Nainar argued that there are legal hurdles to privatisation. "According to the Motor Vehicle Act, only the government can operate buses on certain roads," he said. "These laws cannot simply be amended."
