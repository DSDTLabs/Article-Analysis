New Delhi: JNUSU president Mohit   on Friday removed the installed   cameras at the Brahmaputra hostel and said the act was to “reject the move to put surveillance mechanism.” The administration on the other hand claimed that this would be a contempt of court’s order to install cameras at all important public places.

 Pandey led a group of students to   the cameras installed at the Brahmaputra hostel. “It’s a privacy concern, which is why we won’t allow this to happen. The cameras will increase surveillance and they are not required at places accessed by students. Cameras are already there at the administration block and the main gate. Also, the reasons given by the administration are false. In fact, the administration claims that the main gate CCTV was not working when   disappeared. Why didn’t the guards in the hostel record the assault on Ahmed in the register?”
 
 The dean of students told TOI to contact the registrar who in turn didn’t respond to the calls or the text messages. 
 
  sources said that the university is planning to install 45 cameras at a cost of Rs 70 lakh. These cameras are high-end equipment with facilities to zoom and of voice recording. These will be put up at the entrances and lobbies of the hostels and other public spaces on the campus.
 
 Terming this as “bulldozing”, Pandey said the installation was undemocratic as the hostel association has not approved of the same. “The proposal has been rejected at various general body meetings and hostel meetings. If the administration wants a dialogue then why doesn’t it hold a GBM to know what the students feel?”
