NEW DELHI: Jawaharlal   on Monday informed Delhi high court that it has lodged an FIR against students who have blocked access to the varsity's administrative block.

 It also urged the court to direct police to provide help for its officials to enter the block but, Justice   refused, pointing out that it is for JNU to seek its own remedies.
 
 The university claimed without police protection it faces hindrance in securing copies of marksheets of several students who have approached the court. They said that they need the documents to pursue further studies or apply for jobs.
 
 “Only for providing marksheets you need police? The university has to take appropriate remedy,“ the judge.
 
 It also asked JNU to provide to the petitioners the names and details of the students named in the FIR, so that they can be made a party to the matter and listed it for hearing on March 1.
 
 During the hearing, senior advocate  , appearing for the petitioners, argued that JNU appeared to be intimidated by the protesting students. He said the protestors have no right to agitate where they are as there is an appropriate place and time for such activities. The Centre standing counsel  , however, apprised the court about lodging of the FIR adding that group of students blocking the block keeps changing.
