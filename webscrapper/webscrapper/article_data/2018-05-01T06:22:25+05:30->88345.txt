BENGALURU/ KGF (KOLAR):   national president   on Monday slammed   for meeting fodder scam convict   in AIIMS-Delhi earlier in the day, saying it “exposed” the   chief’s “dual face”.

 
 Shah tweeted from his official Twitter handle, saying: “Rahul Gandhi tore off the ordinance brought by   to save Lalu Yadav when in power but now goes to meet the convicted leader in fodder scam to take his support for 2019 elections. This dual face of Rahul Gandhi is exposed.”
 
 
  
 
 Earlier, addressing a public rally in Kolar Gold Fields, Shah took exception to Rahul talking about ending corruption. He claimed the same Rahul had torn up the copy of an ordinance to tackle graft. “He did it to save the UPA government and certain individuals, including former Bihar chief minister Lalu Prasad Yadav. Now he is talking about corruption. The Congress is for corruption and cannot support anti-corruption moves by any government,” he said.
 
 In Bengaluru, Shah gave a spin to BJP’s ‘Congress-mukt Bharat’ slogan, saying the need of the hour is to make the city “mukt” (free) of Congress leaders.
 
 Brushing aside allegations by Siddaramaiah that central assistance to Karnataka had fallen drastically under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Shah said under the 13th Finance Commission, when UPA was in power, the state had got Rs 88,000 crore. “The state has got Rs 2.19 lakh crore under the 14th Finance Commission recommendations. The NDA government has allocated Rs 2,600 crore for Namma Metro project and Rs 960 crore for the Smart City programme,” he said.
