AHMEDABAD:   on Friday turned down the demand for compensation, for the killing of   in an   in 2003, on the ground that no final outcome has been reached in the case it is not possible to award compensation at present.

  Sadiq’s father, Jamalbhai Mehtar, filed a petition seeking directions to the state government to award him compensation of Rs 50 lakh for bumping off his son, in an alleged fake encounter, on January 13, 2003.
 
 While denying Mehtar compensation at this stage, Justice J B Pardiwala said the trial is yet to begin and the evidence gathered by   and its claim that it was a fake encounter case are not incontrovertible. The HC also observed that though the   and the high courts often grant compensation by exercising their powers for violations of fundamental rights, “but such a power should not be lightly exercised”.
 
 The HC said there must be a proper inquiry before awarding compensation and the court should examine the report after hearing the parties involved. This should be permissible only if the court also reaches the same conclusion as the inquiry report. 
 
 It further said, “The award of monetary compensation, in such an eventuality, is permissible when that is the only practicable mode of redress available for the contravention made by the state or its servants in the purported exercise of their powers.”
