NAGPUR: Almost 15 years ago, a groundbreaking discovery by an Indian Space Research Organization satellite proved that the deserted area of Rajasthan had once cradled   river before it dried up, said poet and playwright Pranav Patwari, the translator of the research paper in Sanskrit.

 
 Patwari made the revelation while speaking on ‘Importance of Saraswati river’ at an event organized by Sanskrut Bhasha Pracharini Sabha on Saturday. The scholar has written and translated many plays and poems, including Kalidasa’s ‘Meghdoot’, in Sanskrit.
 
 Talking about the origin and course of the river, he said, “The geographical origin could be tracked down to the Saraswat glacier near Har Ki Dun in the  , from where it travelled through four states to finally meet the Arabian Sea from Rann of Kutch. Eventually, due to the shifts in our tectonic plates, it got detached from the glacier and dried up. The various soil and stone samples from in and around Kutch region have proved this.”
 
 He referred to scriptures as ancient as Rugveda in which the river has been mentioned. “The various life stages of Saraswati have been described in our four Vedas. Rugveda talks about its origin, while Yajurveda gives an account of her transition from a mischievous child into a beautiful young woman. Saamveda describes her role as a mother and Atharvaveda mentions her as a deity who grants salvation. This goes a long way in proving the existence of the river,” he said.
 
 Patwari also said that the “researchers believe that the river derived its name from an iceberg, but our ancient scriptures proves it’s the other way round. In our Vedas, it is mentioned that the waters of Saraswati that froze leading to the formation of glaciers and icebergs or ‘sarovar’ as we know them in Hindi.”
 
 On the occasion, Patwari was presented with Pradnya Barati Puruskar, the first centenarian award given by the academy to encourage young Sanskrit scholars.
