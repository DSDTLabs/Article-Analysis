CHANDIGARH: Chief minister   on Monday said the Ludhiana   were likely to be held before February 24. He was replying to a question on the proposed cabinet expansion and said it would happen after the election process is over.

 Even though an official spokesperson of the government later clarified that Amarinder was only talking about the tentative dates,   (SAD) got a chance to attack the   regime. SAD spokesperson   said, “The announcement of poll schedule of Ludhiana MC poll by the CM indicates that state government has taken total control of the state election commission (SEC). Soon the government will also send the readymade result to the   for notification. SEC is free to complete customary procedure.”
 
 Earlier, local bodies minister Navjot Singh   had said that elections for Ludhiana civic body were likely be held before February 20. “We are targeting the first week of February but the state election commission will take a final call on this,” Sidhu had told mediapersons on January 4. The state election commission has, meanwhile, not made any formal announcement about the date of election even though it has been almost a month since the corporations in three cities of Patiala, Amritsar and Jalandhar went to polls.
 
 Polls in Ludhiana were deferred as the delimitation process was not complete and local leadership of the Congress wanted some more time to prepare for the polls. The Congress has won majority of seats in the corporations and other civic bodies where elections were held.
