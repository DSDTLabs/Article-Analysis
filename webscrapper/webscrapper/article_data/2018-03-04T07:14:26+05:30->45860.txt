CHANDIGARH:   chief minister Captain   on Saturday countered Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remark that   didn’t give him “respect”, saying it was part of the BJP’s “pointless attempts to create a wedge between him and the party leadership”. Earlier on Saturday, Modi said, “In Punjab, Congress does not even consider the CM as its own. He marches on, like an independent solider.” Modi was speaking at the   headquarters in Delhi following the party’s resounding victory in Tripura, Meghalaya and Nagaland elections.

 Countering Modi, Amarinder said, “I don’t remember complaining to him against the Congress leadership. Did the leadership go and complain to him against me? One really fails to understand what prompted Modi’s illconceived and unfounded remark.” He said neither he nor the party leadership needed Modi’s advice on how to manage their relations.
 
 The CM also said the Congress leadership had full faith in him and had given him a free hand to bring Punjab out of the mess into which BJP had plunged it in. “I know my business and how to run my state. I am personally set to take this battle to finish, Mr Modi.”
