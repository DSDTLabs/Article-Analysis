MADURAI: The Madras high court Madurai bench has directed the state government to file a counter in a case seeking to impart firefighting training to its employees besides having 108 ambulance as well as fire engine stationed on the premises of government offices to meet exigencies. 

 Petitioner C M Raghavan, state spokesperson of  , said that he had witnessed one Esakkimuthu set himself and his family members ablaze in October for an alleged harassment over unpaid debt, at the Tirunelveli collectorate. Though a number of government employees and police personnel witnessed the incident, not a single person had the knowledge to use a fire extinguisher. Instead, only sand was used for the purpose. Had anyone known how to use a fire extinguisher, precious lives of four people would have been saved. 
 
 Besides, there was no ambulance and fire engine inside the collectorate. The police took the victims in their jeep to the hospital while the ambulance and fire engines reached the spot only after that. Though most government buildings have fire extinguishers, they are not useful unless the staff are given proper training to use them. Hence, it was necessary to give firefighting training to the government servants. Further, the fire department should give no objection to the public buildings only when they install fire extinguishers on their premises. The petitioner said though he had sent representation to the chief secretary, director general of police and director of fire and rescue services on November 23, no action was taken. When the case came up for hearing before the division bench headed by  ,it sought counter from the government.
