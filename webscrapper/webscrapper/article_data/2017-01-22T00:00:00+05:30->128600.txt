I wasn’t really spiritual. I had been an actor in the film industry for 16 years. After Pyar to Hona Hi Tha released, I quit films to pursue my love for art. During this period, I was exposed to opulence, wealth, ‘the high life’, private jets and other trappings of material life. Then I saw the markets crashing in 2008... It was then that I realised that the millions you may earn could be snatched away from you in a snap. I had a deep understanding of the impermanence of all the so-called ‘important’ things we waste our entire lives to acquire. Instead of wasting time wallowing in the grief of my losses, I chose to acquire something that was permanent and could never be taken away by anyone. I started travelling to yoga retreats and became a regular at the International Yoga festivals of Rishikesh, France and Bali. I discovered the magic of Kundalini Yoga at one of these festivals. My life finally got a direction. From a learner, I soon became a teacher. Spirituality helped me give up my material life completely. It helped me peel off my ego, and I glowed in the spiritual happiness. I let go of my desires, wants, emotions and ego. An inner brightness lit me from within. The restlessness was replaced by stillness. I lost my party mates, but found new soulmates through meditation. I learnt to control my cravings and desires. I moved away from any negativity. I started watching things without attachment or distractions.
