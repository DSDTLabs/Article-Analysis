Navi Mumbai: Four labourers employed at a flyover construction site at Chinchpada along the   bypass road in Panvel taluka sustained injuries after they fell from a height while erecting the iron reinforcement of the flyover pillars.

 The Panvel city police said, the incident occurred on Saturday around 12.30pm when the group of 10-15 labourers were engaged in erecting the iron reinforcement for one of the pillars of the flyover. While, three men sustained minor injuries, the fourth labourer sustained head injury and even fractured his leg. He is still undergoing treatment in a hospital. However, the Panvel city police have not registered any offence against the supervisor of the construction site as the labourers were not provided with safety gears.
 
 NHAI's regional project director Prashant Fegade said, “There was a viral message on social media that the flyover pillar’s iron reinforcement had collapsed which was not the case. Actually, four workers slipped while erecting the metal reinforcement and they sustained injuries after some iron rods fell on them due to imbalance of the reinforcement structure being erected.”
