IMPHAL: To address the problem of growing drug menace in the state, chief minister   said on Saturday his government will soon establish a fasttrack court to tackle the issue. 

 Speaking at an official function at Langthabal, Biren said the fasttrack court would replace the present Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances court and hear all the cases concerning drug abuse.
 
 Biren's statement comes in the wake of the recent large-scale seizure of heroin, World is Yours (WY) tablets and other narcotic substances from different parts of the state by the security forces, police and other government agencies.
 
 A committee has been formed in this regard with principal secretary (home) as chairman, an ADGP as vice-chairman, and all IGPs, DCs, SPs as its members. 
 
 The committee will look into the rapidly growing problem of drug abuse among young adults and check the peddling and smuggling of drugs in the state. It will also be empowered to track down the kingpins of the drug smuggling business in the state, the CM added. 
 
 Biren further informed that a WhatsApp group has been formed to exchange information and cases related to drug menace and added that he has been receiving photographs and reports on this group of poppy plants being destroyed in the remote corners of Kangpokpi and   districts. 
 
 The chief minister has asked all the deputy commissioners, SPs and SDOs concerned to destroy all poppy and cannabis plants by March this year. 
 
 In a separate function - the 16th foundation day celebration of a popular local cable operator - held here on Saturday evening, the CM said since the situation of substance abuse is very alarming right now, his government will do everything in its power to address the problem. 
 
 He informed that an assistant sub-inspector of police was arrested recently while carrying a huge quantity of drugs and added that he has given instructions for meting out exemplary punishment to him.
