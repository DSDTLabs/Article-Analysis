Vadodara: Burglars seem to have a merry time even as city police claimed to have increased night patrolling.

 A day after two burglaries were reported in Manjalpur and Rajmahal Road, a businessman’s house at Vishwamitri was broken into in the wee hours of Thursday by burglars who decamped with gold and silver ornaments worth Rs 4.8 lakh.
 
 Complainant Praful Jadhav told the police that he had gone with his family to stay at his brother’s house in Makarpura on Wednesday night. On Thursday morning, Jadhav’s neighbour called him to inform that his house has been broken into. When Jadhav reached his house, he found that valuables in the house were lying scattered.
 
 Police said that burglars broke open two safes in Jadhav’s house and stole gold and silver ornaments worth Rs 4.7 lakh and Rs 6,500 cash from them. Jadhav then approached Raopura police station and got a case registered.
