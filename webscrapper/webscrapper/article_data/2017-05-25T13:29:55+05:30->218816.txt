HYDERABAD/DELHI:   CM K Chandrasekhar Rao and the BJP were locked in a bitter war of words on Wednesday over the alleged lunch that   had with a   family in Teretpally in Nalgonda, that was actually prepared by a member of the forward Reddy community. 

  "The lunch that Amit Shah had with the Dalit family was actually prepared by  , a resident of Khammagudem village. As a result, the Dalits in Teretpally are upset," KCR alleged, adding, "Besides, Dalit leader   was made to stand while the BJP chief had his meal on a table. Is this called 'sahapankti' (partaking lunch together)?" 
 
  The Telangana CM also said that the second day's lunch was prepared at Pedda Devulapalli Annapurna mess and not at a Dalit's home. "On the third day, fearing protests from Dalits, Shah had lunch at Bhongir that was prepared by a Dalit," the CM said . Claiming that whatever he said was true, KCR dared Shah to deny the same . 
 
  The allegation drew a fiery response from BJP. "KCR is rattled by the huge success of our president's visit to Telangana and that hour-long press conference where he fulminated almost exclusively against BJP is an evidence of his jitters," said GVL Narasimha Rao, party's spokesperson.
