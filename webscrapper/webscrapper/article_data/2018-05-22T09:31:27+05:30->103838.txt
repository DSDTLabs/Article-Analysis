HYDERABAD: In yet another horrific case of animal cruelty, six stray dogs were allegedly poisoned by residents of Moula Ali’s   (Street No. 5) over a span of 20 days.

 The incident came to light on Monday, after one of the Community Animal Protectors (CAP) realised that healthy dogs in the area were suddenly dying, and alerted volunteers of People for Animals (PFA), an organisation working for animal welfare.
 
 
  
 “Our CAP volunteer   suspected foul play after he noticed that a dog that he fed on Saturday night was dead on Monday morning. On close inspection of the dead animal, he noticed that there were no signs of injury or struggle on the dog’s body,” said  , chief executive officer of PFA. He added: “We rushed to the spot after Pratap informed us about this and later sent the dog’s body for post-mortem.”
 
 Following a complaint lodged with the Malkajgiri police by PFA, a case was registered under Section 429 (mischief by killing or maiming animals) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 11 of The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (PCA) Act, 1960.
 
 This is the second time in the last 10 days where stray dogs have died under suspicious circumstances. In a similar incident that took place last week, about 25 to 30 carcasses of dogs were found in a garbage dump near the   forest area — about 30 km from Hyderabad. While a complaint was registered in this case as well, cops are yet to nab the culprits.
 
 Activists suspect poisoning as the cause of death in both cases and say that the safety of dogs has become a serious cause for concern in recent times.
 
 “There have been quite a few cases of dog poisoning in the city lately. Though the postmortem reports are still awaited, going by the pattern of deaths, we fear that somebody or some group is intentionally doing this,” Pratap said.
