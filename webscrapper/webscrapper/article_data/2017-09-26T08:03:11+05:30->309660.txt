HYDERABAD: Days after a major crackdown against an active sheikh marriage racket in the city, which saw cops arresting several foreign nationals, the police finally zeroed in on Qazi Ali Abdullah Rifai aka Volta Rifai, a main accused.

 The Qazi who belongs to Talabkatta area in Moghalpura, became infamous for performing dubious nikah and was absconding since the South Zone police broke the clandestine network of brokers and Qazis last week.
 
 A team of Falaknuma police was tracking him after he allegedly went into hiding during the crackdown on Arab Sheikhs and Qazis in Old City .“We have finally succeeded in tracing him and he has been detained for interrogation,“ said an official associated with the investigation.
 
 In 2015, he was booked in a similar case for performing child marriages with elderly Arab nationals.
 
 The Qazi had earlier obtained stay from court against State Minorities Department and was continuing to perform marriages.
 
 So far, the police have arrested 20 people, including five Omani nationals, three Qatar national, three Qazis, five local brokers and four lodge owners.
