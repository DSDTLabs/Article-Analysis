Women power is the one theme that Drake explores in his latest single 'Nice For What'. The three-and-a-half minute song replaced the 31-year-old rapper’s own song 'God’s Plan' on the charts as it debuted on the top position. This is a record of sorts for the Canadian artiste as this marks his fifth song to reach the No. 1 position on the US Billboard Hot 100.
 
 The song, influenced by Bounce music, samples Lauren Hill’s 90s hit 'Ex-Factor', features more than a dozen actresses including Olivia Wilde, Rashida Jones, Zoe Saldana, Letitia Wright, Emma Roberts and Michele Rordriguez; and there’s a reason for that. 
 
 The hit song is all about woman power and features the actresses in the most beautiful manner, respecting them as talented strong women. In the track, Drake looks at the everyday challenges that women face and respects the way that women meet them. What’s best is that the song never gets preachy. With a heavy New Orleans sound, Drake makes sure that the energy is present throughout the track. The overall effect is a song that unapologetically celebrates women and sounds like it, too!
