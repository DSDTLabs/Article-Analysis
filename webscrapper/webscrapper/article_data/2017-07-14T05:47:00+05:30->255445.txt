Yavatmal: The district Shetkari Nyaya Hakk Samiti is scheduled to take out a farmers’ procession on July 14 from the historic Azad Maidan to the district collector’s office.

 The samiti is demanding complete loan waiver for all the farmers and incentive of Rs 25,000 to those who paid their loan instalments regularly to the banks concerned.
 
 According to reports, the rally is being taken out under the leadership of sitting MLA Bachhu Kadu, Shetkari Sanghatna leader and former MLA Wamanrao Chhatap and farm activist Chandrakant Wankhede.
 
 However, the Congress has distanced itself from the so called ‘shav yatra’ despite a few disgruntled local Congressmen expressing their solidarity to the rally.
 
 Former social justice minister Shivajirao Moghe said none of the Congress leaders would participate in the rally, which is nothing but an outcry of a few people in the district.
 
 When asked if former MPCC president Manikrao Thakre is participating in the rally, as claimed by one of the DCC office-bearers, Moghe said, “There is least possibility of Thakre attending the rally.”
 
 However, DCC secretary Anil Gaikwad, who is a close associate of Thakre, has confirmed that the leader will reach Yavatmal on Thursday night and will attend the rally.
