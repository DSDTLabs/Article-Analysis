LUCKNOW: All   and   lots would be turned into smart parking in Kaiserbagh, the area chosen for area-based development under the Smart City project. Several other projects, like making Globe Park disabled-friendly and installing solar rooftops and waste water management in four building of Kaiserbagh, have been earmarked for the first phase. 

 The decision was taken during the third board meeting on Saturday. The corporation has already received Rs 134 crore - Rs 62 crore each from the Centre and the state government - to begin the proposed projects.
 
 The other plans, like providing proper water supply and revival of the old LMC office in   House, Lalbagh have taken the backseat as the detailed project report(DPR) wasn't tabled in the meeting. Additional municipal commissioner   said the DPR would be tabled at the next meeting.
