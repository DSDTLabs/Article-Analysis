NEW DELHI: Following the removal of   Chief   and secretary  , as per the   orders, we look back at the events that transpired ever since the Apex court came up with the decision of implementing Lodha Panel reforms.

 - On July 18, 2016, the Supreme Court welcomes Lodha Panel's recommendations of sweeping changes within the BCCI. The Apex court gives the board four to six months to adhere to these chances under the supervision of the committee. The Lodha Committee also clarifies that officials who have completed nine years in the job cannot contest for another run.
 
 - Justice RM Lodha sends invitation to Shirke and Thakur regarding discussion over the new reforms on August 9 but Thakur doesn't show up. Few days later, the Panel issues its first set of timelines after Shirke meets the panel and says the BCCI will follow the same. Its deadline is September 30.
 
 - The Lodha Committee issues its second set of guidelines on September 1. The BCCI is asked to hold elections and conduct AGM by December 15. The board is also directed to form a fresh IPL governing council by December 30.
 
 - On September 28, the Lodha Panel submits to SC a report that claims BCCI's inability to implement the reforms intentionally, and suggests that all officials of the board be replaced. TS Thakur, the Chief Justice of India, issues a warning to the BCCI to follow the reforms. Two days later, the BCCI misses the first deadline.
 
 - The Lodha Committee orders Yes Bank and Bank of Maharashtra to stop the disbursal of funds from the BCCI accounts to the state associations, following which the India-New Zealand ODI series comes under a possible cancellation. However, the funds are disbursed in time and the matches take place as per schedule.
 
 - But soon after, the Supreme Court clarifies that the state associations will receive no further funds unless they implement the Lodha panel's suggestions. Thakur is asked to submit individual affidavit on whether he had sought ICC intervention in the implementation of the Lodha panel's proposals.
 
 - In November, the Committee proposes the disqualification of all ineligible BCCI office-bearers and suggests the appointment of GK Pillai as observer to oversee day-to-day functioning of the BCCI.
 
 - In December, it is revealed that the Apex court had quashed the review petition that was filed by the BCCI against the July 18 order. More trouble mounts for BCCI chief Thakur as the SC hints at perjury case against him and reserves order for January 2017. Amicus curiae Gopal Subramanium suggests a three-member independent panel consisting GK Pillai, former cricketer Mohinder Amarnath and former CAG head Vinod Rai.
 
 - On January 2, 2017, the Supreme Court removes Anurag Thakur as BCCI chief and secretary Ajay Shirke. Thakur has until January 19 to reply to the Supreme Court's perjury charges. The SC also suggests that the senior-most vice-president take over the reins.
