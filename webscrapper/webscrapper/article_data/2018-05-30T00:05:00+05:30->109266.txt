It is one of the biggest musical reality shows on Kannada  . Year after year when it returns with a new season, the buzz only seems to get louder. It was no different this time around, too.   Season 14 witnessed a glittering finale over the weekend and was a nail-biting one at that. As always, contestants from the previous season came over to watch the event, while the ones who dint make it to the finale of the current season rendered soulful songs. 

  Five-year-old Neha, who has endeared herself to audiences this season, also performed on stage. As for the highlight, competition among the finalists was so stiff that the judges had to make a detour from the regular format and award four places rather than the regular three spots. As for the lucky one, it was   who stole everyoneâ€™s hearts with his talent and was declared winner of this season.
