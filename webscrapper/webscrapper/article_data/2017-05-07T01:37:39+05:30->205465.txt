GURUGRAM: Around 100 homebuyers, who have invested in the upcoming   in  , hit the streets on Saturday to protest against the developer for its alleged failure to hand over flats even eight years after the project was launched.

 The agitating buyers, who assembled in front of the office of Emaar Properties near Sikandarpur Metro station and protested for about an hour, alleged the developer was yet to start construction for Amber and Topaz, two low-rise apartments within the project area. They claimed the project was launched in 2009 and the two apartment blocks were to be completed by 2013.
 
 “Not a brick has moved on the site (of Amber and Topaz) till date. The developer has been citing the demerger — erstwhile Emaar MGF split to form Emaar Properties in 2016 — as the reason for the delay and promised to give the possessions by 2018. However, the pace at which work is going on currently, they will not be able to finish construction even by 2022,” claimed Umesh Sapra of Emerald Hills Owners’ Association.
 
 “Around 25 acres has been sold out to a third party. Also, we have been told that the project layout has been changed. But instead of divulging the details, they are telling us to go to the Huda office to see the revised plan,” said Sandhya Jolly, another buyer.
 
 Rubbishing the allegations, a spokesperson for Emaar said, “The work is being carried out in phases. The project will be completed and handed over in phases to ensure seamless delivery. We have started giving possessions for 517 units at Emerald Hills Floors, Emerald Floors Select and Spanish Villas located in the project’s Ivory, Jemma and Topaz sectors.” 
 
 “The developer has already started the process for handing over possessions of 150 developed plots in the area,” he added.
