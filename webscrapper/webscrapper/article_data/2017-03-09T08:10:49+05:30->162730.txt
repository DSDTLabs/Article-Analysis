THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister   slammed director general of police (DGP) T P   in the assembly on Wednesday while responding to demand for adjournment motion by the opposition.

 Replying to the charges against the government with regards to the repeated cases of sexual offences against minor girls, the chief minister said that Senkumar was removed as the   after it was found that he was not fit to continue in the post.
 
 “Senkumar was not removed because   was murdered. It was because he was not fit to continue in the post. It has become evident from his recent activities,” the chief minister said, apparently referring to Senkumar’s subsequent moves for judicial intervention in the matter.
 
 The chief minister also said that the opposition need not vouch for Senkumar.
 
 The matter was raised after   said that the present state police chief should take the responsibility of the repeated incidents as the government had removed Senkumar as the chief citing Jisha murder case in Perumbavoor. TNN
