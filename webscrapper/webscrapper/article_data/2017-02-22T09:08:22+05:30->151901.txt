HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad HC on Tuesday issued notices to the Centre, AP and Telangana governments seeking to know their stand on sub-categorization of scheduled castes (SC).
Justice A   was admitting a petition filed by   of   and V   of Madiga Reservation   (MRSS) questioning the inaction of the states in not implementing the categorisation despite a judicial commission inquiry recommending the same. Petitioners urged the court to direct the states to comply with section 3(4) of the Commissions of Enquiry Act, 1952 and also in tune with the report submitted by Justice Ramachandra Raju commission that delved into the issue under the provisions of the Act. Justice Raju, the commissioner of enquiry for sub-categorization of scheduled castes recommended for division of benefits among SCs and gave his report on May 26, 1999. The intended benefits of reservations are not reaching the most backward sections of SCs like Madiga, Relly, Dakkali and other similar communities, the counsel for the petitioner said. Despite the state cabinet approving and unanimously resolving to implement the categorisation by the composite AP assembly , not much is done, said the counsel.
 
 To rationalise the available benefits, the only option available is to categorise the SCs to ensure that the intended purpose of reservation is achieved, he said. The petitioners maintained that categorisation is very much in tune with the spirit of reservation policy itself as it intends to take the benefits to the doorsteps of the weakest sections who are unable to avail the benefits on their own. The states despite avowing in public that they are in favour of this policy are hardly doing anything to bring this into practice, he said.
