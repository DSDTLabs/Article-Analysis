Against the backdrop of a spate of protests against   movie ' ', actor Nana   today said he would never resort to any gimmicks for ensuring success of his movies at box office.
When asked whether violent protests by the   against 'Padmaavat' boosted popularity of the controversial film in any manner, Patekar said that, if at all that was the case, he would prefer that his film flops at box office but would never resort to any "malpractices".
 He was in the Marathwada city today to attend an event for the promotion of his Marathi film "Aapla Manus".
 "If at all that is the case, then I would prefer my film to be a super flop rather than go for such unacceptable violence to make a movie a success at the box office," he said.
 The actor said people should come to watch a film in theatres with the excitement to see what the makers have done in the film rather than due to "any such measures".
 He added that while a lot of films made money at the box office, what is important was "what the film conveys rather than how much it earns".
 Patekar said "Aapla Manus" was a good opportunity he got after his earlier film "Natsamrat".
 Replying to a query on the best Hindi film he had seen recently, Patekar said he liked "Bareilly ki Barfi" and "Newton".
