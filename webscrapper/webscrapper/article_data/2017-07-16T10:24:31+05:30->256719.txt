CHENNAI: Work to build a second modern   rail   at  , which will stable and maintain metro trains that run across the stretch of North Chennai, may begin by year-end.

 Metro rail officials said they were in the process of completing land acquisition for the depot, which will be one-tenth of the size of those built by the Indian Railways. It will also have cutting-edge technology for regular upkeep of trains. The depot, planned along with the phase-1 extension project from Washermenpet to Wimco Nagar, may get operational only by 2019, when trains start running to far flung localities of North Chennai.
 
 “Land acquisition is in its last stage at Wimco Nagar. We may float tenders to invite companies to build the depot before the end of this year,” said a metro rail officer.   is focusing on completing the underground stretch of phase-1 at Anna Salai and phase-1 extension between Washermenpet and Korukkupet.
 
 Once built and operational, Wimco Nagar depot will be a second shed for stabling and maintenance work apart from the existing one at  , as Cmrl will run as many as 40 four-car trains when phase-1 and its extension project gets operational. One depot may not be enough for inspection and maintenance of the fleet. Wimco Nagar depot will have 17 railway lines to bring trains to shed.
 
 The depot at Koyambedu at present has the capacity to accommodate 10 four-car trains that run on the elevated and underground corridors of phase-1. Air-conditioned metro trains undergo a three-stage service maintenance once in three days at this depot. Engineers also conduct quarterly, half-yearly and annual maintenance work besides overhauling trains once in four years.
 
 “Wimco Nagar depot will only conduct low maintenance work on trains. Koyambedu depot will continue to do heavy maintenance work,” Cmrl officers said.
