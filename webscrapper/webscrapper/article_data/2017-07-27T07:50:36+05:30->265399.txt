BENGALURU: Bengaluru is known as Garden City, Silicon City and Pub City, among other things. But very few people know that it is also a one-way city. The name stuck because a large number of roads, especially in the central business district, are one-way streets or uni-directional movement roads. At present, the city has 193 major and minor roads which are one-ways, and no other city in India has so many one-way streets.

 Converting regular two-way roads into one-way streets is a short-term measure to achieve traffic decongestion. It is usually resorted to when the volume of traffic is higher than the road capacity, causing jams and congestion, and no other project (widening or flyover) to increase the capacity of the road is in the offing.
 
 The first road to be converted to a one-way in Bengaluru was   or SC Road, where traffic movement was allowed only in one direction in 1965. In the 1970s, Sampige Road and   in   were converted to one-ways.
 
 In 1992-93, Kempe Gowda Road, Seshadri Road, JC Road and Lalbagh Road were made one-ways. But the real thrust towards conversion of roads into one-way streets came in 2003-05 when 128 roads were converted into uni-directional movement roads to cope with heavy traffic congestion and bottlenecks, as a result of the IT boom in the city . Major roads like Raj Bhavan Road,  's Road, Cunningham Road, Richmond Road, Residency Road and Infantry Road, too, became one-way streets during this phase.
 
 The change was a result of elaborate traffic studies and systematic planning due to which the entire one-way system has sustained over a considerable period of time.
