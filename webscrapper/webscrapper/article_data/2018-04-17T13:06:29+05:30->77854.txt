PATNA: Hundreds of   ( ) workers staged ‘Aakrosh March’ in the city on Monday against police inaction in the case of manhandling of their national president and Union minister   near Hajipur in Vaishali on April 10.

 The RLSP were taken into police custody for taking out procession in prohibited zones when they were trying to proceed towards   from Dak Bungalow roundabout. Gandhi Maidan SHO Deepak Kumar said more than 100 RLSP workers were detained, but they were released later on personal bonds. Party’s national vice-president Dasai Choudhary and national secretary general   led the protest march from the JP roundabout near Gandhi Maidan and wanted to submit a memorandum to governor Satya Pal Malik, demanding stern action against those guilty of heckling Kushwaha and seeking Z+ security to the RLSP chief.
 
 Kushwaha was manhandled by some youths during the anti-reservation ‘Bharat Bandh’ when he was on way to Motihari to participate in the PM Narendra Modi’s programme. 
 
 “Our party chief was attacked by a gang of people protesting reservation while he was on his way to the PM’s programme at Motihari in East Champaran. He could not reach the venue because of the road blockades at different places. Though Vaishali police registered a case against 60 unknown persons for attacking Kushwaha, only one person ( ) has been arrested so far in this connection. It shows the level of police negligence in the case of attack on a Union minister,” Ram Bihari told TOI after his release from Gandhi Maidan police station.
