NAVI MUMBAI: The   police has arrested a motorist after a video in which he is seen deliberately running into a barricade at the toll plaza went viral.

The incident occurred on April 21 around noon. 
 
 "After recording the statement of Vashi toll plaza staffer Arjun Parab (40), we registered an FIR against Sayyad who was booked under sections 279 and 427 of the IPC. He was identified as his car registration number was captured in the video. He was summoned to the police station and arrested on Thursday. He has been granted bail," police inspector   said.
