MUMBAI: The council for the   has rescheduled the   exam with a  . The Art Paper II, which was to be held on March 25 will now be held on April 7. 

 The paper has been rescheduled after an invigilator at a city school erroneously distributed the Art Paper II exam paper instead of Art Paper I to a few students on March 18.
 
 As many as 3,642 students take the Art exam across the country. The Art Paper I (still life) was held on March 18 at various centres when an invigilator at a city school inadvertently distributed the Art Paper II (Nature Drawing/ Painting) to a few students. 
 
 "The Art paper is a practical exam which requires students to draw in response to the questions. The invigilator by mistake opened the Paper II set on that day and distributed it," said Gerry Arathoon, chief executive and secretary of the board. "The error came to light when it was given out to two or three students. The principal of the school immediately informed the council and students were given the right paper for that day."
 
 However, since a few students had seen the paper a week before the exam day, the council decided to change the paper. "The students had the paper only for a minute or two before it was taken away but we cannot use the same paper next week," said Arathoon.
 
 The board on Monday sent an email to schools and centres where students were appearing for the Art paper. "We were informed by the council about the change in date and we are in the process of informing students who will take the exam," said the principal of a suburban school.
