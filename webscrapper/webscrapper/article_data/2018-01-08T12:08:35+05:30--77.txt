There was a time when she would keep the TV audience glued to her Pari Pagli act in  .  , one of the most popular actresses on TV, decided to call the small screen quits last year. Reason? Her growing involvement with films! Last year alone, Aparajita had four releases — Nabab, Projapoti Biskut, Samantaral and   movie  . This year, she has even more releases and the year will start for her with Ghare And Baire. But Aparajita, who was serious about calling TV quits, is back to doing the megaserial, Sanyasi Raja. When quizzed about her decision to be back on TV, the actress told us, “I have spent so many years doing TV and have portrayed all kinds of roles. Though I didn’t start off as the quintessential heroine, I would be summoned every time the lead flopped. I have no regrets. Having said that, I got busy with films over the past two years and more offers are trickling in. So, it’s tough balancing both. I had, at one point, decided to choose films over television. But the makers of   offered me a role that could be adjusted with my dates. They also spared me till October last year and I am happy to be doing both.”
