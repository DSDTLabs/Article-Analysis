Mangaluru: The Sangh Parivar filed a police complaint against Congress   for her controversial speech in Karkala a few days ago. Members of saffron outfits are demanding that Prathibha be stripped of her post as a corporator.

 Chittaranjan  , president, Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP),   branch, told the media on Saturday that she made the statements to stoke communal tension and score brownie points. Sumith, a Sangh Parivar member, filed a complaint at   police station.
 
 Prathibha, chairperson, standing committee on tax appellate and finance committee,  , had during a recent public rally in Karkala said, “Youths who want to get murdered, join the Sangh Parivar. Those who do not wish to work but make merry join the saffron brigade… you need not bother about filling your stomach. You get plenty of food in prison. All you have to do is kill somebody and enter jail.”
 
 Attacking Sunil Kumar, MLA, Karkala, Prathibha said several youths had gone behind bars after they acted at his behest. However, he didn’t even visit them in prison. “These saffron leaders don’t go to see whether they are dead or alive,” she said, adding that Kumar was incapable of bringing his boys out of jail. Prathibha added that Hindutva leaders only celebrated the death of innocents.
 
 She had referred to the murder of RSS activist Sharath Madiwala and Bajrang Dal member Deepak Rao and said the saffron brigade did not render any financial help to their families. When asked, Bhandary said there was no provision in the Sangh Parivar to render financial help to anybody. However, several members of the saffron brigade had gone to the residences of both slain activists. The Sangh Parivar had launched a social media campaign to raise funds for Deepak’s family.
