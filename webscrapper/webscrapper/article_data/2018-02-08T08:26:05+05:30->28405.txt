CHANDIGARH: There is no evidence to show that   are fairly treated in our society. What we need to do is change our minds since we all are part of this disadvantaged mindset, said Prof Paul  , prof at department of chemistry, University of York, United  . 

 Walton was delivering the 4th Pran   lecture on ‘Equality for  : Why is it so slow?’ organized by the department of chemistry, Panjab university, in association with the British council on Wednesday.
 
 Quoting a 2013 statistical report on the percentage of female academic staff of the UK universities, Walton said, “The percentage of female students in the UK universities at undergraduate level is 55%, while for the male the number is 45%. However, from the graduate level, the percentage of women starts going down and it is the lowest when they become professors.”
 
 Walton questioned where are these women going? Are they disappearing? However, he said that the situation was not improving. Giving another example, he said that the percentage of female staff is higher in disciplines like nursing and paramedical studies. 
 
 Walton explained that there is misconception that women are less ambitious and competitive as compared to men. “The fact is that there is no difference between men and women when it comes to ambition, maths ability, confidence, psychological well-being, personality, cognitive performance and self-esteem,” added Walton.
 
 “The problem is the social construct which constrains women. There is a mindset problem and we need to change this,” concluded professor Walton.
