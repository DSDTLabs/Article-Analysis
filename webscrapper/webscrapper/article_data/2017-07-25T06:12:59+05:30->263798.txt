MUMBAI: The tree that fell on   in Chembur last Thursday , causing her  , is one of 1,404 trees to have crashed since the start of the   this year. The figure represents the   from citizens. Of these, the maximum was in the western suburbs (701), followed by the island city (354) and the   (349).

 An inquiry by the BMC into the Chembur incident has concluded that “mid-level snapping due to wind force caused the tree to collapse“.Harshad Kale, assistant municipal commissioner, MWest ward, said, “This is a natural disaster.“
 
 Experts have a different view. D Stalin, director of the NGO Vanashakti, said trees, especially in the western suburbs, are weakened because of largescale concretization around the bases of trees that are on pavements and along roads. The road length in the western suburbs, which has the greatest area of the city's three zones, is much more, making more trees susceptible to concretisation this way.“In most cases, mud around the trees is removed. After road repairs are over, the BMC does not bother to fill the bases back. Ideally , a tempoload of mud can be brought and put around such trees,“ Stalin said.
 
 Former tree authority member Niranjan Shetty said the BMC is required to keep a 1x1 metre space around a tree's base while undertaking concretization, but this rule is not followed. “Development is important, but it needs to be done cautiously ,“ he said. Dr Suchandra Dutta, asstant professor, department sistant professor, department of botany , RD National College, Bandra, said, “The city's sewage system is very old and leakages, which have organic matter, weaken tree roots. Also, hawking food near trees invites rodents, who dig into ground, weakening roots.“
