MUMBAI: A 45-year-old man, Santosh Shelke, has been arrested for raping and murdering his wife, Sunita (40), in Shahapur on Monday night. The accused also mutilated his wife’s private parts. 

 The police said that Santosh, who is unemployed and an alcoholic, suspected that his wife was having an extra-marital affair with someone at a rice mill, where she worked as helper. The couple resided in Birwadi village in Shahapur taluka of Thane district. 
 
 According to the police, Santosh doubted Sunita as she would be on the phone for long. The couple would often fight over the issue. 
 
 On Monday night, when Sunita was returning from the rice mill, Santosh accosted her and took her to an isolated spot. There he raped her and strangulated her to death with her dupatta. To make it look like she had been raped by someone else, he took a beer bottle lying nearby and slashed the body.
 
 Prashant Kadam, additional superintendent of police, Shahapur region of   police, said, “After committing the crime, the accused went back to his residence. Later in the night, he pretended to be worried as his wife had not yet returned and alerted his neighbours.” The accused and the locals started searching for Sunita and on finding her body in a nullah, they alerted the police.
 
 A local crime branch official said that they immediately launched a hunt for Sunita’s murderer but found something fishy as Santosh showed too much interest in the investigation. When the police grilled him, he gave several contradictory statements and finally broke down only.
