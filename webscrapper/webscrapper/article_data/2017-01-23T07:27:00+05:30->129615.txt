ROHTAK: Haryana development and panchayat minister   on Sunday faced the protest of the sarpanchs at   over non-issuance of   to the panchayats during a felicitation function.

 A group of sarpanchs from Dadri-II block tried to raise the demand to release development grants to them by handing a memorandum to Dhankar.
 
 The organizers, however, objected to the demands after which the sarpanchs came out of the programme and started exchanging heated arguments.
 
 Somesh, sarpanch of a village, said, “The panchayats do not have a penny from the state government even after more than a year. We have been meeting the pressure and embarrassment from the villagers to start development works on daily basis.”
 
 In a cover up operation, the organizers had to request sarpanchs from other blocks of Charkhi Dadri to honour the minister. Reportedly, some of the media persons also faced ire of the organizers and their cameras were snatched.
