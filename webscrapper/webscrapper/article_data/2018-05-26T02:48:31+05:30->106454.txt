MUMBAI: For the first time, radio collars will be used to study the life and landscape of leopards at Sanjay Gandhi National Park. Very little is known about leopards and using the collars is an attempt to learn more about these secretive animals. 

  Five leopards will be radio-collared to monitor their movements closely and understand how they use the landscape in and around the park. SGNP is the most unique forest in the world surrounded by human habitation on all sides. Leopards have been thriving at the park and the 2017 census recorded the presence of 41 in and around it. The census is being conducted for three years using camera traps. 
 
  The SGNP signed an MoU with Wildlife Conservation Society, India, to carry out the two-year study estimated to cost Rs 36 lakh. In 2009, WCS (I) had conducted similar studies with seven leopards,
 
  In 2010, a female leopard in   was tracked in a similar manner and a tigress near   in 2011.
 
  Vidya  , member, WCS (I), said the project would take at least six months to get underway as they would require permission from the Centre as the leopard is a schedule 1 species.  , the park director, said he was happy to see the project come through.
