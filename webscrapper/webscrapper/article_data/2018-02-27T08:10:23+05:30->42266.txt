THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: How can tourism grow in a country or a state that lacks adequate toilet facilities for visitors at destinations? Lack of such amenities in beautiful locales of   has always been a major hurdle for tour operators while taking their clients on attractive packages.

 
 To find a lasting solution to the major concern,   will be launching toilet mapping, a first-of-its-kind initiative in the state. The Mission will also recommend government subsidy for people who provide toilet facilities to tourists at their homes.
 
 The draft RT policy said that toilet mapping is an unavoidable step to ensure that tourist centres are strictly following RT guidelines. At present, public toilets and washrooms across the state will be mapped initially, followed by destinations and places without such facilities.
 
 A major thrust will be to spot local households that are willing to let tourists and visitors use toilets by charging a minimal fee or finding potential entrepreneurs in the sector. With cleanliness being yet another challenge in case of toilets, plans are also afoot to give an RT rating for such facilities. A digital tool, which can help visitors to spot toilets and washrooms and rate them, is another novel initiative that has been envisaged.
 
 Giving priority for implementing the green protocol in various destinations, RT Mission has also identified 20 places to be declared garbage-free in the near future.
 
 They include Pallathuruthy, Alappuzha finishing point, Marari Beach, Muhamma, Kumarakom, Vaikom, Poovar, Fort Kochi, Munnar, Dharmadom, Bekal, Valiyaparamba, Thekkady, Kovalam, Olavanna, Athirappilly, Muzhappilangad, Vellinezhi, Vythiri and Ambalavayal.
 
 Studies will also be held on the capacity of tourist centres and lakes and initiatives similar to ‘waste-free Ashtamudi’ and ‘Clean Vembanad’ will be taken up by the mission, said, officials.
