Chennai: Even as the markets are hitting new peaks on a regular basis with the benchmark Sensex crossing the 30,000 mark, mutual funds (MFs) have emerged as the biggest investors in stocks in the last 1 ½ months. MFs have invested 2.5 times more than FIIs (foreign institutional investors) on a net basis in shares since April. 

 Equity MFs made net investments of around $2.16 billion (Rs 13,834 crore) between April 1 and May 15, data with markets regulator Sebi showed. In contrast, net investments by FIIs stood at only about $786 million (Rs 5,029 crore) between April 1 and May 17.
 
 Fund houses invested Rs 11,224.2 crore on a net basis in April alone, the best showing since November last year. 
 
 Equity funds went on a buying spree due to steady inflows into schemes during April. “The sentiments have been quite good. There has been optimism because of several factors including the forecast of a normal (South-West) monsoon,” said Sunil Singhania, chief investment officer (CIO), equity investments, Reliance MF. 
 
 “The inflows were quite good. There is value buying opportunity in certain sectors including IT (information technology) and metals,” said Gopal Agrawal, CIO, equities, Tata MF. 
 
 “March was a good month for inflows, especially in tax-savings schemes. Inflows were good in April as well,” Singhania says.
 
 Equity MFs (including equity-linked savings schemes) received net inflows of nearly $1.5 billion (Rs 9,429 crore) in April, data with the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) showed. This enabled fund houses to aggressively deploy money in the stock markets.
 
 But FIIs have outpaced MFs in stock market investing by a wide margin in 2017. 
 
 Overseas investors have net bought shares to the tune of nearly $7.2 billion (Rs 45,823 crore) so far in the current year on the back of huge deployments in February and March, data with share depository NSDL showed. 
 
 In contrast, fund houses have invested around $4 billion (Rs 25,300 crore) so far in 2017. Equity MFs, however, upstaged FIIs by pumping nearly 2.4 times more money into the stock markets on a net basis in 2016. 
 
 Fund houses made net investments of about $7.4 billion (Rs 48,746 crore) into the equity markets during the year.
