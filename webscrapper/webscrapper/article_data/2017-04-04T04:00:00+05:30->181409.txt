Vadodara: The district court rejected revision application of Arvind Jani, the land agent through whom Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) was trying to buy a piece of land in Sankarda in 2007, and asked him to deposit Rs 25,000 with district legal service authority. Jani had filed revision application in the court saying that the trial court that is hearing BCA’s case against him under Negotiable Instruments Act was not being heard according to the procedures of law.  Before filing the application in district court, Jani had applied in the lower court too but his application was rejected. Jani had told the court that the trial court was proceeding the trial in summons trial manner but the affidavit of BCA was sent to him along with the summons.  This, according to Jani, was violation of the provisions of summons trial procedure. BCA’s lawyer V J Shirke, however, argued before the court that the application moved by Jani was with malafide intention to prolong the matter of trial court.  The additional district judge T D Padia while rejecting Jani’s statement said that he was aware about the validity of the law yet he filed the revision application which has delayed the trial since June 2015.  The court asked him to deposit Rs 25,000 as cost in district legal service authority. BCA had invested Rs 4.5 crore in a piece of land in Sankarda in 2007. Deal for the land that was to be used for constructing international cricket stadium was done through Jani. The deal, however, failed to materialize and BCA had been trying to recover the money along with interest since then.  In 2013, Jani issued post-dated cheques worth Rs 8.22 crore towards final settlement to the cricket body which bounced after which a case was filed against him. BCA treasurer, Amul Jikar said, “Arvind Jani was trying to misguide the court by giving wrong citations of the SC orders. The court has rejected Jani’s application and this order will help the BCA in recovering the money from Jani.”
