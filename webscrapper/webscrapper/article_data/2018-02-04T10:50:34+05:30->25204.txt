AHMEDABAD: A special   court on Saturday completed hearing and reserved its order till February 16 on a plea filed by former DGP P P Pandey seeking a discharge in the 2004 Ishrat Jahan encounter case. The court also kept its decision pending on an application filed by two central IB officials questioning a lower court’s decision to issue summons to them after taking cognizance of additional chargehseet filed by CBI in 2014.

 Pandey, who was head of the city crime branch at the time of the encounter, questioned the evidence as well as raised the issue of want of prosecution sanction in his case. Since he had been a government employee, he cannot be prosecuted without proper sanction from the government, he had argued.
 
 In the second application, two IB officials, Rajeev Wankhede and T S Mittal, challenged the magisterial court’s decision to issue summons by taking cognizance of the chargesheet against them even though the central government denied permission to CBI to prosecute them. They submitted that the court cannot take cognizance of the chargesheet without prosecution sanction.
 
 In December, a magisterial court had issued summons to four IB officials, two others being IB’s special director   and his former subordinate M K Sinha. This happened after CBI intimated the court that the Centre had denied sanction to prosecute the four intelligence officials according to the provisions of Section 197 of the CrPC. For some four years, the court had not taken cognizance of the chargesheet after the investigation agency said that it was waiting for prosecution sanction.
 
 Ishrat Jahan was shot dead along with three others – Javed Shaikh alias Pranesh Pillai, Amjad Ali Rana and Zeeshan Johar – on June 15, 2004 by Ahmedabad crime branch sleuths in the outskirts of the city. After the killings, cops said the deceased were   operatives who were on their mission to kill then chief minister  .
