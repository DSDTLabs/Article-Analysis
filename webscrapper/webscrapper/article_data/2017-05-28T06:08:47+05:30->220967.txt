THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala chief minister   on Saturday wrote to prime minister   demanding that the newly imposed restrictions on cattle trade by the Centre be repealed, even as Congress and   conducted 'beef fests' across the state, cooking and eating beef in public places in symbolic defiance.

 In his letter, the CM cautioned Modi about the serious impact the decision would have on the livelihoods of millions of Indians and how it violated fundamental principles of our Constitution. “May I remind you that meat is the primary source of protein for millions of poor and ordinary people in this country, particularly Dalits,“ he said.
 
 Speaking at a public function here, senior Congress leader and former defence minister A K Antony said that the notification should be “torn to bits“ and “dumped in a dust-bin“. 
 
 Demonstrations were held outside the Secretariat where protestors cooked and distributed beef to passersby. In Kollam district, senior Congress leader Bindu Krishna said “beef delicacies will be packed and sent to head post office for delivery to Modi ji.“
 
 In Kochi, devaswom minister   joined scores of   cadres to eat bread and beef curry.
