AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat   issued a notice on Tuesday to the Border Security Forceâ€™s recruitment board, its director general, and the officer-in-charge of recruitment in response to a petition challenging the decision to scrap the recruitment process for   (tradesmen). Eighteen candidates from Gujarat, who qualified by clearing all tests last year, have filed the petition.

 After completing the process of recruitment for 561 constables from across the country, including for 28 posts from Gujarat, a decision to scrap the process was taken by authorities on the grounds that irregularities had been noticed. On January 2, the BSF issued notices to all candidates intimating them that their selection and possible appointments had been cancelled.
 
 Challenging the notices, the petitioners from Gujarat have submitted before the court that the authorities ought not to have scrapped the selection process without conducting a proper inquiry. They have also argued that since they had cleared all the tests, they were eligible candidates for the job, and quashing the recruitment process would be injustice to them. The high court has told the authorities to file their replies by February 21, when further hearing on this matter is scheduled.
