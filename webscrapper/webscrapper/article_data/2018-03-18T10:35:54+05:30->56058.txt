LUDHIANA: Allegedly blinded by the headlights of an oncoming car, a man died after he lost control over his motorcycle and rammed into another oncoming vehicle. 

 The accident took place on Sherpura Road in Jagraon on Friday night. A resident of Saleem Pura in Sidhwan Bet,   Singh (20), worked as labourer and was headed home when he met with the fatal accident. His uncle,  , was following him on another motorcycle and informed the police. 
 
 Sukhminder has told the police that they were on the   road when the accident took place. The investigating officer, assistant sub-inspector (ASI)  , said   suspected that his nephew was blinded by the head lights of oncoming traffic. “So he lost control over his motorcycle and rammed into another car,” he said.
 
 The driver of the car phoned the 108 ambulance service, following which a medical team reached the spot and took him to the civil hospital in Jagraon. Police have not registered an FIR and initiated inquest proceedings under Section 174 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). “Harpreet had died on the spot. Though attempts were made to revive him at the hospital, they went in vain,” the cop said.
