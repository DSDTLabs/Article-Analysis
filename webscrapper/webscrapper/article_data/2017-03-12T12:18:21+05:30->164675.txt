PANAJI: Former chief minister and Congress candidate from Poriem constituency,  , continues to script history by being the first Goan politician to win assembly elections for the 11th consecutive term, silencing his critics along the way. The 78-year-old Congress veteran, who began his political career in 1972, once again trounced his bete-noir BJP candidate Vishwajit Krishnarao Rane, this time by 4,066 votes.

 In an indication that the people of Poriem had reposed their faith in him, Rane pulled in 14,977 votes in the 2017 state assembly elections for which counting was held on Saturday. In comparison, Vishwajit, not to be confused with Rane’s son, pulled in 10,911 votes for BJP.
 
 The five-time chief minister has improved his vote share this time around despite political observers predicting that Rane would find it difficult to get re-elected. In the 2012 state elections in the same constituency, Rane had polled 13,772 votes, defeating rival Vishwajit by a margin of 2,547 votes, who had bagged 11,225 votes. 
 
 These numbers must be compared to the 2007 assembly election, when Rane’s winning margin was 3,736 votes. 
 
 Identified by Maharastrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) leader Dayanand Bandodkar in 1972, Rane proved his political dexterity after getting elected from Sattari and being inducted as a minister before joining the Indian National Congress in 1977.
 
 Rane served six times as chief minister of Goa - from 1980 to 1985, 1985 to 1989, for three months in 1990, from 1994 to 1999 and from June 2005 to June 2007. 
 
 Rane, as a chief minister and legislator, has been known for his principled approach. As a seasoned statesman, his soft spoken demeanor has attracted the ire of his critics who accuse him of not doing enough as the opposition leader.
 
 While his political rivals may argue that he has not done much for his constituency, Rane’s impact on Goa’s infrastructure and development is indelible.
 
 As a nascent state, it was Rane’s initiative that gave birth to the Kadamba Transport Corporation government-run bus transport system, which brought about a vast improvement in Goa’s near negligible transportation system
 
 Under Rane’s watch, several schools and colleges opened up in rural areas but his masterpiece in the education sector has to be the establishment of the Goa University.
 
 Though Goa’s industrial sector is today considered as a laggard, it was Rane who gave Goa’s manufacturing ambitions wings by setting up a number of industrial estates and industrial training institutes.
