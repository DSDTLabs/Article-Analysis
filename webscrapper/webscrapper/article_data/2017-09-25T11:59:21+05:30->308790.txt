 On Thursday, income-tax department sleuths raided several properties belonging to Siddhartha in about 25 locations across the country, including Bengaluru, Hassan, Chikkamagaluru, Chennai and Mumbai.

In Chikkamagaluru, another team carried out raids in the Coffee Day Global L imited office, two of his coffee estate offices, a residential school office and the Serai Resorts.
 
 The raids were carried out close on the heels of a similar exercise on Karnataka energy minister D K Shivakumar, a political protégé of S M Krishna, in early August.
 
 This had kicked off a political storm, with the Congress accusing the BJP-led Union government of misusing investigation agencies to target political opponents.
