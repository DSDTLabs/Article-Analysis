PATNA: The   (PMC)’s Budget for the year 2017-18 will be tabled at a special meeting of ward councillors and PMC officials at a posh hotel in the city on Saturday.

 According to sources, the   for 2017-18, like those of previous three financial years, will have a positive balance sheet. The civic body had passed a Rs 20-crore surplus Budget last year while it was a Rs 24-crore surplus Budget in 2015-16.
 
 Mayor Afzal Imam told TOI on Wednesday the PMC was of late focusing on revenue collection, especially holding tax collection. “There has not been any increase in the holding tax rate, but we have upped our target from Rs 80 crore last year to Rs 100 crore for the new financial year. That is, more houses and commercial buildings will be covered now,” he said.
 
 He said cleanliness and sanitation were also on PMC’s priority list as the common man’s expectation on these fronts had increased after Prakashotsava. “Development of parks is also on our radar,” he said.
 
 Asked if it would be a populist Budget in view of the upcoming municipal election a few months later, Imam said the Budget was prepared keeping in mind the necessities of people and not the municipal election. “Patnaites will vote on the merit and performance of their ward councillors,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, a section of ward councillors expressed displeasure over the fact that they had not been given a copy of the Budget till Wednesday evening. “Last year too we were given the copy of the Budget a day before it was tabled. We had not been able to study it properly,” ward 28 councillor   told TOI, alleging that the delay was deliberate to prevent any fault-finding exercise.
