Vadodara: A video of a group of persons consuming liquor in a Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) ward office has sparked a major controversy. A Seva Setu programme was held at the office earlier in the day to address public grievances.

 The video was reportedly recorded by a cameraman of a local video news bulletin on Saturday evening. It shows a group of persons sitting in a cabin in ward office three with soft drink and liquor bottles kept on the table. 
 
 The group members start leaving the office immediately when they realized that they were being videotaped. On being questioned by someone, one of the persons also identified himself as ward officer Damor. The election ward of opposition leader Chandrakant Shrivastava also falls under the administrative ward where the incident took place. While Shrivastava was not aware about the incident, he said that he was not surprised. “In the past, I have caught VMC personnel in drunk condition,” he said.
 
 While the incident was not reported to the police, VMC commissioner Dr Vinod Rao who was on leave also came to know about it. 
 
 “I have seen the video. I am returning to the city tomorrow and will take action,” said Rao on Saturday night.
