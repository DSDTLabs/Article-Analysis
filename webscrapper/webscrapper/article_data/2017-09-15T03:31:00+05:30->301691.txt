Panaji: With the deadline for submission of objections and suggestions under the draft Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act ( ) expiring, the department of urban development has begun to study the 30-odd submissions that various stakeholders have made.

 With just over 45 days left for ongoing real estate projects to register, the department has commenced the process to set up a dedicated website for RERA-Goa.
 
 “As of now, no builder or project has been registered, maybe they are waiting for the final rules to be notified. Work to have a website has already started and going forward we want that all registrations (by builders) will be online,” director of urban development (municipal administration), J Ashok Kumar said.
 
 Kumar added that Indian Institute of Architects - Goa, Goa Association of Realtors, CREDAI – Goa and Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry had submitted detail recommendations on the draft RERA rules.
 
 “We are now studying and compiling what we have received. The suggestions will be categorized based on various sections and will then be discussed to see if changes are required,” Kumar said. 
 
 The BJP government has extended the deadline to October 31 for ongoing projects to register with RERA.
 
  The central Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) came into effect on May 1, 2017, exactly a year after it was passed by Parliament. The RERA website along with the final RERA rules are expected to be notified by October end to facilitate online registration of projects and real estate agents without interaction with government officers.
