MUMBAI:  , who are struggling at the bottom of the   have roped in   as coach for the remaining four matches of the season, sources told TOI on Wednesday. Bruzon had to resign as assistant coach of RCD Mallorca in the Spanish Segunda Division to take the job. 

 Mumbai FC had sacked Santosh Kashyap as coach last week after 12 winless games which saw them earn a measly 10 points from 14 matches. The management wanted an experienced coach to see that the club escapes relegation this season. While former Mumbai coach David Booth and former Salgaocar manager Karim Bencherifa were in the fray , salary and visa problems made them go with Bruzon.
 
 The Spaniard is not new to the Indian   scene. He coached Sporting Goa from 2012-14 and more famously, was assistant coach of ISL team Mumbai City FC in the 20152016 season. He however quit midway through the season after reportedly falling out with then coach and former Chelsea star Nicolas Anelka. 
 
 “Oscar is a great coach. Though he was the assistant coach at Mumbai City, the team used to employ his tactics. The Mumbai FC management was willing to spare no expense to get a good coach, and they are very happy to have signed Bruzon,” the source told TOI.
 
 Bruzon began his coaching career as the U-14 and U-16 coach for Spanish team Areosa CF from 2007-09. He also nurtured talent at   club from 2009-12 as coach of the U-14 and U-16 teams. Bruzon's first game in charge will see Mumbai FC resume their I-League campaign against Churchill on April 8 at Cooperage Stadium here.
