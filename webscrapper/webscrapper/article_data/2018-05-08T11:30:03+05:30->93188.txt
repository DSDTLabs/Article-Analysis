TRICHY: Leaders from various political parties condoled the death of Krishnasamy, father of a NEET aspirant from   who died at   in Kerala on Sunday. His body was brought to Tiruvarur on Monday. 

 DMK MP   met the bereaved family at 7.30am and offered her condolences to Krishnasamy’s wife Barathi Mahadevi, daughter   and son Kasthuri Mahalingam. Later, speaking to reporters, Kanimozhi said that making education a state subject is the only solution. “The state government has mortgaged the rights of its people to the Union government and as a result students are insulted in the name of NEET,” she said.
 
 Tamil Maanila Congress leader G K Vasan also visited the family. He said that the Union government had failed to realise the pain of students in the state. “This is a classic example of mismanagement by CBSE officials, that too when candidates are appearing for such an important exam,” said Vasan. 
 
 CPM state secretary G Ramakrishnan said, “Krishnasamy would have been alive if his son was not allotted a centre outside the state.” Though the Madras high court has asked CBSE to allocate centres within  , the CBSE approached   three days before the exam and obtained a stay. The deaths are a reflection of the failure of the state government, he added. 
 
 “Be it Krishnasamy or   from  , both the parents of medical aspirants died over the hardships faced due to NEET,” claimed T Velmurugan of Tamizhaga Vazhvurimai Katchi.
 
 Officials from Life Insurance Corporation, Tiruvarur, visited the bereaved family and offered a cheque of Rs 1.36 lakh as part of Krishnasamy’s insurance policy. Krishnasamy’s last rites will be performed on Tuesday.
