NEW DELHI:   on Monday launched a special team called traffic  , who would not only help cops manage traffic on colony roads but also be invited to come up with suggestions to improve traffic management in their area.

 A team of 319 volunteers, including social activists and  , has been inducted into the team.
 
 The volunteers would also be deployed during peak hours and at night to help cops streamline traffic movement. Special commissioner (traffic) Dependra Pathak said that the mitras would be selected from among volunteers and would even help cops manage traffic on busy days. “We came up with an idea after we found that a number of people had come forward to report traffic violations or help the police in clearing traffic during peak hours,” Pathak said.
 
 In order to become a traffic mitra, a volunteer has to contact the area traffic inspector. Each inspector has been asked be asked to give a list of five people from every area who could be employed as mitras. Cops would then verify the antecedents of the person and check whether they have had any criminal case against them in the past. Once a volunteer checks out, he/she would be required to undergo a training course.
 
 After the training, the traffic mitras would be provided with a fluorescent jacket and an armband having ‘traffic mitras’ written on it. “They would not be given any statutory powers but a mitra can record a violation and alert policemen if they notice any violators,” said a senior police officer.
 
 Moreover, a traffic mitra can only be deployed if a traffic policeman is present along with them. “They cannot take control of a stretch arbitrarily and start managing the traffic,” the officer added.
 
 Each mitra can work for six months, after which the traffic inspector will have to look for a new batch. Once a person has served as a traffic mitra, he/she cannot return back to the duties.
