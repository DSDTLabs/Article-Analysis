PATNA: All’s not well in city’s Magadh Mahila College with a section of   misuse of funds by principal Dharmsheela Prasad of the Patna University’s constituent college.

 “The college is purchasing 42 new computers, paper shredder machine, sofa sets and LED bulbs for the entire campus... A sum of Rs 40,000 was spent on curtains. It’s sheer wastage of funds,” said an   to this newspaper on Monday.
 
 Principal Prasad seems to be aware of the resentment. “I can make out... A section of teachers and staff of the college, not happy with my decisions, is behind all this,” she said when contacted on Tuesday. She also kept with her a xerox copy of the letter with her.
 
 Asked for her reaction on the charges, the principal said the computers were being purchased because the computer application department’s coordinator had made a requisition for them. “The tender for the purpose was passed by the purchase committee comprising varsity officials, department teachers and others,” she said and claimed she did not play any role in it.
 
 As for other items, the principal said their purchase was decided by the advisory committee of the college. “We haven’t bought any LED bulb,” she said.
 
 Computer application department’s coordinator   nodded. “The department needs new computers for its lab as most of the existing computers are dysfunctional,” she said as she also asked for a copy of the letter.
 
 This reporter spoke to a few other teachers who, preferring anonymity, accused the college administration of apathy towards other pressing needs like recruitment of hostel staff. “At least four guards, two cooks, one sweeper and a gardener are urgently required for smooth functioning of the college’s four hostels,” said one of them.
 
 The principal said the college had already written to the university, underlining the shortage of hands in the college. “The university has to resolve this issue. The college can’t do anything in this matter,” she said.
