 produced a clinical performance to register a 3-2 win over a rather error-prone   in an entertaining   encounter on Sunday.

 At the Koramangala Indoor Stadium, the Paul Scholes-led Royals were often outplayed by his fellow Manchester United teammate and close friend  ' Mumbai but the former took advantage of the chances that came their way to alter the script.
 
 Although clearly past their prime, the famed Class of '92 stars showed glimpses of their prodigious talent. Royals opened the scoring just two minutes into the match when Scholes' run was picked out by   with a looping ball, allowing the former England international to pick his spot.
 
 Mumbai drew parity ten minutes later when Lucas Francini rode Scholes' challenge, exchanged passes with Rico Zulkarnain and slotted the ball into the bottom corner in a quick counter.
 
 Following the goal, Mumbai settled into a nice rhythm, dominating possession. The second half saw a more physical affair with quite a few tackles from both sides. Mumbai's dominance finally paid off at the end of the third period when Tairong Petchtiam won a sliding tackle and found Carlos Gonzalves.
 
 The latter, nestled near the goal, stroked it in to give them the lead.
 
 Raducio King's long range effort two minutes later got Royals back on level terms before Renzo Grasso took full advantage of a defensive lapse in the 36th minute to give the home side the victory.
 
 In the day's other match, Hernan Crespo scored a first half double to lead Chennai Singhams to a 3-2 win over Michel Salgado-led Kerala Cobras, who are yet to register a victory in the tournament.
