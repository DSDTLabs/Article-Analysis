Trichy: More than 3,000 people have expressed their willingness to participate in Trichy Corporation’s inaugural plogging event on April 22, a leisure activity that clubs fitness and civic sense.  A Swedish concept, plogging is a simple workout which can be tried by people on routine strolling or jogging. They have to carry cloth bags for collecting litter, mostly plastic waste, spotted on the roads. The collected waste can either be dumped in bins or handed over to sanitary workers during waste collection. The corporation has planned to popularise plogging in all the 65 wards by hosting the mega event to coincide with International Earth Day on Sunday (April 22). Introducing the concept in the state on April 13, the corporation had begun registration of volunteers through offline and online platforms. A week after the invite, the civic body said that more than 3,000 people had volunteered to participate. “On Sunday, plogging will be organised in all the four zones while in Srirangam zone, Cauvery riverbed will host the event. Civic body officials have been assigned in each of the 65 wards to supervise and encourage residents to sustain the activity to keep both the people and environment healthy,” Corporation Commissioner N Ravichandran told TOI.  Officials said that Google form was created and shared across social media platforms through which several people came forward. Similarly, officials also reached out to residents’ welfare associations (RWA) in the past week. With at least 3,000 people expected to participate in the pan-city event, the civic body aims at getting at least 5-10 tonnes of litter cleared from city roads. “We will sponsor gloves to pick the litter and bags to drop the collected waste. Whenever there is a slowdown in sustaining the drive, such massive event will be hosted for a revival,” the commissioner added.
