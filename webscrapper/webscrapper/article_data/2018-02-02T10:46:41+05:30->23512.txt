PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Chief minister Devendra   has sent the complaint of Shiv Sena’s Shirur MP Shivajirao Adhalrao   about irregularities in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation ( ) to the principal secretary of the urban development department for appropriate action.

 Patil said, “I have received a letter from the chief minister, dated January 25, 2018, stating that my letter has been sent to the principal secretary (urban development-2) for appropriate action.”
 
 Patil had complained about alleged irregularities in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) in the past 11 months after the BJP came to power. One of his complaints was about the civic body suffering a loss of around Rs90 crore in the contracts awarded for various road projects, worth Rs425 crore. The standing committee had approved them in December last year.
 
 Patil said, “The contractors bagging the civic projects have not changed in the past 15 years. Nor has their number. Earlier, these contractors submitted bids below 20-30% of the estimated cost. But now they are submitting bids and getting contracts at rates little below the estimated cost. As a result, the civic body will suffer a loss of Rs90 crore in these projects. So, I demanded fresh tenders for these projects and wide publicity to them so that new contractors submitted their bids. I am sure that the civic body will be able to save around Rs50-60 crore if re-tendering is conducted and new contractors submit their bids.”
 
 He added, “I have also complained about the allotment of transfer of development rights ( ) worth Rs5,300 crore flouting the rules after the BJP came to power in PCMC. The third complaint is about flouting of rules in the tender process of construction of houses for weaker sections under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.”
