MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the   on Tuesday transferred a kidnapping case to the CB-CID. The division bench, headed by justice R Subbiah, passed the order on the habeas corpus petition filed by S Thayammal of   in Sivakasi taluk in Virudhunagar district stating that her husband Seenivasan's life is in danger in the hands of former Kumilangulam panchayat president B Boopathy Rajaram.

 Thayammal's lawyer said that after destroying a tank in 2015, Boopathy tried to convert the irrigation channel into a drainage channel. "Seenivasan filed a case before the high court bench against it. The bench, on July 23, 2015, gave an interim stay restraining Boopathy from converting the irrigation channel to a drainage channel. Following it, Boopathy threatened the petitioner and her husband and asked them to withdraw the case. When the couple filed complaint, police registered a case on September 21. But there was no action," the lawyer said. 
 
 Subsequently, Seenivasan went missing from September 25, 2015. "When Thayammal lodged a complaint, M Pudupatti police on October 1 registered an FIR in man-missing case. But, they did not proceed further. It led the petitioner to file a habeas corpus petition. Following it, the police altered the FIR to kidnapping. However, the police, instead of taking action, claimed that the petitioner's husband committed suicide by jumping in front of a train. The petitioner refused to believe it. Meanwhile, Boopathy again threatened the petitioner to withdraw the case. He also put pressure on the petitioner's counsel through former member of parliament Alagarsamy of CPI and an advocate to leave the case," the lawyer said. 
 
 As Boopathy had contested in the state legislative assembly election and is an influential man, police are hesitating to take action against him, the lawyer added.
