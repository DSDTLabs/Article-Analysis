MADURAI: The Madras high court Madurai bench on Thursday directed the People’s Movement to give a fresh representation to the   police regarding its proposed public meeting to spread awareness about health hazards allegedly caused by   in that district. 

 It also directed the police to pass appropriate orders considering the representation. Justice P   passed this order on a plea filed by one Krishna Moorthy from Tuticorin.
 
 During arguments, the petitioner assured the court the organisation would abide by the condition to be imposed by the police for the meeting. Earlier, the government counsel appearing for the police said the petitioner’s organisation had in an earlier occasion breached the condition.
 
 The petitioner stated that due to functioning of Sterlite Industries situated in SIPCOT, air and ground water are getting polluted. The pollution ultimately causes number of diseases to the local people. The issue was taken to the notice of the district authorities, but there was no action from their side. 
 
 Hence, the organisation decided to spreading awareness among public by conducting a meeting and rally. When it had approached the police seeking permission to hold a public meeting at Rajaji Park near the old   building, police refused permission, the petitioner said.
