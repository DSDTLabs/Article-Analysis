CHANDIGARH: Almost two and a half years after senior Haryana bureaucrat  's name was considered for deputation at the   (PMO) by the Civil Services Board(CSB), it has now emerged that his case was never placed before the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC).

 Replying to an appeal before the before the Central Information Commission(CIC) seeking a copy of the agenda item before CSB, the Centre's Department of Personnel and Training (DOPT) has said that the matter was still pending before ACC and cannot be disclo sed under RTI. Sources however said as per rules a case cleared by CSB in July 2014, can't remain on hold for so long because Khemka was considered for PMO appointment under Centre Staffing Scheme(CSS) 2014, the period for which expired on March 31, 2015.
 
 CIC has now directed the Centre to provide a copy of the agenda along with minutes of the meeting of the CSB on Khemka's appointment. In its January18 order, the CIC bench headed by information commissioner Sudhir Bhargava set a deadline of four weeks for DOPT. The orders have come after DOPT rejected his application to provide the details.
 
 Many had expected Khemka to get a prominent posting in the central government after BJP used the land deal in Gurgaon between Robert Vadra's firm and DLF ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections as an "example of the Congress's misrule". In 2013, Khemka had cancelled the mutation of the land deal due to irregularities.
 
 However, even under BJP, he has not been given a central deputation and frequently transferred by the state government. He was appointed transport commissioner in December 2014, after the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP government took over. But he was shifted within 126 days after he raised issues related to overloading of transport vehicles. He was posted back to archeology and museum department, seen as a punishment posting. In April 2016, he became principal secretary, science and technology department.
