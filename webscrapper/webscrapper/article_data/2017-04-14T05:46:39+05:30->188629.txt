PANAJI: With the completion of the swearing-in of all the cabinet ministers, chief minister Manohar   on Thursday got down to business, visiting key departments to take stock of several major projects.

 With a lot riding for the government’s development plank, Parrikar made it a point to step into the office of the public works department (PWD) and   (GSIDC) to get a close look at the major infrastructure projects under way in the state, sources said.
 
 PWD officials said the chief minister made an unannounced stop at their office, sending everyone scrambling to get their presentations in order. Parrikar is learnt to have sought a detailed explanation of all the road-widening projects currently on in the state, especially work that is on the national highways. 
 
 In his budget speech for 2017-18, Parrikar had increased the PWD’s budget allocation by 40%, to a total allocation of Rs 1,900 crore.
 
 Reliable sources said the chief minister also made inquiries about bottlenecks or delays in clearance of certain approvals. “He asked supervising officers to ensure that projects were completed as per schedule, especially water supply proposals, some of which have been delayed for several months,” a source said.
 
 Parrikar went on to make a quick stop at the GSIDC office in Patto. Among the key issues he gave his attention to was the third Mandovi bridge. Sources said the former defence minister questioned the corporation’s officials about certain delays in land acquisition and also offered to get other departments to grant the necessary approvals that were being withheld.
 
 Discussions about the progress of the   district hospital also came up during the brief, 35-minute meeting.
