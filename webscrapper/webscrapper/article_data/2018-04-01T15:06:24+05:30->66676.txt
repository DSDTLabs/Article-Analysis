Make up artist   has put up a poignant post about her encounter with actor  , behind the scenes of the upcoming film  .

 "When I saw 'Marykutty (Jayasurya) today, I cried. Usually Jayasurya is someone who makes a ruckus on the set. But the one I saw today was a soft and sober Marykutty," Renju writes. "I was able to see many of us in Marykutty. Society will call us Marykutty, but with pride, we will answer, 'yes, we are Marykutty'. Chandupottu was a film which featured a feminine man, not a transgender. This will be a real story of a transgender. Let's wait for the film..."
 
 Not much has been revealed about the   movie except that it will see Jayasurya as a woman.
