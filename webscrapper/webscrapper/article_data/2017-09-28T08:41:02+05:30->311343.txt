JAIPUR: Chief minister   is planning to establish an international university for differently abled persons.

 Raje said that they are in talks with an international university for a university while addressing a   campaign for the differently abled programme in Jaipur on Wednesday.
 
 “It is the collective responsibility of the state to create an able ecosystem for them (disabled) to flourish,” said Raje. The state has a disabled population of 16 lakh under several categories, including seeing, hearing, mental illness, speech, mental retardation etc.
 
 Ironically, the state doesn’t have a single divyang-friendly school or a college which caters to all kinds of disabilities. The absence of facilities either deters parents from sending their wards to the school or they themselves drop out from the school. This is the reason that 44% half of the disabled children in the age group of 5-19 years are not attending any educational institute. The percentage of Divyang population not attending educational institutes in Rajasthan is more than the national average of 39%, says Census report 2011. There has been a demand by the students to create dedicated colleges for disabled

Experts believe that a university will provide these students equal opportunities to study.   also promised to She also said the state government will provide insurance, tricycles and jobs to 25,000 grade-3 teachers soon. However, similar promises of recruitment were also made in the past. Raje mentioned   para-athlete   as someone who will inspire the generations to come.
