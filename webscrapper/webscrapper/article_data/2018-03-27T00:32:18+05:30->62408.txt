Krishnagiri: A two-month-old elephant calf that fell into a pit near Hosur in Krishnagiri district on Monday was rescued by forest and rescue services personnel after two hours of ordeal. The forest officials were trying to reunite the calf with its mother. According to the forest officials, two elephants and the calf came to a lake in Naiyakkanapalli village near Hosur to drink water on early Monday morning. “After drinking water, the elephants were returning towards Podur forest range. The calf suddenly fell into a 5ft pit that was dug to lay pipelines to take water from the lake,” a forest official said.  “The calf got trapped in the pit and could not move. The adult elephants tried to pull the calf, but failed. When the villagers saw this, they informed us,” the official added. After reaching the spot the forest officials and fire and rescue services personnel chased the adult elephants, probably calf’s parents, back into the forest. “We widened the pit around the calf and rescued it after two hours,” said the official.  Later the forest officials brought the calf to Podur forest area and searched for its mother. They said they would leave the calf with its mother and monitor their movements.
