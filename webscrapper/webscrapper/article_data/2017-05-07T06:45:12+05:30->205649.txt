The entrance area of Sarkarwada, the   that houses the office of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), has been invaded by hawkers. Their number has astonishingly increased to more than 10, even as the ASI urged the civic administration to resolve the issue. 

  Moreover, the vendors have moved to the first few steps of the structure making it difficult for visitors and   to enter the place. 
 
 The ASI has decided to send another reminder to the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) in a day or two.
 
 Apart from the inconvenience caused by the encroachments, the heritage building is facing a perennial issue of the hawkers damaging the exterior walls by punching nails for their makeshift stalls and taking up space on the steps of the building.
 
 Sarkarwada is a state protected monument that houses the state archaeology department but the NMC has failed to resolve the problem of encroachment near the walls of the historic  .
 
 “We had allowed the vendors to sit on either side of the entrance on humanitarian grounds. Slowly, one or two vendors started encroaching on to the steps. From the side of the steps they moved to the centre and the number of hawkers also started increasing. 
 
 Now, they have occupied the entire stretch of the last few steps, which makes it difficult for us to reach up. We have to ask them to give us place to move so that we can enter our own office,” said assistant director of department of archaeology, Maharashtra,  
 
 The officials had spoken to the NMC regarding the same about a year ago. “We will remind the civic body once again. Plus, we will also have to cut two trees that are dangerous and can topple down during the monsoon. A DP box of the electricity board here also keeps having short circuits,” Gharpure added.
 
 Deputy municipal commissioner of NMC,   said, “We will look into the matter of hawkers. But, they keep coming back even after evicting them.”
