 “Flex boards and posters informing people about the dangers of   and the penalties attached with the same are being put up at about 140 locations around the railway stations in the Pune division. There is a helpline number (182), which people can call on register complaints about such incidents. We would like to appeal to the people to come forward and register complaints if they came across such incidents, even if they were not hurt,” the official said, adding that they will be tie-up with non-governmental organisations to carry out the sensitization drive.
 
 “It is not only about awareness. Whenever a complaint is received, our officials visit the spot where the incident occurred. Seeing the men in uniform visiting the area always acts as a deterrent. Most of those involved in such acts are teenagers and children and their parents are told about the implications of the such acts,” the official added.
 
 The Pune division records an average of six to seven cases of stone pelting in trains in a month. “The most common place in the division where this menace occurs is between Pune and Lonavla. There are slums on the route and people from the areas indulge in such activities. The trains targeted are mainly the local suburban trains which have no doors,” a senior official told TOI.
