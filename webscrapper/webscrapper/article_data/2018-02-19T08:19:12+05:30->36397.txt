Six days after the brutal murder of   leader Shuhaib, allegedly by   activists, chief minister   finally assured an impartial inquiry into the crime. 

 "Impartial probe will be conducted. Whoever the culprits and whatever their political affiliations, the probe won't be influenced. Police will go ahead with stern action and all culprits will be arrested", the CM said in a statement issued late on Sunday night.
