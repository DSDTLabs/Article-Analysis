GURUGRAM: It’s been nearly a month since the Environment Pollution Control Authority ( ) asked Delhi, Haryana, UP and Rajasthan to submit an action plan to implement Centre’s graded response system to tackle different levels of pollution. 

 While Delhi has already submitted its action plan, none of the other states has even begun work on the project.
 
 According to sources in EPCA, the delay in submission of the action plan by the other states would end up causing further delay in preparing a comprehensive anti-pollution action plan for India.
 
 “The Delhi authorities have updated its 2012 action plan and submitted it to the authority. But the   (HSPCB) is yet to file it. We will only be able to prepare a comprehensive action plan for all the states to keep pollution levels under control if all the states submit their respective report at the earliest,” said a member of EPCA, seeking anonymity.
 
 Officials in the state pollution control board, however, remain clueless. “Our head office in Panchkula will send the plan to the EPCA. However, we have not yet got any direction from the higher authorities yet,” said an official from HSPCB. 
 
 Delhi’s AQI has remained better than Gurgaon’s in the recent past. According to Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) report, AQI in Gurgaon was reported at 337 (‘very poor’) on Thursday. It was 288 (‘poor’) in Delhi. While ‘poor’ level can cause breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure, ‘very poor’ AQI can lead to respiratory illnesses on prolonged exposure.
 
 The graded response system is a first-of-its-kind initiative in the country, which envisages rolling out emergency measures once air pollution levels go up.
