MANGALURU: The Congress which has taken up the pain suffered by the common man due to demonetisation with its ‘Jana vedana’ campaign, will intensify it further. While party workers will hold protest meets in front of RBI offices across India on January 18, it will take up a campaign from January 20 to February 23 to hold grassroots interactive meetings to learn firsthand the travails of people, said Ivan D’Souza, chief whip of the government in the state legislative council.

 Addressing reporters here on Saturday, Ivan while demanding that the government remove all restrictions on cash withdrawals and bring it to pre-November 8 status, said the   is shying away from answering five questions posed to it by   Rahul Gandhi on demonetisation. “It has been 64 days since the government demonetized high value currency and still there are no concrete solutions to problems caused by the unplanned move,” he said.
 
 The situation in rural parts is worse with ATMs either having notes of Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 denomination or no notes at all. “Even if people get notes of Rs 2,000 denomination, they cannot get change for it as banks and people do not have currency notes of smaller denomination including Rs 100 and Rs 50,” he said. Bank employees have staged protests demanding that RBI provide them with adequate cash of lower denominations to tide over the crisis, he said.
 
 Decrying the move to freeze bank accounts opened prior to November 8 on grounds that they are not KYC compliant or for want of PAN or Aadhar cards, Ivan said this is bad in law. The Union government must waive off all farm loans, not charge interest on unpaid loans, ensure ATMs have adequate currency, compensate women from BPL families for the hardships suffered by them and double the wages paid under MGNREGA to people utilizing the same, Ivan added.
