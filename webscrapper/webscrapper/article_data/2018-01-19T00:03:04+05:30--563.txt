Kochi: Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), on Thursday, conducted raids at the residences of top officials at   Ltd in Thiruvananthapuram, Kottayam and Bengaluru in connection with alleged corruption that happened while exporting iron ore in 2007-2008. CBI had registered a case against HLL officers, including its former chairman and current adviser M Ayyappan, a few months ago.

 Raids were held at the residences of M Ayyappan, Suresh Kumar (former marketing director), B Chandrasekharan (former finance director), senior executive director (finance) Sathyavageeswaran, senior VP (procurement and consulting division) S Girish Kumar, deputy manager (procurement and consulting division) AP Hari Prasad and Rajesh Narayanan CEO of Ms Rama Shipping Service, Bengaluru. They are the accused in the case. 
 
 “Details of at least Rs 2.5 crore deposited as fixed deposit with various banks in Thiruvananthapuram was recovered in the raid held at Ayyappan’s home in Thiruvananthapuram. He has around 12 bank accounts and details about the amount deposited in these accounts were also collected,” said an officer. 
 
 The agency said that the accused entered into criminal conspiracy with the shipping company during 2007-2008. HLL released Rs 2 crore in advance fraudulently to the shipping company under the pretext of procurement of iron ore for mercantile export without obtaining bank guarantee. Also, no deliberations or correspondences were made with the buyer before entering into an agreement with the shipping firm, said sources. 
 
 In the agreement, it was said that Rama Shipping Service should furnish bank guarantee as security for the advance paid by HLL instead two crossed cheques worth Rs 2 crore was provided by the shipping company. This violated existing norms.
 
 The cheques were presented on May 2008, but both were returned unpaid due to insufficient funds in the account of the shipping firm. The amount released to the company hence could not be realized.
