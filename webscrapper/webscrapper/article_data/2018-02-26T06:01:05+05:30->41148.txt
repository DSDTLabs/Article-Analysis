CHENNAI: Less than half the   caring for critically-ill patients in intensive care units knew the appropriate selection of antibiotics and how to manage infections, found a   by the Infectious Diseases Educational Foundation ( ) done at the city, ahead of a continuing medical education programme.

 Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest emerging problems worldwide, which often impacts patient outcomes leading to increased stay in hospitals, use of expensive drugs or death. Studies published in several leading journals show that up to 50% of antibiotic use is either unnecessary or inappropriate. “Rationing use is a necessary first step to curb antibiotic resistance,” said infectious diseases expert Dr V Ramasubramanian, who now holds courses for doctors and post-graduate students in the city. In April 2017, the Indian Council of Medical Research – the apex medical body, had advised tertiary care hospitals to avoid at least three antibiotics used to treat multi-drug resistance. The antibiotic stewardship initiative said Carbapenems, Polymyxin and Colistin should be kept in a “low-use” zone and used only as the last resort in critically-ill patients. The initiative urged hospitals to form committees that approve prescriptions containing these drugs.
 
 Although hospitals have drafted internal guidelines, experts say doing that alone won’t be enough. The survey, for instance, to assess knowledge concerning antibiotic resistance and prescribing drugs, showed that only 50% of the intensivists knew the choice of appropriate antibiotic. Dr Madhumitha, who is a co-course director for IDEF, says sessions on judicious use of antibiotics seems to be the need of the hour. “The post-course survey pushed knowledge up to 95%,” she said.
