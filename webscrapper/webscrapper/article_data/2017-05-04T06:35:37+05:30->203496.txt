The Centre will monitor sanction and disbursement of loans through the portal. The ministry asked banks to upload their loan schemes on VLP .
 
 Banks must include a link to VLP on their websites through which all educational loan applications must be uploaded after August 15 and before September 30.
 
 Minister of state for finance & corporate affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal issued the directives in response to recommendations by city-based Education Loan Task Force (ELTF).
