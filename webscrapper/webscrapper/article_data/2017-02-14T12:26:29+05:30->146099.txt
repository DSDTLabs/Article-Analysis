PATNA: Sandeep Das has become the first person from Bihar to join the league of a few extraordinary Indians who have won the prestigious Grammy. The noted tabla player on Sunday won the Grammy for his collaboration with Yo-Yo Ma’s Silk Road Ensemble ‘Sing Me Home’, a fusion of Indian classical and world music.

 Sandeep’s elder brother   said this was the third time that his younger brother was nominated for the Grammys in his professional career of over 25 years. Sandeep was born at Jamadoba in Dhanbad district in Jharkhand, which then a part of Bihar. 
 
 Sandeep completed his schooling from St Xavier High School, Patna, and graduated in English Literature with gold medal from Banaras Hindu University. Later, he moved to Delhi to pursue his professional goals but kept visiting Patna. 
 
 “He has a passion for music and tabla since his childhood days. Our father used to get complaints about his tapping the desk in school classes, which disturbed other students. When the teachers stopped him, he used to tap his feet,” said Gautam. 
 
 Overwhelmed by the success of his disciple, Pandit Shiv Kumar could not control his emotions on getting the news and talking to Sandeep over phone. “I still remember when Sandeep’s father brought him to me when he was just eight. He asked me if Sandeep could become a good tabla player. I was surprised by the way he played tabla on the very first day in 1978,” he recalled. 
 
 “Later, on my advice, Sandeep moved to Banaras and became a disciple of my guru  ,” said Pt Kumar, adding, “He is in regular touch with me even now and whenever he has some queries, he calls me. Today also, he called to seek my blessings.”
 
 Shishir Sinha, his friend from Patna, recalled how Mithu (Sandeep’s nickname) used to practice tabla while most of them played. “He was very focused and dedicated and his achievement has made everyone proud as he is the first person from Bihar to achieve such a feat,” Sinha said.
