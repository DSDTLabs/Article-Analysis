Chennai: Algorithm-based trading platform STREAK has bagged funding of Rs 2.25 crore from Rainmatter, the fund and incubator managed by broking startup Zerodha. STREAK was founded in August 2017 by Harsha Manohar, Vipul Divyanshu and Jayalakshmi Manohar. “Streak is the first end-to-end platform on which traders can create trading algorithms, without coding. They can back-test these algorithms on historical market data to check the profitability of the algorithm and deploy them live in the markets,” said Manohar.Algo trading in NSE has taken mainstage with over 40% cash market orders being executed by algorithms as of December 2017. Over the past few months, several firms like 5Paisa, a unit of IIFL, Master Trust, SMC Global Securities and Upstox (formerly RKSV Securities) have started offering algorithm trading facilities for retail clients. Nithin Kamath, founder & CEO, Zerodha/Rainmatter said, “It’s not just India but even globally, I haven’t come across something this simple for non-programmers. The user can easily execute the trade within a minute.” STREAK has a back testing engine that generates metrics for multiple stocks in a minute. The results include maximum gains, maximum loss, average gain/winning trade, average loss/losing trade, maximum drawdown and more. These metrics give traders a comprehensive idea of their algorithm’s performance. The startup also offers bots that track stock movements for trade signals and sends one click actionable alerts to take action when the strategy conditions are met. STREAK is an extension to Kite, Zerodha’s trading platform. All orders are placed through Zerodha and orders will reflect in Kite order book and positions as well. “We are focussing on Indian markets at the moment but very easily we can make it available for other stock markets,” said Manohar. STREAK’s proprietary technology is patent pending.
