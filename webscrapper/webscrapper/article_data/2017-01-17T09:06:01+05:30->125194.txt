HYDERABAD:   braved all odds to rescue 20 people stuck inside a multi-storied   that caught fire on Monday morning.

 Rao, who was on bandobust duty , was alerted by locals. He immediately rushed to the spot, but soon realised the daunting task he faced as the fire that began on the first floor had by then reached the second.
 
 “When the fire broke out, residents on higher floors started moving upstairs instead of coming down. I had to run after them to bring them down,“ he told TOI. “There were also many aged inside the building who were not that agile. When I heard them  , I rushed to their flats and started pulling them out. After that I began carrying them downstairs to safety ,“ he added. Ayesha Rubina, the area corporator, said: “Fortunately , the constable moved the gas cylinders in the kitchen. By doing so he saved a few more dozen lives of people living in buildings around it.“
 
 Rao, who joined the force in 2009, was recently transferred to Humayun Nagar police stattion from Chatrinaka. His heroics also caught the eye of municipal administration and urban development minister K Tarak Rama Rao, who took to twitter urging   to recognise his brave act. In his tweet KTR said: “Great Job Bheem Rao Garu @TelanganaDGP should recognise his brave act (sic).“
