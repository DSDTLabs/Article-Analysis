HYDERABAD: The   on Wednesday directed the   (ED) and the companies whose assets have been attached by the ED in the YS   disproportionate assets case to approach the appellate tribunal for resolution of the issue.

 The court gave this directive after the ED assured that it would not dispossess the Jagan firms of their immovable assets till the appellate authority takes a decision under the Prevention of   Act ( ). Earlier, the Jagan firms had stated that the ED was trying to dispossess them despite a restraint order from the high court.
 
 The ED had attached the assets on the charge that they were proceeds of crime g enerated in the Bharati Cements case. According to the probe agency , they were illegally acquired by these firms when YS Rajasekhara Reddy was AP's chief minister through doling out public assets to various private persons and industries who in turn gave bribes in the form of investments in the Jagan firms.
 
 Justice A   heard the pleas of Bharati Cements and other firms associated with the Jagan assets case which challenged the attempts of the ED in giving them notices to take physical possession of their assets despite an order contrary to that from the high court.
 
 The judge recorded the assurance given by ED joint director Umashankar Goud that the agency would not dispossess the Jagan firms of their assets till the pronouncement of judgment by the appellate tribunal under PMLA and directed both parties to resolve their issues before the tribunal. “I am leaving open all the issues raised by the petitioner and they can be adjudicated later at an appropriate time,“ the judge said while disposing of the pleas of the petitioner firms.
