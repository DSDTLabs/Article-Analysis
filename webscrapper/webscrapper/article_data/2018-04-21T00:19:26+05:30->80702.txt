Madurai: Collector K Veera Raghava Rao, who presided over the farmers' grievance redressal meeting, instructed panchayat and local body officials to take stringent action against people using motors illegally to draw more water when it is supplied to households. 

 The local bodies other than Madurai city supply 55 litres per capita per day to the people from local sources as well as the Vaigai dam. Illegal drawing of water would thwart the efforts taken to provide water to the people in this raging summer, the collector pointed out. 
 
 The drinking water situation however remained safe this year as reservoirs had better storage compared to previous year. The storage level at Mullaperiyar dam was 1,409 mcft at present compared to 911 mcft the previous year. Similarly Vaigai dam level was 684 mcft as against the precariously low 168 mcft this day last year, the collector said. He assured that there will be no drinking water crisis. However, there should not be any complacency on the drinking water supply and every leak in any pipeline should be fixed within a day. 
 
 Similarly, people drawing more water should be dealt with sternly. Last year, 5,000 pumps used by the public were confiscated during raids. Local bodies should initiate similar raids this year and take action against people drawing water illegally, the collector said.
