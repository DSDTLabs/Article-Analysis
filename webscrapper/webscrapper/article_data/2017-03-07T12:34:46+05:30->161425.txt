HYDERABAD: While the number of   taking to the wheel continue to be a small fraction compared to men, the number of women showing interest in driving light and heavy commercial vehicles is on a rise. As per figures from the RTO authorities,18 women received driving licenses for transport vehicles in 2014, the number rose to 45 in 2016. Also, the ones going for heavy transport vehicles has gone up from just one in 2014 to 9 last year.

 The interest, however, has not translated into more women 'professional drivers'. More women are opting to be trainers at driving schools and supervise test drives at vehicle showrooms.
 
 In the last three years, the city witnessed 99 women drivers holding licenses to drive transport vehicles while there are 18 others who can drive buses, trucks and trailers. Nevertheless, the actual number of women joining the tribe of 'professional drivers' remains low. As per RTO authorities, less than 25 per cent of these women might actually be driving on the roads. “ Among the 10 women drivers who started operating at the   airport, only four or five are continuing,“ said  , joint transport commissioner, Hyderabad.
 
 “I obtained a driver's license for a transport vehicle six months back but I don't want to drive myself. The idea is to train more women and then set up a cab service,“ admitted one such driver with a professional driver's license. A possible reason for the women not turning into 'professional drivers' could be lack of coordination among those who hold these licenses and discouragement. “There are around 10 women professional drivers in the city . We invited them to join our association but the response has not been encouraging. That could be a reason why their numbers are not increasing,“ pointed out  , president of Telangana Cabs Drivers and Owners Association.
