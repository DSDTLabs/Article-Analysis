SHILLONG: The   (PDF), a   in  , aiming at   and   into reality was on Friday formally launched.

 The PDF is the fifth regional political party to be launched here after the United Democratic Party (UDP), the Hill State People Democratic Party (HSPDP), the Khun Hynniewtrep National Awakening Movement (KHNAM) and the Garo National Council (GNC).
 
 Addressing newsmen, PDF president, Ivanlum Marbaniang, said that the party had also completed the process of registering with the Election Commission of India and was waiting for the final approval.
 
 He said the EC, as per its guidelines, will provide a list of symbols and if necessary, the party can also propose its own symbol.
 
 Marbaniang was a former leader of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) before he, along with like-minded friends, decided to form the PDF which will also contest the 2018 elections.
 
 Party secretary Auspicious L Mawphlang said, "The party aims at translating the people's aspirations into reality. It would identify and tap all resources to promote all round development in the state."
 
 Mawphlang said the people are craving for change due to the lack of policies for the welfare of the farmers, youths, traditional institutions and blamed the ruling congress for the mess.
 
 "We aim to bring clear cut policies which will address the various issues concerning the different strata of people in the state," he said.
 
 The PDF is closely linked with the Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council chief Pynshngain N Syiem, a legislator from Mawsynram, who was suspended from the Congress.
 
 Although the PDF leaders denied any link, the present members are mostly from the 'Campaign for Change' platform used by Syiem.
 
 Syiem also heads a coalition executive committee at the Council with a similar name, the Peoples' Democratic Front.
