A month-long strike by the Kerala   Federation that paused Mollywood releases since Dec 16 has now been called off by the organisation's head Liberty Basheer. New movies will reportedly hit theatres from Jan 20 onwards. 

 It's widely reported that Chief Minister  's criticism for prolonging a one-sided strike coupled with the new committee of theatre owners formed by   and other members led to the   being called off. A meeting has been convened to discuss the formation and functioning of the new organisation of theatre owners.
 
 The next few weeks would see the release of  's Jomonte Suviseshangal, Prithviraj's Ezra, Mohanlal's Munthirivallikal Thalirkumbol and Jayasurya's Fukri.
