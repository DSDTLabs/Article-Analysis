MUMBAI: Despite a forecast of heavy rain, the intensity of showers reduced on Wednesday as compared to the previous two days. The IMD has now forecast intermittent rain for Thursday and Friday as well.

 The rainfall recorded in the 12-hour period on Wednesday (8.30am-8.30pm) by the   observatory was 16.4mm and by the Santacruz observatory was 14mm. 
 
 “Neighbouring areas like Thane, Palghar and Raigad may witness more intense rains as compared to the city over the next two days. At present, the offshore trough, which runs from the Maharashtra coast to Kerala coast, is giving the city good rains. Besides, there is also an upper air cyclonic circulation over Kutch and the neighbouring regions,” said a weather official from the IMD’s Mumbai bureau. 
 
 Between Tuesday and Wednesday, the suburbs witnessed significant showers—Kandivli (W) recorded 149.20mm, Goregaon 67.20mm and Malad 93.80 mm. The rainfall recorded by the IMD   observatory during the period was 49.8mm and IMD Santacruz observatory was 79.3mm. Since June 1, total rainfall recorded by the IMD Colaba observatory has been 887.1mm and IMD Santa Cruz observatory 1,184.1mm. The rainfall recorded by the Colaba observatory is 154.7mm below average while it is 122.6mm above average in case of Santacruz. 
 
 While catchment areas received more rainfall as compared to the city and its suburbs over the past two days, the intensity of showers over lakes was not so significant on Wednesday. Except for Vihar, which received over 100mm rain, the other six lakes that provide water to the city witnessed rainfall below 100mm. The seven lakes have already received 73.15% of the total rainfall required to ensure round-the-year water supply for Mumbai. The seven lakes that supply potable water need to have 14.4 lakh million litres by September 30 so that there are no water cuts throughout the year.
