KOLHAPUR: The   of Maharashtra State Electric Distribution Company Limited ( ) has not received any response from the   for its one   launched on October 20, 2016. Sources in the company blamed the low remuneration for the poor response form villages.

 The MSEDCL had launched one village-one electric man scheme to maintain electric supply, meter reading, distributing, power bills, and maintenance of street light in October 2016. As per the government resolution (GR), gram panchayats had instructed to publish the advertisement for the post and scheme is applicable to villages whose population is up to 3,000.
 
 As per the GR, company is liable to pay a remuneration to the electric man, but the company has not received any response from the villages.
 
 Jitendra Sonavane, acting chief engineer of Kolhapur zone, said “The company have informed all the villages under its jurisdiction about the scheme. Even our engineers have taken meetings of sarpnachs in the last three months. It is the responsibility of village local body to publish advertisement in local new papers. It is a good opportunity for unemployed youths in villages to apply for the posts.”
 
 He added, “The company will pay an amount whichever is less — Rs 9 per customer or Rs 3,000 for a village. We will train the selected youths and deploy them in their villages. But we have not received any application.”
 
 However, sources in the company said, “The job profile is hard and the amount of remuneration is meagre compared to the work condition. Therefore, people are not interested in applying for the job.”
 
 A sarpanch in Karveer taluka also agreed to this. He said, “The job is risky and not permanent. There is no job security and remuneration is too low, so the youths are not ready to apply for the job.”
