VADODARA: The city police on Friday denied claims of the girl being being raped by two persons in the   but lodged an offence of loot after taking her and her friend’s statement. 

  police said that the girl and her friend, who had gone to   compound on the evening of May 7 to celebrate her birthday, told the cops that she was not raped. However, her friend Hiten Dabhi, 19, has registered a complaint of loot with Raopura police station.
 
 “We recorded the statements of the girl and her friend who were in Navlakhi. They have said that the claims of gang rape were wrong. When we asked the girl if she was sexually assaulted, the girl retorted and and instead asked that who told us about such a thing. We also talked with her parents who confirmed that the girl wasn’t raped,” said a senior police official.
 
 “But our investigation revealed that three persons did approach the duo and looted them when they were hanging out in Navlakhi. The accused identified themselves as security guards and got into heated arguments with the duo. They then snatched two mobile phones, a chain and some cash from the boy. We have begun search operations to track them down,” the official, who was involved in the investigations, added.
 
 The cops had gone into a tizzy on Wednesday after the claims of the girl being gang-raped in Navlakhi began doing rounds. A social worker had contacted the Raopura police following which the girl and her friend too went to the police station on Wednesday evening. “We took the boy to Navlakhi and asked him about the spot where they were sitting in Navlakhi. The boy couldn’t identity the spot. The boy and girl’s statements too were not concurrent with each other. Also, the girl wasn’t ready to file complaint on Wednesday,” the official said.
 
 “We couldn’t take their statements on Thursday as they both were not in the city. On Friday, we called them and took detailed statements,” the official said.
