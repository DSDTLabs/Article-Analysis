MUMBAI: A career counsellor who left in an auto a bag with Rs 1 lakh and students' results got it back within five hours, thanks to quick thinking and action by the Tilak Nagar police.

 Dipesh Dedhia, 42, had boarded an auto from   station and was headed for his office around 1.20pm last Tuesday. “I usually carry just one bag, but that day I had two. I was answering a phone call when I walked into my office and immediately realized the other bag was still in the auto. I ran back, but the auto had left,” Dedhia told TOI. The bag contained fees given by his students and their career counselling results. Dedhia went back to the auto stand at the station. There, after learning about   cameras along the stretch from drivers, he went to the Tilak Nagar police station. “Along with a constable, I sat and viewed the footage. I saw the auto I had boarded, but its registration number wasn't very clear. Inspector   asked me to click pictures of the footage on my cellphone. Then we headed for   (LTT), which is a hub of autos and has a traffic police desk,” said Dedhia.
 
 
  
 The traffic police use hand-held e-pads to key in a vehicle's number and check if the owner had been challaned before. “We suggested that officers look up a combination of digits that appeared closest to the auto's number plate. They keyed in the digits and found a car and an auto in their database. The auto had the same design engraved on its cover as the vehicle Dedhia had boarded,” said Thube. It was found that the auto had been challaned a couple of times in the past.
 
 With the confirmed registration number, Dedhia and constable   went to the Wadala RTO. Thube had given Ghuge a brief letter requesting RTO officials to part with the address of the auto’s owner. Finally, Ghuge and Dedhia reached a chawl in  . “Ghuge dialled the owner’s number. He agreed to call up his driver, who then met us,” Dedhia said. “I got the bag back by 5.45pm.”
