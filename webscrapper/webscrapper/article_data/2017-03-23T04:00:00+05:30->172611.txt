Ahmedabad: Lawyers of the Ahmedabad Criminal Court Bar Association at the metropolitan court in Gheekanta have decided to burn an effigy of Bar Council of India (BCI) chairman  , over his suggestions to the law commission on how to rein in protesting advocates.

 The Bar Association will stage a demonstration at the metropolitan court on Thursday, against Mishra’s suggestion of strict action against advocates who participate in protests against the judiciary. He recommended that such lawyers be punished by cancelling their license to practice law.
 
 This suggestion has not gone down well with the Bar, which announced it would burn an effigy of Mishra along with copies of his suggestions to the law commission.
 
 Bar’s president B M Gupta said the protest will be in line with demonstrations by members of the Delhi District Court Bar Association at the court premises as well as in front of Mishra’s house.
