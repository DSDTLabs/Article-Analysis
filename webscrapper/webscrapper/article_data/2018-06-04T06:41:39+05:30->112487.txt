PANCHKULA: A tyre burst made a sports utility vehicle (SUV) overturn three times on the   road on Sunday morning, killing a 32-year-old judge and an advocate and injuring one person.

 Sahil   was posted in the   subdivision as civil judge (junior division) on April 1, 2016, after his training in the Chandigarh Judicial Academy.
 
 Yadav, who was driving the vehicle, was returning to Naraingarh from Chandigarh with advocates Rajan   of Shehzadpur and   of Naraingarh. When they reached near   village, the front right tyre of the vehicle (Toyota Fortuner) burst around 10.30am, said local residents. The vehicle spun out of control, overturned and veered off the road. 
 
 Gupta died on the spot. Both Yadav and Singh were rushed to civil hospital in Naraingarh, from where they were referred to PGI, Chandigarh. Yadav succumbed to his injuries, while Singh is struggling for his life. Yadav had got married to a lecturer recently. Gupta, former Naraingarh Bar Association president, is survived by his wife and two kids, aged 16 and 12 years old.
 
 Naraingarh deputy superintendent of police Rajbir Singh said, “Preliminary investigation has revealed that the driver lost control over the SUV after the tyre burst and it overturned three times before coming to a halt. Post-mortem of the victims has been conducted and their bodies handed over to family members.”
 
 Ambala superintendent of police Abhishek Jorwal said, “I cannot confirm it as a case of negligence driving. We will examine the accident site. Local residents helped to take the victims to hospital.”
 
 Residents said Gupta was pulled out dead and it took them while to extricate Yadav and Singh from the vehicle as they were badly stuck in the SUV.
