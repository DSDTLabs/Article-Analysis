CHANDIGARH: The Haryana government has reconstituted the special task force (STF) to fight organized crimes, seven years after a similar team was disbanded by the then CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led Congress government in March 2010. 

 According to sources in the BJP government, incidents of gangwars, especially killings of gangsters outside or around the court premises, forced the government to again set up the STF, which would be headquartered in Gurgaon. 
 
 Law and order and crime were the major issues taken up by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar during the three-day 'Chintan Shivir' (brainstorming session) of Haryana MLAs and bureaucrats held at a resort in Parwanoo, Himachal Pradesh last month.
 
 Inspector general of police (IGP) Saurabh Singh will be heading the STF which will have officers of the rank of superintendent of police (SP), deputy superintendent of police (DSP), inspectors and supporting staff.
 
 Additional director general of police (headquarters) P K Aggarwal said the team would be an extended support to the local police, especially in curbing drug trade, illicit weapons and gang wars. 
 
 "This team has been constituted with the notified standard operating procedure (SOP) and every action will be properly documented. Our focus will be the drug peddlers, suppliers of illicit weapons and gangs having inter-state ramifications. The officers and non-gazetted officers in the STF have been picked on the basis of their service records and competence," said Aggarwal.
 
 He said the team would be based in Gurugram. "We are compiling the data of other districts as well. If required, we will add more members and set their bases in the other districts," the ADGP said.
 
 The previous STF was disbanded after 10 of its members, including an additional SP, were arrested on charges of extortion. They were caught on camera at a jeweller's shop in Panipat demanding money.
