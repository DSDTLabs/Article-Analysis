Madurai: Diet goes a long way in maintaining good   during  , say doctors. Not only elders but it would be better for everyone to avoid spicy and oily food during hot days and drink plenty of fluids. Geriatrician Dr N Raja says that, “idly, rice, porridge and idiyappam’’, are the most suited food items to have during the day.

  alone would not suffice to maintain the fluids and electrolytes in the body. Adequate amount of drinks including lime juice with salt and sugar, tender coconut water and butter milk suit the body. Elders should ensure that they consumed at least two litres of fluid per day.
 
 Going out in the afternoons without umbrellas is a strict no-no. Before going on their morning and evening walks they should consume adequate amount of water as elders tend to avoid water to avoid frequent urination. However, lack of adequate water could lead to urinary tract infection.
 
 Clothing also plays an important role in maintaining body temperature during summer. Loose-fitting clothes of light coloured cotton is the best suited. Synthetic fibres should be avoided. Eating fast food and food cooked outside should also be best avoided, say doctors.
