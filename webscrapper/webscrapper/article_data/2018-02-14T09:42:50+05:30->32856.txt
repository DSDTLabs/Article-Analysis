GUWAHATI: Elaborate arrangements have been made for Maha   celebration in the   with efforts put in place for the cleanliness of Umananda island and other temple premises which are thronged by thousands of devotees on the day. 

 "We have been trying our best to make arrangements to help devotees and visitors. I have also instructed some officials to keep an eye on the movement of visitors near the river bank. It is advisable to leave the island before 4:30 pm to avoid any kind of untoward incident," Angamuthu said. "I have asked GMC to take steps to ensure that Umananda remains the cleanest place in the city. To prevent the use of plastic, concerned departments have been asked to supply sufficient paper bags and paper cups," he added. 
 
 Previous years have recorded several deaths with people having accidentally fallen into the river from Umananda island. Besides Umananda, Bhimeswar Dham, Sukreswar temple and Basistha temple are some of the other popular places where devotees assemble on Shivaratri. 
 
 Strict action will also be taken against people consuming alcoholic drinks and other tobacco products inside the temple premises, stated a press release issued last week. The inland water transport department has arranged at least 10 ferries to carry the devotees and visitors to Umananda temple. "We have designated two ghats - Umananada ghat at Uzanbazar and the one at Fancy Bazar - for ferries to operate. Ten ferries, by government authorities and designated private operators, will be there. The river police, SDRF and NDRF will handle river security," Angamuthu said.
