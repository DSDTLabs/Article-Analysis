 ‘Chal Mohan Ranga’ charts the journey of Mohan Ranga, who thirsts to get a Visa to the US and settle there. He falls in love with Megha and while everything seems hunky dory, they both don’t see eye to eye after a while. While Mohan Ranga remains heartbroken, Megha is sure of their decision to split up. However, if fate has other plans for them or not, forms the crux of the tale.
 
 The film’s quirky trailer and music have been received well, with the song ‘Pedda Puli’ and ‘Miami’ seemingly setting the tone for the film. The former is a Telangana folk song tweaked and rebooted by SS Thaman to suit the protagonist’s journey. The song’s so loved; it was even appreciated by Akon during its release. The latter is a typical, peppy Thaman-esque song that stands out even in the trailer. 
 
 
 
 Trivikram Srinivas was so impressed with Krishna Chaitanya’s debut ‘Rowdy Fellow’ that he roped him in for this project. While Trivikram penned the story, Krishna Chaitanya wrote the script for it. Shot in US, Ooty and other parts of India extensively, the film seems to be a light-hearted commercial entertainer, judging by the trailer. The dialogue Mohan Ranga utters in the trailer, “Meeto problem ide andi, meere pattukuntaru, meere velipomantaru,” has also become a hit with fans.
