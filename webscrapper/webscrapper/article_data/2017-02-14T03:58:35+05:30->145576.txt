NEW DELHI: The income tax (I-T) department on Monday said 7.4 lakh   with Rs 5 lakh or more deposited during the   drive had been confirmed with taxpayers coming forward with details regarding an additional 25,000 bank accounts.

 Last month, as part of ‘Operation Clean Money’, the tax department had put out details related to 18 lakh accounts involving deposits of close to Rs 4.2 lakh crore between November 9 and December 30 for electronic verification.
 
 “Out of the 7.41 lakh accounts confirmed by 5.27 lakh taxpayers (till Sunday), the cash deposit amount has been confirmed in more than 99.5% cases,” the finance ministry said in a statement.
 
 There are at least 4.84 lakh taxpayers, who are not registered on the I-T department’s e-filing portal, who have now being approached through SMS with the deadline for verification extended by five days until Wednesday.
 
 The government, however, said it was positive given the additional disclosures.
 
 “The department is encouraged to note that taxpayers have increased the cash deposit amount in nearly 90,000 accounts and provided details of additional 25,000 bank accounts in which cash was deposited. 
 
 The explanation of cash deposits submitted by the taxpayers is being analysed in the context of nature of business and business profile in the earlier returns of the taxpayer,” the ministry said.
 
 The I-T department is focusing on catching the ‘big fish’ which sought to convert unaccounted cash by depositing it in bank accounts. While a fresh disclosure scheme has been put in place, it is hoping that data mining will help it net evaders and expand the tax base.
