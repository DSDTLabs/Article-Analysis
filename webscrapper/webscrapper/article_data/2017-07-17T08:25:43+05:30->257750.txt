CHANDIGARH: Development has two faces in Chandigarh — the north and the south, felt most   who participated in a TOI roundtable at the   here on Sunday.

 They said the divide between the north and the south of Chandigarh was visible to all and the administration should chalk out a plan to keep this balanced. They said while northern sectors were developed on the lines of the design by LeCorbusier, the administration hardly showed any concern for southern sectors.
 
 The vice-president of residents’ body Foswac, Hitesh Puri, said residents’ welfare associations had been raising this issue for years, but southern sectors were still ignored by authorities. “All sectors south of line from Panjab University to Sector 28, or the Udyog Path, have been ignored. Even though southern sectors have a higher density of population, there are fewer civic amenities there. To lessen the pressure on south, the administration should work out a plan through which there is equal development,” he said.
 
 City industrialist Sandeep Sahni said the administration had been giving an excuse, for the past few years, that Chandigarh’s infrastructure was not enough to provide all kind of services to residents. “What has the administration done get past this? The assurance of providing 24x7 water supply is only on papers. It has to work out a plan to through which development across the city can be done rather focusing on specific area in Chandigarh,” he added.
