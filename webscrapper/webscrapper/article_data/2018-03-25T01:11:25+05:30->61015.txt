 “After they had me at gunpoint, they threatened my friends too. They then opened the drawer and took the money. When I resisted they hit me on my head with the pistol butt and fled with cash and car keys of the two people who were in my office,” Kumar said in his complaint.
 
 On the complaint of the property dealer, an FIR was registered against three unidentified accused under sections 392 (robbery), 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing  ) of IPC and sections 25-54-59 of Arms Act at Bajghera police station.
