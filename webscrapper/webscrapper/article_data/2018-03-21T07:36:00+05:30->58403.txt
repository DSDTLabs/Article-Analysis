Amritsar: Most of the 27 Punjabi men had got employment in Mosul after paying anything between Rs 1.10 lakh and Rs 2.25 lakh to travel agents for arranging a job and for travel expenses.

 Relatives of all the men that TOI contacted on Tuesday confirmed they had paid more than Rs 1 lakh for visa and travel arrangements.
 
 Federation of Indian Manpower Councils and Association director Anil Yadav told TOI that travel agents in general prefer sending Indian youth on a visitor’s visa to Dubai, from where their local handlers arrange for their onward journey to Iraq or any other destination.
 
 In Dubai, if there is a large group of people travelling onward to areas in West Asia, then many companies arrange for a charter plane to fly them from Dubai.
 
 Travel from India to Iraq was banned between 2004 and 2010.
 
 Most of the 27 Punjabi men killed by the Islamic State had gone to Iraq about a year or so before their abduction in 2014. It is believed that they directly flew to Iraq since there was no ban on traveling to Iraq after 2010.
 
 “By using a visitor’s visa, travel agent does not bear any responsibility for the person concerned. However, if a person goes on an employment visa, then the agent’s name also figures on the document,” Yadav said.
