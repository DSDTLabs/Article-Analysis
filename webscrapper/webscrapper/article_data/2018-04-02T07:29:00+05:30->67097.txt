Noida: Over a hundered buyers from Amrapali Heart Beat City staged a   against the builder for delayed construction and non-delivery at the project's Sector 107 site. The residents claimed they organized the protest to mark the day as they have been ‘hoodwinked by the builders’. 

 “We have been fooled by the builder. We have been representing our project before Noida Authority since 2016 for rationing the responsibility of the three stake-holding companies who are partners in developing the project to complete and deliver our flats. About 2,100 flats were sold in 2011 and were to be delivered by 2014. But till now, nothing has been done. Last year tripartite meetings were held between builders, buyers and authority – but nothing came of those meetings. To us it was simply a cosmetic cover-up of the problems,” Puneet Parashar, member of Heartbeat City Buyers’ Association, said.
 
 Parashar further added that the buyers now demand a delivery of the apartments by 2019. “None of the apartments are complete. There is a slow-paced construction visible on site, but we don’t think that is enough for completing the project on time.”
 
 Comments from the builders were not available.
