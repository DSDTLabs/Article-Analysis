BHOPAL: The   (CBSE) has withdrawn its circular regarding psychometric test to be conducted on school staff after the   school murder case. In the aftermath of the murder of Class 2 student in a   last year, the   had released a set of guidelines to ensure safety of children in its affiliated schools. The board had directed the schools to put all the staff through a psychometric evaluation. 

 However seven months after the Gurugram school murder case, the board has withdrawn both the circulars regarding extensive guidelines in connection with the safety of schoolchildren. "The additional measures mentioned in CBSE circular dated 12/09/2017 have been adequately covered in the guidelines of   and NDMA. The schools are therefore required to comply with the guidelines contained NCPCR and   guidelines," the circular issued by board secretary Anurag Tripathi said.
 
 The circular clearly mentions that in the light of comprehensive guidelines issued by NCPCR and NDMA, "there is no requirement at present to issue any further guidelines and accordingly circular no 21/2017 dated 28/09/2017 is hereby withdrawn."
 
  Secretary Madhya Pradesh Parents Association Prabodh Pandaya said, "It is shocking. Psychometric test had given parents a hope to see safety for their children. Now that board has withdrawn the circulars, no school is going to take NDMA, NCPCR guidelines seriously." 
 
 Pandaya said that the CBSE's decision of making psychometric test mandatory was hailed as a milestone decision. However, "its withdrawal speaks volumes about how serious the board is about the safety of students."
 
  Meanwhile, CBSE did not publish the amended circular vide number 5/2018 dated March 27 on its home page, and rather choose to upload it in its affiliation section of circulars.
