HYDERABAD: Registering  ,   will soon become easier with 21civil society organisations launching a citizens’ entitlements campaign, in Hyderabad and Secunderabad, on January 26.

 Volunteers from all 21 organisations will cover 1,000 colonies and localities in the twin cities spread over 100 wards. “We will distribute one lakh pamphlets with details and phone numbers of depts where people can register complaints.   will also be made aware of apps and social media platforms where they can raise concerns,” said S  , director, Association for Promoting Social Action.
 
 “Through this, we will escalate issues to higher authorities to ensure complaints are resolved in a time-bound manner with accountability,” said BT Srinivasan, general secretary of United Federation of Residential Welfare Associations.
