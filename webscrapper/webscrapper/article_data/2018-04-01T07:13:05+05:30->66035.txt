PUNE : Day temperatures have breached the 40°C-mark at almost half the locations in the state. The   (IMD) weather data revealed that as many as 14 Met stations in the state — out of 29 — witnessed the day temperature either touching 40°C or crossing that mark on Friday. On Saturday, 13 stations recorded similar readings.

 On Saturday, the Met department also predicted   conditions in parts of   on April 1.
 
 Though the mercury is rising across the country, weather stations in   have recorded unusually high temperatures. The readings here have been higher than even in New Delhi and several spots in northwest India, which are traditionally known to be hotter than Maharashtra. For instance, New Delhi’s temperature on Friday was 36.2°C, while   in Pune touched 38.6°C and   recorded 40.1°C. In the state, the temperature at this time of the year is usually around the 36°C-mark.
 
 AK Srivastava, the head of the climate monitoring and analysis group at IMD, Pune, told TOI that an anticyclone over Gujarat, Rajasthan and adjoining Maharashtra is keeping temperatures high in the state.
 
 “Warm easterly winds are currently prevailing over southern Maharashtra, while the anticyclone has resulted in clear skies, which is causing the day temperature to shoot up. Also, the anticyclone tends to trap the warm air in the lower levels of the atmosphere, keeping the temperature high,” he said.
