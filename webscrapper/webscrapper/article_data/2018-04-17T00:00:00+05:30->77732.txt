When we look at the electorate, there are three different sets of people. The first are those who say ‘I want change and I will be the change’. They are the ones who join the system and try to do some work. The second group of people are those that are simply not bothered, because they think that the system is so bad that nothing can change and have given up. The third group, which is the majority, want to do something and can’t keep quiet, but do not have the necessary inclination or bandwidth to do the same. The second and third group can make a huge difference by coming out in big numbers and voting. 
The biggest pride of India is that it is a democracy. If you want to see change in the process or the system, the route to that is through your vote. A lot of people tell everyone that the future of the country lies in your own hands; I say that is wrong. The future of the country lies in your voting finger. This one vote can not only be a reason to implement the right change for five years, but for generations to come. One needs to understand the importance of this vote and not look at it as just another duty.
 When you go to vote, you must not look at the list of nominees the previous night or that morning and cast your vote randomly. This is a multiple choice question that determines the future of a nation and you must study diligently. I’d say that you must begin right from the time the list of candidates are announced. Once this is done, you need to choose your candidate based on three major points. The first is understanding the principles that he/she stands for. Second, look at his/her intentions. Third, and the most important, is to understand his/her efficiency, because you need someone who is a doer and can put his/her intentions into action. If the urban voter understands this process well, you are securing the future.
