HYDERABAD: A day after a school boy was beaten up by cops in  , child right activists said most cases of corporal punishment go unreported due to absence of strong laws.

  (NCPCR) guidelines against corporal punishment state that the school staff member should be suspended immediately if a complaint of corporal punishment is filed during the investigation period.
 
 “After the parent's complaint, headmaster will first enquire and report it to mandal education officer, who will then report it to district education officer,“ said Varsha Bhargavi, advisor to   (TSCRPF).
 
 TSCRPF was dissolved in February and the government has failed to constitute a fresh commission till date.
 
 “During my tenure, we suspended over six teachers involved in corporal punishment between 2015 and 2016.Now, most cases go unreported, due to the standard procedure and hierarchy of officials, who fail to take these cases seriously,“ said Achyuta Rao, former member of SCPCR and child rights activist.
 
 Activists say in rural parts of the state and city outskirts many students face corporal punishment, but their parents, who are unaware of the crime, fail to address the issue.
 
 SCPCR, in 2017 till February, has managed to file 23 cases against school staff for physically and mentally harassing children in and around the city. But after the commission was dissolved, not many cases are reported. “We have seen instances where teachers or school authorities have mentally harassed students. But parents are unaware that this is a crime and school management can be held accountable,“ said   from Hyderabad School Parents Association.
