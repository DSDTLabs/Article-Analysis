VISAKHAPATNAM: The increasing pollution levels in the port city is likely to be discussed at the TDP Mahanadu, with party leaders urging the high command to come up with a solution. The annual plenary sessions will be conducted at AU Engineering College Grounds from May 27 to 29. 

 “The problem faced by the people due to the pollution will be one of the topics to be discuss at the Mahanadu,” urban TDP president and Visakha South MLA   told TOI. 
 
 NGO   had filed a PIL in March 2005 following which the   (NGT) had directed VPT and the AP Pollution Control Board (APPCB) to check air pollution and bring it under control by the end of 2018. The tribunal had also asked the port trust to submit quarterly reports so that they can check if pollution levels are under the permissible parameters. Large-scale pollution caused by the coal stored in Visakhapatnam Port Trust (VPT) premises has been a major threat to not only the residents of Old Town, but also other parts of the city since many years. Scores of people have developed bronchitis, skin diseases and irritation of cornea and even lost their lives due to the high levels of pollution. Data collected by the NGO states that there were 60 deaths from 2011 to 2013 due to high levels of pollution. The TDP leaders are planning to utilise the Mahanadu to come up with a solution and win the trust of the people, sources said. Construction of residential structures are also declining in   due to pollution. “Even the people are gradually shifting to outskirt areas like Pendurthy, Vepagunta, Chinna Mushidiwada, Madhurawada, PM Palem, Kommadi, Marikavalasa and even Paradesipalem where several realty projects are coming up,” said a senior town planning officer of GVMC. “Every praja darbar conducted in the constituency on Tuesday has been receiving many complaints about the increasing pollution levels,” the MLA said, adding the problem should be solved immediately, else people will loose confidence on people’s representatives.
