VADODARA: The proposal by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation ( ) administration to impose equal taxes for bot properties that are   out as well as those occupied by owners themselves has come under the scanner of the standing committee of the civic body. The proposal was made in the draft budget presented on Wednesday.

 The VMC commissioner had proposed that the rate of general property tax be raised from Rs 16 to Rs 18 per square meter for   properties and from Rs 30 to Rs 32 for   properties. While this was on expected lines, what seems to have surprised the elected wing are the manner in which the multiplier for calculating tax has been tweaked.
 
 The multiplier has been pegged at 1.25 for all types of properties be it residential, non-residential, rented or self-occupied. Earlier, the multiplier for   residential properties was one while that for rented ones was 1.5. Similarly it was one for self-occupied non-residential properties and two for rented ones.
 
 Sources in the standing committee said that the multiplier for non-residential properties, in particular, had raised eyebrows. The standing committee has sought more clarifications and justifications for doing so. According to members of the panel, it was brought to their attention that renting out spaces at malls and commercial complexes was a lucrative business.
