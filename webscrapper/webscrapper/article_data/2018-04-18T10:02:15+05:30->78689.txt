CHENNAI: The worst fears of   conservationists, who had been disapproving of the ‘rescue’ methods employed by forest officials to net about two dozen spotted   near  , came true when a female deer was hit by a vehicle. 

 The animal, fleeing the ‘rescuers’, died on the spot. The incident occurred on   on Tuesday evening.
 
 A senior wildlife official told TOI that since morning the ‘operation deer drive’ was on in the   compound. 
 
 There were only a half a dozen of them left in the premises. In order to trap them and translocate them, ‘rescuers’ had driven the animals to a portion of the vast premises. However, two spotted deer — a sub-adult male and a female of about eight years old — scaled the wall of the DLF premises and jumped on to the road.
 
 While the sub adult male ran to the opposite side of the DLF premises across the road, the female was hit by a truck coming that way. The male deer is yet to be traced and rescued. The carcass of the femal deer was taken to the wildlife headquarters range office in a vehicle. The lorry and its driver were taken to the wildlife range (headquarters) office in Velacherry. They will be released once they remit the fine amount.
 
 The spotted deer are covered under Schedule III of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. Whoever is injuring or killing the animal by way of accident too have to pay a penalty up to Rs 15,000.
 
 Now there are four more deer are left in the DLF premises and they have to be trapped and rescued, said officials.
