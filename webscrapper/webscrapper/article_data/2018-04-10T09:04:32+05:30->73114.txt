It will take a year to complete the skywalk, after financial arrangements are made," HMRL managing director NVS Reddy told TOI. 
 
 Officials said Nuzevid Seeds Limited and Hyderabad Cricket Association have come forward to provide financial assistance. The municipal administration department had also held preliminary discussions with HCA office bearers.
