NEW DELHI : Expect snarls around   flyover for the next few days as PWD began the   work for a damaged joint on Monday. Police sources said that as per the diversion plan, vehicles coming from Noida would be diverted to Barapullah   to reduce the volume of vehicles on the Ring Road.

 
  
 
 According to an estimate, over three lakh vehicles cross the stretch between DND and Lajpat Nagar daily. Sources said that as per the plan, vehicles going towards Lajpat Nagar from Ashram would be diverted under Lajpat Nagar flyover. Heavy vehicles coming from Lajpat Nagar would be asked to go below the flyover and merge with incoming traffic from Ashram.
 
 DCP (southern range) Vijay   said that they expect traffic on the stretch to be heavy from Tuesday due to the restrictions. “We have requested commuters to plan their journey in advance if they are travelling on the stretch. Roads might be blocked at some point of time for movement of construction equipment’s,” Singh added.
 
 Cops expect the stretch of Ring Road between Barapullah loop and   to be congested too, because of the excess volume of vehicles.
