MUMBAI: The   on Tuesday asked the state government what it was doing to raise awareness about the use of sanitary pads and to make these accessible with   rates.

 “This is a very important issue,” said a bench headed by Justice Naresh Patil, who directed the government to reply to a public interest litigation (PIL) which seeks to exempt sanitary napkins from 12% goods and services tax GST.
 
 Filed by the Shetty Women Welfare Foundation, the PIL said only 12% of menstruating women are able to afford sanitary napkins in the country.
