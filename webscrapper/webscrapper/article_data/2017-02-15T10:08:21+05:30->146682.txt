KANPUR:   Raj Babbar said on Tuesday that how could a person be loyal to his country who was not loyal to his wife and family? 

 Addressing a rally in Bather village of Bhagwantnagar assembly seat in Unnao district, Babbar while making a scathing attack against Prime Minister   said, "Modi wants to win UP election by vitiating communal harmony in UP but the people of the state will not let it happen. He appealed to the people to vote for all SP-Congress candidates contesting election in Unnao district." 
 
 He said while contesting Lok Sabha election from Varanasi, Modi said that he came here because Ganga Maa had called him to contest from this place. 
 
 "But all of you know and even have seen what he has done for Ganga in almost three years of his regime", Babar asked.
 
 Describing BJP MP Yogi Adityanath as a 'missile', he asked the people, "Do not make a mistake by pressing the button symbol of this party." 
 
 He said that development of   was possible only with the coalition government. "Now since hand and cycle are together, therefore, cycle will run faster on roads", he said.
