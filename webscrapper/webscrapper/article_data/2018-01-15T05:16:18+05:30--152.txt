PATNA: Bengaluru-based civil engineer Krishna Mohan Tiwary (42) was shot dead near   village under the   police station in   district on Saturday night.

 He was returning on a bike from his relative’s house at Mashrakh when bike-borne criminals shot him at close range, Taraiya police station SHO Ajay Kumar Singh quoted villagers as saying.
 
 “Tiwary was a project engineer with a construction firm in Bengaluru. He had reached his native   village under the   police station area in Saran on January 8 to attend the last rites of one of his relatives and was likely to return to Bengaluru after Sunday. He had a sound financial background,” the SHO told   over the phone.
 
 The SHO said personal enmity seemed to be the reason behind his murder as no attempt was made to loot the deceased. The deceased was married twice. “He first got married in 1996 and has a 17-year-old daughter. The estranged wife along with her daughter lives at   in  . He again got married in 2010 with a girl from Madhopur village under Mashrakh block and had a son and a daughter from his second wife,” the SHO said. An FIR was lodged against unknown persons on the complaint of his younger brother Munna Tiwary.
 
 The SHO said one .315 bore pellet was found in his body in post mortem. Tiwary was rushed to a private hospital but was declared brought dead.
