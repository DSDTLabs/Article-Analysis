LUCKNOW:   chief   on Saturday said despite the recent electoral debacle, her party continues to remain BJP’s main opponent. Presiding over a review meeting of party functionaries in the state capital on Saturday, Mayawati claimed people in large numbers were getting associated with the BSP’s missionary movement to challenge the might of   and the RSS.

 “The electoral defeats have not dampened the spirits of our party supporters, in fact, they are all the more adamant in attaining the masterkey to power,” said Mayawati in a statement. She added that people of all castes and communities felt cheated in 2014 Lok Sabha elections and again in 2017 UP assembly elections. 
 
 The former   said the country never witnessed atmosphere of hatred, fear and animosity for such a long period like in the ruling BJP government. “It is only to hide its failure in the ill-planned demonetisation and now implementation of GST without preparation that BJP government at Centre is coming up with one issue or the other like ‘Gauraksha’, terrorism, Kashmir, tension on the border,” said Mayawati. Likewise, she said, people of UP felt cheated as the Yogi Adityanath government failed to fulfil promises made during UP assembly elections. Mayawati said the recent spate of crime and a poor law and order situation reflected the misrule of BJP in the state.
 
 The BSP chief said that the `casteist' political parties like the BJP had earlier opposed the ideology of BR Ambedkar and were now trying to divide the country on caste and communal lines. Mayawati also accused the RSS of using government machinery and power in carrying out its casteist, communal and violent agenda. ``And its target is especially the BSP,'' the BSP president said. ``However, the party would not bow to the pressures and conspiracies hatched against it. The missionary movement of the BSP will surely yield desired results in the days to come,'' she said.
