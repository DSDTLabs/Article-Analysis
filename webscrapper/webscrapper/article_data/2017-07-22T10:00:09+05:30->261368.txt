PATNA: The bickering among the ruling partners in Bihar continued on Friday with JD (U) spokesperson Ajay Alok targeting  , saying it could not pursue secularism while being a party to corruption.

 Ajay fired the salvo against 
  a day after its MLC Dilip Choudhary had ridiculed JD(U) spokespersons for seeking explanation from RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav’s son Tejashwi Yadav over allegations that the deputy CM had acquired benami property.
 
 “Congress can’t fight the battle of secularism against fascist forces while being a party to corruption. Why is Congress silent on the issue when serious corruption charges have been levelled against Tejashwi? It is not necessary that only JD(U) should speak against corruption,” Ajay told TOI.
 
 Reiterating JD(U)’s demand that 
  clarify on charges of corruption against him after the CBI FIR, Ajay said: “Political values are dropping sharply due to corruption charges against politicians and young politicians (Tejashwi) are aggravating such perception by not giving proper explanation to the people, even though FIR loaded with serious charges has been lodged against him.”
