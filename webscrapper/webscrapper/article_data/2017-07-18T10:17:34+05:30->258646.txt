The script by RD   will have PC Sreeram handling the cinematography, which will be the second project for Raja and PC after Remo. Giving us details about this project, Prabhu says, “We will begin shooting for the film by January end, next year, as   is held up with a few   projects. It will be a fun romantic entertainer and we will likely shoot in and around Chennai and in some rural areas of Tamil Nadu. We are really glad that PC sir has agreed to be a part of the project.

 Talking about his association with Raja, Prabhu says, “Raja and I go back a long way. We have been discussing about films and collaborating even before we were in the field of cinema. We first worked together in the serial, Kana Kaanum Kaalangal, where the basic idea was arrived at by both of us. We later did a movie together in Malayalam called Dhoore, with Ananya in the lead. I even directed a promotional song for Remo, Sirikkathey with Anirudh, Sivakarthikeyan and  . We are really excited about doing a full-length feature together in Tamil.”
