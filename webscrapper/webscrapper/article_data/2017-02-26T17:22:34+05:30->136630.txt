We had earlier reported that   will be playing an important role in P T Kunju Muhammed's upcoming film Viswasapoorvam Mansoor. 

 However, the latest we learn is that Shweta will be opting out of the film owing to date clashes, and will be replaced by Zareena Wahab. 'Shweta had date clashes with one of her films and I wasn't able to change the dates of my movie either,' says P T Kunju Muhammed. 'Zareena Wahab will be playing her part in the film. She has acted in many Malayalam films and she was happy to be part of the project.'
 
 The film speaks about a particular social issue, and revolves around its women characters. 'It will be about two women 'mother and daughter ' who escape from a riot and reach Kerala. Zareena will be playing the mother while Prayaga Martin is the daughter.'
 
 Meanwhile, Tamil actress   who was earlier cast in the film has also opted out owing to her personal commitments. '  will be playing Gautami's part, that of Roshan Mathew's mother. Leona Lishoy also has an important role in the movie,' says the director. The film's shoot will start shoot on the 24th of this month, at Thalasserry.
