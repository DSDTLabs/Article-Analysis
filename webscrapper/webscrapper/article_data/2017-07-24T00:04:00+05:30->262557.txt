 has pulled off a casting coup of sorts by bringing together two Tolly biggies in his next,  . Though it’s well known that   is playing the lead in the airborne drama, CT has learnt that   is making a special appearance as Dev’s father in a recap from the latter’s childhood. Revealing that   was in Mumbai earlier this week to shoot for the film, a source close to the unit told us, “Bumbada (Prosenjit) agreed to make this special appearance because shares a warm relationship with Dev and he shot in Mumbai for a day on Tuesday. Dev is so happy that he agreed to be part of the film despite his 
busy schedule.” The source told us the actor makes an appearance in a flashback when Dev remembers what his father told him in his childhood. “Dev, who plays a pilot in the film, remembers his father’s words while making an emergency landing. So, Bumbada’s character appears at a crucial point in the film,” he added.
 We, however, couldn’t reach Prosenjit for comment despite calling him several times.
