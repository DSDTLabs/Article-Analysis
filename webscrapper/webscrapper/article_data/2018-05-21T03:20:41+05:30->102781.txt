NEW DELHI: The railways plans to serve only vegetarian food on its premises, stations and on trains on October 2 to celebrate 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. 

 The national transporter also plans to appeal to all its employees to eat vegetarian food on that day. 
 
  The idea is to observe October 2 as 'Vegetarian Day' as mark of respect to Mahatma Gandhi, India's most famous ambassador for vegetarianism. Along with observing 'Vegetarian Day', the railways has prepared an elaborate blueprint like running special trains, tickets bearing watermark of Mahatma Gandhi among others to contribute its bit when the Modi government kicks off special commemoration of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. 
 
 However, the plans are subject to approval from the culture ministry which is the nodal ministry for the special commemoration.
 
 A senior official said the railway board has proposed that no non-vegetarian food will be served to passengers on railway premises on October 2 in 2018, 2019 and 2020 during the years of celebration.
 
 Plans to run a 'special salt rake' from Sabarmati on March 12 to commemorate the Dandi March and 'Swachhata Express' trains from Sabarmati to various stations connected with the 'Father of the Nation' have also been worked out. These also include thematic painting of all stations connected with Gandhiji and setting up of digital museums, depicting significant activities undertaken by him. 
 
  Stations at all divisional headquarters and their various administrative buildings and those of zonal headquarters may have murals of Gandhiji. A special logo designed by culture ministry is likely to be displayed outside train coaches near the doorway where seat numbers are displayed, so that it can be seen by the public.
