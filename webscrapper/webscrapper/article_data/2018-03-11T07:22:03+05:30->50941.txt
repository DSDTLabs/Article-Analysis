THANE: A day after the Thane crime branch put the spotlight on Nawazuddin  , whose lawyer is reported to have sourced the call records of the actors wife, the actor took to social media exclaiming ‘disgust’ at the accusations.

 Siddiqui, on Saturday, tweeted, “Last evening, I was helping my daughter with a school project. This morning I went to her school for her Project Exhibition. To my surprise, the media had questions about some random allegations on me #Disgust,” the actor said and also uploaded few pictures from the activity with his daughter.
 
 DCP (crime)  , on Friday, said   was summoned for investigation, but he did not turn up after issuing notices.
 
 Sources said that the actor is likely to turn up at the Thane crime branch soon to record his statement. A police official said that it was from the WhatsApp chats of arrested private detective Prashant Palekar, Abhishek Nagargoje and Jigar Makwana that they got to know that the actor’s lawyer Rizwan Siddique had sought the CDR of Nawazuddins’ wife.
 
 Sources said that the trio might have sourced the CDR of his wife from cyber crime expert Ajinkya Nagargoje or his source who is a police constable and who was arrested in the case. They may have hacked into the official email-id of Yavatmal SP under the pretext of making their website.
 
 “If the actor claims that he has not done anything wrong he can come down to the crime branch and record his statement and clear the things rather than justifying anything on social media,” said a police official.
 
 Meanwhile, the actors wife took to   and said, “Just because Nawazuddin is a celebrity, he is ‘being made a soft target."
