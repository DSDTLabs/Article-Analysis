NEW DELHI:   after it was  , the   is   to see yet another   come and go. A perennial “white elephant project” of north corporation, this six-lane “grade separator” has been touted as a solution to traffic woes on the stretch between Pusa Road and ISBT Kashmere Gate.

 Having seen five deadline extensions in just one year, the flyover will not open even this month. Officials involved with the project said even though 95% of the work was complete and the basic structure was “almost ready”, the civic body was facing technical problems in laying road over the freshly laid heavy segments. “We may see a delay of another 3-4 months,” a senior official said.
 
  
 Over the last two decades, the project has seen innumerable hurdles, ranging from land acquisition, court stays and multiplicity of agencies to shifting of services of DJB and BSES.
 
 During this period, the project cost has escalated from Rs 177 crore to Rs 825 crore — at last count. Conceived in 1998, the flyover was commissioned by the erstwhile MCD in 2006. When TOI visited the site, it saw construction material and connecting blocks strwen all over the place. The horticulture department of the corporation, however, has started beautification work at some points. Ravi Sharma, a shopkeeper near Azad Market, said despite all the fanfare, project was far from complete. “In another three months, monsoon will arrive and the project will get delayed further,” he said.
 
 Many shopkeepers said they were forced to use plastic sheets to ward off dust. That, they said, was the least of their worries. The massive traffic jams on the stretch was a big headache, though, they claimed. 
 
 Mayor Preety Agarwal conceded that there could be a delay of a couple of months. “A large chunk of the project has been completed in my tenure. I am taking daily updates. As the engineers have said it may not be safe to open the flyover due to the solidification process, we are thinking of allowing lighter vehicles first.”
