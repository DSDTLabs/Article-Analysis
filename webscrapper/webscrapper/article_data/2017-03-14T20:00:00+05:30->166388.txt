 But, the moment women speak-up about such incidences, they are trolled, slut-shamed and blamed for doing it for publicity. Be it an ex-employee alleging sexual harassment by the boss or a student getting rape-threats for voicing her mind or girls being slut-shamed for posting party pics, such instances only bring out the hypocrisy of the society towards women who report harassment, something that’s still considered taboo. 
 
 Because, apparently, ‘ye sab toh hota rehta hai’ and ‘achhe ghar ki ladkiyan aise kaam nahi karti’ or even better – ‘zaroor tumne hi kuch kiya hoga, warna woh ladka aisa kuch kar hi nahi sakta’. We bring to you a few such recent cases where women who dared to voice their thoughts, were targetted.
 
 
 A girl who used to work for a web entertainment portal, wrote about how she suffered harassment at the hands of the portal’s founder   for two years. Soon, similar allegations were levelled against Arunabh by other women, some ex-employees and some acquaintances. While many, including Aligarh’s writer Apurva Asrani and comedienne Aditi Mittal, supported the anonymous post, the number of people calling the girl’s post a ‘publicity stunt’ were more in number. Add to it Arunabh’s statement to a publication which said, “I am a heterosexual, single man and when I find a woman sexy, I tell her she’s sexy. I compliment women. Is that wrong?”
 
 
 
 
 When Gurmehar Kaur, a student who lost her father to war, tries making a sound statement, social media pokes fun at her and even issues rape threats. Ultimately, Gurmehar has to retract her opinion after severe backlash from trolls. 
 
 
 
 
 The first day of 2017 started on a horrible note after reports of mass-molestation of girls in Bengaluru surfaced. The police couldn’t take action because no one has filed a report yet. But that didn’t stop political leaders and the general public from targetting the girls instead of focusing on taking action against the perpetrators.
 
 
 
 
 Meghna Singh, a DU student who attended a college fest recently, returned home only to find semen stains on her jeans. She recounted the incident through a social media post which read, ‘Concerts are for people to show their love for the person performing on stage and letting some part of their dream come true. While some people just cannot contain the excitement and feel the urge to jerk off right in the middle of the crowd, feel up your butt and just vanish in thin air. I came back home so happy and tipsy on KK’s pyaare songs only to find this. Mard hogaya aaj toh yeh banda, ekdum mard. Thanks mardo, thanks!’ (sic). Again, some came out in support but others found the traumatising experience hilarious. There were comments asking her to get a chemical analysis done on the stains because they could well be ‘shrikhand’ or ‘chuna’ stains.
 
 
 
 A couple of days ago, when a city-based IT professional and her younger sister were walking home, the elder sister noticed a man staring at her sister’s chest. She gave a fitting reply by staring at the man’s crotch and even posted the incident online. Soon after, ‘sanskari’ comments started pouring in.

 A 26-year-old IT professional who jumped in to save her sister from pervert stares recently, shares, “According to the people I’m surrounded by, it is not right for a woman to voice her opinion in public. People are calling me mean, negative, anti-men and what not. Some even went to the extent of calling me a lesbian, as if that’s a cuss word! When I asked some of these so-called friends, what positivity can a girl, who was a victim of child abuse or rape, get from hearing and reading about such comments, they thought I was speaking from personal experience and even pestered me in a sympathetic tone to reveal the details of my abuse. No one got the rhetoric.”

 Rucha Satoor, a volunteer working towards reclaiming public places for women, says, “An accused is judged based on his/her socio-economic status. So, an accused from the top management, for example, ‘can’t be wrong’, according to the society. By doing this, what kind of examples are we setting? Rather than blaming the victim, there is a need of people who say ‘I understand your situation and what can I do to support you’.”
 
 
 
 While   and blaming the victim happens online, in some cases, the authorities go out of their way to take cognizance of such cases. Vidula Sonagra, a city-based woman who suffered harassment at the Pune Railway Station, has different story to tell when it comes to reporting issues. The support from the police and the lawyer during her case proceeding was supportive. “Before the cross examination in court, the defence lawyer told me that he would need to ask some questions in the court room as per procedure and even prepared my mindset for the same,” shares Vidula.
