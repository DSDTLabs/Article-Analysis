VADODARA: The standing committee of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) did not take a call regarding the proposal of allowing   Gas Ltd to sell its stake in Vadodara Gas Ltd (VGL) to Gujarat Gas Ltd (GGL). A request by GAIL for waiver of restrictive clauses so that it could sell its stake in VGL to GGL, has sparked a major row at the  .

 VGL is a joint venture (JV) company floated by VMC and GAIL with both having equal stakes in it. Restrictive clauses in the shareholding agreement include those that bar a partner from selling its stake before five years of the formation of the JV. Neither of the partners can offload a stake beyond 20 per cent as per the clauses and this too can be done only to a company not involved in city gas distribution business.
 
 If GAIL wants to sell its stake to GGL, it will have to seek waiver of these restrictive clauses for which a side letter will have to be signed with both the parties and made a part of the existing agreement. This would essentially mean making changes in the agreement.
 
 The move was met with stiff resistance with former VMC mayor Bharat Shah during whose tenure the JV was formed shooting a letter to the sitting VMC mayor. The letter asked the mayor to ensure that GAIL remained a partner and, even if the stake was sold, the interests of VMC were not jeopardised. Opposition leader Chandrakant Shrivastava too has objected to the move.
 
 Sources said that the standing committee meeting on Wednesday did not discuss the issue at all. The panel deferred the matter. But if insiders are to be believed many within the ruling BJP are also of an opinion that staying with GAIL made a lot of sense. Notably, Shah and Shrivastava have claimed that it was not GAIL that wanted to sell its stake. On the contrary, they stated, it was GGLâ€™s parent company   that had approached GAIL to buy it.
