RAJKOT:   have alleged that the   officials wasted thousands of litres of   by releasing it into the desert to avoid damage to main canal bringing water to   near Bhachau in Kutch.

 Ashok Jhala, leaders of the opposition from Congress in the Bhachau municipality alleged that on March 16 the branch canal for transporting Narmada water to Tappar dam of Kutch was damaged due to heavy flow of water from the main canal affecting water supply to towns like Adipur, Anjar, Kandla and some parts of Gandhidham.
 
 “Though the government officials stopped water to the branch canal, the inflow into the main canal continued. Fearing damage to the main canal due to water pressure, water was diverted to Khari river that flows into the desert near Rapar,” alleged Jhala.
 
 “This has resulted in wastage of thousands of litres of precious water. They could have diverted it to nearby village ponds or small dams, but they (irrigation department officials) decided to release it into Kahri river,” he added.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had inaugurated the ambitious pumping station in Bhachau, which is used to pump water into the canal. The branch canal was constructed to bring Narmada water to Tappar dam
