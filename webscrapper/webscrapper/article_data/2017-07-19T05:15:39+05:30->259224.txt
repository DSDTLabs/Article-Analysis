MUMBAI: The city and neighbouring areas of Thane, Navi Mumbai, Vasai and Virar witnessed heavy rain on Tuesday. The India Meteorological Department has predicted that the   spell will last for another week. While the downpour added to the stock of the lakes supplying water to Mumbai, it also hit road   considerably.

 BMC data shows that the highest rainfall between Sunday and Tuesday was recorded in Matunga at 225mm followed by Dadar (215mm) and Fort (211mm). 
 
 Even as 62 tree fall complaints were registered with the BMC, traffic crawled at less than 5kmph along several stretches thanks to waterlogging and potholes. A study done for TOI, tracking vehicular flow at 50 of the busiest spots in the city using Google Maps, showed that the worst stretches included Goregaon-Mulund Link Road, LBS Marg and Jacob Circle. 
 
 Meanwhile, SATARK, a landslide   facility initiated by the Centre for Citizen Science, Pune, has issued a weather alert valid till Thursday. It said areas like Mahabaleshwar, Thane, Ghatkopar, Malshej, Mahad, Dapoli, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and Amboli were most prone to landslides because the rain quantum there had crossed the threshold limit.
