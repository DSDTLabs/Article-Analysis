Shimla: After chief minister Virbhadra Singh, his son Vikramaditya Singh, president of Himachal Pradesh Youth Congress, has attacked state Congress president Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu over his statement on Monday, wherein he had tried to blame Virbhadra Singh for the party’s failure in Shimla municipal corporation elections. 

 Sukhu had said, "Had we won two more seats from municipal wards under Shimla rural assembly constituency, we would have been able to have our mayor.” Vikramaditya had commented on Sukhu’s remark saying municipal elections were not fought on the basis of particular region or ward but the entire area, which went to polls. He added that singling out one particular area smacks of regionalism, something which the Congress party has always opposed. 
 
 Vikramaditya said as a result of multiple candidates of the Congress contesting the election, a division of votes was created that resulted in an advantage to the BJP candidates who won with lesser votes than that of the two Congress candidates put together in Tutu, Krishnanagar and Chotta Shimla wards for instance.
 
 He added that outcome of elections could have been much more disastrous had it not been for the relentless midnight campaigning of Virbhadra Singh in various wards which came as a big boost following which the Congress was able to have a near neck to neck fight with the opposition.
 
 Vikramditya said for any elections, be it parliamentary, assembly or local bodies, nomination of candidates, poll management, and preparation of manifesto needs to be completed “well in advance”. 
 
 “I have respect and regard for the party hierarchy and office thereof even more so since I am holding one following the due election process and procedure keeping the ethos of the intra party democratic setup of the Indian National Congress alive. I would not be surprised if this "free for all contest, and winner is our's theory" is carried forward in the upcoming Vidhan Shabha elections later this year in the current setup,” he added.
