Jalandhar: Dal Khalsa has thanked Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh for offering legal aid to Sikh hijackers Satnam Singh and Tejinderpal Singh, who have been put on fresh trail under sedition charges after 36 years. The two have already served life term in Pakistan for hijacking an Indian Airlines plane in 1981 to Lahore (Pakistan). However, the lawyers to fight the case had already been engaged and Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) has taken upon the responsibility to pay their fee.

 “We thank the CM for his gesture but lawyers have already been engaged. We are grateful to DSGMC for providing the legal assistance to both,” said Dal Khalsa spokesperson Kanwarpal Singh. Notably, the Punjab CM on Thursday directed the state’s legal aid team to extend help to two Sikhs facing possibilities of ‘double jeopardy’.
 
 The two were granted regular bail by a Delhi court on Thursday. The flight IC-423 was hijacked on September 29, 1981, after it took off from Delhi for Srinagar via Amritsar and was taken to Lahore by five hijackers. All members of Dal Khalsa, who were demanding release of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, who was arrested nine days before on September 20 in connection with murder of a Hindi newspaper editor but was later released after there was no evidence against him. They were also demanding release of other Sikh prisoners and compensation for the family of Sikhs who were killed in police firing on September 20, 1981, during a protest before Bhindranwale’s arrest.
