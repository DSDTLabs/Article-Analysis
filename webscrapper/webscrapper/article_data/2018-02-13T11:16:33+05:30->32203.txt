AGARTALA:   chief minister  , in his charateristic manner, launched a blistering attack against the Left Front government in   that immediately drew an angry response from the   leadership. 

 Addressing an election rally in Kanchanpur (ST) assembly constituency, Aditya Nath said though the Centre provides Rs 1,500 crore to Tripura every year under MNREGA, the money doesn't reach the beneficiaries as CPM cadres gobble up the funds. "Yeh paisa garibo ke paas nahin pahunchta hain kyunki CPM ke cadre dakaity dal dete hain (the money doesn't reach to the poor as it is used up by CPM cadres). That is why there is underdevelopment, unemployment and poverty in the state. Prime Minister   is making India a developed nation, but Tripura is lagging behind," he added.
 
 He also spoke about the plight of Reang refugees displaced from Mizoram and said he had raised the issue in Parliament when he was an MP. The UP chief minister said youths in Tripura are migrating to other states because the Left Front government has failed to create employment opportunities for them. 
 
 Giving a clarion call to put an end to Left rule, he said, "Tripura doesn't get the benefits of Modi's Digital India, Standup India, Startup India and over 100 other pro-poor schemes because the Left Front government wants to remain in power by creating anarchy."
