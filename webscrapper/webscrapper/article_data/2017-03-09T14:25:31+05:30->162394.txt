Panaji: With just two days left for the state assembly elections results to be declared, defence minister  , who spearheaded the   election campaign in the state, held closed door meetings with several candidates on Wednesday. Discussions about government formation and portfolio allocation also came up, sources said.

 Senior party functionaries, including party president  , chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar and   MP Narendra Sawaikar were present for the deliberations.
 
 The meetings began early in the morning and continued till late evening, but the party refused to comment on the outcome of the discussions except to assert that the BJP would form the next government.
 
 “After the elections, all the elected MLAs and the parliamentary committee will sit and decide on the CM face. We may get a couple of seats lower than our projection of 26, but we are 100% sure that we will form the next government,” state party president Vinay Tendulkar said.
 
 The party was seen stocking up on flags and banners for the March 11 and a constant stream of visitors kept the party office door swinging.
 
 When asked about what kind of preparations the BJP was undertaking just ahead of the counting process, Tendulkar said that the booth-level workers in nearly all the constituencies had been asked to study the turnout through the postal ballot and to ensure that those who had yet to submit their postal ballots did so.
 
 “The BJP will form the government. This was a preparatory meeting for March 11,” Sawaikar added.
