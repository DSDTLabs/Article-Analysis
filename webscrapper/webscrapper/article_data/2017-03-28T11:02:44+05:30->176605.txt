CHENNAI: At least 202 pieces of land carved out of the   marshland and illegally registered, have come under  . The Madras high court has now called for all registration details, beneficiaries and the list of serving as well as retired officials who registered them. 

 "The state government is directed to give details as to the officers who registered the documents, who the executors are, the beneficiaries of the documents and what is the action taken against those officers, retired and in service", said   on Monday.
 
 Pallikaranai, a critically endangered   in Chennai's southern parts, is shrinking at breakneck speed due to conversion of vast stretches of marshes into dumping yards, encroachments from all sides.
