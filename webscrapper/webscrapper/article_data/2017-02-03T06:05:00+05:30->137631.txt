Ghaziabad: The police have issued notices to the owner and the alleged driver of the Audi car that collided with an autorickshaw killing four persons on January 28, asking them to appear before them and record their statements. The police, however, are yet to identify who was behind the wheel when the accident occurred and have also not been able to trace Dr Manish Rawat, the owner of the car.

 “The investigation is underway and we have issued notices to Dr Rawat and driver Ishaak Ahmed under Section 166 of CrPC. They were asked to come to the police station to record their statements. I also want to reiterate that we have not given a clean chit to Rawat. Both Rawat and Ahmed will be questioned separately and their statements will be corroborated,” said SSP Deepak Kumar.
 
 When asked why there was no trace of the owner even five days after the accident despite the police’s claims that all efforts were on to trace him, Kumar was silent. 
 
 When TOI asked the SSP how Ahmed appeared from nowhere and managed to apply for a surrender application right under the nose of the police in CJM court and get bail the very next day, Kumar replied, “The IPC provisions under which the accused driver were booked were bailable and the court rightly granted him bail.”
 
 Meanwhile, the irresponsible manner in which the police left the Audi on the roadside outside Indirapuram police station also came under scanner. Curious onlookers opened the car and inspected it, stalling any forensic examination of the vehicle.
 
  When asked about it, the SSP said: “In the case of an accident, this is the practice. Vehicles recovered from accident sites are brought to the respective police stations and kept the same way as in this case. Hence, there is nothing unusual about it.”
