NAVI MUMBAI: A group of 12 feisty women from   are taking the ‘Say no to plastic’ civic drive forward in their own way. Apart from spreading the word against banned   below 50 microns, they are seizing them too from shopkeepers in their area. 

 The group, calling themselves, Swacchhagrahi, includes working women and housewives. “Swacchhaagrahi means being self-driven towards cleanliness. This group is an example of how to bring about change by being part of it,” said DMC (Solid waste management), Tushar Pawar. Similar drives will go a long way towards achieving zero-plastic waste, he added.
 
 The group members make random visits to local markets and keep a watch on those using banned plastic bags. They have even confiscated 31 kg of plastic bags from the shops. “Civic chief, Tukaram Mundhe’s drive against plastic has helped us work on a bigger scale,” said a group member, Swati Tillu. 
 
 “We interact with shopkeepers and explain the purpose of the campaign,” she added.
 
 Not everyone shares their enthusiasm though. “It’s not easy to ask a shopkeeper to turn eco-friendly. There have been instances when we were asked to mind our own business,” said Tillu. But with   providing them with ID cards it has become easier, she added. 
 
  When someone refuses to comply, the group members click photos of the shop in order to send them to the ward office. That is often enough to make them see sense, they add.
