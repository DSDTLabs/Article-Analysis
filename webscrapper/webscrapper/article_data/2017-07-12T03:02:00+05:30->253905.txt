Nagpur: The deficient rains in the first half of the monsoon season seem to have hit the paddy growers of eastern Vidarbha the most. The taluka-wise rainfall data issued by the government on Tuesday shows shortfall ranging from 5% to 70% across the six districts of the revenue division. In the five districts of Bhandara, Gondia, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli and Nagpur, paddy is the most preferred crop as it requires water in large quantities for cultivation. Normally, this belt receives assured annual rainfall in the range of 1,000mm to 1,200mm. But despite prediction of good rains, the paddy belt has first seen a delay in arrival of monsoon and then erratic spells which are not scattered all through the paddy belt. The combined shortfall of the division was 37%. Bhandara was worst hit with -51% rains followed by Gondia with -46%, Chandrapur -42%, Nagpur -39% and Gadchiroli -33% . The situation is quite alarming in Nagpur district as out of 52 talukas, only one— Saoner—has received its normal quota of rainfall. All other talukas are short by 5% to 57%. Wardha district was better placed with only 10% shortfall in rains. Arvi taluka in that district has received its full quota for the period.
