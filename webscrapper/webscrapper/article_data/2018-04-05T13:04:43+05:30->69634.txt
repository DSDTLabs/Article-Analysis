In the past couple of years, China has emerged as the largest and most powerful producer of steel on earth, beating global leaders like the USA as well. Not many know, but the fact is that China produces about half of the world's total steel. The country singlehandedly churns out as much steel in one year as the entire world did in 2000.

 At the same time, the share of US global production has fallen from 12 per cent to 5 per cent today, says Eswar Prasad, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and professor of trade policy at  .
 
 Steel has over the years occupied a designated place in the way the U.S. and other nations see themselves. It's both a source of national pride and a symbol of a country's industrial strength.
 
 This need and reverence of steel are common all over the world. The continued global glut steel in steel is almost entirely due to sixfold growth in China’s production. The country’s share in global steel output rose from 15 per cent to 50 per cent in the last 16 years.
