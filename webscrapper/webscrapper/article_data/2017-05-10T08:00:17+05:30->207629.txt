BHOPAL:   ( ) has proposed a new air-conditioned multi-storeyed Inter-state Bus Terminal at a new location near the existing Nadra bus stand. The new   would come up along Hamidia road on the site of old Sabzi Mandi.

 After inspecting the Nadra bus stand on Tuesday, Bhopal City Link Limited (BCLL) director and BMC corporator Keval Mishra said, “Till a new bus stand is developed on Hamidia road, the existing facilities need to be improved.”
 
 “Directives for changes in making the bus stand passenger-friendly will be implemented in the coming days,” he added. Urban planners have been critical for having a vital bus stand along a commercial zone.
 
 During inspection, it came to light that bus operators were not paying maintenance cess of Rs 40 that BMC collects per bus per day to maintain the premises. Over 200 buses ply daily from Nadra bus stand that connects Bhopal to nearby towns. It is also considered important as it connects commuters to the railway station situated nearby.
 
 The proposed bus stand, expected to cost about Rs 10 crore, would be spread on an area of about 5 acres. It would also have a skywalk that would directly connect to the nearby railway station. “The new facility will be air-conditioned and will promote use of electronic payment,” he added.
 
 Mishra said that BMC is also considering launching a mobile-based application for tracking buses and reservations.
