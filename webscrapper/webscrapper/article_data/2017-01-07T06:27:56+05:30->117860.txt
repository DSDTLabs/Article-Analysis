THANE: The   police returned recovered valuables, vehicles, mobiles and cash to their legitimate owners at a function organized at the police commissioner’s office on Friday. 

 Officials said the police had collectively recovered valuables worth Rs 24.70 crore and cracked 1,726 cases of the total 5,405 cases of theft and robbery registered across the Thane police commissionerate in 2016. 
 
 As many as 385 cases of gold theft by chain snatchers were detected with valuables worth Rs 1.5 crore recovered and returned. Also, 771 complaints of vehicle thefts worth Rs 8.33 crore were also solved. 
 
 The police also recovered around Rs 10.19 crore from a heist that took place in a cash management company near the Thane mental hospital last year by armed robbers. 
 
 One of the owners who got his stolen vehicle back was a 25-year-old Sunil Somwanshi, whose vehicle was picked up from a parking lot in   last October. 
 
 “I was at a shopping mart around that area and when I came out I realised that my motorcycle was missing. I was completely shattered as it was my first vehicle. I went to the   police station to lodge a complaint and a cop there told me that they will find my two-wheeler. He not only gave me hopes but also offered me his bike for a week so that I could write my oncoming exams that week. I am overwhelmed not just by the police finding and returning my vehicle but also by the cop’s gesture of offering me his vehicle so that I could travel to my college at   for my exams,” said Somwanshi.
