HYDERABAD: The   has directed the income tax authorities to relax conditions of the   2016 in the case of a city doctor.

 Soon after  , city-based doctor Indira Ajay deposited Rs 11.18 crore of the banned currency in three of her bank accounts in December 2016. She showed it as income for 2017-18 and paid an advance tax of Rs 3.15 crore. 
 
 But after the Centreâ€™s introduction of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, which allowed individuals to legalize their unaccounted demonetized currency, she thought of utilizing the scheme. But when she attempted to do so, she realised there were far too many hurdles for her to avail this scheme. As a result, she had to borrow Rs 83 lakh and deposit it in the bank to become eligible to use the scheme. 
 
 The bench of Justice V Ramasubramanian and Justice  , which heard her plea, recorded that after she paid advance tax and other fees, the balance in her accounts stood at Rs 7.5 crore. Income tax authorities sought to treat this as seized currency. As per norms of the PM GKY scheme, the doctor has to deposit 30% of the seized currency towards tax and 10% as penalty. 
 
 Things did not end here. She has to pay cess equivalent to 33% of money paid as tax. All this amounted to 49.9% of seized currency, which worked out to Rs 5.58 crore leaving Rs 1.92 crore as balance in her accounts. But there is one more rider. In order to avail the scheme, she has to keep 25% of the seized currency as deposit in RBI Bonds. For this, she is required to get Rs 2.75 crore . But the money available fell short by Rs 83 lakh to fulfil this.
 
 The bench directed the I-T authorities to treat the seized currency as tax, cess, penalty etc instead of asking her to get all this from outside while seizing her existing cash. The bench directed the petitioner to get Rs 83 lakh from outside to complete RBI bond transaction while the tax sleuths can retain the bonds with them.
