MEERUT: Catching them off the guard, three criminals on Thursday afternoon took a two-member police team hostage at their rented home in Meerut’s upmarket Yashoda Kunj colony when the unsuspecting cops went there to cross check credentials of the tenants. The three men later fled in a car with a flat tyre, leaving behind a pile of ammunition, SIM cards and the two embarrassed policemen.
 
  The cops had gone to the house to check record of the tenants after getting complaints from neighbours about their suspicious behaviour.
  
  According to police, the suspects overpowered the policemen and fled in a car, leaving another car. Close to two dozen cartridges, a magazine and 12 SIM cards were found in house number 160 of posh Yashoda Kunj colony.
  
  The house, owned by  , a Lucknow-based banker, was rented out to   on December 1 last year.
  
  When contacted,   said, “The man (Harjeet) told me that he, along with his younger brother, was preparing for competitive examinations. I rented out the property after procuring requisite documents for verification and rent agreement.”
  
  Amid uncertainty over profile of the suspects, senior police officers have pressed several teams in action. Services of local unit of special task force (STF) are also being taken, police said.
  
  “We don’t know background and criminal history of the suspects. A manhunt is on, we will soon get a breakthrough,” superintendent of police (Rural)   said.
  
  Police have also secured CCTV DVR of the main entrance of the colony.
  
  The incident has sent shock waves among the local residents in the gated colony.
  
  “The youth in the house kept to themselves. When asked, one of them claimed that he is a trainer at a local gym,” a neighbour said. Police are also trying to extract information from a local pizza outlet, from where the suspects had ordered food recently.
  
  TOI has accessed the Aadhaar card of one of the suspects, Harjeet Singh, which shows him as a resident of Hastinapur.
