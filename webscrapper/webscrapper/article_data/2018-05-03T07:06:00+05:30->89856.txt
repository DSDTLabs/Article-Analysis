Ludhiana: The Sahnewal police have arrested a man on Tuesday for extorting money from people while impersonating as a CIA official. The accused struck at a grocery store along with his accomplice, and threatened the store owner by accusing him of illegal sale of LPG cylinders and kerosene. Thereafter, they extorted Rs 2,000 in cash from him.

 According to police, the accused and his accomplice have been extorting money from various people over a period of time. The accused, Navdeep Singh, is a resident of Shimlapuri, said the police. A case has been registered against him under sections 384 (punishment for extortion), and 170 (impersonating a public servant) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). 
 
 Complainant Dimpy Bajarh of Sahnewal said on Tuesday evening, the accused came to his shop along with his accomplice. They introduced themselves as CIA officials, and accused him of selling kerosene and LPG cylinders illegally. Although he denied the charges, the accused forcibly took Rs 2,000 from him and left. Meanwhile, some more shopkeepers too revealed that the accused had also extorted money from them. After this, the shopkeepers together approached the police.
 
 Investigating officer ASI Joginder Singh of Sahnewal police said within a few hours, they got five similar complaints from Sahnewal and Dhandari. Following this, police installed a checkpost in Sahnewal and arrested Navdeep, while his accomplice Prabhjot Singh, a resident of Dholewal, managed to escape. The ASI added that Navdeep was a carpenter by profession. “He has a good physique and hence could be mistaken for an officer. He has targeted many people in the past five months,” said Joginder.
 
 He further said Navdeep had also been booked in different cases of brawls and under NDPS (Narcotics, Drugs, and Psychotropic Substances) Act in Sirhind and Ludhiana. He used to roam around in the city searching for targets. Cops have launched a manhunt to arrest his accomplice.
