While lack of tickets, especially to specific destinations, remains the major issue at halt stations, commuters say toilets and amenities like a foot-overbridge or subway are also necessary.

 There are 160 halt stations across  , of which 30 are in Chennai division and spread across the city and its neighbouring districts   and Kancheepuram. Among the 30, there are 12 in Chennai division where more than 1,000 tickets are sold every day.
 
 These stations do not have toilets, say commuters. “Even the halt agents, who have been engaged as railway contractors to sell tickets, have to relieve themselves in the open,” says  , member of   (DRUCC).
 
 Cleanliness is lacking at these stations. Railway sources said it was commercially not viable to depute staff at such stations and have asked NGOs to adopt such stations. Railway sources said they have suggested to seniors that a group of halt stations on a section, say between Tiruvallur and  , should be bunched together and given a set of cleaning staff to tide over the unviability.
 
 FOBs and subways are necessary at stations where the number of passengers are increasing. Commuters are forced to cross railway tracks. “At  , railways recently built a subway as there was a danger to many school and college students being run over on the fast line,” said S  , a regular commuter on the section. Railways should take similar suggestions from passenger associations in the interest of safety, he added.
