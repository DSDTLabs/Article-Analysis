In an unprecedented move, the makers of   Kannada   have pushed the grand   of the show by another two weeks. While earlier, it was widely reported that the show would witness its finale on January 15, now in a sudden move, the names behind the programme have decided to keep it going for another two weeks and wrap it up on January 29.
 So what prompted this move? “Bigg Boss has grown to become much more than a show; it is now a   phenomenon,” says   Kumar, senior executive vice president. The show has enjoyed stupendous adulation from viewers thus making its contestants household names. The popularity of the series compelled us to extend it and also move the airing of the show to our sister channel,” he says.
  Ravish adds that with wildcard entries, tasks and unique guests, have become a topic of dinner table conversations. “And now that the show is reaching the fag end, it has added to the excitement. The extended show will now conclude on January 29,” he sums up.
