BATHINDA: Taking note of large-scale felling of trees on the   highway, the   (NGT) has directed   not to axe any trees till further orders. NGT has also directed the state government to file the latest status report about the trees felled for different projects and steps taken for afforestation after May 19, 2016.

 Taking note of indiscriminating felling for road widening projects,. NGT had restrained Punjab from axing trees on May 19, 2016. Copy of the NGT orders, passed on July 10, was made available on Thursday.
 
 The   had stayed the NGT order in June 2016. The apex court vacated the stay on April 22 this year, to pave away for the NGT order of May 19, 2016 coming into force. Over 70,000 full grown tress were felled in an unscientific manner for the widening of 220km long Bathinda-Zirakpur national highway-7 in 2015.
 
 Longowal resident Dr   had approached the NGT in 2016 against indiscriminate felling of trees with an appeal to restrain the state government and compensate the loss of green cover by planting similar number of saplings along the highways. Amandeep’s counsel Saurabh Sharma told TOI over phone from Delhi, “The NGT, in its order on July 10, directed Punjab not to axe any trees till further orders and file status report about the trees felled for various projects and steps have been taken for afforestation. The matter will come up on August 9.”
 
 Amandeep said the state government seemed least bothered about taking care of the environment. “Though felling of trees is needed for development but there is dire need for compensating that by planting saplings. We will come up with the details of trees axed by the state government for various projects across Punjab.”
