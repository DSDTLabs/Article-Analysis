VADODARA: On Sunday evening, Barodians picked up their bicycles and pedalled all the way to the   for enjoying the first ride-in movie — Cycle. 
 
 
 A cycling organization had organized the event to celebrate the World Cycle Day. The participants didn’t just watch the movie in the open air but also enjoyed the festival organized by Cycling Cities. 
 
 “We chose the movie as it was based on a man and his attachment to his cycle. People enjoyed the movie and the festival we had organized,” said  , who runs Cycling Cities. “The idea was to spread awareness about cycling among the citizens. Our roads are getting congested due to constant increase in traffic. If people start riding cycles for short-distance travel it can help in not just decongesting the roads but will also help improve their health,” she added.
 
 During the festival, an exhibition of different kinds of bicycles was held apart from a small fest. Director of the movie   attended the festival along with mayor Bharat Dangar. 
 
 Lalwani has been promoting bicycling in the city for past few years.
