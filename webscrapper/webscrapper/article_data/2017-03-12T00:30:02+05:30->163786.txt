Hyderabad: TDP’s A   on Saturday threw down a gauntlet at chief minister  , taunting him to invoke the ‘perish or prove’ move against him. 

 The CM had declared in the   that he would resign ‘in five minutes’ if a single ‘lie’ in the Governor’s address was proved. Reddy, suspended for the entire  , told reporters the governor said there was no political corruption in the state over three years. “But former deputy CM S Rajaiah was sacked from the cabinet for corruption. If Rajaiah was corrupt, then how can Governor say there was no corruption? And if Rajaiah was not corrupt, then why was he charged with it and sacked?” Revanth Reddy asked. 
 
 Armed with copies of Governor’s addresses to both Houses in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, Reddy listed out what he called further ‘lies’ that the Governor was made to read. Reddy challenged the CM to either throw him into prison or resign as promised in the  .
