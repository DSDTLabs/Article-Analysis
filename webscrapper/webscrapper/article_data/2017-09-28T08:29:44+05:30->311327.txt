NAMSAI (Arunachal Pradesh): Union minister of state for home   on Wednesday reassured the people of Arunachal Pradesh, saying the Centre will not act on Chakma and Hajong refugees without taking the interests of the original inhabitants of the frontier state into consideration. “I am very saddened by the fact that a bandh was observed across the state recently on the citizenship issue.

 It was not based on facts at all. There has been no decision by the Centre regarding citizenship for Chakmas and Hajongs yet. Not even the Union home minister has taken any stand yet on the issue. I am hurt by the manner in which my image on this issue was projected,” Rijiju said at the World Tourism Day celebrations here. The All Arunachal Pradesh Students’ Union had called a bandh in protest against citizenship for Chakmas and Hajongs in the state, during which incidents of violence were reported. Rijiju reiterated his stand that protection of the rights of the indigenous people of Arunachal Pradesh is top priority for the Centre and that he will take steps by which the tribal population of the state is safeguarded. Rijiju mentioned the   order of 2015 which said about giving citizenship to Chakmas and Hajongs.
 
 Chakmas and Hajongs, who were originally the inhabitants of the   Tracts in Bangladesh, had to leave their country of origin because of persecution there. There are about 1 lakh Chakmas and Hajongs in the state settled in Arunachal Pradesh in the 1960s. “There is a Supreme Court order on the citizenship issue. But let me make clear that the Centre has not taken any decision yet,” Rijiju added.
 
 Recently, Rijiju hadsaid that there are genuine difficulties in giving citizenship to Chakmas and Hajongs as it would violate the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulations, 1873, from which the Inner Line Permit (ILP) system is derived. All outsiders need an ILP to enter the state.
