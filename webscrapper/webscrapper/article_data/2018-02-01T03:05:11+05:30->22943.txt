MUMBAI: The Delhi high court verdict upholding   to enforce arbitration award will complicate the multiple ongoing deals pursued by the Singh brothers of Religare to wriggle out of a financial mess. 

 Malvinder and   have been in advanced talks to merge   with  , which is backed by private equity giant TPG. After months of discussions, the transaction had progressed into documentation work with Manipal only awaiting the outcome of the court order, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. 
 
 Similarly, the two troubled siblings have been in protracted discussions to sell parts of their financial services business under Religare Enterprises. 
 
 The latest HC order would prompt Daiichi to seek custody of promoter shares in Fortis, though a substantial part of it is pledged with banks. This could lead to banks taking proactive steps to protect their interests. “Now there’s a situation where Manipal wouldn’t know who will control the shares. Hopefully there will be some clarity in the next two weeks,” sources added. 
 
 A merger rather than a sale of the promoter shares was contemplated to abide by earlier court order asking the Religare founders not to alienate or sell any of their assets. Fortis has sought extended deadlines with market regulator Sebi to declare its second quarter results amid swirling rumours of financial difficulties.
 
 A favorable order for the Singhs would have seen more suitors showing up for their assets, including Fortis, which is one of the largest private hospital networks in the country.
