Coimbatore: As many as 3,145   in and around the   will be removed by October 8, an official of the   said.

 “Nearly 532 encroachments located near Sanganoor canal, one of the major areas where encroachment has blocked the passage of water, were evicted on Friday and Saturday,” he said.
 
 “Seventy-two houses built on Sanganoor canal, 62 houses at Anna Nagar in Ondipudur and 50 houses at Auto-driver’s Colony, including those built by government employees, were removed. Another 48 houses need to be evicted. That will be done after the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation disconnects power supply to the high-tension power line passing through the area. We need to disconnect power as we are using heavy machinery to raze down houses,” the official said.
 
 “We have decided to evict people from 3,000 houses every month and have drawn up a schedule for the same. There is a high court order regarding this. As the northeast monsoon is fast approaching, we want to ensure that the maximum number of encroachments are removed before the rain,” said a senior engineer.
 
 However, residents resisting the anti-encroachment drive are posing a hindrance to the process. “Most of them co-operated with us when we sought their identity proof and also surveyed the houses. It shows that they are ready to shift to new tenements. But, somehow, on the day of the eviction, external elements including political parties, misguide the residents and they indulge in protests. But, we will not stop the eviction process and evict residents from all the 15,200 homes as soon as possible,” said the engineer.
 
 All those evicted were provided alternate homes at Vellalore housing unit. Once the tenements at Kovai Pudur are completed, residents of Muthanan Kulam and neighbouring areas will also be evicted.
