BATHINDA: Leader of the Opposition in the   assembly   has accused chief minister Amarinder Singh’s government of lowering the morale of the state police’s field staff. He alleged that either the ruling party leaders were beating the cops or the government was punishing the brave officers.

 On Tuesday, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA called upon the state police field officers to not obey ‘illegitimate’ orders of the state government and work for protecting the life and liberty of the people.   made this observation in   after his visit to Ferozerpur villages on Monday was marred by manhandling by some people alleged to be close to the Congress leaders.
 
 Khaira said, “Earlier the state government punished Mehatpur station house officer (SHO) Parminder Singh Bajwa. On Monday, the goons of the Congress leaders beat up a policeman at Ferozepur for intervening when they tried to manhandle me. These instances are lowering the morale of the policemen. The CM, instead of supporting policemen, is backing the Congress leaders who are into land grabbing.”
 
 Meanwhile, Ferozepur senior superintendent of police (SSP) Pritam Singh said, “The land disputes cases Khaira is referring to are under litigation in various courts. There is no case of forcible land grabbing. A case has been registered against a dozen unidentified people who beat up the policeman and we are trying to identify the guilty.”
