AHMEDABAD: In the 1903 edition of Indian Opinion-- a journal he edited in South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi had written on the heritage of Ahmedabad and exclusively on the ornamentation of stone screens, which included referring to the the Sidi Saiyyed ‘Tree of life’ stone latticework. Bapu quoted an article that appeared in the Times of India on the intricate carvings and screens with stone latticework. In this article Bapu wrote, “The open-carved marble windows and screens at Ahmedabad furnish examples of skilful ornamentation which beautifies every Indian building , from the cave monasteries of the Buddhist period downward. They also show with what plasticity the Hindu architects adapted their Indian ornamentation to the structural requirements of the Muhammadan mosque. We wish we could give our readers (readers of Indian opinion) a reproduction of the fine supplement of Times of India , giving some of the illustrations.”
