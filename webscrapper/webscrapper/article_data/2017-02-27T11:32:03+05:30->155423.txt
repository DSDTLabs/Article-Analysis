LUCKNOW:   hasn’t been able to achieve its tax collection targets for 2016-17, despite the  , and is facing a slump due to ongoing elections. As a result, development work in ths pipeline is likely to suffer.

 The corporation is still about 35% below its target of Rs 200 crore as of December 2016. The model code of conduct was implemented across the state soon after. Many tax officials, ranging from assessment officers, tax superintendents and revenue officers, have been deputed at different locations for training and election duties over the past two months. This has also impacted the smooth process of tax collection in zonal offices. Additional municipal commissioner   said, “This year, most of our staff is engaged in election duties which is affecting tax collection. We collected only about Rs 130 crore by January first week and have now pinned our hopes on the last month of financial year to achieve targets.”
 
 He said if targets are not achieved, the biggest impact would be on development works of the city. With the seventh pay commission being applicable from this year, it is also a big worry for the LMC to meet the salary expectations of employees. The salaries have risen by almost 20% and LMC is entitled to pay them. If targets are not met, it would be difficult to pay the increased salaries and also do maintenance works in 2017. Other expenses, like electricity bills, petrol, pumps etc; are also meted out with this collection.
 
 Last year, the LMC had collected Rs 160 crore. This time, it expected to touch Rs 200 crore but it is way below the last year’s target too. Though the ban on Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes in November 2016 forced people to pay their long pending tax dues, LMC still couldn’t achieve the desired results. Srivastava said, “Notebandi was a great relief as we unexpectedly collected about Rs 30 crore alone in the months November and December. Right now, we are in the wait and watch mode till elections get over.”
