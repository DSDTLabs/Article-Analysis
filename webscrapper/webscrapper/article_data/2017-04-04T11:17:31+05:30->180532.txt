LUCKNOW: As soon as she heard from a neighbour and   that her son Chitransh had been kidnapped, Aarti Pandey called up her husband Susheel Pandey, who was at his   in  . As he rushed home, he saw a large number of neighbours gathered.

 There was panic in the Rastoginagar colony. Businessman Anupam Srivastav said there was a similar situation in the colony last month when a resident Ghaus Mohammed Khan was picked up by the NIA (National Investigation Agency) team. “We were caught off guards and today, when we heard that someone had been kidnapped, I and my family came out of our home to find out more,” he told TOI.
 
 Friends of the 10-year-old boy rushed to his house and joined his worried mother and his elder sister Adya, a student of Class VI who said he is most obedient and never moves with strangers. “He plays only in the colony with friends,” she said.
 
 As the waiting crowd heard that Chitransh had been rescued, there were loud chants of “Jai Shree Ram”.
