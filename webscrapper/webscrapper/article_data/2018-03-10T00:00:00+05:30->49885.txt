A party hosted by Sangini club turned out to be a pleasure trip, literally. Flying high being the theme of the party, it was designed around two prominent airlines which the ladies had named as Singfisher and Fundigo. Some of the members were dressed as crew members and looked every inch the same. Since this was the last event of the tenure of  , Soni Lakhmani and  , the trio made sure that everyone had an enjoyable time.
Even the venue was in tune with the theme and the members were given boarding passes to check in. Several performances also marked the bash. Mudita Agarwal, Manisha Kishnani, Muskan Dube among others danced on Swag Se while Priya Agarwal and Poonam Maheshwari danced to Ayeye Meharban. Nidhee Kapoor, Soni Lakhmani and Namita Tandon performed on Laila Me Laila. The bash also had some funny moments with   putting in a Vijay Mallaya-act.
