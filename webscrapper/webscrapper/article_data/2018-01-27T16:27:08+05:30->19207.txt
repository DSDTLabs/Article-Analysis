BEIJING: India’s ambassador to China, Gautam  , has said Beijing should pay serious attention to New Delhi’s concerns about the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( ) and not ignore them. 

 “The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor passes through Indian-claimed territory (POK) and hence violates our territorial integrity. This is a major problem for us,” he told China’s state-run ‘Global Times’ in a hard-hitting interview. “We need to talk about it, not push it under the carpet. I believe the more we talk to each other, the easier it will become to resolve problems,” he said. 
 
 Bambawale seemed to convey a stern message from New Delhi that Beijing could not hope to tap the Indian market and enhance economic ties if it continued to ignore Indian concerns over sovereignty. In an interview published on Republic Day, Bambawale said the 73-day border standoff at   must be seen from the historical perspective. 
 
 “I look at the Doklam standoff from such a long-term perspective. When you do so, the Doklam standoff is just one event in a much longer-term history. I believe that you are blowing it out of proportion. The people of India and China and our leaders are experienced enough and wise enough to overcome such momentary hurdles in our relationship.” Bambawale conveyed India’s desire to re-examine some of the differences while accelerating improvement in relations. 
 
 “India sells pharmaceuticals and IT products all over the world, but not in China. Why? For 20 years, we have been asking for the Chinese market to be opened for our pharmaceutical and IT products and services,” he said, adding, “...To no avail. What do we make of this? We should discuss such issues frankly but also take steps to resolve them.”
