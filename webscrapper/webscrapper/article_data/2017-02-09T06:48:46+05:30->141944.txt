SURAT: Hoteliers and restaurant owners in the watering hole of Union territory of Daman have heaved a sigh of relief as the administration has lifted the ban on the sale of eggs and processed   and poultry products within the surveillance zone from Wednesday. 

 The Daman administration had imposed prohibitory orders for the sale of eggs, processed poultry and poultry products for the period of 30 days on January 7 after two samples from the   village tested positive for bird flu. 
 
 The administration, has however, continued the ban on sending live poultry, eggs, dead carcass, manure or any such material from the infected zone, that is, Kadaiya village in the 10 kilometer radius from the epicenter, until April 11.
 
 Due to positive sample of H5N1, the Kadaiya village was declared as ‘infected area’ and the whole of Daman was notified as ‘survelliance zone’ for the period of 30 days.
 
 The hotel, wine shops and restaurant business was hit hard following the ban.
 
 Talking to TOI, Pramod  , a wine shop owner in Daman said, “The sale and consumption of eggs and poultry products are allowed in Daman now. So, we expect the tourist flow to be restored as it was before the bird flu was announced”
 
 Tandel added, “The hotel and wine industry have suffered huge losses and that the tourist flow had decreased to almost 50 per cent due to the ban on poultry and eggs.”
