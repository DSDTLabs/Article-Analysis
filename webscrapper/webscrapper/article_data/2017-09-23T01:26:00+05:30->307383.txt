 Lucknow: Issuing a warning to hostellers, Lucknow University said on Friday that mess services would be shut permanently if indiscipline continues. The hostellers have been told to give a written undertaking to cooperate in maintaining discipline and catching troublemakers for continuation of the mess services.
 
 The hostellers will meet LU vice-chancellor SP Singh on Saturday in this regard.
 
 “The mess service is being intentionally disrupted by a student group who want to eat for free. This would be the last attempt on our part to run the central mess. The hostellers have to take the initiative to identify the rowdy elements,” said vice-chancellor.
 
 He said the students involved in vandalizing central mess on September 19 could be identified with the help of bouncers. In the previous incidents — when biometric machines were damaged or mess ration stolen — the hostellers were present but refused to identify the guilty, VC added. 
 
 Singh said it’s difficult to run the central mess as there is no end to indiscipline and LU students are among the problem creators. If the students fail to give assurance, central as well as individual mess services will be closed and fees will be refunded to students, Singh warned. 
 
 The mess facility was suspended in April this year due to largescale indiscipline. In August, LU started a central mess for all the boys hostels. But, following a series of incidents of violence and rowdyism, it too was closed on Tuesday.
