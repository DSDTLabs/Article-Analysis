MUMBAI: Major jewellers Gitanjali, Ginni and   have also come under the scanner of various investigating agencies following the   fraud.

 “The CBI and Enforcement Directorate (ED) is looking at their (Gitanjali, Ginni, Nakshatra and Nirav Modi) arrangements with various banks and end use of money,” a senior official of a public sector bank (PSB) told  . No immediate comments were available from these companies.
 
 There is a strict instruction from the finance ministry to all banks that no big fish should go scot-free and no honest borrower is harassed, the official said. Lenders are now looking at their systems and processes to prevent such frauds, the official said. All banks have been asked to present a status report as soon as possible, he added.
 
 In 2015, Bank of Baroda, another PSB, had brought to light a scam of Rs 350 crore in which fraudulent export bills were discounted. Investigations revealed major irregularities, because the forex transactions were done mainly via advance remittances for import, through newly-opened current accounts. Heavy cash transactions — sometimes four or five times a day — were also noticed. The ED, under the revenue department of the finance ministry, had arrested the businessman duo under money laundering provisions. PNB said that fraudulent transactions took place in one of its branches in Mumbai.
