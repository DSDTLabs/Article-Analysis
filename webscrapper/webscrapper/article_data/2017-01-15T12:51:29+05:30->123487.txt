INDORE: The students in the city, who will be appearing for the   as well as the competitive exams like   to reserve a berth in the reputed colleges of the country, are concerned about managing time as both are scheduled during the same period. 

 JEE 2017 is scheduled to be conducted on April 2 which will be a paper-pen based exam while the online exam will be conducted on April 8 and 9 at various centres across the country. 
 
 “Though I had started preparing for the competitive exam quite early but concentrating on both the exams is difficult. Both are very crucial for me and I cannot think of messing it up anyhow,” said Jay Purohit, a student of Class 12. 
 
 The medical aspirants, who will be appearing for NEET 2017 to be conducted on May 7, are also intimidated with the limited time available to prepare for both. 
 
 “As the boards are approaching it’s becoming difficult for me to manage studies. During the school hours I am focusing on the board exams and after that I go for a coaching to prepare for NEET. But it’s a habit that I study major portions at last but board exams are not leaving much time for me to focus on NEET,” said  , a science student from the city. 
 
 However, experts feel that students can manage both the exams if they focus on   books. 
 
 “Both JEE and NEET are conducted by   and only NCERT books are preferred for the exams. If the students focus on NCERT books and study material given by CBSE then they can prepare for both the exams simultaneously,” said  , CBSE helpline member from the city.
