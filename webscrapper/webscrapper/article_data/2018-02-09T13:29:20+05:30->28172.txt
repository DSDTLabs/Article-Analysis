SURAT: The Gems and   (GJEPC) has made a strong representation to Revenue Secretary   for taking aporopriate action in ensuring the early release of diamond parcels seized by the GST department in Mumbai.

 The Revenue secretary however has not given any assurance for the release of diamond parcels.
 
 A delegation of industry representatives led by chairman of Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC),   met the revenue secretary in New Delhi to 
 strongly represent the case of the diamond manufacturers and traders from Surat whose valuable parcels were seized by the GST and   department during the raid on Angadias in Mumbai last month. 
 
 Industry sources said that more than 300 parcels were seized by the GST and Central Excise officials during the raid conducted on the angadias at Mumbai Central Railway station in the first week of January. While a few parcels having legal documents including invoice and jhangad were released, but a majority of the parcels without proper documents were seized by the department. 
 Sources said that around 200 parcels of diamonds and jewellery belonging to the manufacturers and traders in Surat have been confiscated by the department from the last one month. 
 
 It must be remembered that the GST on polished diamonds and rough diamonds have been brought down to 0.25 per cent. 
 
 Talking to TOI, chairman of GJEPC, Pramod Agarwal, said, “The Revenue Secretary heard our grievances but he has not given any assurance on the release of the parcels seized by GST and Central Excise department.”
