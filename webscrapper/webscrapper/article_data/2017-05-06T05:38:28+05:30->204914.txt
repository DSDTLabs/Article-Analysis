MUMBAI: Yet another platform overshooting has been reported at Malad. The motorman of a Churchgate-Borivli local, scheduled to halt at   at 7pm, Thursday, failed to apply brakes at the right moment. As a result three  , before the train stopped.

 Since two such incidents have been reported in quick succession on   , commuters are a bit disturbed.On Friday, a Borivli-Churchgate slow local halted one and a half coaches ahead of the platform at Grant Road. The incident occurred around 1.35pm, resulting in a delay of 5 minutes--crucial in the suburban schedule. The motormen and guards of both trains have been suspended.
 
 Explaining the incidents, a motorman said that running rooms at   and Bhayander used for deployment of train crew are in a bad shape. “They are supposed to be air-conditioned so that train crew can relax before starting duty,“ he said.
 
 But a WR official said crew get adequate rest, enough to recharge for their type of work.
