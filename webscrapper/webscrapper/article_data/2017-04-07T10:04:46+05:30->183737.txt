PUNE: Two men were injured in an accident at the crematorium in   on Thursday morning.

 The accident created panic among people who were attending final rites. Some of them had to leave the funeral proceeding halfway and rush the two men to a nearby hospital.

 The officer said that Todmal and Dodmani had gathered at the crematorium for the last rites of their acquaintance from Mulanagar in Old Sangvi. 
 
 Around 10am, while the rites at the gas-based crematorium were being performed, one of them caught hold of the iron beam used for supporting the shuttering plates. "The iron beam got displaced and the shuttering plates fell on the two men from a height of about 10ft," the police officer said.
 
 Contractor Sunil Gawade told TOI the concrete work was done about 20 days ago.
