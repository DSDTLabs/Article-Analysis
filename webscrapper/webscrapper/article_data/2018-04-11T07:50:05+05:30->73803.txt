CHENNAI: Three years ago, commuters cheered when the city's first, and so far only, air-conditioned bus shelter was inaugurated at the Asarghana bus stop, opposite the Alandur metro station. Today, the shelter has become an ornamental structure, thanks to the lack of maintenance. Commuters at the spot continue to be exposed to the elements. 

 After it was thrown opento the public, the 1.25 crore shelter with three rooms, each measuring 360 sq ft, and two toilets was handed over to a private contractor for mainetenance. But, the shelter has been virtually abandoned. The air-conditioners developed faults almost six months ago but they are yet to be serviced. 
 
 When contacted,  , chief executive of the   Mount cum Pallavaram, under which the area falls, said the contractor entrusted the job of maintaining the shelter. faced a setback when the state highways department objected to his putting up adevertisements there. The Madras high court ruled in the contractor's favour about two months ago but it is not known why the rpair work has not been undertaken so far,   said.
