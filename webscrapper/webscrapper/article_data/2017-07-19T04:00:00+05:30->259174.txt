Mumbai: Markets regulator   has directed all listed banks to disclose to the bourses in case there is any divergence in their non-performing assets ( ) classification as was published by banks and as identified by the RBI during its inspection. 

 Recently at least five banks —  ,  ,  ,   and   — had announced substantial divergence in NPAs that had led to a sharp slide in stock prices of these banks. Soon after these discrepancies came to light, Sebi had also asked these banks to explain such divergences. 
 
 On Tuesday, Sebi said that the RBI rules require banks to disclose in notes to accounts in their annual financial statements immediately following communication of such divergence by the RBI to the bank. Accordingly, all banks which have listed specified securities shall comply with a set of Sebi rules, the markets regulator said. These norms specify that banks shall disclose to the stock exchanges divergences in the asset classification and provisioning wherever the additional provisioning requirements assessed by the RBI exceed 15% of the published net profits after tax for the reference period, and/or the additional gross NPAs identified by the RBI exceed 15% of the published incremental gross NPAs for the reference period. 
 
 Sebi has also specified a format in which banks are required to disclose such divergences to the bourses.
