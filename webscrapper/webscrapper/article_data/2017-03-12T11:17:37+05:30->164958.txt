Actress   reveals she was fed diet pills as a youngster trying to make it in  . 

 In an interview, Joan, 83, recalls how she took little green diet pills - which curb appetite - because she was 'too fat'. "When I first went there I was about nine stone (57 kgs) and the studio said, 'You're too fat, you have to lose weight.' But it was hard to do, I was 20, and I loved my food, so they gave me these little green pills."
 
 "I took them every morning. Goodness, I didn't want to eat - I didn't sleep much either! A friend came over and said, 'What are you taking, you never eat when we go out. He said, 'You can't take these, they're  , that's what hooked  '," she says.
