THANE: In a sensational revelation,   Mhatre, the key accused in the murder of Congress   Manoj  , has reportedly confessed to the police that he had instructed his henchmen to behead his cousin and bring his head to him after chopping the body into pieces. Prashant was taken into custody on Tuesday from Panchagani in Satara district by anti-extortion cell of the Thane police.

 The supari  , ordered by Prashant Mhatre, was a fallout of a long-standing rivalry between the Mhatre cousins. 
 
 In the 2012 elections to BNMC, Prashant wanted to contest on a Congress ticket from the ward from where   fought and won. Both Prashant and Manoj had over two dozens criminal cases against them.
 
 To dodge the police, Prashant was traveling only by tourist bus to Daman, Ahmedabad, Goa and finally to Panchgani, said a police officer.
 
 Prashantâ€™s technical evidences came when once he called up one of his third contact from Goa.
 
 The crime branch has already slapped the stringent MCOCA against the 18 accused in the murder of Manoj. TNN
