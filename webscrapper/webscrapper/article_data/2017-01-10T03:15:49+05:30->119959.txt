NEW DELHI: Even as garbage continues to pile up in east Delhi, a majority of employees of   are going on strike from Tuesday due to nonpayment of salaries. The striking staff include sanitation workers, engineers and administrative employees.

 There are a total of 57,000 employees under the north corporation, of which 30,000 will go on strike from Tuesday. Though doctors’ and teachers’ associations have given a memorandum to North Delhi Municipal Corporation, they will not be joining the strike.
 
 Rajendra Mewati, general secretary of United Front of MCD employees, said in the last two months the majority of staff had not received their salaries. “The situation (disruption in pay) has been the same for the past two years.”
 
 Rajendra Mewati, general secretary of United Front of MCD employees, said, “We don’t have any other option but to go on strike. Unless the corporation clears our pay, we will not resume work.”
 
 The finance department of the north corporation claims they will receive Rs 230 crore from the Delhi government by Tuesday but it will only help in clearing salaries of employees for the month of November and salaries of group C & D employees for December. “But to clear salaries for January and February, we will have to bank on the Delhi government,” said an official.
 
 With most of the north corporation staff going on strike, sweeping of roads will be severely affected. “We will not work and not let private concessionaire lift garbage from dhalaos,” said Mewati.
 
 Dhiraj N Agarwal, member of Federation of Residents Doctor of Delhi (FORDA), said doctors haven’t got salaries for the last two months. “If our problem is not sorted out, we will be forced to join the strike,” said Agarwal. Tariq Khan, member of  , said a memorandum has been given to the north corporation and if the situation doesn’t get better by January 15, then all teachers working under the north and east corporations will join the strike.
