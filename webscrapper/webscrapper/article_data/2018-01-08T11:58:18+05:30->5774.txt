AGRA: The panchayat of   village,  , allegedly tried to “force” the family of a gangrape survivor to strike a deal with the accused but her father refused to bow to pressure and lodged a complaint against the accused.
 
  According to police, the minor girl was accosted on the fateful day allegedly by four men while she was on way to her fields to pluck vegetables. They dragged her to a secluded spot and allegedly raped her.
  
  The girl’s father said he informed the villagers about the incident and sought their help to get the suspects booked. However, the local panchayat held a meeting and tried to put pressure on him not to file a police complaint. They wanted him to settle the issue and offered money as “compensation”, he claimed.
  
  The man, however, refused to accept the panchayat’s proposal and filed a complaint against the accused on Saturday. In his complaint, he said his daughter had gone to the fields with one of her neighbours around noon on January 2. Two men from the same village,   and  , dragged her away and sexually assaulted her. Two of their associates also joined them and allegedly raped the girl.
  
  Talking with TOI, senior superintendent of police (SSP) Rajesh   said cases under section 376 D (gang-rape) have been registered against six suspects. Two of them have been identified as Sonu and Dasi. He said the victim’s family had also accused two local girls of allegedly helping the four men and cases have been registered against them as well.
  
  Pandey, however, said he was not aware about the panchayat’s attempt to hush up the case by offering money to the girl’s family. “If any such thing happened and is found to be true during investigations, strict action will be taken against them,” he added.
