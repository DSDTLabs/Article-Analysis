CHANDIGARH: It is time for parents, who will be admitting their wards to schools this year, to gear up as a number of prominent schools in the city including Bhavan Vidyalya, Delhi Public School and St Kabir School will be holding the draw of lots, the week.

 As per the common   schedule, the eligible candidates’ list will be displayed on the notice boards of all the schools as well as their websites on January 16.
 
 The first phase of entry-level admission process has ended on December 12 with all Chandigarh schools, closing the process of form submission.
 
 What has been making parents worried is the number of forms submitted against a few seats.
 
 Approximately, 2150 forms were submitted against100 seats in Bhavan Vidyalaya School in Sector 33. Out of these, only 50% seats will be open for the general public.
 
 In St Stephen’s, 460 forms were received against 225 seats. St Anne’s School in Sector 32 got 1960 forms against 200 seats. In St John’s school, around 700 forms were received for 160 seats, whereas Sacred Heart and   school received around 1,000 forms in five days for 120 and 160 seats, respectively. These four missionary schools will be holding their draw of lots on January 25.
 
 “On an average, around 10-15 students are competing for one seat. So, chances are very little. It is going to be sheer luck. Our fingers are crossed,” said Sapna Kulkarni, a parent, who has filled Bhavan Vidyalya’s form.
 
 Also, no clarity on the total number of seats for the general category has become a major reason to worry for the parents. Since, most of the schools have clearly mentioned that the students falling under categories like siblings, alumni, management, staff among others will be given the first prefernce to get admitted, the parents have no clue about how many seats will be remaining for the general category students belonging to no such quota.
 
 Anandita Bhattacharya, a parent said, “I have filled the form of Carmel School and also, Sacred Heart. However, with so many forms being submitted, the competition to get into any one of these is quite tough. On top these, the schools have mentioned that the preference will first be given to different categories and then, if the seats are still left vacant, will be offered to the general category students. Let’s hope for the best.”
