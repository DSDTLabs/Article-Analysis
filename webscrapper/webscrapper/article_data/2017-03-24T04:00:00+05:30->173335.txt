Mumbai: ‘Gift’ tax provisions will not apply to property received from an individual by a  , according to an amendment made in the  , which was passed by the Lok Sabha on Wednesday.

 High net worth individuals (HNWI) commonly use family trusts as a tool for succession planning, as it provides an upfront solution to any possible future disputes that may arise, including any challenges to a will by relatives at a later date. Family trusts also ring-fence assets from any future liabilities. Shares, immovable property et al are settled (transferred) to the trust for the benefit of spouse, children and other relatives. The trust distributes income to the beneficiaries.
 
 The Finance Bill, which was tabled on February 1, had introduced clause (x) in section 56(2). It provided that receipt of money or property by ‘any person’ (which includes individuals and other entities such as   and companies) without consideration or for inadequate consideration in excess of Rs 50,000 shall be subject to income-tax in the hands of the recipient, under the head ‘income from other sources’.
 
 “The budget proposals had created uncertainty around family trusts receiving such gifts. The enacted change is extremely welcome and will bring relief to families intending to create trusts for legitimate succession planning,” says Pranav Sayta, family business services leader at  . 
 
 However, there has been no change as regards taxation of dividend income in the hands of trusts. Private trusts, including family trusts earning a dividend income of more than Rs 10 lakh a year, would pay a tax on such income at 10%.
