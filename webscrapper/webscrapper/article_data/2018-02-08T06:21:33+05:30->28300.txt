ISLAMABAD: A Pakistani anti terrorism court on Wednesday awarded death sentence to one person, life sentences to five people and jail term of four years to 25 others for last year’s lynching of a 23-year-old university student who was falsely accused of blasphemy.

 A student of mass communication,  , was beaten and shot to death in the hostel of Abdul Wali Khan University in northwestern   district in April for allegedly posting “blasphemous content” on Facebook. His half-naked body was later thrown out of the building where dozens of men started kicking and hitting it with sticks and planks.
 
 The incident shocked the nation and sparked a debate over misuse of Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.
 
 A total of 57 accused were indicted in the case. Three suspects, including a tehsil councilor of the Imran Khanled   Tehreek-e-Insaf, are still absconding.
 
 Talking to media, Mashal Khan’s father, Iqbal said he felt justice had not been delivered as the court acquitted 26 suspects despite video evidence. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM   said his government would appeal against the acquittal of 26 people. “The police is trying to arrest three absconders,” he said.
