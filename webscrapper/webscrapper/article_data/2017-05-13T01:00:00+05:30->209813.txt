The teaser of Ajith-starrer   was supposed to release at 12.01am on Thursday, but got leaked online some time before its official release time. With a section on social media blaming that the leak was from the editor’s side, the film’s editor, Antony L  , refutes such rumours.

 Speaking to us, Ruben feels that the leak may have happened due to hacking. According to him, only trusted people in the film’s team had access to the teaser’s link on YouTube and it was unlikely that any of them had caused the damage. He says, “Today, even official YouTube channels are being hacked. The leak was not from my side. The leaked version was of poor visual quality and the sound was not in sync. We are looking into this, on how this cybercrime could’ve happened.”
 
 Meanwhile, Ruben expresses happiness over the appreciation he received from  . He said, “Ajith sir had watched the teaser earlier, and had messaged me after it was officially released. He was happy the way it had come out.”
