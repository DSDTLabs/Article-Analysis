NEW DELHI:   Pushkar’s   Shiv on Saturday approached the Delhi high court opposing BJP leader Subramaniam Swamy’s plea for a court monitored probe into his mother’s death.

 The application is likely to be heard on Monday by the bench which is also hearing the petition filed by Swamy seeking probe into Pushkar’s death.
 
 In his plea, Shiv has sought to be heard as a party and argued that the BJP leader has no locus in the issue of his mother’s death. He has also urged the court to restrain Swamy and his lawyers from posting on social media, including Facebook and Twitter, the information about the case and its proceedings, saying it has adversely affected the investigation.
 
 The application also seeks directions to Swamy and his lawyers not to share information about the investigation with the media and public at large. Shiv also wants police to be directed to complete the investigation in a time-bound manner. HC has already sought a status report on the investigation conducted till now, from the police.
 
 Last week, the direction was issued by the bench after Delhi Police standing counsel Rahul Mehra informed the court that the status report of the investigating agency has been given to him in the courtroom so he wants to go through it before placing it on record.
 
 Considering the request made by Mehra, the court hads fixed the matter for August 1, while directing them to supply an advance copy of the status report to Swamy, the ministry of home affairs and the CBI. Swamy, along with advocate Ishkaran Singh Bhandari, has alleged that “inordinate delay” has been caused in the investigation “which is a blot on the justice system”.
