Television industry is extremely unpredictable. But even then,   was not prepared for what happened to her on the show, ' '. The shoot of the show, which marked her return to TV after two years, is wrapping up even before her entry has aired.

 What’s even more disappointing is the fact that Aasiya, who became a household name as Santu in ' ', and was last seen on ' ', was looking forward to a long innings as she was playing a character with grey shades for the first time.
 
 However, it was not meant to be. Launched on February 12, 'Mere Papa...', which was supposed to run for 130 episodes, will wrap up after completing just 65 episodes on May 11.
 
 A heartbroken Aasiya shares, “This show is different from the regular saas-bahu dramas. However, our journey has been cut short, and we have already been asked to stop shooting. The news came even before my entry could be telecast. I have no idea about the reason for this abrupt decision. It's quite disappointing because as an actor, I haven’t been able to get any feedback for my work. Before the audience could see me in this new avatar, the journey has already ended.”
 
 She adds, “I remember crying for three hours on the last day of 'Bandini’s shoot, as that too was wrapped up abruptly. It feels bad even when a show ends after five years. However, I prepared myself mentally as this medium is uncertain. Actors can be deeply affected if they don’t take such unforeseen events in their stride. There are times when shows keep getting extended when we are hoping they won’t or vice-versa. However, such occurrences are completely out of an actor's control!”
