If you are a nature lover, you will love this trend. London-based 19-year-old Ellie Costello started the   eye   while experimenting with freshly-plucked flowers, other bits of plants and 3D appliques.
The stunning trend, called terrarium eyes, involves sticking tiny flowers, petals and leaves on your eyelids in very delicate motions.
 This look is not for you if you can’t even get your winged liner correct. More of an   trend, it is not suitable for a daily look unless you want petals falling off midway through a date. But, if you have a special occasion coming up and you are good at makeup, then do try it. Be prepared to have your eyelids feel heavy and for the flowers to fall off while you socialize. However, it’s worth it because the end result is stunning.
