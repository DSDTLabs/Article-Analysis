GURUGRAM: A   to distribute   among residents of sectors 3, 5 and 6 of Gurgaon was held from 11am to 5pm on Sunday in Sector 5. 

 The move comes amid raging controversy over Aadhaar, which has been made mandatory by the government for availing of various welfare schemes announced by the Centre.
 
 RWA members told TOI they had collaborated with the government and were authorised to issue the cards. “Residents would be issued new cards in 10-15 days,” said Dinesh Vashisht, president, RWA, Sector 3, 5 and 6. The camp was conducted at RWA office opposite Vita Dairy in Sector 5. Vashisht said as many as 3,000 residents living in all these sectors. “A lot of people had raised concerns about not having Aadhaar cards. This issue has grown to prominence over the last few months, ever since the card was declared essential.”
 
 The camp organisers told TOI they were also effecting corrections in existing Aadhaar cards, where name or address were misspelt.
 
 “I have received requests from many people to organise this camp. We will organize them in the future also,” said Vashisht.
 
 He said the camp more than 100 people in the area visited the camp on Sunday.
