Chandigarh: Most students from the city who scored a percentile of 99 and above in CAT-2017 are from an engineering background.

 Results of Common Admission Test were declared on Monday.
 
 Except for topper Pramod Beri (21), a final-year BCom student of GGDSD College, Sector 32, who topped the city with a 100 percentile, all other 99-and-above scorers from the city are either engineers or engineering students. Apart from him, 10 students from Tricity bagged 99-plus percentiles.
 
 Vipul Kukkar (22), from Chandigarh, took the second position in Tricity with 99.99 percentile. He graduated in mechanical engineering from Punjab Engineering College, and is working in Gurgaon at present.
 
 Abhinav Bakshi, with a 99.88 percentile, is third. He graduated in BTech from Vellore Institute of Technolgy. Abhinav has appeared for IAS entrance too and is awaiting its result.
 
 Vipul, who works in Gurgaon, has already started getting calls from all major B-schools, including IIM Ahmedabad. According to Vipul, taking mock tests regularly helped him prepare for CAT-2017.
 
 While some top-scorers want to shift to MBA for a better pay package, others wanted to learn marketing skills for promoting their own talents in future. There also some who wish to do MBA for a better CV.
 
 Sophia Dhawan, a Chandigarh resident who scored 99.52 percentile, is also an engineering student. “I am a debater and have been participating in events that made me realize that I am good in dealing with people; I felt I should hone these skills by doing an MBA. Also, I like caricaturing. So, in future, I would need marketing and branding skills to promote myself. The MBA degree will help me,” said Sophia, a final-year student in Chandigarh College of Engineering and Technology.
 
 Dhawan is specializing in computer science.
 
 Shashank Saroha, a final-year student from University Institute of Engineering and Technology (UIET), PU, scored 99 percentile. “I have been working for an organization named Make a Difference; it was while working with them that I realized that I should learn marketing skills. So, I decided to appear for CAT,” he said.
 
 For Priyam Dixit, a student of University Institute of Chemical Engineering and Technology, a specialisation in finance is the next step forward. “MBA, I feel, has more scope. Also, I will get a better salary,” he said.
 
 A BSc student from SD College, Sector 32, scored a percentile of 99.25. Anmol Bansal, though, said it was a good sign that the topper was from commerce background.
