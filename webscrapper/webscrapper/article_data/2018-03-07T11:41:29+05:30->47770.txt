TRICHY: A day after TOI carried a report spotlighting the return of wall posters in a portion of   that was recently cleaned by youth,   city police swung into action and booked a case against the defaulters under the Tamil Nadu Open Places (Prevention of Disfigurement) Act, 1959.

 The four-lane Chettipalam Bridge, built over the   canal, near MGR roundabout had been serving as medium for political parties and private advertisers to paste advertisement posters and protest announcements for years. As the traffic sign, signifying that the bridge ahead is narrower than the approach road, was completely covered by these posters, youth including professionals and college students took up a cleaning drive along the 35 metre long bridge on February 25.
 
 However, a week after the drive, posters cropped up again on the bridge, much to the disappointment of volunteers who had put hours of hard work in cleaning. Subsequently, TOI carried a report titled, ‘Posters Deface Bridge Again’ dated March 5, 2018. Taking cognisance of the issue, city traffic police told TOI that a case has been registered against the defaulters.
 
 “Despite the cleanliness drive taken up by youth, we noticed posters have returned to deface the public property. So we booked a case against CITU’s district bullock cart sand carrier association for displaying a poster announcing a protest on  ,” a senior police official said. It is said that the defaulter could be penalised between Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 by the Cantonment police.
