 is excited about his ongoing movie,   for different reasons. He will be seen with actor M   and play the role of his friend in the movie. “I have finished shooting the first schedule for the film. It is an enriching experience working with Sasikumar. He is so knowledgeable and is constantly giving you new information on various subjects. He is a quiet person, but he also has a great sense of humour that is quite evident from his style of movies.I keep asking him to share his experience of working with directors, like Bala and Ameer.“

 The film is set in Madurai, and is a pucca rural subject, says Balasaravanan. “I am from Madurai, so I didn't have to work on the slang at all. But this movie is one of the best that I have worked on -for quite a different reason. Sasi sir has his own food truck from which he is provided food. And the yummy food also reaches us. The chef makes amazing kari kozhambu and fish kozhambu. His kodal kozhambu is fantastic. We binge on an elaborate meal almost every day. I guess I am going to put on a lot of weight shooting this film,“ he laughs.
 
 The director of the movie,   is the one who had introduced Bala in cinema. “I can never say no to Muthaiah sir. He is my godfather as he introduced me in  . This movie also has a good story and will have the audience enjoying the comedy portions,“ he says and signs off.
