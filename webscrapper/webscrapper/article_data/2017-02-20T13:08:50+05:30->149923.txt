PATNA: The local unit of   (ASME)   successfully conducted Contraption 1.0 at the institute campus on Sunday. 

 It was a team event in which students had to design a system that comprised various subsystems â€” each subsystem having its own function and triggering the other before finally hitting a ball. 
 
 A total of 11 teams participated in this event making it a grand success. The complexity of the subsystems and the creativity in designing the steps together decided the winners. The event was judged by final year students of mechanical engineering branch of the institute. The event was organized at the Students Activity Centre building. Team   emerged the winner whereas team Initiators was the runner-up and team   was the second runner-up. 
 
 The winners were awarded cash prizes and certificates, according to a press release.
