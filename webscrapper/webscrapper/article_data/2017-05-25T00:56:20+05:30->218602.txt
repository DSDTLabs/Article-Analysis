 A 14-year-old boy, who was waitlisted since March, received the donor’s heart, while her liver was given to a 27-year-old woman who suffered from liver disease caused by Wilson’s Disease. One of her kidneys was donated to a patient registered at Fortis, while the other was given to a patient in Lilavati Hospital, Bandra.
 
 Dr S K Mathur, who heads the  , said, “It is encouraging that donations are happening steadily. This is the fifth donation th-is month, with two donatio-ns on May 7.” While the city saw 20 families agreeing to donate their brain-dead relatives’ organs this year, only 17 resulted in transplants. While one of donors crashed, the organs of the other were not fit for transplant. The city has witnessed 58 cadaveric donations last year.
 
 A press release sent by Fortis quoted the donor’s relative Raja Louis saying, “We knew about organ donation and readily agreed to donate. While we lost her early, we believe she continues to live within four deserving people.”
