BATHINDA: Punjab Congress president Captain Amarinder Singh dared Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supremo Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday to fight the Punjab assembly elections from Lambi constituency and make it a three-way fight from CM Parkash Singh Badal’s electoral bastion.

 Amarinder’s dare to Kejriwal came a day after he had announced on Saturday that he had requested his party’s central leadership to allow him to take on the SAD patriarch and five-time CM on his home turf. The former Punjab CM said the three-way contest would be a “true test of popularity and acceptability” for the three parties in the fray in Punjab.
 
 Amarinder also announced to “politically decimate” Badal in his stronghold. He made the statement while electioneering for the February 4 elections at his ancestral village, Mehraj in Bathinda.
 
 Though Amarinder made his request to the Congress high command public on Twitter on Saturday, there has been no official word on it yet. “As I have decided to contest from Lambi, Kejriwal too should come and contest from there. He will get to know about his popularity in Punjab. Earlier, Kejriwal was asking me to contest against Badal, but I never gave heed to his suggestion. But now that I have decided to take on the CM in his stronghold, I have decided to contest and requested the party high command to let me contest from here,” he said. “If Kejriwal has any guts, he should contest against me,” Amarinder said. “I have made up my mind to contest from Lambi. I will ensure the political end of Badal.”
 
 During the day, Amarinder also campaigned in Rampura Phul constituency, and later addressed an election rally in Talwandi Sabo for party candidate Khushbaz Jattana.
