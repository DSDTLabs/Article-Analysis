JAIPUR: Police had a tough task managing people flocking to the Jodhpur court on Friday following hearings in two high profile cases—the   Khan poaching case and Asaram Bapu case.

 Incidentally, it was also the birthday of the rape-accused, self-styled godman Asaram.
 
 The morning began with Salman’s lawyers applying for bail application. Later in the day, several devotees of Asaram gathered near the same premises at the collectorate when they learned about his appearance in the court.
 
 Police had to disperse fans and devotees to maintain order. “We made elaborate security arrangements on the court premises so that no one causes any inconvenience,” said deputy commissioner of police (Jodhpur east) Dr Amandeep Singh Kapoor.
 
 Kapoor said that additional forces were deployed for the smooth conduct of court proceedings.
 
 Nanda Karnikar, a devotee of Asaram from Thane in Maharashtra, said that she had come to meet Bapu. “We have been coming to Jodhpur for the last eight years. He has been framed politically in the case,” she said, adding that she was also a fan of Salman.
 
 “I also want Salman to walk out of the jail. But, the first preference should be given to Bapu,” she said.
 
 “Until now, we had to only manage Asaram’s devotees. Now, there’s the added burden of Salman’s fans who have been coming to Jodhpur from across the country ever since he has been convicted,” said a police official.
