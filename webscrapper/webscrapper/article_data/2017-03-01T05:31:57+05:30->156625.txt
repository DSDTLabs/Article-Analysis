PATIALA:   from Sangrur,  , on Tuesday took potshots at Chautalas, calling the entire episode of the   giving a call to dig the   (SYL) canal a ‘political drama’.

 Mann, who was in Patiala to meet the party volunteers keeping a watch outside the EVM storage centres, said it was surprising that the Chautalas-led INLD did not realize the importance of the SYL canal during last 10 years when their best friends Badals were running Punjab. “Such a move could have created a political crisis for Badals here and thus INLD kept mum on the issue.” He said, “One who has hurt his finger cannot be called martyr. INLD is trying to gain political mileage over the issue without actually sacrificing anything.”
 
 Mann said that party volunteers deployed outside strongrooms were in fact guarding the future of the state. In reply to a specific question, the MP ruled out any possibility of the AAP forming any alliance with rival parties to come to power in the state. He claimed that they were already winning over a 100 seats and the question of forming government in alliance did not arise. Mann, who is on a four-day tour across Punjab, also motivated the volunteers calling them “real heroes”.
