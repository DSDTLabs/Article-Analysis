PUNE: Decks have been cleared for the procurement of 1,550 new buses by   (PMPML), with nearly Rs400 crore being allotted to the transport utility in the  .

 The funds will also be utilized for infrastructure projects, like the construction of 13 new terminals, and a depot on a 35acre piece of land.
 
 This is twice the allocation of funds compared to the Rs207 crore PMPML got last year.
 
 “Better public transport is key, hence the decision to increase the allocation funds to the public transport body has been increased,“  , civic commissioner, told reporters on Thursday.
 
 The boost in funding will prove useful as, along with the augmentation of the current BRTS projects, new BRTS projects are being planned. The body also has to develop parking spaces for buses, as new buses will be added to the fleet.
 
 Funds also will also be spent for promotion and implementation of the `MI-card' on a large scale. The cards will be used as pre-paid cards to use the multi-modal transport system. Nearly three lakh commuters, including students, use PMPML bus passes. Officials plan to convert all bus passes into MI cards. The card can also be used as an e-purse to make payments for property tax, water tax as well as parking fees, among others.
 
 “The funds will be used for all-round development of the transport body,“ said D P More, joint MD of PMPML.
 
 PMPML currently has a fleet of 1,600 buses transporting over 8 lakh passengers a day. It has 10 bus depots, 20 main bus stations, and 282 routes.
