AHMEDABAD: A 12-year-old boy  , a resident of Lambha village on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, went missing from LG Hospital on May 27. Rahul’s father, Dinesh, had lodged a complaint for his missing son on Wednesday. After initial investigations,   police lodged a kidnapping case on Thursday.

 According to the complaint, Dinesh works in a private company at   near Vatva. His younger son, Aeesh, about one-and-a-half-year- old, was admitted in the hospital. Rahul used to come with Dinesh to the hospital. On May 27, both of them went to the hospital with a tiffin box for Aeesh and his mother. “While Dinesh was inside the hospital, Rahul was playing in the garden outside. When Dinesh returned after some time, he couldn’t find Rahul anywhere,” said an investigator.
 
 “According to Dinesh, he approached the police after a futile search for his son for three days. He said he had no enmity with anyone. However, he told us that his younger brother Vivek used to visit his house often. We are also trying to find out why there was a delay in informing the cops about the incident,” added a senior police official.
 
 The city crime branch is assisting the Maninagar police in the probe. Cops were shocked when they found out that the   cameras installed in the LG hospital were not working. “Currently, we have no clues. Even the CCTV cameras installed in nearby shops couldn’t record anything as they are very far from the gate of the hospital,” said sub-inspector H I Rabari of Maninagar police station.
 
 It was in July 2008 that one of the 20 bombs planted in the city, allegedly by a terror outfit Indian  , had exploded on the LG hospital campus. CCTV cameras were later installed there. According to police investigating the kidnapping case, they have been informed that the cameras had not been working at the hospital for the past two months.
