MOTIHARI:   traffic will be restored between   and   stations of East Central Railway (ECR) from Sunday as the tracks damaged by recent floods in the   have been repaired.

 Samastipur DRM (divisional railway manager) R K Jain told this correspondent on Saturday the rail traffic in the section had been suspended since August 14 as floodwaters overtopped the tracks at more than a dozen points and washed away the soil beneath them.
 
 After the first phase of repairs, traffic was restored between Raxaul and Kundawa Chainpur stations on the route in the August last week. 
 
 After inspecting the tracks near Kundaw Chainpur on Saturday afternoon, Jain said, a decision has been taken to resume traffic on the Raxaul-Bairganiya route from Sunday.
 
 Jain said traffic would be restored between Bairganiya and Sitamarhi after at least two months as the floods washed away a railway bridge near  . A new bridge is being constructed and the tracks on the route are being repaired, he said.
 
 It may be recalled that traffic was suspended on Narkatiyaganjâ€“Gorakhpur route on Friday as the track was overtopped by rainwaters near Chamua station. The traffic resumed after seven hours.
