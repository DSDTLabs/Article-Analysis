CHANDIGARH: Girl students of Gothra   in   finally ended their   on Wednesday, after the Haryana government issued a notification upgrading the   till Class 12. The girl students had been on protest since May 10, demanding upgradation of the village school to senior secondary level.

 While announcing the upgradation of school, the state government on Wednesday also deputed a principal in the school. The admission process will commence from Thursday.
 
 Haryanaâ€™s additional chief secretary (school education) P K Das said state education minister Ram Bilas Sharma had relaxed the rules to upgrade the school as it (school) did not meet the condition of a minimum of 150 students required for the senior secondary level. The school at Gothra Tappa Dahina has 70 students in both classes.
 
 When asked about the complaint of eve-teasing by anti-social elements, Das said that besides the state government, it is also the social responsibility of panchayats and other prominent people of the village to come forward to confront such elements.
 
 Girls of Gothra Tappa Dahina have been demanding upgradation of the village school for a long time, saying they have to face harassment and fear molestation while travelling to a senior secondary school in the neighbouring village. A group of 83 girls studying in classes 11 and 12 at the school in adjoining Kanwali village, had gone on hunger strike on May 10, when the administration failed to respond their demand for upgradation of village school.
 
 Sources said the authorities were reluctant to upgrade the school initially, but relented under pressure from the girls, who went on hunger strike and the health of some deteriorated. Several political leaders had even joined the girls in their protest. Tej Bahadur Yadav, a former Border Security Force (BSF) trooper who had shared a video on social media about poor quality food served to jawans, had also announced hunger strike along with the girls.
