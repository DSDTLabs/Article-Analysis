HYDERABAD: Revealing a disturbing trend,   on Sunday said that one-fourth of the number of people who attempted suicide at the   last year were minors aged between 10 years and 14 years.

 The lake turned a watery grave for as many as 40 people over the past one year despite a campaign initiated by the police to stop people from taking the extreme step. The cops said the number could have been higher if they had not rescued around 180 persons from ending their life.
 
 However, officials are more concerned about the number of minors or school-going students who attempted suicide.“There has been a substantial rise in the number of minors trying to take their life. When we call their parents and have a counselling session, they begin to talk about their issues. Mostly, their issues pertain to schools and academic performance,“ K Sreedevi, circle inspector, Lake Police, told TOI.
 
 After students, it was women between the age of 25 years and 27 years who chose to take their life at the lake. “The women who we rescued had conflicts either with their husbands or in-laws,“ the inspector added.
 
 “There is a considerable rise in the number of people who are falling prey to depression. The easiest way to beat it is to air out their problems, rather than keeping them bottled in,“ said N Denthe, a psychiatrist.
