MUMBAI: Closed-circuit television (CCTV) at MIDCSeepz recently helped MIDC police track down an autorickshaw in which an accountant had left his company’s locker keys. 

 Loss of the key would mean that the company would have to replace the locker worth over Rs 12 lakh. Lokendra Jain later took to Twitter to applaud   for tracking down the auto driver within 48 hours of the incident. 
 
 Jain’s tweet read: “Humble thank you on behalf of   to Mumbai Police. Recently we lost the key of our office, (sic) by immediate help and investigation with CCTV footage by Mr ACP Ambadas Pawar, Sr PI Shailesh Pasalwar and PSI Hanumant Dhavan for the key’s location. Thanks for their duty.” 
 
 The jewellery unit had to remain closed for a couple of days and around 90 employees were unable to work as diamonds worth crores were in the locker. 
 
 “The company employee left the pouch containing the keys in the auto. The team managed to track down the auto driver and get back the keys worth over Rs 12 lakh,” said deputy commissioner of police (Zone X) Navinchandra Reddy. 
 
 The incident occurred on February 8 when Jain went to   to take the keys from his employer’s residence. Jain alighted from the autorickshaw at Gate No. 3 of MIDC-Seepz around 8 am. However, he forgot to take the key pouch kept on the seat. 
 
 “Around 9.30am, he came to the police station and lodged a complaint. After scanning through CCTV footage, we managed to get the auto number. We approached the   who provided us the auto owner’s number,” said sub-inspector Hanumant Dhavan. The police team then realised the owner Rajesh Shaw was in Bihar and another person was driving the auto. He was called to   where he handed over the keys.
