AHMEDABAD: For the first time, a ‘fringe’ will be part of the   of architecture, Archiprix 2017, organized at  . Known as ‘C’est la CEPT+NID’, the secondary festival will be held on the fringes of the Archiprix 2017, and it aims to recreate the historic ‘Badminton Building’ from where the school of architecture operated in its initial years from 1964. Even the   (NID) is part of the fringe, which will be held over three days from Friday.

  Events, including a musical and reading performance and exhibition, would be part of C’est la CEPT+NID, which is a celebration of the institutional memory of the Badminton Building, which is presently located between   and LD Arts College.
 
 Gavin Keeney, teaching fellow, faculty of architecture – Cept University, who spearheaded the project, said, “It was 53 years ago when faculty of architecture started from the Badminton Building. Even though it is not a part of the   at present, it has a special place in the history of the faculty of architecture. We aim to recreate the space like it was years ago through a series of photographic projections.”
 
 The building, which was originally meant to be a badminton hall, had no separate classrooms. “Classes used to be very informal over there and if one had to go from one class to another, one would pass through a few classes. There never were any corridors so we could see how others used to work and interact with them too,” said 75-year-old Mahendra Kothari, a Cept alumnus from the 1962 batch.
