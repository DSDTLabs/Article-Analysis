Vadodara: M S University has started giving final touches to the preparations for hosting 66th annual convocation of the university in which President Ram Nath Kovind has consented to remain present as chief guest. 

 A series of meeting were held at the university head office on Tuesday and Wednesday for making the necessary arrangements. MSU vice-chancellor professor Parimal Vyas, engineer N K Ojha and all the elected syndicate members personally visited the convocation ground on Tuesday to check the arrangements made so far. 
 
 Sources suggest that 45 foot area at near the podium at the convocation ground behind university head office will be cordoned off on January 22 – the day of the convocation ceremony. 
 
 “We will be issuing special identity cards for senate and syndicate members as well as gold medalists,” said Vyas, adding that special help desk will be set up for students while entry inside the shamiana will be based on invitation only. 
 
 Students however can enter the shamiana on the basis of their identity cards. There will be three entry gates including one for the VVIP guests while parking will be done at the NCC ground and hostel campus. 
 
 While three special green rooms have been prepared at Sayaji Bhavan adjoining the convocation ground for President, Gujarat governor O P Kohli and Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani, a general green room for state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama has also been set up. 
 
 The university officials have also changed the arrangements made for drinking water and soft drinks for students. Unlike previous years, the drinking water will be available for students outside the convocation ground. 
 
 Deans of faculties who usually occupy the space near the podium might be provided specific locations as per the tentative arrangement which are being finalised.
