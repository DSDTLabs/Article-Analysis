PATNA: The 24-day   will be held at Gandhi Maidan from February 4 this year. Basant Utsav, a part of the Mela, will begin on February 16 and conclude on February 27.

 People of the city can enjoy performances of Bollywood celebrities and local artists during the Mela. The event is being organised by Shri Krishna Smarak Samiti.
 
 Patna divisional commissioner Anand Kishor said the idea was to provide some entertainment to the Patnaites and bridge the gap between administration and the people. “There will be various stalls offering handloom products and handicrafts to the visitors apart from games for adults as well as kids. Food stalls will also be there for the visitors,” Kishor added.
 
 People can listen to playback singers Alka Yagnik and Vinod Rathod on February 4 and 5, respectively, while VIP alias Vijay Ishwar Lal will perform a comedy show on February 7. On February 13, Punjabi singer Lakhbir Singh Lakha will perform, followed by another performance by playback singer Tulsi Kumar on February 15. 
 
 Basant Utsav will be inaugurated by playback singer-cum-music director Amit Kumar, son of legendary singer Kishore Kumar, on February 16. On February 21, there will be ‘hasya kavi sammelan’ and on February 22, Bollywood singer Kavita Paudwal will perform. This will be followed by performances of stand-up comedian Ahsaan Qureshi on February 23 and playback singers Sadhna Sargam and Usha Uthup on February 26 and 27, respectively. Kishor said the cultural programmes would be organised after 6pm and Rs 10 will be charged as entry fee.
 
 For school and college students, painting, dance, singing and quiz competitions will be organised during daytime. “The administration will ensure proper security and parking facilities at the venue,” Kishor added.
