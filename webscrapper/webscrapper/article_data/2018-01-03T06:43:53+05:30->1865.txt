LUDHIANA: With dense   enveloping Ludhiana, the district administration has ordered all government, aided and private schools to start at 10am from Wednesday. 

 The directive will remain effective till January 12. 
 
 The additional deputy commissioner said with several accidents being reported in the recent past due to foggy weather, the decision has been taken to ensure safety of children. 
 
 Private school association member   welcomed the directive. “The change in school timings will facilitate parents, too. Dense fog early in the morning was making it difficult for them to drop kids to schools,” said Rudra.
