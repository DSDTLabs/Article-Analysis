Shrugging off protests by central trade unions, the Narendra Modi government signalled its commitment to press ahead with tough labour reforms. 

  In his   speech, FM   said that legislative reforms will be undertaken to simplify, rationalise and amalgamate the existing labour laws into four codes - wages, industrial relations, social security and welfare, safety/working conditions. Archaic labour laws have been cited by foreign investors as a major obstacle to investment. 
 
 Jaitley's comments indicate the government's willingness to accelerate labour reforms which have been on the back-burner for the past year. 
 
 The labour ministry is pushing the Industrial Relations Code Bill, 2016 and Wage Code Bill, 2016 for Parliament's approval in the ongoing budget session. Two other codes, one on social security and another on working conditions, health and safety will be brought in Parliament later, said an official.
 
 "We are keen on fostering a conducive labour environment wherein labour rights are protected and harmonious labour relations lead to higher productivity," the finance minister said, adding that the Model Shops and Establishment Bill, 2016 has been circulated to all states for consideration and adoption. "This would open up additional avenues for employment of women," Jaitley said.
 
 The Cabinet has already cleared a legislation that allows shops, malls and other establishments to operate throughout the year. The law covers establishments employing 10 or more workers, except manufacturing units, and will provide freedom to operate 365 days with flexibility on opening and closing timings. It also provides for women to be employed on night shifts with adequate security and calls for better working conditions for employees such as drinking water, canteen, first aid, lavatory and creche. Jaitley said the amendment made to the Payment of Wages Act is another initiative of the government for the benefit of the labour and ease of doing business.
