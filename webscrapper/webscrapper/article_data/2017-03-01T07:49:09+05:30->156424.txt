JAIPUR: It was not just a business proposition for 48-year-old Syed Amjad Ali and his brother Syed Faizan Ali of Udaipur as it became a source to earn blessings of more than 700 senior citizens together. The travel agency of Udaipur got the contract of air travel, boarding/lodging, temple visit and food of pilgrims under ‘Deendayal Upadhyay Teerth Yatra’ Scheme launched by the state government Tuesday. 

 Under the scheme, chief minister   flagged off the first flight carrying 30 passengers. The passengers, selected by devasthan department, would be getting free air travel, lodging/boarding, temple darshan and food. 
 
 Already mastered in dealing with Haj Pilgrim, Amjad, elder among the two, thought of submitting the tender when Devasthan department invited for it some months ago. 
 
 “I was not very sure if my travel agency will get the tenders. Finally, I was happy to see that I would be responsible for more 700 pilgrims. It was a double bonanza as one can expect to earn money and blessings together,” said Amjad while talking to TOI at the terminal 2 of Jaipur airport. 
 
 Amjad has managed for some travel guides for first lot of 30 passengers who were flown to Chennai to visit Tirupati. But he is keen to join the senior citizens as coordinator and guide. 
 
 “I will certainly get some time out to assist the senior citizens who will be visiting Tirupati Balaji, Rameshwaram and Jaganath Puri. I think such associations between two communities will help us in bridging the gap. To me, sending someone for pilgrimage irrespective of his caste, creed and community is a noble deed that also fetches some blessings,” said Amjad. 
 
 Amjad was seen interacting with the first lot of senior citizens and was clearly asking them to call him in case they find any difficulty during travel. “Bujurgon Ki Khidmat Se Bada Koi Kam Nahin hai (There is no big work than serving the elderly),” said an elated Amjad.
