BENGALURU: Chief minister   dozed off at a Kannada Sahitya   (KSP) event here on Monday, only to wake up when his spectacles slipped and fell. 

 The embarrassing moment occurred when Parishat president   was addressing the gathering after the CM inaugurated the Parishat's three-storey centenary building.
 
 Later, Siddaramaiah said the government is supporting each and every step of KSP as well as all its works related to Kannada. "I am not a writer nor do I know about literature. But I take pride in  , Kannada, its culture and literature, and it has to be so for every citizen of the state," the CM asserted.
 
 Kannada and culture minister Umashree was also present at the event.
 
  Speaking to mediapersons later,   said four designs have been shortlisted for the proposed flag for Karnataka. "The committee set up by the government to decide on the separate flag has met thrice. Various departments have been involved in the discussions and meetings. One of the four flags will be selected before taking up the matter with the central government. This will be done in one or two meetings," Baligar said. tnn
