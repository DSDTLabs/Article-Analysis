Chandigarh: Authorities of the the Manimajra-based school that had stated about assessment on its website for giving admission to classes I-VIII appeared before the Chandigarh   for protection of Child rights (CCPCR). According to sources from the CCPCR the school admitted to have mentioned the word assessment in the admission policy but said that they did not mean screening.

 “They said that they just wanted to see if the child doesn’t need any kind of help and did not mean to assess the child to give admission. We told them that they can do it later and in written assured that they will change the admission policy.”
 
 The Chandigarh Parents Commission however said that it should not believe such claims by schools as checking anything before giving admission leads to violation of Right to Education Act. No school can assess a child’s ability in any way,” said Nitin Goyal, president Chandigarh parents association.
 
 According to Section 13 of the Act, no school is authorised to collect any capitation fee while admitting a child. The child or his/her parents/guardian will not appear for any screening procedure. If the school subjects any prospective child to screening, it “shall be punishable with a fine which may extend to Rs 25,000 for initial contravention and Rs 50,000 for subsequent contraventions,” the Act has said.
 
 The school was summoned by the commission after TOI reported about this school in Chandigarh and other schools in Panchkula violating Right to Education Act by mentioning on their websites that admissions will be based on screening.
