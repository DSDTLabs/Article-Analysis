When he was behind the bars in Faridkot jail, he had posted a video shot inside the jail premises on Facebook in November, last year, raising issues concerning prisoners and farmers.
 
 The DIG, prisons, Lakhminder Singh Jakhar, replied, “If he has any proof, he should approach the authorities concerned so that it could be probed.” Denying allegations of human rights violations inside Faridkot jail,   said that the prisons department was ensuring proper security and welfare of prisoners in every jail.
