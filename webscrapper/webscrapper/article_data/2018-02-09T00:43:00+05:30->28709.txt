Barely a week before Canadian PM  's visit to India, two of his most prominent Sikh ministers have distanced themselves from news reports in India which called them Khalistani sympathisers. According to a report in The Canadian Press, Canadian defence minister   and infrastructure minister   have said that it is ridiculous to say that they espouse the Khalisatani cause. 

    chief minister Captain  , who has often called some Sikh Canadian ministers 'Khalistani', welcomed Sajjan and Sohi's statements. "This indicated that the Canadian Prime Minister had clearly sent out a strong signal within his party and the government that he would not allow his country's soil to be used for any anti-India activities," Amarinder said. 
 
  Trudeau's cabinet has four ministers with roots in Punjab - Sajjan, Sohi, Navdeep Bains and Bardish Chagger. He will be in India from February 17 to 23. 
 
  Sajjan's statement said Sohi and he "neither sympathise with nor espouse the Sikh nationalist movement, which is bent on creating a separate country called Khalistan. 
 
  Amarinder had last week said that he had no problem meeting Trudeau but he would not interact with two to three of his ministers as they were 'Khalistani sympathisers'. In April last year, Amarinder had refused to meet Sajjan during his visit to India.
