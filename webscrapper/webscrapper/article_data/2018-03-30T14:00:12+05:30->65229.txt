 has been providing us with a music that is unfailing to vaporise from our minds. That is quite evident in his films in the past like   and Puriyaatha Puthir. Now the music director embarks on his journey in Kerala through Mohanlal’s   offering the background score.

 “Soon after the release of Vikram Vedha, I got many offers including the ones from Bollywood for background score. But I am a staunch believer that I have to offer a wholesome package to a film rather than being confined to a zone. But I couldn’t refrain when I was approached   sir’s Odiyan. Such intriguing was its premise laced with non-linear narration,” says Sam CS. He adds, “It’s a thriller set against the backdrops of a particular time and region, which gave me an instant ideation to utilize the ancient ethnic musical instruments of Kerala.”
 
 When asked to talk about the unique instrumentals that he has used in Odiyan, he says, “Usually when we think of Bamboo associated with instruments, it would be a mere flute. But there is 6 ft Bamboo instrument which is known for its casting esthetical spell. We came across just one old lady who knows to play it and used her for this film.”
 
  has already completed the score for few portions even before it could be filmed. He says that he is quite excited to be a part of Odiyan team. Meanwhile, Sam CS is occupied with back to back projects that includes Karu, Gorilla, Adanga Maru, Mr Chandramouli, Vanjagar Ulagam and a few more in hand.
