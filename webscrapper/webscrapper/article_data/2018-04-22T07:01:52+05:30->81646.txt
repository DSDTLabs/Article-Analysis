PATNA: A teacher at government primary school at Usri under the   police station area in Patna district on Saturday was arrested for allegedly showing pornographic images to girl students in the classroom. Before his arrest, he was thrashed by some of the parents who had gathered at the school after getting information about it.

 Shahpur police station SHO Vikash Chandra Yadav said the teacher was identified as   (46) of   locality in Patna. He said a girl student of Class V had submitted a written complaint to the Shahpur police station. An FIR was lodged against Kalim under relevant sections of POCSO Act, SC/ST Act and Section 354A of IPC.
 
 “The 13-year-old student, in her complaint, stated that Kalim used to call six-seven girls of Class V inside the classroom during lunch and show them the pornographic images,” the SHO said. 
 
 “During lunch time, when the boys were outside the classroom, Kalim used to show the pornographic pictures to the girls,” the SHO quoted the complaint and said Kalim had been allegedly doing this for over a fortnight.
 
 He said preliminary investigations revealed that some of the girls had earlier complained to their parents, but they seemingly ignored. “Some other male students also told the police that Kalim used to show images to girls,” the SHO said.
