PATNA: The Bihar archaeological directorate has found fragments of a few ancient sculptures from the ancient fort at Devangarh in   district during excavation, which started last week.

 Senior officials in the state archaeological directorate said the   is perhaps the oldest in Bihar as the artefacts found there were from the Neolithic (from 3000 B.C. till 1500 B.C.) to the Gupta (4th-5th century AD) periods.
 
 “The excavation site is broadly divided into three components — fort, factory and temple area. We have started the excavation from the temple area and a couple of sculptures have been found,” said archaeological directorate director  . 
 
 The excavation site is spread over an area of 80 acres. The evidences of fort were first reported around 15 years ago by the then curator at Nawada museum, Awadh Kishor. Apart from identification of walls, three big statues have also been found — two related to Buddhism and one with Hinduism.
 
 “Three ancient statues found earlier from the temple area are kept at the Patna Museum. The factory area is believed to be an arms manufacturing unit as large deposits of iron slags have been found there. After excavation in temple area, we will move on to the factory area and finally to the fort area,” Verma said.
 
 The directorate had applied to the   (ASI) for excavation licence in June last year and got its approval in November. Officials said the licence has been issued for a period of one year. “Though the licence is valid till September, we might have to suspend the excavation works by June with the advent of monsoon,” he said.
 
 Verma, however, cried foul over the short duration of ASI licence. “Considering the fact that the earmarked site is spread over 80 acres, we need at least 10-15 years to completely excavate the fort. However, the ASI does not issue licence for a site after five years of excavation. Thus, we might not be able to completely excavate the Devangarh fort,” Verma said.
