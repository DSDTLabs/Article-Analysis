Chennai’s changing food scene is something that everybody has been talking about these days. Restaurants in the city offer different cuisines from around the globe. But this new place in T Nagar,  , is for those who miss the flavour of food from their grandmother’s kitchen. It offers south Indian food that uses recipes that have been long forgotten. Their menu is curated by Sangeeta and Ramya and the restaurant has been conceptualised by Sirish, while Chikky has worked on the interiors. 
 
 The CEO of the restaurant, Krish Sridhar, says “It’s divided into three different spaces. Bhakshana is a space that serves traditional south Indian feasts without artificial flavours or preservatives, whereas Bhakshanam is a quaint space that sells sweets and savouries with both traditional and contemporary twists, and are made in-house. Decoction Café serves easy nibbles and the famed filter coffee.” Its launch was attended by many from the film industry.
