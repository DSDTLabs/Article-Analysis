LUCKNOW: BJP   Kuldeep   Sengar’s wife   on Wednesday demanded a narco test on her husband and the teenaged   rape survivor to “bring out the truth in the case”. She defended her husband and claimed that he was innocent.

 Sangeeta, who is head of   panchayat, met DGP OP Singh in Lucknow and pleaded with him for the narco tests. She was accompanied by   MLA   ‘Shailu’.
 
 Talking to reporters after meeting the DGP, she refuted allegations that her husband and his aides had assaulted the rape survivor’s father which led to his death.
 
 “We are devastated and feel embarrassed in facing the society because the media has portrayed my husband as a rape accused. My children are in a state of trauma,” she said. “Police must conduct a fair probe. There is no truth in rape charges,” she added.
 
 Later, talking to TOI, she ruled out any negotiations with the rape survivor’s family who live near her house in Unnao. “There is no point in talking to the girl or her family as they have accused us in the case. We thought that we belong to the same village and share a bond, but they think otherwise,” she added.
 
 I am sad at the death of the girl’s father. There should be a fair probe into the entire incident,” she said.
 
 Asked about the whereabouts of her husband who is reportedly untraceable, Sangeeta said, “He was with me in the morning, but I don’t where he is now. I don’t know if he is hiding from media.”
