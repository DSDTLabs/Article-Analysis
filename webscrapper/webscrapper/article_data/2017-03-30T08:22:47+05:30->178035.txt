JAIPUR: With elections coming closer, the   government is going all out to woo tribals who could decide the fate of candidates in about 28 assembly segments in the Mewar region.

 The rural development and panchayati raj department in partnership with the tribal area development department (TAD) will complete nearly 25,000 incomplete   in the tribal sub plan (TSP) areas of the state.
 
 The TSP area comprises districts of Banswara, Dungarpur, Pratapgarh, parts of Udaipur and Sirohi.
 
 The digging of wells, which were taken up under various schemes in the past but remains incomplete, will now be taken up under MGNREGA, said  , additional chief secretary, rural development and panchayati raj department.
 
 He said the upper limit for a well has been fixed at Rs 1 lakh. Of this, 60% of labour and 40% of material costs would be made available under MGNREGA. The remaining amount, if necessary, will be borne by the TAD department.
 
 This scheme is meant for tribals under BPL living in TSP areas. He said these wells would not only act as a source of drinking water but also help to recharge the ground water aquifers in the region.
 
 “This scheme is not meant for deepening existing wells but those that have been abandoned mid-way due to paucity of funds under different schemes,” clarified Sethi.
 
 According to initial estimates, the number of incomplete wells in this region is said to be about 25,000, but the actual number will be known only after conducting a survey.
