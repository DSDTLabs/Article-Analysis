Ahmedabad: A city sessions court on Saturday granted further police remand for Kirit Paladiya for four more days in connection with the controversial bitcoin extortion case.

 This was the second occasion when the court extended Paladiya’s custodial interrogation. After his arrest, Paladiya was remanded to police custody for six days. On Thursday, the court extended the custody for two days.
 
 The probe agency, CID (crime), produced Paladiya before the court on Saturday and sought six more days for his custodial interrogation. The remand application stated that Paladiya holds a Binance account in which there are 119 bitcoins worth $10.85 lakh. Paladiya did not reveal from where he had purchased bitcoins and whose money he had invested in bitcoins.
 
 The probe agency stated that the bitcoins are required to be transferred from Paladiya’s Binance account to Zebpay. This transfer is a complicated and time-consuming process. For this purpose, Paladiya’s presence is required to get his Binance account opened, for he only knows the IDs of digital wallets.
 
 The CID also claimed that huge amount of black money is invested in bitcoin, and there is a possibility of recovery through Paladiya.
 
 Paladiya was a business partner of complainant Shailesh Bhatt, who alleged abduction and extortion of 200 bitcoins by Amreli police in February. Bitcoins were allegedly transferred from Paladiya’s digital wallet. He was a witness in this case earlier, but later investigators found that he had allegedly masterminded the extortion.
 
 The suspended Amreli police inspector, Anant Patel, who is an accused in this case, has requested the court to get back custody of the vehicle that CID (crime) seized from Junagadh district while he was evading the arrest.
 
 The probe agency has also requested the court to permit it to invoke Prevention of Corruption Act in this case because of involvement of cops.
