MUMBAI:   on Tuesday met special director of enforcement directorate (ED) western region Vineet Agarwal to discuss the   of Rhythm House, the Kala Ghoda music store purchased by diamond merchant   last year. Last week, on Twitter, Mahindra had suggested crowdfunding the acquisition and restoration of the   to convert it into a performance venue for rising musicians and found many takers.

 ED officials said they explained the legal process involved after provisionally attaching properties to Mahindra.
 
 After the meeting, Mahindra tweeted, “Agarwal explained the Rhythm House property currently has been provisionally attached by ED and is awaiting approval of the PMLA adjudicating authority for final attachment. He encouraged us to stay in touch & assured us he would transparently share their progress. We view the meeting as a positive development. We will now consult with specialist lawyers to map out our options in bidding for, or utilising the property for a wider public purpose.”
