New Delhi: Sixteen days short of a year into the probe in Sunanda Pushkar’s death,   filed an FIR of murder. The complainant was the investigating officer himself.

 The FIR had stated that   was a normal, healthy individual, so a natural death was out of the question. Even the AIIMS autopsy board had in its December 29, 2014, report held that it wasn’t a natural death, and that she may have been administered poison either orally or through injection, the FIR had said. 
 
 In the complaint, the investigating officer, Atul Sood, who was then the SHO of Sarojini Nagar police station, had said that he had received a call from Abhinav Kumar, PS to Tharoor, around 9pm on January 17, 2014, that Pushkar had done something in her room (number 345) at Leela Palace hotel. 
 
 Sood said that he reached the hotel with his staff and found Pushkar dead. An SDM inquiry was ordered. The FIR said that the three-member autopsy board opined that the cause of death, to the best of their knowledge, was poisoning. 
 
 The FIR had also quoted from the autopsy report and said “the circumstantial evidence is suggestive of alprazolam poisoning”. It held that all injuries were simple and caused due to blunt force during scuffles. 
 
 But these didn’t contribute to death, except injury number 10 that was an injection mar, the report said. Injury number 12 was a bite mark; and all injuries were sustained between 12 hours and four days. The report was handed over to the SDM for examination.
 
 The FIR said the viscera tested positive for ethyl alcohol, caffeine, acetaminophen and cotinine. The medical board reserved its comment on the specific poison/chemical since there were a lot of limitations in the viscera report. It was also found that Pushkar was neither ill nor suffered from any disease prior to her death. 
 
 The viscera samples were sent to the CFSL lab in Rohini to verify the presence of saliva and foreign material, and epithelial cells in her nails and other parts of the body.
