MUMBAI: The   downplayed the  's good performance in the North-East polls even as chief minister   said under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership, the party would sweep the Karnataka polls and the 2019 general election. 

 The Shiv Sena has offered a left-handed compliment to the BJP on its win in the North-East polls. 
 
 "A poll victory belongs entirely to a political party and its programmes and principles. Yet, why was such a spectacular victory not scored in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu?" asked senior Sena leader   on Sunday
 
 "The assembly poll results favouring the BJP will help the North-East join the national mainstream," Raut told journalists on Sunday.
 
 All the states in the North-East are crucial to national security. Hence, BJP's success in these states is important, said Raut. He, however, added that the poll results will have no impact on national politics.
 
 "It's relatively easier to score a poll victory in, say, Uttar Pradesh or Gujarat. There are issues such as the Ram Janmabhoomi temple and Godhra riots which help such states garner votes. However, it is a matter of pride to work in remotest states such as   and   and strike roots there. In view of this, BJP's success in these states is crucial," said Raut. In keeping with his party's 'sons of the soil' ethos, Raut said the BJP's win in Tripura was scripted by Sunil Deodhar, a Marathi 'manoos'. A senior RSS activist, Deodhar, is being largely credited with having built the BJP in Tripura from scratch. He was the RSS pointsman in the state. "We are happy that a Marathi manoos helped the BJP carve a poll victory in Tripura. He overthrew the Communist regime there," said Raut.
