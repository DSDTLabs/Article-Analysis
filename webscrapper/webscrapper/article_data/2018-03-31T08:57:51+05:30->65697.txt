HYDERABAD: As tyre burst incident on Wednesday stalled flight operations at RGIA, the airport authorities have planned to start night landing facility on its second runway. In reply to a TOI query, a   Hyderabad International Airport Limited spokesperson stated: “The airport has already upgraded the secondary runway infrastructure and informed the   in November 2017, requesting to permit night operations. The same is being examined and approvals are expected shortly. Night operations will be followed by live flight trials.”

 Welcoming the move, an aviation expert said, “This will be extremely beneficial considering the exponential increase in traffic at the   facility. At present, it handles over 400 aircraft movements every day.”
 
 On the possibility of using   airport, experts said it wasn’t an economically viable proposition. “Not only is it out of bounds as per the concession agreement between GMR and civil aviation ministry, but also not a cost-effective plan. It has limited infrastructure and will have to be revved up with all facilities,” said  , director (aviation), Telangana.
