VADODARA: The detection of   (DCB) of city police arrested historysheeter   alias Kalpesh Kachhiya’s aide Ramesh Kapadia alias Deepak Dhobi on Wednesday for threatening a key witness in three murder cases.

 The crime branch sleuths had picked up Kachhiya’s brother Jagdish alias Jago for questioning but he was not arrested. Police said that though Dhobi’s name as accused was there since the beginning, they arrested him after collecting several evidences.
 
 Dhobi will be interrogated to know who was to benefit from Parekh’s change in statement since Kachhiya was not an accused in any of the three cases. Police are also suspecting that other witnesses who turned hostile were also threatened by Dhobi.
 
 During hearing, Parekh had informed the court that he is being threatened following which the court had ordered police protection for him. However, Parekh approached the DCB with his complaint and a case was registered. tnn
