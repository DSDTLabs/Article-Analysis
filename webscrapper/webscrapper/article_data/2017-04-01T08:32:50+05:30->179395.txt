MUMBAI: The   on Friday restrained Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation ( ) from discontinuing   on 21 routes within the   (VVMC) limits from April 1.

 The court heard a   filed by schoolteachers and students saying discontinuation of bus services would cause tremendous hardship to them. MRSTC’s advocate argued that it had been providing the services for years. Between October 2011 and April 2014, of the 80 routes, the municipal corporation took over took over 52 profit-making routes and has been running them with assistance of private service providers. He said despite MSRTC requesting the civic body to take over the remaining routes, it did not. Finally in January, the MRSTC issued a notice to discontinue its bus services on the 21 routes. 
 
 MSRTC’s advocate claimed that VMMC is plying buses to places like Thane and Mulund, but not on these 21 routes as these are not ‘lucrative’. “It is the primary duty of the corporation to provide bus services,” he argued. 
 
 In its order, the bench noted that “it is not proper on the part of the city corporation not to provide bus services” on 21 routes in spite of taking over the other 52 routes, but said MSRTC will continue to serve the routes till the next hearing date. The court also directed the state government to “intervene and make the corporation realise its obligation to the public”. It added that otherwise the court “will pass appropriate orders, including appointing an administrator for the corporation. VMMC has been restrained from plying beyond its permissible limit.
 
 The bench also made an oral observation: “If they (VVMC) don’t come forward, probably we may give you all 80 routes to MSRTC.”
