Shraddha Kapoor’s maiden biopic project ‘Haseena Parkar’ failed to bring in the numbers at the box-office. The actress has portrayed a never seen before avatar of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim’s sister  . While her real-life brother   plays the don himself.

 
  
 The film which opened at Rs 1.37 crore showed almost no sign of improvement during the weekend and fell lower on Monday with the collections of just around Rs 65 lakh, as reported by Boxofficeindia.com. The film has now made a total of approximately Rs 4.87 crore. 
  
 Shraddha, who has always played girl-next-door roles in romantic films, plays the titular role for the first time as she portrays a tobacco chewing, mother of four. Ankur Bhatia plays her husband in the film.
