KOCHI: City (apartment) residents have received a breather with the district collector holding talks with tanker owners on Friday in order to ensure that they will not be stopped from taking water from supply sources in panchayats and villages. 

 The local bodies in the city suburbs had stopped tankers from taking water from the depleting sources in their areas and more than 400 tankers operating in the district were unable to supply water to apartment complexes, hotels and other commercial complexes.
 
 After meeting the representatives of Ernakulam district drinking water tankers welfare association (EDDWTWA), district collector   said the tanker owners would be allowed to take 10 trucks of water per day from sources with enough water. "The ground water department will verify the capacity of 10 wells on the banks of Periyar," he said.
 
 "Everyone has equal right to get drinking water. The government has given priority to drinking water and it must be given to all those who need it," Safirulla added. He also directed the police not to stop tankers carrying drinking water.
 
 The collector instructed EDDWTWA not to supply drinking water for other purposes. He also asked tahsildars to look into the allegations that tankers were sourcing water lying in unused quarries. 
 
 The   (KWA) provides 17 lakh litre water from its supply point at Aluva. The KWA officials has informed the collector that it would not be possible to provide more water from the supply point. 
 
 The tanker operators have agreed to clean 25 wells in the Aluva region. The tahsildar has been asked to prepare the list of wells by Wednesday.
 
 EDDWTWA president   said: "We did not go on a strike. The trucks stopped plying as there was no water available for supply. The municipalities and panchayats stopped us from sourcing water from their areas. Only three-four tankers were able to fill water from the KWA's supply point at Aluva per day."
