RAIPUR: Maoists hit security forces at two places in   on Wednesday — killing five police personnel and severely injuring eight in an attack in Abujmad and injuring another two in an IED blast in  . 

 This is the biggest attack on security personnel since the back-to-back ambushes in   in March and April last year in which 37 CRPF personnel were killed. Special DGP (anti-Naxal operations) D M Awasthi said two sub-inspectors and three constables were killed when a joint team of   (STF) and District Reserve Guards (DRG) was out on anti-Naxalite operations in the forests of Irpanar in Abujmad region of Narayanpur district. 
 
 Of late, security forces have been moving deeper into Abujmad, the last remaining stronghold of the Maoists. On Wednesday, over 60 jawans were out on an operation when they were attacked by the Maoist 6 Company around 11 am. 
 
 The forces retaliated and a four-hour-long encounter ensued. All the slain personnel are from DRG. The injured were air-lifted to   for treatment. Police said losses on the Maoists’ side can be ascertained only when security personnel return to camps.
