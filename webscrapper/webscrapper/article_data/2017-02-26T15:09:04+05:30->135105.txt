But when   and   exchanged rings on Sunday night, it looked like the couple were doing a retake of that very scene from from their first film. Social media has been flooded with memes gushing about Sam and Chai's love story since   shared the pics post the hush-hush ceremony.
'#Chaisam It's official now. My mother is my daughter now. Couldn't be happier!! Can't express my happiness in words!!', (sic) wrote Nagarjuna expressing his happiness about having Samantha, who played his mother's role in  , as his daughter-in-law. Apparently the couple got engaged in Hindu style before exchanging rings in a Christian ceremony.
 The talking point of the event was Samantha's saree which featured snapshots from their love story. The moment Chaitanya proposed, a shot from Ye Maaya Chesave, Chai's look from the movie Premam, the Akkineni family pic from Akhil's engagement besides other family pics were all embroidered on the saree.
