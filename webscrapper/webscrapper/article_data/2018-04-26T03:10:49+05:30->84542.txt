Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad administration has issued notices to three persons who were found to be engaged in   in Morti village after a complaint was filed by a   official According to the complaint, fish farming in the village, which is near the  , attracts birds of prey thereby increasing the risk of bird hits for inbound and outbound planes from air base and hence measures should be taken to cease such activities.

 “A complaint was sent to district magistrate Ritu Maheshwari by wing commander Sohaib Ahmed in which it was said that fish farming in the funnel area along Hindon Air Base poses risk to planes so the administration should ensure that such activities are stopped immediately,” said Sunil   from the fisheries department in Ghaziabad. “Acting on the complaint, we carried out an inspection in and around areas close to the air base and found that there are at least seven ponds in Morti village where villagers are engaged in fish farming. Accordingly we have issued notices to three persons,” said Kumar. 
 
 They have been given four days time to cease all such activities failing which strict action would be taken against them.
 
 According to the norms, areas that come under flying zone, including dumping grounds, slaughterhouses and fish farming are banned as birds of prey are flock around such areas in search of food.
 
 With Hindon air base to be soon used for civilian operations under regional connectivity scheme the matter seemed to have been raised by the IAF at the right time. The air base is home to   C-17 Globemaster aircraft that form the backbone of the heavy airlift division of IAF along with home to Avros and Mi-17 helicopters.
