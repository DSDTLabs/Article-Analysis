 “Usually the air quality in winter is poor but the city saw higher temperatures in the past week,” said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR. “Due to the high temperatures, the pollution had cleared up. However, the temperatures have dropped once again and the winds are extremely calm. The pollutants are suspended closer to the earth’s surface due to this.” 
 
 Among the 10 locations monitored by SAFAR, six recorded an AQI in the very poor category (between 301 and 400). The most polluted location was Navi Mumbai with an AQI of 324. The least polluted was Chembur at 77.
 
 SAFAR predicted an improvement to 239 on Saturday. “Both wind speeds and temperatures are likely to rise after the weekend,” said Beig. TNN
