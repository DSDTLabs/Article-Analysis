CHENNAI: An   has moved the   seeking a direction to the Election Commission of India (ECI) to suspend the results of the   declared on December 24, 2017 and to restrain   from acting as the legislator of the constituency in the ongoing assembly proceedings, in view of the allegations of electoral malpractices levelled against him. The allegations against him include bribing the voters of the constituency.

 In his petition, Chennai-based   S V Ramamurthy said Dhinakaran, who was an independent candidate in the byelection, had managed to win it by indulging in electoral malpractices. He was also facing criminal proceedings for allegedly trying to bribe ECI officials to secure a favourable order in the two leaves symbol case, he added.
 
 The petitioner said the ECI had admitted that it had seized around Rs 30 lakh from the constituency meant to be distributed to the voters.
 
 "Though major political parties have said that it was actually the ECI which faced defeat in the byelection and (they) have filed complaints of malpractices against Dhinakaran, no action has been initiated against him so far. Even my representation dated December 29, 2017 has not received any response from the ECI so far, prompting me to approach the high court," Ramamurthy said.
 
 The plea filed as a public interest litigation (PIL) is likely to be heard by the first bench headed by Chief Justice Indira Banerjee on Tuesday.
