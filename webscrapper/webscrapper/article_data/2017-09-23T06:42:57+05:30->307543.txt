MYSURU: The sight of kids accompanying the minister for primary and secondary education   as he inaugurated Children’s Dasara on Friday was heartwarming to behold. Paraphrasing US President Abraham Lincoln’s immortal words, Sait said, “This event is for the children, by the children and of the children.”

 Children who have made a name for themselves in reality shows – Mahendra, Arishi, Amit, Vaishnavi and Disha – inaugurated the event on Friday.
 
 Expressing his delight at the children of the   and   of the Dasara elephants showcasing their dance skills, Sait said, “It is important that these children not be deprived of education during Dasara. It is important that they too attend school and participate in cultural activities.”
 
 Emphasising the need for education to transcend lines of caste and creed, the minister called on the children not to get involved in religious conflicts. “You have to become the assets of the country,” he added.
 
 Meanwhile, mayor MJ Ravikumar asked students to stay away from mobile phones, and asked them to use this phase of their life to learn more. “Children should develop concentration skills,” he said.
 
 Deputy director of the department of public instruction BKS Vardhan read out an oath to the students. “We shall one day overcome and stop violence against children,” the oath read.
 
 An arts and science exhibition was inaugurated by Sait and Ravikumar as part of the event. Students from nine blocks of Mysuru district participated in the exhibition.
 
 The dance performances by the children of the mahouts and the kavadis, trained by K Shobhakumari, Anitha and Narendra Kumar, were probably the highlight of the event on Friday.
