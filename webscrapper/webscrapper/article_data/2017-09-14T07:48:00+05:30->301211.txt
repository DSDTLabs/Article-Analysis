Ludhiana: The Jagraon police have solved a nine-year-old murder case on Tuesday with the arrest of Randhir Singh of Sidhwan Khurd, and his partner Satnam Singh of Sidhwan Kalan. The accused had thrashed Jaskewal Singh of Jagraon to death by hitting him with a brick on 21 December 2008. The police had assumed that Jaskewal died as his motorcycle slipped on the road. That time, the police had filed proceedings under Section 174 of CrPC.

 However, after nine years, the police got leads in the case, and it has been identified that the accused had killed Jaskewal Singh following an old rivalry. The accused have also confessed to their crime. The DIG said Randhir Singh and Satnam Singh had a liquor tavern in Sherpur. On 21 December 2008, when they were going back home, they coincidently met Jaskewal Singh outside the village, who was going somewhere on his Royal Enfield bike. The accused told police that Jaskewal Singh was in an inebriated condition. They indulged in a scuffle, and later thrashed his head with bricks. Before fleeing, they dumped him on the road to make it look like an accident. Though the injured was rushed to the hospital by some passer-by, he succumbed to his injuries.
 
 Later after nine years, ASI Chamkaur Singh — deputed as CIA staff — found some information about Jaskewal Singh’s death, and he initiated an investigation. The police on Monday arrested the accused. After their confession, a case under sections 302 and 34 of the IPC has been registered against them. The official revealed that the acused Satnam Singh had a rivalry with Panchayat member Jeet Singh of Sidhwan Kalan for insulting his mother. Satnam Singh had manhandled Jeet Singh for it, following which Jeet Singh had lodged an FIR against Satnam Singh. Jaskewal Singh was supporting Jeet Singh in the case, following which Satnam and Randhir had nursed a rivalry against him too.
