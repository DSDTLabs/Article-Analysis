VIJAYAWADA: While the desire among youngsters to get their hands on a high-speed bike always exist, it is the   who should see to it that parents don not cater to such desires before the right time. Legally, under the Motor Vehicle Act, no person under the age of 16 can ride a two-wheeler and those who have attained the age can only ride a motorcycle with an engine capacity of 50cc.

Underage driving is a huge problem in the city, leading to serious road accidents. 
 
 City traffic police said that they had made it compulsory for parents to attend the counselling sessions along with their wards after the latter were caught riding two-wheelers without licences.

There is no lack of awareness of traffic rules among parents,” Rana told TOI.
