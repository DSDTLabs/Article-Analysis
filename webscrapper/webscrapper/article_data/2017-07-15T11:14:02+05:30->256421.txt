VARANASI: In a review conducted by   urban development minister Suresh Khanna last week, it was decided that local registered contractors will be engaged to complete construction of toilets in the constituency by September.
 
  So far, the constituency is lagging in achieving targets. It has been decided to engage a new agency to operate the Kadsara solid   project through open bidding by October this year. Meanwhile, the municipal corporation will ensure that all bulk generators of solid waste, like hotels and restaurants, install processing plants by September.
  
  A management plan for linking households with existing bio-methanisation plants will be executed by September. Rag pickers will be trained and involved in collection and supply of solid waste to such plants. The central urban development ministry has set timelines to achieve these goals.
  
  
 
  Among the other decisions, Varanasi Nagar Nigam building will be redeveloped to provide office and commercial space.   will submit a feasibility report in this regard by the end of next month.
  
  Under the Varanasi   Plan, the state government will identify eight locations for developing multi-level car parking by September this year. A museum-cum-culture centre on the contributions of Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya to the freedom movement and to the city of Varanasi will be developed, for which bids will be invited by November.
