MUMBAI: The   is exploring the feasibility of introducing a   for Kaali Peeli taxis in Mumbai, based on engine capacity/type of vehicle. It also wants to make fares telescopic, which means that you pay less as the distance (kms) increases. The department, on Friday, began seeking feedback from various   in MMR and over a lakh drivers. 

 The three-tier fare structure system has been welcomed by A L Quadros, leader of Mumbai Taximen's Union - the biggest union of   in the city. 
 
 The three categories could be cabs with various engine capacities - 980CC to 1200CC (includes nearly 50% of taxis), 1200CC to 1400CC and those above 1400CC, sources said.
 
 If approved, the cabs can be colour-coded as per the categories. The objective is to encourage cabbies to bring new and high-end car models on the road, and give commuters more options. 
 
 Quadros said, "Between 1965 and 1970, we had a similar fare structure, wherein there were two categories of taxis in Mumbai."
 
 The suggestions/objections, which can be given by the unions on the official website of the transport department, will be forwarded to the four-member Khatua committee that is finalizing fares for taxis and autos in the city. 
 
 An official said, "For non-AC Kaali Peeli taxis, we also want to know if drivers are ready to offer AC services at extra fares in the range of 10% to 25%. Online survey also asks unions / drivers if they are in favour of 'On-call' taxis and GPS in taxis, with a common control room number that can locate available taxis over GPS and send them to callers."
