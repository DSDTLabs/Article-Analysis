NEW DELHI: The Delhi   on Friday asked the   not to take any   against two senior   — registrar of cooperative societies (RCS)   and former RCS  .

 Justice Rajiv Shakdher, however, refused to stay the proceedings started by the House panels, adding that they are free to either appear in person or through a lawyer and issued notice on the petitions.
 
 Apart from a notice by the Question and Reference committee, the privileges committee as well had recently alleged breach of privilege and contempt by the officers and asked them to appear before it.
 
 The committee probing the alleged scam in Delhi Nagrik Sehkari Bank had called the bureaucrats along with chief secretary Anshu Prakash but Prakash got a relief from the HC earlier when the assembly undertook not to proceed against him for the time being. However, the two other officers had not been given any stay in the matter since they were not a party to the petition filed by the CS.
 
 On Friday, the court heard their plea through advocate Vivek Chib who sought quashing of the notice issued by the two house panels on the ground that the move is unconstitutional and violates the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business of the Assembly.
 
 Chib argued that the assembly and its panels have no jurisdiction to question decisions taken by the RCS in these cases as such functions are “quasi-judicial.” The petitioner officers maintained that as per the main Act, the RCS, while exercising powers of inspection and inquiry, acts as a quasi-judicial authority with all the powers of a civil court.
 
 By questioning these decisions, the assembly panel is acting as a court sitting in appeal over the RCS decisions, the two bureaucrats submitted.
