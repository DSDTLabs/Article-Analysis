Surat: A manhunt has been launched by cops for four persons who beat up a man a few days ago on the suspicion that he was a police informer.

He suffered serious injuries on head and other parts of the body and laid there for 10 hours before approaching the police. The four were booked under IPC Sections 307, 325, 324, 323, 114 and   Police Act Section 135(1) for attempting to kill Bharadwaj.
 
 A police officer said, “Victim denies any enmity with the attackers. He claims to be a police informer but we don’t have anyone like him. He may have been beaten up following a dispute over money, woman or some other thing.” 
 
 “We will question Bhardwaj again after 72 hours once his condition improves. The attackers are not coming to their houses since the incident, but we would nab them soon,” the police officer added.
