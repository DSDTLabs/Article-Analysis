Visakhapatnam: Tourists will get to relax and enjoy a view of the sea from the beach this summer vacation with Gopalapatnam-based Hashini Resorts setting up reclining seats with thatched umbrellas close to the Kalimata temple on RK Beach.

 Speaking to TOI, resorts proprietor P Vamsi said he visited Goa to study the facilities provided to the tourists there and came up with the idea to set up the seats on the city beach. “I thought of setting up thatched umbrellas over the seats to provide a cool shade in the hot summer. I spent nearly Rs 15,000 for each seat and six such seats will be provided in the first phase,” Vamsi said.
 
 He further said seven months ago he set up cloth umbrella at the beach, but due to two cyclonic storms, they were damaged. “The response was good particularly by non-locals from neighbouring Odisha and West Bengal,” he added.
 
 “We daily receive nearly 150 customers and 300 during the weekends and we charge Rs 30 per head. We also offer foot and head massage by experienced people,” Vamsi added.
 
 I Suryanarayana, a labourer of preparing the umbrellas said the dried grass (Avuru Gaddi) is brought from Salur in Vizianagaram district. The grass is generally used by village people to build thatched houses.
