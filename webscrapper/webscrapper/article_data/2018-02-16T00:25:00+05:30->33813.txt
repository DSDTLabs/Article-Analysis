Trichy: Body of a middle-aged woman was found in a decomposed state in the dry Uyyakondan canal on Thursday. Preliminary investigations hint that it could be a murder, police said. However, police said that postmortem report can give clarity on the reason for her death.

 The body was found half buried in the sludge after the canal went dry over the past few weeks. Following emission of foul smell from Quaid-e- millath Street near Uyyakondan in Ariyamangalam, people spotted the body and informed police.
 
 Police said that the body could be that of Parvathy, 35 from the same street who has been missing for the past three months. According to relatives, she had gone to the canal to take bath and has been missing since then.
 
 Examining the body, police suspect it to be a case of murder as it is unlikely to get drowned in the shallow water. Ariyamangalam police recovered the body and sent it for postmortem. Further investigation is on.
 
 Uyyakondan canal that was brimming with water a couple of months ago is now dry after water flow was reduced in Cauvery which is the water source for Uyyakondan canal.
