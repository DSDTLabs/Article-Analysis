 Canara Bank is expected to pick later this week the preferred suitor for its 30% stake, which is valued at around Rs 2,000 crore. Can Fin shares dropped 2% in a falling Mumbai market to close at Rs 530 apiece, giving the company a Rs 7,000-crore — or $1.1-billion — market capitalisation.
 
 Baring’s all-cash offer is said to have matched HDFC’s cash-cum-share-swap proposal by value. If it succeeds, Baring is expected to make a contingent open offer for an additional 21% to mop up a controlling interest in the Bengaluru-headquartered housing finance company.
 
 As reported by TOI last week, HDFC has offered to pay cash for a 14% stake and would unveil a share-swap ratio for Canara Bank’s remaining 16%. The bank is expected to offload these HDFC shares with an upside sometime later. 
 
 Can Fin has 132 branches and 20 affordable housing finance centres with a particularly strong footprint in the southern markets. Baring’s Indian portfolio includes majority ownership of IT services firm   and cash-supply management company  .
 
 Can Fin Homes was promoted by Canara Bank in 1987 and listed in 1991. It carries a legacy of an uninterrupted dividend payment since inception. It has 73% of its business coming from south India. The company’s loan approvals for the nine months ended December 2017 stood at Rs 4,307 crore — 6% higher than the same period in the previous year. For the nine-month period, the company reported a net profit of Rs 226 crore, up 37% from Rs 164 crore in the year-ago period.
