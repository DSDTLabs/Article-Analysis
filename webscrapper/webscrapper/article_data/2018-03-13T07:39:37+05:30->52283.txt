MARGAO:   recently questioned the seriousness of Goa’s BJP-led coalition government in tackling the forthcoming ‘tsunami’ that would arise March 15 onwards following the   verdict against ongoing mining leases in the state.

 Opposition leader Chandrakant ‘Babu’ Kavlekar along with Goa Pradesh Congress Committee ( ) president Shantaram Naik and South Goa district Congress president Subhash Faldesai said the party was apprehensive of the fate of those dependent upon mining, directly and indirectly. Hence, they had been part of the all-party delegation to Delhi to seek central   leadership’s intervention in the crucial mater.
 
 “But, a month since the February 7 order terming the present mining leases illegal, the government is not seriously concerned. Governor Mridula Sinha as well as the Union ministers have sought that the state government submit a proper proposal on this matter. While I wish that ailing CM Manohar Parrikar recovers soon, not a single meeting of his three-member committee regarding this important subject has been convened. The government should make its stand on the matter clear. Congress will not be a party to any attempt made to fool the public. Mining should continue and this should be the collective decision of every elected representative. We have to be united as the people will suffer. I am from the mining belt so I am aware of the hardships,” said Kavlekar.
 
 He questioned the absence of state advocate general advocate   from the all-party delegation to Delhi while advocating the need to consult legal experts and seek a legal opinion on the subject. The opposition leader further expressed his doubts over the state government’s intentions, citing the mining department’s recent orders to mining firms to halt all activity from March 13.
