Scientists are still learning about the actions of   in the body. Studies have shown that estrogen affects almost every tissue or organ system, including the heart and blood vessels. The known effects of estrogen on the cardiovascular system include a mix of positive and negative effects:

 • Increases HDL (the good cholesterol )
 • Decreases LDL (the bad cholesterol)
 • Promotes blood clot formation and also causes some changes that have the opposite effect.
 • Relaxes, smooths and dilates blood vessels so blood flow increases
 • Soaks up free radicals, naturally occurring particles in the blood that can damage the arteries and other tissues.
 
 Estrogen probably affects the cardiovascular system in other ways that are as yet undiscovered. New research continues to give scientists and physicians more information and raise more questions about this important and controversial hormone.
 
 Over the years, there is accumulated evidence that suggests that estrogen also helped to protect women against heart disease. With heart disease being the number one killer in women over age 65 years, this is an important issue. Women develop heart disease 10 years later than men, but by age 65 years; their risk is equal to that of men. The accepted thinking was that the drop in estrogen levels associated with menopause accounted for this jump in heart disease risk in women. 
 
 When estrogen levels decline; levels of LDL (the bad cholesterol) increase and levels of HDL (the good cholesterol) decrease thus leading to the buildup of fat and cholesterol in the arteries that contribute to heart attack and stroke. It made sense that replacing estrogen through Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) would potentially improve  .
