SBI Card MD & CEO Hardayal Prasad said, “It took us one year to increase our card base from 4 million in September 2016 to 5 million in September 2017. Since then, the card base has grown to 6.3 million in March 2018.”

The company has increased its market share in the number of cards to 16% from 15% last year, while its share of spend has gone up faster to 16% from 13% earlier.

 “Increase in mobile internet is driving e-commerce transactions in small towns. We are seeing close to 35% of our transactions through mobile,” said Prasad.

This is by those in the 25-35 age group and largely by millennials,” he said.
