 is ‘sporting’ a brand new look these days. And, it’s got nothing to do with personal fitness goals. The actor has been training tirelessly to play a wrestler on the TV show ' ' for the past few months. 
He says, “I started working out eight months before the show took off. I am being trained in akhada-style wrestling by those who coach Indian wrestlers for Olympics. I gained muscle mass of around seven kilos — I now have a bulky body as opposed to my previous lean and muscular self.” 
 Getting the new look, Vikkas says, has not been an easy task. “I quit alcohol and junk food. I would wake up daily at 3 am to run, and would work out, train and wrestle throughout the day. I learnt horse riding and even changed the way I walk. I have also changed my look, including my beard and my skin tone, which has become four shades darker,” he elaborates.
 With two recent B-Town films revolving around wrestlers, did he take a cue from the superstars? “I don’t want to ape anyone, but just get inspired by those who leave no stone unturned to get into their character,” he replies.
