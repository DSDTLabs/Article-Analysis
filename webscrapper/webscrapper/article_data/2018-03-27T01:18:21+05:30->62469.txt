GURUGRAM: Environmentalists on Monday were up in arms after an   structure came up in the protected  , allegedly over the weekend. TOI visited Delhi-NCR’s only sacred grove on Monday and found the illegal structure — a porta-cabin — spread over 600 sq yd, which is just 20m from a forest check post and 70m from a police outpost.

 According to locals, the construction took place over the weekend. “It came up very quickly. Material was transported on Friday and construction started immediately. By Sunday, the porta-cabin was up,” said Trilok, a local. Environmentalists alleged the perpetrator is a land owner who had been slapped a Rs 1 lakh penalty by   last year, and who has been involved in other   cases in the area.
 
 “The land owner, who was fined by NGT last year for felling trees on the same plot, has now encroached upon it. It’s proof of Faridabad administration’s disdain for   and NGT orders,” said Jitender Bhadana of Save Aravalis, who highlighted the issue.
 
 Many locals claimed such activities usually take place over the weekend in connivance with forest officials. “All encroachment attempts in the past three months took place over weekends. Forest officials are hand-in-gloves with the encroachers, as their office is closed during that period, and once the structure is up, the department needs permission to demolish it, which often means the encroachment stays,” said environmentalist Vivek Kamboj. 
 
 Despite several calls and messages, both conservator of forest (Gurugram circle) D Hembram, and district forest officer (Faridabad) Ranbir Singh remained unavailable for comment.
