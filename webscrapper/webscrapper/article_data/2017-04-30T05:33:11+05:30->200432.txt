NEW DELHI: BJP ruled out on Saturday any possibility of talks with Kashmiri separatists, accusing them of playing politics of sentiments over dead bodies, echoing the stand the government took in the Supreme Court on Friday. 

 “Separatists have only one motto — one dead body a day, so that they can play sentimental politics over the dead bodies. They use the people of the Valley as guinea pigs in their reprehensible politics of violence and separatism,” BJP general secretary   said in a post on his Facebook page. 
 
 His remarks are in sync with the stance the Centre took in the SC when it brushed aside the suggestion to have open dialogue with separatists, but seem to be at odds with BJP partner and J&K chief minister Mehbooba Mufti’s view that the option of talks should be explored in the future. 
 
 Claiming that a difficult job is being executed with sincerity by the security agencies in the state, Madhav stated that the forces and government try their best to ensure that the ill intentions of separatists do not succeed. “The Centre had told the SC yesterday (Friday) that there is no plan to hold any talks with separatists and those not loyal to India,” Madhav mentioned. 
 
 Being BJP’s pointsperson on J&K affairs, his views hold immense significance as it also brings to the fore the simmering differences between the ruling alliance partners. Saying that forces use pellet guns in rare situations as they are deemed less lethal than the normal guns, the BJP leader said the government’s stand is to tackle militants and their sponsors with utmost toughness and stone-pelters with deftness so that violence is firmly put down but care is taken to prevent loss of life. 
 
 “She (Mehbooba) might be interested in talks but we are firm on our views that there will be no talks with separatists,” a senior BJP functionary said, corroborating the views expressed by Madhav.
