NEW DELHI: Lactating mothers travelling by trains will now have the privacy of a dedicated space in 100 waiting rooms of   across the country where they can breastfeed their babies. 

 The railway ministry has informed the women and child development ministry that instructions were issued to all zonal railway authorities to create a private space in waiting rooms for women so that they can comfortably feed their babies.
 
  Earlier this year, WCD minister   had written to railway minister   on the need for private rooms for women who find it difficult to breastfeed their babies as there were no allocated spaces. Maneka cited the complaints of women travelling with babies and how they had been asking her to intervene. 
 
  In a letter, the railway board informed the secretary of WCD ministry that, "Instructions have been issued to all zonal railways on June 8 to provide a segregated area within the waiting hall at important stations for feeding babies by lactating mothers. This corner is provided with a small table and a chair with appropriate partition/screen around it. As of date, more than 100 waiting halls have been provided with this facility. " 
 
  Happy at the step, Maneka said, "  is extremely important for the health of a child. We stand for clean, safe and exclusive areas in public places where women can breastfeed their children peacefully. I hope this facility will be extended to all railway stations." 
 
 In her letter to Prabhu, Maneka had said, "When women passengers wait on stations for long hours, they cannot breastfeed their baby. They have no facilities to change their clothes as well. And this is due to lack of infrastructure at railway stations."
