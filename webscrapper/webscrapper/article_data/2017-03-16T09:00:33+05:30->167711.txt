LUCKNOW: Every third baby in private health facilities of UP is being delivered through Caesarean-section. Data from the recently released   Survey 2015-16 fact-sheet for UP presented an alarming trend of 31.3% deliveries at private hospitals being C-section, far above the  's admissible range of 10-15%. 

 The increase was noticed in private health facilities located in urban as well as rural sector. It is 37% in private health facilities in cities and 28.1% in rural areas. Against 4.4% of all child births in 2005-06, Caesarean surgeries have gone up to 9.4% of the total 5.6 crore childbirths in the state. Concern over the trend has been raised by Union minister for women and child development,  , who maintained that "gynaecologists who conduct C-section deliveries for no reason other than for making money should be shamed". 
 
 She had reacted to the issue in February while accepting a Change.org petition started by one Subrana Ghosh. Started in January, the petition has been signed by over 1.44 lakh people so far. 
 
 "Studies show that C-sections lead to higher risk of post-partum depression and lower breastfeeding rate in women and diseases like obesity and diabetes in children. Despite its adverse effects on maternal and child health, hospitals and doctors are conducting C-sections indiscriminately to make more money," the petition read.
