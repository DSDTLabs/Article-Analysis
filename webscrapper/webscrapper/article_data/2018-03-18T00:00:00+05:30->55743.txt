This one aspect of yoga has stood the test of time. It is a lifestyle change that bridges the gap between strength and calm. Suryanamaskar is great and should be practised daily. In ancient India, it was common for children to perform 5 Suryanamaskars every day as a part of the daily routine along with brushing, bathing and eating. 

 
 
 - It gives you a strong muscular back – given our inactivity and poor posture, we are losing the strength in the back which is required to keep not just the spine healthy but connect the strength in the physical body, more specifically of the gluteus, to the strength or calm in the mind. If we feel weak in our body and aggressive in our mind it’s because we don’t have a strong back.
 
 - Offers ageless, radiant skin – this is not just a cosmetic benefit but a real reflection of good health. Skin is the largest organ of our body and if the skin is healthy it means that kidney, liver, heart, all the organs are healthy and well nourished.
 
 - Hormonal balance. If there is one exercise that works directly on our glands — thyroid, adrenals, pituitary — it’s the Suryanamaskar. From optimum metabolism, pain-free periods to healthy levels of Vit D, the practice will ensure that the glands work at their best.
 
 
 
 
 -Choose a fixed place at home, preferably a well-ventilated one. Fix a time to do it daily – sunrise or sunset are good times or you can even fix your time as pre-breakfast or post-bath, whatever works best. Breathe normally and take your time to learn the correct posture, no rush. One on right, one on left together make one round. 
 
 - If you have never done Suryanamaskar before – a) Start with 2 rounds every alternate day; b) Graduate to 2 rounds every day from week 3; c) Then add 1 round to your practice every alternate week.
 
 -Tie it to a non-negotiable, for example. Say you won’t leave from home without the practice; a) 5 a day is a good number, sustain that; b) If you feel like doing 1 more, wait for 12 weeks. Train the mind to be consistent first.
 
 -Doing it regularly. Don’t take a break even on a Sunday;
  a) don’t drop below 5 or go beyond 12;
  b) The idea is to get better with every step.
 
 Paying homage to the rising sun helps better absorption of calcium and vitamin D substances. This strengthens bones & prevents bone demineralisation.
