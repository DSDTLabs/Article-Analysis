PATNA: Nearly 10,000 women from all over the state are expected to take part in a silent procession against the   bill on February 18. The protesters will start from Patna Science College at Ashok Raj Path, cross the Anjuman Islamia Hall and stop near   Mor.

 “The Bihar chapter of women’s wing of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), the Rashtriya Secular Seva Manch and 28 other voluntary organizations will urge the   government to withdraw the   talaq bill as it is against the laws of Islam,” Mahjabeen  , convener of AIMPLB-women wing’s Bihar Chapter, said on Friday.
 
 The Muslim women will raise voice against President   for advocating the triple talaq bill and describing them as “confined”. “The remarks made by the President while delivering his maiden address to the joint sitting of both Houses of the Parliament regarding Muslim women were misleading and insulting,” Naaz told this reporter and demanded revocation of the statement.
