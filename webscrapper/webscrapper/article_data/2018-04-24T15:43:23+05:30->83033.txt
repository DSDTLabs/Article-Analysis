Nagpur: There has been a considerable rise in use of helmets in city, which shows people are taking safety measure quite seriously, said assistant commissioner of police  , here on Monday.

 “Due to this, around 24% decrease in accidents has been observed in one year. This is because people are becoming more aware about regulation of traffic rules,” he said.
 
 Bodkhe was speaking at the inaugural function of ‘Road Safety Week’ held under Road Safety Mission 2018, on   premises. The event was jointly organized by RTO rural and urban. Superintendent of Police (rural) Shailesh   presided over the function. For the benefit of citizens, the RTO is hosting a weeklong exhibition on ‘road safety’.
 
 Bodkhe further said that awareness should just not be for a week but should be a regular public practice.
 
 Talking about road safety measures, SP Balkawde said, “Road safety can be effectively dealt with collaboration of three ‘Es’ — engineering, enforcement and education. While engineering and enforcement can be practised to a certain limit, proper education regarding the safety measures can assure road safety.” 
 
 He stressed on the need to instill moral values in the youngsters. He highlighted some main causes of accidents like ‘drunk driving’ and ‘violation of traffic rules’ which can be curbed by creating awareness among the people.
 
 Deputy commissioner (revenue) Sudhakar Telang, spoke on the importance of being responsible while driving. “It is the social responsibility of every driver to ensure safety while driving the vehicle. Special training programmes for people should be started,” he said. 
 
 Director (information) Radhakrishna Muli, road safety activist Shankarrao Lanjewar and many others were present in the event. Assistant RTO B Newaskar hosted the function while Vinod Jadhav proposed a vote of thanks.
