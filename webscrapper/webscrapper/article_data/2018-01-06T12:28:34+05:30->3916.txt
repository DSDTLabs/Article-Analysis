PATNA: Over 20,000 samples of veterinary   along with its packaging materials worth about Rs20 lakh were seized from   in the city on Friday. 

 The drug controlling authority and Patna police conducted a joint raid on the residence of Dr   and seized the samples. Although the use of veterinary oxytocin in blister packaging is allowed in veterinary colleges and hospitals, its sale is restricted in the retail market and is allowed only under close scrutiny of drug officials. 
 
 Drug inspector Sachidanand Prasad told this newspaper that the presence of unblistered samples, unavailability of any purchase receipt, sale invoice and raw materials prove that the hormone was meant for illegal sale in retail market. The samples were kept in different cartons while their labels were stored in separate boxes, he said. 
 
 “The area has been sealed. The raids will continue till tomorrow after which an FIR will be lodged against Dr Krishna and his medical chemist  ,” Prasad said. 
 
 Sources said Dr Krishna initially tried to mislead the raiding team when its members tried to enter the premises where oxytocin was stored. An official of the drug safety wing said usually oxytocin is injected into cows and buffaloes to increase milk yield.
 
 Although oxytocin is used in some cases for treatment, it has many adverse effects on humans due to consumption of milk and dairy products obtained from animals subjected to this injection. Medical experts point out that the use of oxytocin can cause hormonal imbalances in humans, reducing the age at which girls attain menarche from 16 to 10 years. Boys have been diagnosed with gynecomastia (breast enlargement). Children are most susceptible to its side-effects and it is known to have caused unbalanced hearing and weak eyesight.
