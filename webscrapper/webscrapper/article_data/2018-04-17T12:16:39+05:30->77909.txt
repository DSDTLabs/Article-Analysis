PANAJI: Underlying the Union government’s concern over the closure of Goa’s iron ore extraction and export industry,   secretary   on Monday said that the state and central government were in discussion to ensure that “issues could be resolved at the earliest”.

 Following an expansive discussion with Goa’s export stakeholders, which includes the mining sector, Teaotia stressed that it was vital to have “strong cooperation” between the state and central government if Goa’s beleaguered mining industry had to revive.
 
 “There is a SC directive and in order to make that work, there will need to be strong cooperation between the state government and Union ministry of mines and Union ministry of environment,” Teaotia said.
 
 The Goa government put a complete halt on iron ore mining in the state from March 16, after the   in February quashed the second renewal of iron ore mining leases given to 88 companies in Goa in 2015.
 
 A delegation from the Union ministry will meet Goa chief secretary   and other senior secretaries from the state government on Tuesday.
 
 “I think we would certainly take this up in that spirit in the discussions with the state government, but also in the discussions with the Union government, to see that these issues could be resolved at the earliest in a way that allows the economic activity to resume,” Teaotia said.
 
 There is a directive from the Supreme Court and in order to make that work, there will need to be strong cooperation between the state government and Union ministry of mines and Union ministry of environment
