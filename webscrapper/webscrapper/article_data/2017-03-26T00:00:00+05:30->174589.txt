This week’s release,  , introduces a new hero to Sandalwood and Tollywood audiences. He’s got the looks, height, and what’s more, he’s been trained by none other than director   for his debut, produced by Saanvi Pictures. “I was interested in being a part of the film industry, but my family insisted that I complete a basic education. The minute I finished my graduation, I spoke to my cousin,  , who is a producer, and while he supported me, he insisted that I get the requisite training before getting into it full-fledged. For starters, he got me to assist on his film Shivam, after which I also worked on the set of Vajrakaaya. Once I got the hang of life on a film set, I was sent to an acting institute in Visakapatnam to train as an actor,” says  .
The one-and-a-half year that he was there, Ishan not only learnt the nuances of acting, but also spent considerable time in the gym for general fitness, as well as on dance lessons. “When I finished my course, I was set to return home, but Manohar asked me to stay back, as he had fixed a meeting with Puri sir. He agreed to work with us as soon as he finished his ongoing commitments. Once he was onboard, it was decided that I would be launched in Telugu films as well,” says Ishan.
 In the months thereafter, before actual shooting began, the filmmaker ensured that Ishan was prepared for his stint in front of the camera. “Even when he was away, he continued taking a personal interest in my training and would ask me to send him videos of me emoting and mouthing lines, which he would then give me feedback on. He also sent me to Bangkok for an intense session in Muay Thai, which I found difficult at first, as I have not had any formal martial arts training before. But he insisted, and, over time, I began to enjoy those classes,” says the young actor.
