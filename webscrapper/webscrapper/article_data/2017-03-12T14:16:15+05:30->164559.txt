MANGALURU: Deputy commissioner K G Jagadeesha has issued an order barring Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited ( ) and Mangalore Special Economic Zone ( ) from lifting water from Nethravati river with immediate effect. The ban order was issued considering the low inflow of water into to the river that could lead to drinking water crisis in the city and surrounding areas in coming days. 

 Currently, MRPL and MSEZ are lifting water from the dam of AMR Power Limited located at Shamboor in Bantwal taluk in the upstream of Thumbe vented dam, the main drinking water source for Mangaluru. 
 
 “As a result of reduction in the inflow into Nethravati, the water level at both AMR dam and Thumbe dam are decreasing at a rate of 15 cms per day. The storage at AMR dam is also being reduced due to frequent lifting of water by MRPL and MSEZ. This may lead to shortage of drinking water supply in coming days. The MCC commissioner had requested me to issue directions barring MRPL and MSEZ from lifting water from AMR’s dam. Hence, I have directed officials to take necessary action to prevent MRPL and MSEZ from lifting water from AMR’s dam,” the DC said. 
 
 AMR Power Pvt Ltd representatives have already been asked to maintain maximum water in their dam at a meeting on November 5. 
 
 Mayor Kavitha Sanil, who visited Thumbe vented dam and AMR’s dam, on Saturday, said the MCC has deputed two engineers to AMR dam site. A nodal officer has also been appointed by the district administration at AMR dam site through the department of minor irrigation. The MCC will also depute security guards and staff to the site, she said, adding that lifting of water from AMR’s dam will lead to drinking water crisis in Mangaluru City. 
 
 AMR’s dam has a maximum level of 6.15 meters with 18.82 MSL of storage. While MSEZ has been lifting 9 MGD of water from AMR’s dam, MRPL has been pumping 6 MGD, Kavitha said.
