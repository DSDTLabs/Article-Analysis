PUNE: The state health department has directed Pune Municipal Corporation’s health department to conduct mosquito-breeding surveillance at all public and private hospitals located within the civic limits. 

 The directive follows recent death of a woman doctor due to dengue fever-induced complications at a private hospital in Pune. State health officials later found breeding of dengue-causing Aedes   and malaria-causing Culex mosquito at the parking basement and terrace of the hospital. 
 
 “We have directed the   health officials to carry out entomological surveillance of all hospitals and submit the report,” Sanjay Deshmukh, deputy director of the state health department, Pune circle, said.
 
 P G Darshane, assistant director, state health department, said, “We issued the directives soon after we found breeding of mosquitoes at the private hospital in Hadapsar.”
 
 When contacted, Kalpana Baliwant, head of the insect control department at PMC, said, “We have already started surveying private properties, including private hospitals. Besides, hospitals can also contact us if they want the entomological surveillance of their premises.” She added that criminal cases will be filed against the establishments facilitating mosquito breeding if they did not pay heed to the directives. 
 
 Incidentally, an entomological   carried out at state-run hospitals across state two years ago had found dengue-causing mosquitoes at 56 hospitals out of the total 370 state-run hospitals surveyed. Vaishali Jadhav, assistant medical officer of health, PMC, said some of the medical facilities in city were found to be facilitating breeding of mosquitoes in a similar survey two years ago.
