JAIPUR: In a joint action conducted by Rajasthan and Uttarakhand, two persons were arrested for allegedly manufacturing spurious antibiotic medicine in   of Roorkee district in Uttarakhand on Thursday. 

 They were manufacturing spurious life-saving drugs. “The arrests have been made under Copy Right Act and Drug and Cosmetic Act,” Ajay Phatak, state’s drug controller, health department said. 
 
 Officials have seized wrappers, packaging material, capsules and other items were found which were used for preparing spurious medicine for making them available in the market. 
 
 Phatak said that the action taken in Uttarakhand’s Roorkee is related to Rajasthan. In June’s first week, a team of drug controller had inspected a godown in Rail Nagar in Jaipur and they seized spurious drugs worth lakhs. “When we investigated into the matter, we found that the spurious medicines were manufactured in Uttarakhand. We got in touch with the officials in Uttarakhand and conducted a joint action against those involved in spurious medicine production,” Phatak said.
 
 The health department sent two of its officials to investigate into the matter in Uttarakhand. 
 
 Officials said that they have seized the material for manufacturing the medicine worth Rs25 lakh and after production of the medicine, it would cost much higher. 
 
 Spurious medicines prepared in Uttarakhand were sent to Rajasthan. The officials found that these drugs were life-saving but they were having nil content in it, so they were ineffective in treatment of the disease. If a patient consumes such medicine, it will not be helpful in providing relief to the patient. 
 
 The health department is taking arrests of two persons as a major success against spurious drugs. It managed to uproot the gang involved in making spurious medicines available in the state. The arrested accused were managing their business from rented shops in Bhagwanpur.
