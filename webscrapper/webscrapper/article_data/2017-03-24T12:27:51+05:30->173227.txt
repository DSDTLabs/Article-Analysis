LUCKNOW/ETAWAH: The ongoing crackdown on illegal   and retail shops has forced lions and tigers of   to  . Same is the  . They, too, are surviving on white meat since Tuesday.

 According to zoo authorities, they require 235 kg of buffalo meat everyday, but the supply for the past two days is just 80 kg. Lions are kept on bird-diet only till they are cubs, after that they are given buffalo meat. 
 
 At present, there are 47 wild animals including seven tigers, four white tigers, eight lions, eight panthers, 12 wild cats, two hyena, two wolfs and two jackal, which are dependent on non-vegetarian diet. All the other animals, too, who are given mutton and chicken are also relishing the different diet and seemingly enjoying the change.
 
 Delivery of meat to the city zoo has become a topic of concern for the administration ever since the ban has been imposed. Until now, a contractor from the city used to deliver the required quantity of meat, but following the stringent action on illegal abattoirs, zoo administration is now trying to roll in a contractor who can import meat from authorized sources outside the city and fulfill the demand.
 
 Officials of Etawah Lion Safari told TOI that it has been over three days since the big cats are off buffalo meat. “We are feeding mutton and chicken, but that is hardly adequate for them due to low fat percentage. It’s a lean diet for them. The average consumption of a big cat is 8 to 10 kg of beef daily, which is missing since the past three days."
