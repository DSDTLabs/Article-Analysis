NAVI MUMBAI: The   (PCMC) will float fresh tenders for an integrated approach of combining high-tech surveys of the properties under its jurisdiction. The earlier tender had got three bids, according to   sources, but there were errors in bids and hence, the need for fresh tendering. The civic body plans to   properties using  , LIDAR cameras, cell phones and I-tabs and place it on GIS platform, geo tagging relevant information for speedy calculation of  .

 The survey will also enable study of demography and help in finalising land use maps and be a step towards the final master plan.
 
 The corporation said the survey will also help to understand the type of structures in different localities and help in fixing the rateable value of the property on which the tax will be calculated. The tax will be commensurate with the type of construction. 
 
 Kuccha structures would have low rateable value.
 
 Property tax constitutes around Rs 200 crore of the Rs 1212-crore budget for the 2017-2018 fiscal. The civic body has planned for 20% realisation of the property tax in the first fiscal to keep it proportionate with the low rates paid in gram panchayat areas that have now come under the corporation.
 
 PCMC sources also said that properties in Cidco nodes will be charged the same low rate, as tax payers have been paying a nominal service charge to the planning and development body.
 
 The new PCMC jurisdiction includes Cidco nodes of Kharghar, Kalamboli, Taloja, Kamothe and New Panvel besides 29 villages and old Panvel town.
