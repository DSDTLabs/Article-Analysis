PANAJI: With just over a month left for financial year 2017 to close, the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) is making a last-ditch effort to recover nearly Rs 28 crore from various agencies to sustain its coffers.

 The corporation has now knocked on the doors of the Entertainment Society of Goa seeking recovery of Rs 22.63 lakh for services provided during the   (IFFI), 2015. Ironically, CCP’s notice came just days after the directorate of municipal administration issued a memorandum to all urban local bodies to initiate recovery of pending dues. “If the government is going to squeeze CCP, I don’t see how the city can function, forget develop,” said mayor  .
 
 Despite three previous reminders seeking recovery of the dues, ESG has failed to pay the dues. Municipal engineer Vishnu Naik has written to the chief executive officer of ESG seeking payment towards solid waste management services rendered during IFFI-2015. “It is urgently requested to make the payment,” Naik has written in the notice.
 
 Since ESG failed to pay the dues in 2015, CCP refused to lift or handle the garbage generated during IFFI 2016. ESG outsourced the work to a private agency for the event. “CCP will send a final recovery notice if they don’t reply,” Furtado said. A few days earlier, a desperate CCP issued a demand notice to pay-parking contractor Straight Deal Services to cough up Rs 24.75 lakh along with 9% interest which have been pending for nearly a year.
 
 With hardly any revenue sources, CCP has consistently posted a deficit budget with the deficit for 2016-17 standing at Rs 6.40 crore. The civic body has struggled to recover arrears from house-tax defaulters, including several government bodies. Kala Academy, Junta House and GTDC are some of the government agencies that have defaulted on house tax payments amounting to just over Rs 7 crore.
