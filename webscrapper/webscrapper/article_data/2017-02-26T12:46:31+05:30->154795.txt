IMPHAL: Union HRD minister   said Manipur CM   has no reason to question the content of the framework agreement once PM   had made it clear that Manipur's territorial integrity will be intact.

 The framework agreement was signed between the Centre and   (IM) on August 2015.
 
 "Like you believe in the   for the surgical strike against militants in Pakistan, you have to believe in your PM. Singh has no reason to ask again on the agreement once PM has allayed all misconceptions," Javadekar said.
 
 Singh had demanded to make the agreement document public after Modi at a BJP rally here on Saturday said the framework has nothing against the state.
 
 Javadekar also said that the PM had also discussed with   president on the framework before signing.
