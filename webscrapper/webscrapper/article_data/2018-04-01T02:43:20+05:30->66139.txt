NEW DELHI: Police are on the lookout for the owner of an   based in  , who allegedly cheated around 50 students of approximately Rs 70 lakh. 

 The academy had promised jobs to the candidates, most of whom are from  , as flight steward and cabin crew after a six-month course. Each student was asked to pay Rs 1.6 lakh as the course fee.
 
 DCP (Dwarka)   said a case for cheating has been registered and they are investigating the matter. A preliminary probe revealed that the representatives of the institute visited Jammu and Kashmir and advertised about jobs in the aviation sector. 
 
 Ghulam Rasool Bhat, whose son is among the many who were conned, said that the institute’s representatives conducted a test, following which 50 youths were shortlisted. “They accepted admissions for various categories such as flight attendant, steward and ground staff but our kids found that everyone was given the same syllabus,” Bhat said, adding that most of the students paid the full fee.
 
 The parents alleged that the institute then started suspending the students on various grounds such as indiscipline and poor performance in the class. As the course was about to end, all 50 students were made to fail in their exams.
 
 The owner of the academy promised the candidates that they would get jobs next year and allegedly refused to return the money. 
 
 A student shared that the company later offered to get them jobs at duty-free or other retail outlets at the airport. The institute later asked the students to get their passports made as they would get jobs in foreign airlines. But, nobody got any jobs.
 
 Investigating officers said they are checking the recognition documents of the academy along with the course matter, which would be vetted by experts for more details.
