PATNA: ‘Kshitij-Mere Pankh Mera Aasmaan’, an educational institution for   run by schoolchildren, organized an art and painting exhibition for fund raising at Maurya Lok on Wednesday.

 Students from Patna Women’s College and JD Women’s College donated more than 90 paintings and handicraft items for the exhibition. Children of the educational institution also put up their handloom products at the exhibition.
 
 The institution is the brainchild of   of St Michael’s High School,   of   and Vaishnavi of Holy Mission School. They study in class XII and started this institution on May 24, 2016. Around 100 underprivileged kids study there.
 
 “It was very exciting to know that we could actually help someone with the art created by the college students. We collected more than Rs16,000,” Salman said.
 
 “Before starting this institution, we did a survey and   parents to send their kids to schools rather than engaging them in manual labour. Most of them complained that their kids didn’t learn anything in school. Then we decided to start our own institution. We run it in two shifts. The first is for the students who go to government school and another is for those who have never been to school,” Salman added.
 
 They run the institution in a slum area near Strand Road. “There is a small flat owned by a non-government organization, World Vision. They train women in bangle-making. We coordinated with them and they allowed us to take classes in the evening. Many students, who never went to school, are all set to take admission this year in government schools,” said Aryan.
 
 “Every day, nearly two hours are dedicated to teach these children from this locality. We have a bunch of volunteers, who are interested in spending time with these children and help them develop their personalities. When we get together for a cause, change will happen,” Vaishnavi said.
