Ludhiana: Mayor Balkar Sandhu seems to be following his predecessor Harcharan Singh Gohalwaria by conducting the Finance and Contracts Committee (F&CC) meeting without nominating two other members. The first meeting of F&CC is going to take place next week, and officials have been told to prepare the agenda for the meeting. The councillors were pressing the mayor for giving approval to development works of their respective wards, and under their pressure, he has decided to conduct the meeting.

 Former mayor Harcharan Singh Gohalwaria had also conducted meetings without nominating the members for years, and at that time, Congress had raised a hue and cry in every house meeting and otherwise. Mayor Balkar Sandhu was nominated the member of F&CC after almost two years to the formation of the previous MC house. Now, when Congress has come into power, they are repeating the same things.
 
 The mayor said they were supposed to complete the quorum for the meeting, and it would be completed with the presence of mayor, senior deputy mayor, and deputy mayor, and the commissioner would also be there. He said they would nominate two members, but after some time. Sources revealed that on Tuesday, Local Bodies minister Navjot Sidhu has asked the mayor to conduct meetings and give approval to development works, because many councillors were angry over non-development of their respective wards. Mayor Sandhu on Wednesday refused to approve any development work in anticipation, and asked officials to put works in the agenda to be discussed in the meeting.
