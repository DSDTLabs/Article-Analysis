Owner of a voice that incessantly spoke for the minorities till his end it is perhaps destiny that E Ahamed spent his last hours of public life inside the sanctum sanctorum of Indian democracy, listening intently to the words of the president. He was always in the forefront of protests when the fascist government acted against the interests of the people.

 Even though he was a Malayali, Ahamed gained his name taking up the issues faced by non-Keralites.
 
 When imperialist nations bullied Palestine, he went there to profess solidarity endearing himself to the people and their cause.
 
 He was many things at once, litterateur, orator, administrator, diplomat, continental sojourner, Indian ambassador to the Arab nations. IUML as a party is indebted to him for raising its stature nationally and making it know internationally. He prided himself for being a contemporary of veteran leaders such as Seethi Sahib, Bafaqi Thangal, Pookoya Thangal, C H Muhammed Koya and my father late Muhammed Ali Shihab Thangal.
 
 In the history of development of Malabar, Ahamed is a name that cannot be erased.
 
 His signature is writ large in the development of Ponnani and Malappuram. Ahamed's interventions positively influenced achievements like the establishment of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) South India centre at Perinthalmanna, Haj House at Karipur, passport office at Malappuram, the increase in haj quota for the pilgrims from the state and development of Karipur airport.
