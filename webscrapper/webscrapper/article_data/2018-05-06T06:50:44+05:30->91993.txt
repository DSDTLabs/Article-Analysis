BENGALURU: What matters when you vote? For 296 of 300 Bengalureans who turned up for the mock poll conducted by Citizens For Bengaluru (CfB) at   on Saturday, it was not caste, religion, politics, money or muscle power that makes a difference.

 
 They voted for ‘namma issues’, sending across a message that caste and religion do not have an impact on them when it comes to election.
 
 “It’s our vote for our welfare. The election narratives, however,deal with all other issues apart from the necessary ones. We want a directly empowered mayor,” CfB member   said.
 
 Krishna Panyam, a member of  , a resident welfare association (RWA), said the initiative aims to show the government that people are aware of the issues that exist. “Most people here are some sort of activists. Hopefully, this will raise awareness.”
 
 Kannada actor Chetan said: “What plays the main role in elections these days is, unfortunately, money, caste and other things. This was a poll based on the actual concerns of people. It’s important that there’s an insightful approach to polls.”
 
 
 
 Saad Khan, director of Humble Politician Nograj, said: “The government lacks a sense of ownership. There’s a scarcity of power and water. With more and more people entering the city, it’ll become more difficult.”
 
 
 In October 2017, CfB had held   and prepared a manifesto that was distributed to all parties. It highlighted issues faced by city-dwellers relating to water, traffic, planning, garbage, sewage treatment, governance and pollution.
