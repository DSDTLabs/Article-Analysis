GURUGRAM:   of   Phase 1 (extension) on Sunday demanded   surveillance and women guards after a   was allegedly molested by a security guard on Saturday evening.

 “We’re terrified by the   incident. Steps should be taken to increase CCTV cameras in the area. Also, I think having women guards will help a lot,” said Gunjan Sharma, a resident. “It happened in front of me. The guard was drunk and on a cycle. He hit the woman deliberately, passed lewd comments, and molested her,” said another woman resident, requesting anonymity.
 
 Residents also said security has worsened in the last year. “Now, eve-teasing has become common here. Involvement of a security guard raises question on security of women in the area,” said another resident. Her view was contested by representatives of the RWA of Qutub Enclave, a society within the area, who claimed security has been lax of late because of the forthcoming takeover of maintenance by MCG. “The area was inhabited since the 1980s. Yet, this is probably the first case of a security guard being blamed for molestation. However, I checked with police and was told no complaint has been filed yet,” said Dhruv Bansal, spokesperson of QERWA in DLF Phase 1. 
 
  “Reportedly, a couple visited a clinic in DLF Phase 1 (extension). On their way back, the woman collided with the bicycle of a security guard. The couple and the guard got into an argument, after which a PCR reached the spot and took both parties to the police station, where a complaint was reportedly registered. Even though we don’t know what exactly happened, we have decided to dismiss the guard on Monday,” Sudhir Kapoor, president of DLF City RWA, told TOI. The security agency which was hired by the RWA has also been hauled up, he added.
 
 “Though a complaint by the couple from Chakkarpur village was received, both parties decided to mutually settle the case after they were brought here,” said a cop at DLF Phase 1 police station.
