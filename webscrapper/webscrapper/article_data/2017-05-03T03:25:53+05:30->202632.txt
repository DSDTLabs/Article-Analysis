Gurgaon: Police on Tuesday started a campaign to “sensitise youths” in the city, named  , and approached both men and women to apprise them about the ills of   and misbehaviour. 

 Police teams, including women officers, were formed, which went around the city, mainly in Civil Lines and Government College for Girls in Sector 14, and met the youths. 
 
 “We met college girls as well as working women and explained to them that if someone harasses them, they should shout, call the women’s helpline (1091) or Dial 100,” said Kailash Devi, SHO, women’s police station.
 
 Devi added they also spoke to men who lurk around these places and educated them about the need to ensure a safe environment for women. “We told them they are responsible for the safety of women, and should work to make the city a safe place for them, as they would have done for their sisters and mothers,” she said.
 
 “We’ve already formed a few teams. More will be set up in the coming days for quick response to   from women, who are harassed or teased on the road,” she said. These teams will patrol the city in all-women PCR vans. In the coming days, the drive will be conducted near Metro stations, bus stops and colleges.
 
 Devi said the teams will try and identify women who are in trouble. “Young girls are often lured by men and accompany them without realising their intent. It’s not that all men are criminals, but we’ll try to identify women in trouble and take action against suspects,” she said. She added that in case of confusion about consenting couples, cops will speak to the women and assess the situation. She assured no one will be troubled without legitimate reason.
