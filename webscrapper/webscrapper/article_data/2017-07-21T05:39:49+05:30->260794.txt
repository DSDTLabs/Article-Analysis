NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi shared a 20-year-old photo with the family of Ramnath  , acknowledging his old association with the President-elect.

 “20 years ago and the present.... always been a privilege to know you, President-elect,“ tweeted Modi, sharing two photos, one of a wedding reception of Kovind's son and a recent one in which the PM is seen with Kovind and his family members. Before he took over as Gujarat CM in 2001, Modi was   national general secretary and in-charge of UP. On his visits to the state, Modi regularly interacted with Kovind as the two often moved together. Kovind was president of the BJP SC Morcha and Rajya Sabha member twice.
 
 
  
 
 Possibly to send across a strong message about how the party has endeavoured for the uplift of Dalits, BJP president Amit Shah trumpeted Kovind's social background as he tweeted, “It is our great privilege that first time BJP had an opportunity to nominate a President on its own, a member of Dalit community was chosen.“ Hailing his victory as “historic“, Shah said, “It's a victory for the poor, downtrodden and marginalised sections.“
