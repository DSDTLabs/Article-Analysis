Jaipur: The   police investigating the disappearance of nine-year-old Naitik Bansal said that the boy was murdered by his neighbour Ram Singh who threw his body in jungle where wild animals may have devoured it.

 An official in the district police told TOI on condition of anonymity that the interrogation of accused Ram Singh, who ran a repair shop next to Basnal’s father, had abducted the boy for extortion and killed him before throwing his body in jungles of Langra.
 
 The police had roped in drones and commando units to track the body, but in vain. The officials are now claiming that Bansal’s was eaten up by stripped hyenas that populate the area.
 
 “There have been previous two examples where bodies were thrown into the same jungle as we still could not recover them,” the official informed TOI.
 
 The local police have claimed that the accused admitted to killing the boy and dumping his body in the jungle. The police’s theory, however, came into questioning when it took the accused to the spot where he had admitted to have dumped the body.
 
 At the “crime spot,” the cops were able to recover only the boy’ trousers and there was no clue of the body. “It is suspected that Ram Singh dumped the trouser here while threw the body somewhere else so that the police could not recover it,” an official informed TOI.
 
 For the parents of Naitik Bansal, the last 14 days have been nothing short of a nightmare. With no clue of their son’s body, they have been demanding justice for their son.
 
 “We did everything we could to find the body. We suspect that the accused tried to mislead the police and dumped the body and trousers separately. But our investigation is not our, we are still searching for him. But I suspect that he has been killed,” the official informed TOI on the condition of anonymity.
