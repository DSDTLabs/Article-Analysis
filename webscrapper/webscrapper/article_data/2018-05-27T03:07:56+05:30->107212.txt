MUMBAI: Small-time actress  , whose family left her destitute during sickness, died in   old age home at Veera Desai Road, Andheri, on Saturday. She had claimed to have performed a bit role in the film ‘Pakeezah’ (1972). 

 Sr Pramodini HM of Jeevan Asha said, “She died a heartbroken woman. Kapoor was depressed when she was brought to us June 1 last year, and kept waiting for her son who never came. We needed four or five attendants to carry her and care for her since she could not walk. She became weak as she refused to eat in the last few days.” 
 
 Activist Ashoke  , who along with film maker   had funded the actress’s medical treatment, tweeted, “Standing besides the dead body of actress Geeta Kapoor who was abandoned by her kids in SRV Hospital a year back, breathed her last at a suburban old age home today morning (sic). 
 
 We tried our best to keep her healthy but her wait for her son and daughter made her weaker day by day.” Pandit said her remains would be kept at Cooper Hospital, Vile Parle, for two days hoping her children would come and perform the last rites “Otherwise we will bid her a dignified goodbye,” he wrote.
