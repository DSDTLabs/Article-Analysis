CHENNAI: Even as Tamil Nadu has hit a hat-trick of sorts by retaining its top position in attracting the highest number of domestic and international tourists in the country for the third consecutive year, the state-run   corporation has witnessed a decline in occupancy rates in its hotels and fleets and fairs.

 The annual review report of the Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation (TTDC) also revealed that income has decreased on all counts, including lodging and catering. The report was tabled in the state assembly on Wednesday.
 
 The occupancy rate in TTDC hotels has dipped by 9% in three years. While the average occupancy rate in the (TTDC) hotels was 60% during the financial year 2013-14, it has dropped to 51% in 2015-16. The corporation operates 53 hotels across Tamil Nadu.
 
 The occupancy in TTDC’s fleet of vehicles too has suffered a setback, going down by 13% in the last three years. The occupancy in 17 buses operated by the tourism corporation was 64% in 2013-14 and shrunk to 51% in 2015-16. As far as the number of   to the annual India   and industrial trade fair at the Island Grounds in Chennai is concerned, the numbers have dwindled by 33%. The report said the fair registered visits of about 7.88 lakh people in 2015-16, though it had recorded 11.68 lakh visitors three years ago during the fiscal of 2013-14.
 
 On the other hand, the graph of footfalls of foreign tourists visiting Tamil Nadu has been witnessing a growth between 2014 and 2016, with the state receiving about 4.65 million and 4.68 million foreign tourists in 2014 and 2015 respectively. It jumped to 4.72 million, the highest in the country, during 2016, as per the data of the Union tourism ministry.
 
 Experts observed that TTDC has failed to tap the potential tourists to its facilities due to the absence of an effective marketing strategy. M Charles, president of the Tourist Guides’ Federation of South India, said lack of standards in TTDC hotels was a major issue., “(TTDC) hotels are situated in prime locations. But lack in standards particularly on the hygiene front. Quality of services and food should be improved," Underscoring that Tamil Nadu was a pioneer in the country by launching a corporation to promote tourism in the early 1970s, he saidadding that the state lacked a good marketing strategy.
 
 When contacted, TTDC officials said the drop in occupancy rate in hotels and visitors to the trade fair during 2015-16 was owing to the unprecedented floods in December 2015. "It had an impact on the number of tourists visiting the state in the following couple of months. Our hotels maintain 100 per cent standards," a TTDC spokesperson said.
