ALAPPUZHA: With the poll campaign hotting up in   assembly constituency, fronts are looking up to the votes of first-time voters. The constituency, where a bypoll is scheduled to be held on May 28, has 5,039 first-time  , which is a sizeable number considering the slender margin of victory in the 2016 election. In 2016, K   of LDF won from Chengannur by a margin of 7,983 votes.

 Though candidates are hopeful of mustering up fresh votes, many first-time voters are not much excited about the bypoll. Twenty-year-old Mobin C   added his name in the voters list and secured voter’s ID card last week. However, when asked about his first opportunity to exercise his franchise, Mathew, a degree student, said, “I will cast my vote but I am not seriously observing the political developments here. I decided to take the voter’s ID card after some politicians visited my home and told me to get it. I don’t know more about our candidates. I will lend my ears to elders to understand the situation here and will take a proper decision’’.
 
 Majority of the first-time voters said their constituency was not facing much problems.  , 19, an ITI student, said Chengannur was a developed place. “However, the interiors of the constituency face issues like shortage of potable water. So the new MLA should give importance to such issues,’’ he said.
 
 Anandu Mohan, 18, another ITI student, is clear about his maiden vote. “I will cast my vote for LDF. We want the developmental projects like reviving of rivers, taken up by late MLA K K Ramachandran Nair, to continue,” he said.
 
 Jithin Varghese, 20, a BTech student, said, “I am not much interested in politics. However, the bypollhas triggered political debates among our friends circle. My friends and I are very excited to vote.”
