NEW DELHI: The slow pace of construction of military infrastructure along the northern borders with China, in terms of strategic roads and railway lines needed for swifter mobility of troops and equipment will be among key issues to be discussed during the biannual   commanders’ conference to be held here from April 16 to 21.

 
 Officers said the conference, chaired by General  , will also deliberate upon “management of security dynamics, mitigation of future security threats, enhancement of combat edge over potential adversaries and optimisation of limited budget to ensure making up of critical deficiencies in ammunition”, among other issues.
 
 The conference comes at a time the Army is bracing for a “hot” summer, both along the 778-km Line of Control with Pakistan where fierce firing duels have become the daily norm and the 4,057-km Line of Actual Control with China.
 
 India has managed to complete only 28 of the 73 ‘strategic’ all-weather roads, with more east-west lateral links as well as better access routes to strategic peaks and valleys, identified for construction along the   almost two decades ago, as reported earlier by TOI.
 
 Moreover, the construction of 14 ‘strategic’ railway lines on the fronts with China and Pakistan, which was approved by the defence ministry in 2010, is yet to take off despite the Army identifying three lines in the north-east and one in J&K as top priority.
