How sample pictures of a prosthetic mask (see above) shared on a photosharing website unwittingly ended up giving a sneak peek of NTR’s negative role in his upcoming film, makes for a funny story. Apparently, an aide of   make-up artist,   posted the pictures on his instagram account a couple of days ago. As luck would have it, a Telugu cine fan happened to see them and shared them online, hinting that this is NTR’s look in his upcoming film directed by  . And within minutes the pics went viral, much to the chagarin of the filmmakers.
We have learnt that this is one of the many sample prosthetic masks that Vance and his team are working on for NTR. “Vance Hartwell and his team have created many sample masks and these are just one of them.   hasn’t yet zeroed in on the look,” informs a source in the film’s unit.
 Well, these pictures have certainly raised the expectations surrounding the first negative role NTR is playing in his career.
