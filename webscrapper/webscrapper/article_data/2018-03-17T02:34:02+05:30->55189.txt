NEW DELHI: Police probing the   believe   orchestrated it from inside   Jail through his aide,   or Amit. Police have learnt that Tajpuria was there at the crime scene too. 

 Tajpuria and Tillu are from Tajpur village in outer Delhi and have been close associates for years. After Tillu was jailed, the responsibility of the gang fell on Tajpuria’s shoulders. But rival gangster   emerged as a bigger problem. 
 
 Last year, the Gogi gang bumped off two Tillu gang members, who had been working as guest teachers during the day. Then on January 15 this year, Gogi, his close associate Kuldeep Fajja and a few others killed Tillu’s close aide, Ravi Bhardwaj, by shooting him 30 times in full public view in Prashant Vihar. 
 
 This was when the Tillu gang decided to regroup and take on the Gogi gang. In the last one month, members of both gangs went underground fearing attacks and came out only for emergencies like court appearances. Friday was one such time. 
 
 The two gangs have been at loggerheads since 2013 during the Delhi University students’ union elections. Gogi escaped from custody in Bahadurgarh in 2015 while being taken for a court hearing. Since then, he has been hiding in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, and comes to Delhi only to commit crime. He has a reward of Rs 2 lakh on his head. 
 
 Police now suspect revenge strike by Gogi. Sources said Tajpuria and others might surrender to save their lives. Gogi, however, continues to dodge the police.
