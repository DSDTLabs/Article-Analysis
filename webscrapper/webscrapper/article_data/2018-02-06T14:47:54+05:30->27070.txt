NEW DELHI: A BJP lawmaker from Hyderabad has said those who don’t go to the daily meetings held by the   – called ‘shakhas’ - aren’t Hindus as far he’s concerned.

 The lawmaker,  , said the “RSS is a factory” that produces “icons” like PM Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh CM Adityanath. He made this comment on Sunday at a meeting in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh.
 
  “I request all of you to enrol yourself in nearest branch of RSS. Any Hindu who doesn’t join RSS isn’t a true Hindu and is thus incapable of serving our nation,” said Raja Singh, to a large crowd gathered at his rally in MP’s Neemuch district.
 
  
  
 The BJP lawmaker further said that everyone living in India must say ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ and ‘Vande Mataram’ irrespective of their religion or else they are “free to leave this country”. He alleged that no country in the world would tolerate people hailing an enemy country or hailing terrorists.
 
 “No other country will tolerate anyone chanting ‘Bharat Mata ki jai’ but we have people in our country who say ‘Pakistan zindabad’ and hail terrorists like Afzal Guru,” he said. Guru was a Kashmiri separatist, who was hanged in 2013 after being convicted in the 2001 Indian Parliament attack.
 
 Raja asked Hindus to work for the betterment of their religion by fighting “evils” like love jihad and what he alleged are paid conversions by Christian missionaries.
 
 “If Hindus want to do something for society, they must create awareness against love jihad and paid conversions of tribal people,” he said.
 
 Raja, who is MLA from Goshamahal in Hyderabad, then launched an attack on the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen leaders, Asaduddin and Akbaruddin  . He claimed that they built property worth crores in US by dividing Hindus and Muslims.
 
 
 
 “Muslims are becoming anti-nationals because of the Owaisis. They should understand that these brothers are playing dirty politics and will continue to do so. People must not fall into their trap,” Raja said.
