MADURAI: Seeking to stay elections scheduled on various dates in April to the 18,775 co-operative societies in the state and to conduct fresh election by preparing a fresh voter list, a public interest litigation has been filed before the Madurai bench of the Madras high court. 

 When the case came up for hearing before the division bench headed by justice C T Selvam the bench adjourned the case by two weeks. 
 
 The petitionerâ€™s counsel told the court that the government set up the   State   Commission in 2012, following which the first election took place the next year. In that election, the   members alone gave applications to become members of the societies while members of other political parties and general public were not allowed to become members. 
 
 Besides, many of the members swindled public money from the societies in the last five years. Now, the joint registrar of the co-operative societies issued a notification to hold election to the 18,775 co-operative societies.
 
 But, members of the AIADMK alone are again permitted to become members of the societies. Hence, it was necessary to cancel the election and to direct to conduct election by preparing a fresh voters list by including members of the other political parties and general public, the counsel said.
