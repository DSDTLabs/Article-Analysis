TIRUPUR:   saris manufacturers and weavers in   are worried about the abnormal trend of silk yarn price as it was affecting the industry.

 “If the governments fail to take steps to control the inflation, it will affect 4 lakh labourers including 2.5 lakh indirect labourers in the industry in the state,” said the manufacturers.
 
 In Kangeyam, around 3,000 silk handlooms are operated by the weavers, who produce soft silk saris and other dresses. 90% of the weavers here would utilise Indian-made silk yarns for weft and China-made silk yarns for warp. Rest of them utilise Indian-made silk yarns for both the weft and warp, said  , advisor of Kangeyam Silk Manufacturers Association.
 
 Now, one kilogram of weft silk yarns costs around Rs 4,300-4,500. It was only around Rs 3200-3300 five months ago. In case of warp silk yarns, it costs around Rs 5,200-5,400, which was only around Rs 4,100-4,300 five months ago. Normally, the price fluctuations would be around Rs 200 averagely in a season in both the warp and weft silk yarns because of low production in winter season. The rate would start to come down in February, he said.
 
 But this year, the price has shot up abnormally and even there was no sign of decreasing. “Though silks were extracted in various parts of the country, Bengaluru and few other places of   are the major market for silk yarns. We strongly suspect that the silk yarn manufacturers could have artificially increased the prices,” he added.
 
 So, the central and state governments should intervene and reduce the silk yarn prices, he urged.
