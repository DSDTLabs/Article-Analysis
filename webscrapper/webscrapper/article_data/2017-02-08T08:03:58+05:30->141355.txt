PUNE: The Poona Blind Men’s Association has received a   from Japan government’s main overseas development arm — the   (ODA).

 “Japan has extended an assistance of Rs 5.08 crore ($79,498) to The Poona Blind Men’s Association, a non-governmental organization, to provide medical equipment to H V  ,” a statement from the consulate-general of Japan in Mumbai, which facilitated the donation to the NGO, said.
 
 The association runs the H V Desai Eye Hospital, which operates mainly on charity. The hospital conducts thousands of eye surgeries and many more optical examinations every year. Most of the procedures are done at subsidised rates or free of cost for the needy.
 
 Officials from the NGO said the donation amount, which will be spent entirely on procuring new equipment for diagnosis and surgery, will help in expanding their operations further and in conducting more operations free of cost.
 
 “The grant will be used to buy a phacoemulsification machine, auto-refractometers, and operating microscopes, among other equipment needed in eye surgeries. We do around 37,000 surgeries at our hospital every year, and a few more at Nandurbar and elsewhere. With the help of the grant and more equipment, we can reach out to more people,” said   (retd), chief medical director, Desai Eye Hospital.
