CHENNAI: Railways officials were left in a quandary on Thursday morning after two buffaloes, among a herd of six that had strayed onto the elevated   tracks at Chepauk, were   over by a train. Four more buffaloes were injured. The incident was the first of its kind where a herd managed to sneak onto the tracks and walk for more than 3km on an elevated corridor. Officials suspect the herd must have entered the track from between   and  , and walked till the Chepauk station.

 The challenge for officials, however, was to rescue the injured animals and remove the carcasses, as the overhead traction left little space for cranes to carry out rescue operations. A team of railway officials and   volunteers who attended to the injured animals had to wait until the services closed at 10.30pm in view of the peak evening hour and absence of lights on the track.
 
 Railway officials said the buffaloes were hit by the first MRTS service from   to Beach that passed Chepauk station around 6.30am. “The visibility was very low at that time due to which the motorman could not notice the buffaloes walking on the track,” a railway official said.
 
 Following the accident, the station master at Chepauk alerted the subsequent motormen to go at ‘caution speed’.
 
 After first aid, the injured animals were pushed to the sides of the tracks with the help of specially designed sledges, said Blue Cross general manager  . They have been sedated for the time being.
