NAVI MUMBAI: Regular   are starting from   to   (Gharapuri) from mid-April. The   move means residents of Navi Mumbai, Thane and Raigad need not travel to the   to take a boat to the World Heritage Site caves. 

  "We expect to start the service from April 15. Licencing and scheduling will be approved by our regional office in Thane soon," said Mora port officer Arvind Sonawane. 
 
 At Mora, a traditional fishing port at Uran, a private tour operator has been given permission to start with an initial fleet of four large boats with a capacity of 150 passengers each. The travel time will be around 30-40 minutes, compared to 60-70 minutes from the Gateway of India. MMB has decided on a fare of Rs 120 (roundtrip) for adults and Rs 80 for children. 
 
 Many Navi Mumbaikars were sceptical about Uran as the Mora jetty can be reached only by road, which sees heavy container trailer traffic thanks to the proximity to the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust. "The authorities should explore the possibility of launching services from Belapur," said Vashi resident Charanjeet Singh.
 
 At the moment, a private operator runs a limited ferry service to Gharapuri from Belapur on weekends from a floating jetty. "We have not charted out any plan for a ferry service from Belapur as there is not jetty, unlike at Mora. But  's marina project at Belapur has proposed a jetty," said an MMB official. Train and metro services are planned from Navi Mumbai to Uran. 
 
  The Mora ferry will be especially useful to residents of Uran as many have businesses at the   and had been demanding a regular ferry for years. "We are delighted... Travelling in private boats has always been a risky affair," said Uran resident Ram Trimukhe.
