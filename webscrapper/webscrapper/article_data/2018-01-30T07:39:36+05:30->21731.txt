 LUCKNOW: The mismanagement of parking facilities at   continued to cause inconvenience to visitors and organisers on Monday too with vehicles being parked in ‘no parking’ zones.
 
 Absence of adequate signage to designated parking lots and the distance from there to the main entrance made people flout norms. The cars parked in   zone were towed away and their owners had to pay Rs 1100 in fine.
 
 Vehicles were parked near main entrance and on the other side of the road, while the parking areas were vacant.
 
 Not just private vehicles, but even government vehicles were seen parked illegally near the main entrance.
 
 When asked,  , driver of a government official’s white car said, “There are no signs for parking spots.”
 
 “If the parking was at a distance, there should have been some facility to ferry visitors from there to the main gate. Many of us have problem in walking and breathing in this mud,” said Mukul Raj Singh.
