HYDERABAD: Aam Aadmi Party ( ) activists allegedly   and damaged his car at the Rajiv Gandhi International   parking lot on Sunday night. 

 The AAP cadre reached the airport to receive party MLA   on Sunday night. An altercation broke out between the activists and an air passenger, who was exiting the parking bay in a WagonR, the RGIA police said. 
 
 RGI Airport inspector Mahesh said the AAP cadre did not give way to the passenger. “When the car owner honked, the activists picked up an argument. Later, they manhandled him and damaged the car. We found that the car owner was the victim,” he said. A petty case was registered against the AAP cadre, but action is yet to be initiated. 
 
 When contacted, AAP leaders refuted the charge and gave a contradictory version. “When Somnath came to the parking area, the person (in WagonR) came out with a rod and damaged a car we arranged for the AAP leader besides injuring two of our activists,’’ AAP spokesperson PL Vishweshwar Rao told TOI.
