Nagpur: With   coming up,   ( ) is not happy with the scheduling of BCCI’s  , which will be held on March 12, just a couple of days ahead of Irani Trophy, in New Delhi.

 Vidarbha are playing their first Irani Trophy at their home ground from March 12. Sources said the team management and the officials are not happy with the timing of the conclave. The conclave was supposed to be held on March 2 but postponed due to the festival of Holi.
 
  sources have also confirmed that they have finalized the date. “One day won’t affect Vidarbha’s preparations much. We have lot many things to look for the next season and we need enough time in hand,” a top BCCI official said.
 
 The BCCI official, however, didn’t clarify why the conclave couldn’t have been held after the Irani Trophy match. While it won’t affect the Rest of India side—none of their players are captain of their respective state sides—Vidarbha’s preparations will be marred by the absence of coach   and skipper  .
 
 “BCCI should have kept the Irani Trophy in mind before scheduling this conclave. They could have scheduled it after the match,” sources in VCA told TOI on Tuesday.
 
 Vidarbha officials are thinking of taking up this issue with the board. “We are going to discuss this with the BCCI. Both Pandit and Faiz have been an integral part of planning the strategies throughout the season. Their absence, at that moment, will hurt us,” he said.
 
 Pandit, also a former India wicketkeeper, is a meticulous planner. He goes into the match with all bases covered up, including the wicket and the strength of the opposition. “Pandit is also upset with the schedule. He generally prefers to stay with the team, especially before a important match. He didn’t go for the dinner outside the hotel during the knock-outs despite various invitations. For him, winning is everything,” the sources said.
