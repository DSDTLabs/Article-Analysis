NAGPUR: A massive fire in electrical appliances repair shop of   at Mount Road, Sadar, on Wednesday caused losses wohth Rs25 lakh. The fire was reportedly caused by short circuit. 
 
 The fire broke out in the workshop that repairs household appliances like refrigerators, air conditioners, microwaves, and washing machines shortly after noon. It took ten fire tenders about three hours to control the blaze. Several blasts were also reported as compressors in the appliances started exploding. The sound of blasts could be heard all along Mount Road extension. The fire destroyed almost the entire workshop that had tin roof. 
  
 Fire brigade was informed of fire at 12.35pm. It was spreading rapidly as papers, furniture, and appliances caught fire. An employee said, “We saw flames so rushed outside, we then tried to save some of the ACs that had just arrived but by then the blasts had started.” 
  
 NGDA is run by Behram and Dorab Patel, fire brigade said. 
  
 It is learnt a few days before a fire had broken out at the same place. There was no fire fighting equipment at the workshop.   sources said the workshop had no fire NOC which is mandatory. This incident again exposed the casual approach of NMC’s Fire Department towards allowing work places with low fire safety. 
  
 Raju Dubey, station officer of Civil Lines, told TOI, “There were two LPG cylinders that were brought out of the workshop in time by the firefighters. Otherwise it could have been a lot worse.” 
  
 A local resident who witnessed the fire pointed out that rampant encroachments and extension of sheds of shops obstructed the passage from   to NGDA from the back which prevented the fire tenders from moving freely in the area.
