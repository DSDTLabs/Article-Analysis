Whether it was  ,   or Sonakshi Sinha’s  , you can tell an   film from the way in which the action sequences are fused with the narrative flow. And if the teasers of   are anything to go by, looks like the filmmaker has pushed the bar even further. “The film has a lot of action sequences that will leave the audience awestruck,” assures Mahesh. But there is one sequence in particular that left the superstar himself astonished. “It was a massive set with about 1000 junior artistes and about 400 harness bound ladies jumping and flying around. A small mistake could’ve resulted in someone getting hurt, but thankfully it was brilliantly orchestrated. It unravels on screen like a beautiful story. I’m sure it will also leave the audience spellbound,” remarks the actor.
The most spectacular stunt sequence of the movie, however, is the climax episode, reckons Mahesh. “In the film, the scene is set in Chennai, but we shot it in Vietnam for over 25 days. It was a massive set with lots of artistes involved and it plays out amidst collapsing buildings,” recalls the actor, adding, “We shot back-to-back so it was very rigorous. I used to be drained by the end of the day. It was so intense that I had a physiotherapist with me on the sets 24x7; he’d tend to me after 
 almost every shot. Yet, I couldn’t get up for a week after the shooting schedule.”
 Despite all the physical stress, apparently the actor chose to do all the stunts himself. Why? “That’s where the real fun lies, right? Only when you do the stunts yourself will the intensity translate on to the screen. When I saw the output it made all the hardships worth the while,” he says. 
 Ask him if he went through a special physical regime to get into the skin of his character, Shiva, a spy, and Mahesh says, “Not really, I’ve always been a fitness freak and my regimen is set. I don’t touch carbs, except once in 15 days maybe.”
