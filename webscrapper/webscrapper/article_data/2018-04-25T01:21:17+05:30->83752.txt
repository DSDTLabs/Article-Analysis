Erode: To save elephants and alert drivers of vehicles, the forest department has placed 15 signboards on Bhavanisagar-Mettupalayam state highways in the district. The signboards read ‘Elephant Crossing Zone’ with a cutout of an elephant.  Herds of elephants cross Bhavanisagar-Mettupalayam state highways. Similarly, leopard, tiger, deer, peacocks, wild boars also cross the road in the stretch.  According to an official in the forest department, many motorists, especially heavy vehicle drivers, are not aware of the elephant corridor on the stretch and they drive their vehicles at maximum speed. They could not control the vehicles when an elephant herd crosses the road.  Though there is no man-animal conflict in the stretch, saving elephants is the prime concern of the forest department and naturalists, the official said. “To avoid conflict and to create awareness among the road users, we have erected the signboards,” the official added. The signboards also instruct motorists not to drive fast and not to venture into the forest even for nature’s call.  The forest department has planned to issue pamphlets to motorists in Tamil, English and Kannada to avoid killing elephants and other wild animals on the road.
