AHMEDABAD:   on Monday sought a report from the   (Crime & Railways) and the   (RPF) chief over a complaint alleging connivance of RPF and Government Railway Police (GRP) personnel with pick pockets and bag lifters.

 The issue regarding the safety of passengers on trains came before the high court after one Mohammed Akil Shaikh from Surat filed a petition demanding a thorough probe into alleged connivance between security personnel and thieves.
 
 Shaikh lost his mobile phone on Surat railway station last October when he had gone to see off his relatives. The thief was caught by the public and they handed over to police. 
 
 The man was, however, allowed to go by the cops and Shaikh was allegedly manhandled by them. 
 
 The cops did not register his complaint that security personnel had connived with the thieves. Following much insistence by Shaikh, police registered his FIR, but did nothing to investigate the incident.
 
 Shaikh moved the HC through advocate Chirag Upadhyay and requested the court to direct higher authorities to probe the connivance of security personnel with bag lifters and thieves at railway stations and on running trains. He demanded departmental action against the erring officials.
 
 After hearing the case, Justice J B Pardiwala said, “Very serious allegations have been levelled against the RPF and GRP acting in connivance with pickpockets and bag lifters at railway stations and in running trains. This petition is one concerning the safety of the public at large, more particularly, those travelling in the trains. The matter requires serious consideration.”
 
 The court issued notice to the authorities concerned and sought reports from CID head Ashish Bhatia and the RPF chief by January 24.
