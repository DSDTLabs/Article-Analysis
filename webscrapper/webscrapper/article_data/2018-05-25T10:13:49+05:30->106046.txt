PANCHKULA: A retired colonel living in Sector 20 was duped of Rs 3.50 lakh by his neighbor on the pretext of taking loan for a week as he had to show money in his bank account to obtain visa for going abroad.

 Col (Retd) S K Chauhan (45) alleged in his complaint that his neighbor   had approached him on August 20, 2017 and requested to loan him Rs 5 lakh for a week to augment his bank balance to fulfill the conditions for getting visa.
 
 At first, Chauhan gave him Rs 3.10 lakh. Later, Kalsi’s wife Preet approached Chauhan’s spouse Renu, and took Rs 40,000 from her. After three months, when Chauhan asked   to return his money, Kalsi handed over a cheque to him which bounced in the bank.
 
 Chauhan then gathered more information on the duo and came to know Kalsi and his wife were involved in various frauds. He immediately filed a police complaint, following which the cops booked the duo under relevant sections of the IPC.
