MADURAI: As many as 3,284 nominations have been received for 230 co-operative societies, for the first phase of elections that is scheduled to be held on April 2 in Madurai district. A total of 852 co-operative societies in the district will go to the polls in four phases.

  vice-president,   co-operative employees federation,   said the first two phases of the elections for primary co-operative societies would go on without much ado, as the members usually elect the representatives after a consensus. “The first three five-year plans had good fund allocations and the societies also did a lot, but now there is a lot of political interference, and it is always the ruling party which would have the upper hand,” he said.
 
 The chairmen of the primary societies who will be elected in the first four phases, will then elect the members of the   in the next phase and they will then elect the members to the state co-operative society.
 
 Amarnath said the co-operative societies could perform as well as a local body in any region, as they looked after the needs of the locals, both socially and economically. “There used to be days when a representation in the co-operative society was a must to gain entrance into a full-fledged political career and councillor and   seats were given only to people who had been a member of a society. Now, the situation has reversed, where people who fail to get a councillor or MLA seat are trying to become members of the society,” he said.
 
 It was in these societies that women were also given proper reservation, even before the other electoral bodies. There are some societies like the Goripalayam Women’s Tailoring Co-operative society, which was is operated by all-women, he said.
 
 The trade union societies will go for the election in the third and fourth phases, when the real problems and controversies will start among the ruling and opposition parties, he added.
