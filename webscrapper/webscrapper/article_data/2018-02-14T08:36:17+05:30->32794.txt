LUCKNOW : Almost 28 years after  's   demanding construction of the Ram temple in  , another   was flagged off from   in the temple town on Tuesday. The yatra is being organised by the Maharashtra unit of Kerala-based Sree Rama Dasa Mission Universal Society. 

 The Rath - designed like the proposed Ram temple model - would take a 41-day journey, crossing six states, to reach   in Tamil Nadu on March 25 (Ram Navami), tracing the route said to be taken by Lord Rama in Treta Yug during his exile.
 
  While Faizabad BJP MP Lallu Singh, Ayodhya mayor Rishikesh Upadhyay and   international secretary general Champat Rai were part of a programme held before the yatra, it didn't attract many people, with Karsewakpuram ground recording thin attendance. 
 
  A surprise attendee was Yakub Habeebuddin Tucy, a self-claimed descendant of Bahadur Shah Zafar. He was dressed in embroidered Sherwani and padgi. "I apologise on behalf of Timur, Babar and all Mughal rulers with respect to Indian temples. We will work together with VHP and Sunni Waqf board to build the temple," he said. 
 
 "Ram Rajya was the dream of Gandhiji, Deen Dayal Upadhyay and Ram Manohar Lohia. It is known for best governance, and that's what all Hindu organisations want," Lallu Singh said. "The yatra is being taken out to push for a five-point demand-construction of Ram temple, setting up Ram Rajya, inclusion of Ramayana in school syllabus, change of weekly holiday to Thursday from Sunday and declaration of a 'World Hindu Day'." 
 
 Head of the Kerala-based outfit Swami Krishnanand Saraswati said, "Ashok Singhal was a good friend and he did his best for the temple. But I feel disappointed because even now we are thinking of building the temple. We are not getting land for it in India. Land is given to Christians, Muslims and even atheists, but not to us." 
 
 "Only the party which prioritises Ram will form the next government in the country," he added.
