LUDHIANA: Punjab director of school education has ordered an internal probe after an anonymous letter accused a senior officer of Ludhiana district of sexual harassment. Ludhiana deputy district education officer (elementary)  , who has been accused of harassing a woman teacher, has termed the complaint false and an attempt to “defame and mentally harass” him.

 While the anonymous letter was sent to director of school education, the investigation was marked to Nabha circle education officer (CEO). In a letter dated February 1, the CEO has asked district education officer (elementary) Jaspreet Kaur to send Kuldeep Singh to join the inquiry on February 7.
 
 The letter written, a copy of which is with TOI, states that the department had received a complaint form a woman teacher against deputy DEO (elementary) Kuldeep Singh. Kaur confirmed that she had got the letter from CEO office. “However, the department has not sent a copy of the complaint to me. I have been told it is an anonymous complaint,” she said. 
 
 When contacted, Kuldeep said the education department had earlier announced that it would not entertain anonymous complaints. “However I am ready to cooperate with the department for any kind of inquiry,” he said.
 
 In another case, on January 30, Punjab secretary of education Krishan Kumar had marked an inquiry to the director of public instructions (elementary),  , over a tussle between staff under the banner of   Union (Sekhon) and deputy district education officer (secondary) Kuldeep Singh. At that time, teacher unions had accused the deputy DEO of harassing woman staff with false complaints, while the deputy DEO had accused the unions of defaming him. 
 
 The official had also filed a police complaint, accusing 17 teachers, some unidentified, of defaming him and hatching a conspiracy against him. However, police never converted the complaint into an FIR.
