RANCHI: The state higher and technical education department plans to provide aid to private   to develop infrastructural facility and increase the gross enrolment ratio of the higher education institutes. 

 Sources in the higher education department said the government plans to provide up to Rs 6 crore to private engineering colleges and around Rs 3 crore to private polytechnic institutions to help them upgrade their laboratories and use smart technologies in their classrooms. There are 11 private engineering colleges and 16 private polytechnic colleges in the state. 
 
 Department secretary Ajay Kumar Singh said, “The funds will be given to the existing colleges in instalments. An amount of Rs 2 crore and Rs 1 crore will be given as first instalment to engineering and polytechnic colleges.”
 
 The department has laid down a host criteria for the institutes to be eligible for the aid: The institutes need to be recognised by   (AICTE) and have their financial statements of past five years audited. The colleges also need to be affiliated to state board of technical education.
 
 The second instalment will be given to colleges only if it is accredited by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA).
 
 Once the grant is provided to the colleges they will have to ensure that students from the state are enrolled in 60% of the total seats for a span of five years.
 
 The department will also provide land to new colleges planning to set up their campuses in state if they get AICTE recognition.
 
 “The national gross enrolment ratio is 23.6% while the state ratio is 13.4% only. We aim to increase this ratio to up to 30% by 2018, and for this we want more private colleges in the state,” Singh said.
