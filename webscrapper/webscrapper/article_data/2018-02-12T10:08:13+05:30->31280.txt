CHANDIGARH: Do you know whether a coconut shell falls under the category of dry   or wet waste? Or whether sanitary pads are dry or wet waste? A group of students from the environment studies and centre for public health of   (PU) has taken it upon themselves to make people aware of waste segregation. They have put up a stall at the   rose garden festival, which concluded here on Sunday.

 Now, given the seriousness of the issue, the students have devised a unique way to attract the attention of the participants. They have designed a game to inform the people of garbage segregation. There are different types of waste at the stall and people just have to put the waste in the right bin. There are three types of bins – dry, waste and hazardous.
 
 Now, those who got it right were also presented with a sapling as a gift. 
 
 “Earlier, we thought of starting a campaign to apprise people about the two-bin system and waste segregation. But then we thought we should start from the   at the university. A lecture or a seminar does not teach you as much as a game like this can do because practical knowledge is always better. It is quite surprising to know that even women don’t know that sanitary pads should be segregated as dry waste,” said  , a research scholar of environment studies, PU. 
 
 “The students of the Centre of Public Health, PU, are also checking the body mass index (BMI) of the people. They are also apprising them about obesity and telling them ways to cure it,” said Goyal.
