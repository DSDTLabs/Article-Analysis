KOLKATA: An early morning accident involving a   bus, an app cab and a mini truck left at least three persons, including a pregnant woman, injured. The incident was reported around 5.55am on Saturday at the Diamond Harbour Road-Remount Road crossing. The impact left not only these three vehicles damaged, but even a shop — Biswanath Warehouse —completely destroyed.

 According to locals and police officers, the WBTC bus plying on route 7D ( ) was speeding towards Mominpore from the Majherhat side. The driver, Ranjit Chakraborty, saw the yellow light blinking and thought he could cross over before the light turned red.
 
 “However, since it was early morning, the signal at this less crowded crossing kept blinking. The driver of the app cab, carrying a pregnant woman from  , was trying to take a right turn towards Behala from Remount Road. The cab driver,  , did not stop and the bus driver swerved to the right to avoid a collision. In the process, though, the collision could not be avoided. The bus kept to the right and probably the steering got locked. The bus hit a mini truck and then smashed against the shop,” said an officer recounting witness accounts and CCTV footages.
 
 “I woke up with screams of men and women. I rushed out to see my shop — standing here since 1974 — completely damaged. The bus driver later claimed his steering wheel got locked,” said  , the shopowner.
 
 The victims were rushed to different hospitals. Bus passenger  
 
 (42) was treated and discharged from CMRI. The app cab driver and bus driver were admitted to ESI Thakurpukur, where they too were treated and discharged. The driver of the mini truck could not be traced. A case in this regard has been registered by the Alipore police.
