BENGALURU: Seven months after  , grandson of late politician  , was booked for ramming his   SUV into a Maruti Omni and injuring six people, police are yet to file a chargesheet. Investigators say they’re unable to establish who placed the ganja in his car.

 The police, who had arrested Vishnu after the incident near South End Circle, had found 100gms of ganja in his car, prompting them to also book him under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. 
 
 In normal cases, a chargesheet must be filed within 90 days of filing the FIR, and in some special cases, generally involving terror and other serious crimes, police are given 180 days. When they cannot file the chargesheet within 180 days, they need to seek the court’s permission to extend the period.
 
 Vishnu rammed the Omni on September 28, 2017 and was shifted to   from where he escaped next day. He surrendered before police on October 4 and a local court granted him bail next day. Initially,   police from south division handled the case. On September 30, police commissioner T   transferred the case to the Central Crime Branch.
 
 Suspecting Vishnu to be under the influence of alcohol and drugs, Jayanagar police had sent his blood samples to the forensic science laboratory. Stating that the reports would reach them soon, police said they would file the chargesheet.
 
 While Vishnu claimed that he had nothing to do with the ganja found in his car and he doesn’t know how it landed there, police also failed to establish its owner. They are neither able to produce evidence that it belongs to Vishnu nor establish who placed it there.
 
 “There is no material evidence for the ganja. So far as the chargesheet goes, we’ve received blood samples of Vishnu but we need clarification on the blood report and are waiting for more inputs from the FSL. Once that comes, we’ll filing the chargesheet,” a senior officer said.
