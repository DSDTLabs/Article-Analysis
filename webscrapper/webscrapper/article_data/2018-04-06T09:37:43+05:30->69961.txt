HAVERI:   and former minister   tendered his resignation as a legislator and said he would join the   in the presence of party national president Amit Shah on April 7 or 8.

 After submitting his resignation letter to assembly speaker K B Koliwad at the former’s residence at Ranebennur in Haveri district on Thursday, Guttedar told reporters that he has decided to join the BJP as “Prime minister Narendra Modi has given clean governance in the last four years.”
 
 Guttedar alleged that he was sidelined by   even though he was elected six times from Afzalpur in Kalaburagi district. “The Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha and Kalaburagi MP Mallikarjun Kharge’s son Priyank was a first time MLA and yet he got a ministerial berth. Kharge does not allow anyone else but his family members to grow. I brought this injustice to the notice of the Congress high command several times but they did not respond,” he said.
 
 Guttedar accused Kharge of quarantining honest Congress leaders and workers for the past several years. “Kharge has been giving preference only to those who serve him personally. When chief minister Siddaramaiah had given me the charge of the Karnataka Housing Board, the board was suffering from a loss of Rs 600 crore. During my stint as the chairman , it has earned a profit of Rs 700 crore. Still, my contributions were not recognised,” he alleged. The speaker accepted his resignation right away.
