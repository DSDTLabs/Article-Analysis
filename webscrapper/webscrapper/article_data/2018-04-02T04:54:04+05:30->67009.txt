NAVI MUMBAI: In compliance with a Bombay high court directive,   cracked the whip on   constructions at Shahbaj village in Belapur. The civic body demolished two illegal floors of an under-construction building on Saturday after winning the case against the encroacher in the court. In   ward, too, marginal space of a hotel was cleared of an extension during the day-long drive. 

 NMMC had served eviction notices to the person responsible for the illegal constructions in Shahbaj, one Mahesh Kumbhar, but he instead moved the court for a stay. But NMMC won the case as the court empowered the civic body to demolish the illegally constructed floors amid adequate protection from the police and NMMC security personnel. 
 
 Kumbhar was issued yet another notice 24 hours before the  . “We a got a shot in the arm as the court has favoured us and ordered for necessary action against the encroacher. Our anti-encroachment team cleared the illegal floors in the building with the help of adequate manpower and machinery,” said NMMC additional commissioner Ankush Chavan.
 
 In the other demolition undertaken by Vashi ward officer Mahendrasingh Thokke, the marginal space of an under-construction hotel in sector 12 was pulled down to pave way for pedestrians. “The commissioner has ordered action against all illegal constructions and misuse of marginal space,” said an official.
