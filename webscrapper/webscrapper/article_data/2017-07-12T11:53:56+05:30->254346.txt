AHMEDABAD: Despite assurance from the state government, textile traders across the city have decided to continue their indefinite strike, until the goods and services tax (GST) on cloth is revoked. Some 50,000 traders across the city announced an indefinite strike on Monday. There is tremendous opposition to the new tax regime and cloth traders have unanimously decided to continue the strike till GST is revoked.

 With this, a number of allied industries are staring at losses despite operating full time. “Our businesses are completely dependent on textile traders. Therefore, if the traders continue to strike, how will our industries function. Several processing units are seeing a tremendous dent in business. Textile processing units are highly labour driven and most of our daily wagers have returned to their villages as they don’t get any work,” said  , vice president, textile processing units association.
 
 Textile traders have been holding large daily gatherings at   as the strike continues. While traders did plan to take out a protest rally on Wednesday, it has now been deferred to Saturday. “We deferred the rally to Saturday in the wake of the terror attack on the bus full of pilgrims. We consulted the commissioner of police and were advised to defer it,” said  , president, Maskati Cloth Merchants Association.
 
 Textile traders will take out the rally from New Cloth Market to   Bhavan on Saturday and will submit a memorandum to the government.
