VELLORE: Calling the controversial letter that announced cancellation of   to   and Exclusion and Inclusive Policy as a “forged document”, chairperson of the   (UGC)   said they would file a case in this regard with the police.

 “We never wrote such a letter to the institution and it is a forged one. We will file a case in this regard,” said Prof Prakash while talking to reporters on the sidelines of the University Day and Annual Sports Day of   in Vellore on Sunday.
 
 The letter dated March 6, allegedly written by UGC under-secretary, stated that the Commission would not provide financial support to JNU’s Dalit studies centre after the end of the 12th plan as per the order received from the Ministry of Human Resource Development.
 
 The higher education regulator UGC on Saturday denied that it planned to wind up the Centres for Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy established in Universities on a plan-to-plan basis as long as they showed satisfactory progress in their focus areas. It claimed that media reports on such a proposed move were based on a forged letter.
 
 "On 17th and 18th of March, 2017, various newspapers carried the news indicating that UGC is in the process of winding up the Centre for Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy which is blatantly a false news. The whole news is based on a forged letter," an official statement from the body said.
 
 The 'forged' letter said the UGC will withdraw funding and that it will not be liable to any matter of functioning of the Centres. Set up in 35 Central universities since 2007, these Centres are dedicated forums for research on Dalits, tribes and minorities.
