The government said that the case is still pending in the apex court as HPCA’s request to quash FIR was turned down by the high court.

 In a statement, spokesperson of the state government said that two other vigilance cases were still pending with Himachal HC. The official said that the case dismissed by the SC was investigated by Kangra district police and pertained to encroachment of government land, in which the court has opined that Anurag Thakur’s personal involvement in the encroachment was not established prima facie. 
 
 “The government would still take action,” it was stated. The spokesperson said that HPCA had lost the appeal to quash the vigilance case in the high court since these cases were based on serious charges and thereafter the HPCA made an appeal in the SC which has been listed for hearing on March 29.
 
 Deputy chairman of Himachal Pradesh State Planning Board Gangu Ram Musafir and chairman of 20 Point Programme Implementation Committee Ram Lal Thakur said that the BJP leaders were confusing the vigilance cases of serious charges which were still pending in the court of law, with the case dismissed by the SC against HPCA.
 
 They said that few BJP leaders of the state seem to be rejoicing upon the verdict on the case that was investigated by the Kangra police, but the major case which the vigilance had filed pertaining to violation of laws in purchase of land near Dharamshala were still pending. These leaders were making unnecessary claim of winning a battle, but the war is not yet over, they added.
