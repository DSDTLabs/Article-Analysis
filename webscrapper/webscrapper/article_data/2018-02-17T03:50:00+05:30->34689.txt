GURUGRAM: In a crackdown on goods and services tax (GST) dealers who have fraudulently tried to claim input tax credit, the state excise and taxation department on Friday lodged an   at   in Gurugram against a firm purportedly registered as M/s  . 

 Input tax credit is a tax that a business pays on a purchase, which it can use to reduce its tax liability when it makes a sale. In other words, businesses can reduce their tax liability by claiming credit to the extent of GST paid on purchases. 
 
 “Vipin Enterprises is registered at shop no 16, Lal Kothi, Sector-40, Gurugram, whereas in reality it’s a saloon. The dealer had also submitted a mobile number which is answered by a person not concerned with the firm. Vipin Enterprises utilised input tax credit of Rs. 50,34,04,831 under GST through fraudulent entries. The GSTN number of the fraudulent dealer has been cancelled,” said   excise and taxation minister Capt Abhimanyu.
 
 According to him, the firm had also committed bogus transactions under VAT by making fraudulent claims of input tax credit on intra-state purchases in a web of operations and further showed bogus inter-state purchases to obtain ‘C’ forms worth Rs 27.16 crore from the department and facilitated the selling firms for concessional rate of tax. “The registration certificate of the firm has already been cancelled under the Haryana GST and Central GST Act to prevent any further fraudulent activity by the dealer,” he said. 
 
 Capt Abhimanyu said the officers of the state excise and taxation department and the tax research unit had identified some other dealers involved in GST-related fraudulent activities. “Other dealers are also likely to be acted against and penalised shortly,” he added.
 
 The chief minister has transferred the case to a special investigation team of Gurugram police, an official statement said.
