 This romcom, starring Amit Sadh and  , revolves around two polar opposite people who come together to launch a website for couples who want to elope. Keeping in sync with the theme, the songs, too, are as varied as they can get. The album by Times Music starts with Abhishek-Akshay’s 'Pyar Ka Test'. With disco beats and linear tempo, this one sounds straight out of the 80s. Bappi Lahiri and Kalpana Patowary lift the number with their buoyant singing, all the while enjoying mouthing lines like Tum Humare Ludo Ho, Hum Tumhare Hai Chess! The strings prelude to ' ' has us hooked, and Sukanya Purkayastha (remember her in 'Paani Da Rang'?) impresses with her sober rendition. ' ' is a typical fun, shaadiwala number that’s high on Punjabi beats. Quirky lyrics by Shellee and the late Labh Janjua’s energetic singing make this one a foot-tapping offing. Sanam Puri and Sonu Kakkar’s 'Bhaag Milky Bhaag', composed by Keegan Pinto, is a thematic take on the movie. But, his other composition, 'Faraar', hits bullseye. Flavour of the season, Jubin Nautiyal shines in this inspirational track that has a touch of soft rock. In an album that mostly comprises situational and motivational songs, 'Main Faraar Sa' comes as a breath of fresh air. Anupam Roy and Hamsika Iyer come together for this slow duet, where vocals take centre stage. The rhythmic beats and guitar and flute arrangements in this number work their magic. The string-sax arrangement in ' ' lends itself to the tune, and in the voice of Jubin, the track is a decent fare. The seven-song album is a cocktail of desi beats and Western influences. While all of them may not find a place on your playlist, they do make for some 'situational' hear.
