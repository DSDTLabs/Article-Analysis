THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: KPCC president V M Sudheeran has said he was shocked by the statement of writer and   alias Kamalsy Prana that he has decided to burn his novel and stop writing because of  .

 “I was shocked to read Kamalsy’s Facebook post in this regard. A very talented and creative writer is forced to stop writing at a time when the CPM-led LDF government is ruling the state. It’s an insult to Kerala, which is well-known for upholding freedom of expression and other democratic values,” Sudheeran wrote on his Facebook page on Friday.
 
 Condemning “the harassment meted out to Kamalsy by the LDF government’s police”, Sudheeran urged chief minister   to come out with an explanation.
 
 Citing the case of Tamil writer Perumal Murugan, who stopped writing in protest against the intolerance of Sangh Parivar, Sudheeran reiterated that it was a shame that a similar situation has emerged in Kerala ruled by the LDF. “It shows the double standards employed by those who gave support to Perumal Murugan,” he pointed out.
 
 Sudheeran also appealed to Kamalsy to withdraw his decision.
 
 According to his Facebook post, Kamalsy is expected to burn his novel ‘Smashanangalude Note Pustakam’, at Kidson Corner in Kozhikode at 4pm on Saturday. Kozhikode police had arrested him last month and charged him with sedition, following a complaint by Yuva Morcha, the youth wing of the BJP, accusing him of insulting national anthem through a Facebook post.
 
 It was later revealed that the controversial post was an excerpt from the particular novel published by Green Books in 2015. His latest Facebook post announcing his decision to burn the book, has also appealed to the publisher to withdraw the book.
