This election was billed as, among other things, a referendum on demonetisation. The results read as a big thumbs-up for the measure as BJP's massive mandate in UP seems to reflect PM Modi's ability to craft a wide coalition of the poor, cutting across caste lines.

 BSP president   and UP CM   attacked demonetisation fiercely, but Modi said his aim was to target the corrupt and their ill-gotten wealth -a declaration that touched a chord. BJP's success in west UP -where, ironically, it was said to be doing badly indicates this faith.
 
 The region is home to micro and small industries besides being a major farm belt with big mandis. If note ban had a debilitating impact here, rendering many jobless, the vote doesn't show it, suggesting that the impression was exaggerated. The dominant Jats were definitely unhappy with BJP and  's RLD was supposedly the beneficiary -none of this seems to have been true.
 
 In central and eastern UP, the general refrain was that the cash stash of the rich had been hit. In Modi's parliamentary constituency of Varanasi, it was difficult to find one person critical of demonetisation. Mayawati and Yadav ended up looking like they were opposing what many saw as a move to track tax evaders or, worse, being a part of the complicit set. Many are still asking how much cash was finally deposited in banks -a question the RBI has not answered -but Modi managed to turn the same question around and sell it to voters as a sign of the Centre's success. The preparedness of the less privileged to put up with hardships made it evident that Modi had managed to convince this crucial constituency that he is working in their interests.
