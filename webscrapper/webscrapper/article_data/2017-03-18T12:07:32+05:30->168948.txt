PANAJI: Refuting claims that a tussle for the post of chief minister led to a delay in government formation, Congress state president Luizinho   on Friday hinted that decisions taken by AICC general secretary  , and Goa screening committee chief  , were responsible for the party’s debacle in Goa.
 
  Asserting that the Congress had the support of 21 MLAs and was capable of forming the state government, Faleiro said it was Singh who suggested that the party wait till governor Mridula Sinha invite it to form the government.
  
  “As per procedure, I had a letter drafted for the governor to inform her that we would be staking claim to form the government, but I was told by Singh that as per convention, the governor would call us. So we waited,” Faleiro said while speaking at the party office in Panaji.
  
  Narrating his version of what transpired on the night after the election results were declared, Faleiro said Porvorim MLA-elect  , and NCP Benaulim MLA-elect  , had extended support to the Congress along with two independent MLAs.
  
  “We had 21 MLAs with us on March 11 night, but we didn’t have their signatures. Venugopal and Singh were empowered to discuss and take decisions. I would not like to cast blame but yes, I feel we should have taken a decision that night,” Faleiro said.
  
  The state party president went on to indicate that Singh, along with the other central leaders, was reluctant to stake claim to form the government until GFP also came on board. Sources said that on March 11 itself, Singh, Venugopal and Chellakumar met Vijai Sardessai at   to convince him to join the Congress coalition government.
  
  “It was decided by our general secretary and by our leaders in Delhi that we should not go ahead without GFP,” Faleiro said, adding, “I am not pointing fingers at anybody, but all I can say is that when I was in charge of the north-eastern states, I used to take decisions on the spot.”
