Mumbai:   union leader A L Quadros, while welcoming the City Taxi Scheme, has demanded that there should be a cap on surge pricing by aggregator cabs. “We are happy that after two and a half years, the government has announced the scheme that allows kaali-peeli taxis to join the app-based network model. But we want the fares to be controlled by the state, and there should be a cap on high-end fares,” he said. 

 “We will make a representation before a committee that the government has formed to recommend a fare structure and submit our petition. We will ask the committee to finalize fares that are realistic and will ensure that our drivers don’t run into losses,” he said. 
 
 Another taxi union leader K K Tiwari alleged that in the existing aggregator model, several drivers had run into losses, and their monthly earnings had dipped by over 50% lately. “The new fare structure for app-based cabs should enable our drivers to earn profits,” he demanded. 
 
 The kaali-peeli cabbies have also demanded that drivers of Ola and Uber be asked to get badges from the transport department, although there was no mention about this in the press statement issued by transport minister Diwakar Raote on Saturday. Every kaali-peeli driver has a badge, and it is obtained by showing a domicile certificate and one-year experience of driving a commercial vehicle in Mumbai. “We want a level-playing field and the government should look into our demands,” Quadros added.
