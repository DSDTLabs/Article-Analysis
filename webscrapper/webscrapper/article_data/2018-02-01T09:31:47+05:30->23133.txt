CHANDIGARH: A joint action committee ( ) of Chandigarh-based industrialists took up pending demands with Union home minister   on Wednesday.

 The JAC urged the home minister to direct the administration to rehabilitate tenants of  , Phase III. JAC convener B S   said, “Rehabilitation of small-scale industrial tenants has been a pending demand.”
 
 The committee took up the issue of leasehold to leasehold transfer and leasehold to freehold transfer of industrial plots. In Industrial Policy 2015, the administration promised the transfer of industrial plots from leasehold to leasehold and leasehold to freehold, but never came good on it.
 
 The administration allotted leasehold plots in both phases of industrial area between 1973 and 1982, on a condition that these plots were transferable after 15 years. However, even after 35 years, the administration did not formulate a transfer policy.
 
 Industrial Area has been developed over 1,200 acres in two phases — Phase I has an area of 776.14 acres and Phase II 486 acres. There are around 2,500 leasehold plots in the two phases. All plots in Phase II were allotted on leasehold. Till 2011, owners transferred plots by entering into an agreement with buyers on Rs 100 stamp paper.
 
 The committee also urged the minister to allow construction of additional floors on non-converted industrial plots. The conversion scheme of land use of industrial sites into commercial activity/services in Industrial Area phases I and II had given service sector a push. Conversion, which was launched on September 19, 2005, was initially floated for two years, but later extended by six months. The policy was withdrawn on March 18, 2008. “The administration should extended the benefit of construction of additional floors on non-converted industrial plot,” said Saini.
