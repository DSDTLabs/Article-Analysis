Chandigarh: A Jind court on Friday sent three accused on four-day police remand in case of shooting of undertrial Sumer Singh outside the district courts complex on July 9 in the broad daylight. The accused: Rakesh Kumar, Deepender Singh and Vicky Singh, were brought to the Jind district court from Jhajjar jail.

 A day after the incident, they were arrested by Bahadurgarh police on Tuesday and since then they had been lodged in Jhajjar jail. Jind crime investigation agency (CIA) in charge Surender Singh, who is investigating the case, said during interrogation the accused confessed to their crime. 
 
 “Since there was high security, they claimed to have waited for cops to come out and attacked Sumer outside the courts complex when he was on his way to the bus stand to board a bus to Hisar. We are interrogating them to ascertain the source of weapons as well,” said Surender.
