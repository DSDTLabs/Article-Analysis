NEW DELHI: Suspended   ( ) member   today alleged that party chief and Delhi chief minister   has been to the office just two times in the last year.

 "Even as friends and relatives' houses are being raided, even as more and more corruption is coming to light, the CM who's completely cut off from his public leaves his house after many days to see (the film) Sarkar 3. That's right, Sarkar 3," said Mishra today in a Facebook post.
 
 The sacked AAP minister, who shocked everyone over a week ago with his corruption allegations against the Delhi CM, further alleged that Kejriwal barely goes to the office and takes days off "all the time".
 
 "In the entire country, he (Kejriwal) is the chief minister who meets the public the least, the one who goes to the office the least, the one who has no portfolio, the one who works the least, the one who takes the most days off...and soon he will be the CM in the country with the most corruption cases against him," Mishra wrote.
 
 Mishra, who was sacked as Delhi's water minister by the AAP government, has been leveling more and more corruption allegations against Kejriwal since his first one the Sunday before last. And Kejriwal hasn't personally responded.
 
 "He has just one response to all questions - criminal silence. He hasn't spoken and won't either, because soon the public will speak," Mishra said.
 
 Mishra has alleged he saw the Delhi CM accept Rs 2 crore in a questionable transaction. He has also alleged that top AAP leaders laundered the donations they got from the public. In addition, the sacked minister has demanded details of how AAP leaders' foreign trips were funded.
