CHANDIGARH: Two days after the Punjab Pollution Control Board challenged the report of the   which has ranked Patiala 13th in the list of most polluted cities in the world, the   government also countered the report findings on Faridabad (2nd in the list) raising doubts over source of the data.

 Haryana environment and climate change minister Vipul Goel on Friday said the source of the data, on which the report is based, is not clear.
 
 He said the   (HSPCB) has been monitoring the data since 2010 through Continuous Air Ambient Quality Monitoring Station in Faridabad and Gurgaon. As per the details available with the board, the PM 2.5 value of both the cities are being monitored regularly since 2013.
 
 “These values go beyond 170 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) only during a brief season around Diwali, crop harvesting season and peak winters when the temperature is low and wind velocity is minimum. Therefore, it is not justified to claim that the average PM 2.5 value is above 170 µg/m3 in Faridabad,” said Goyal
 
 The report which claims that city like Srinagar is also one of most polluted cities in the world raises doubts about the source of the data, the minister said. Even Patiala’s air pollution level has been placed quite high based on PM 2.5 values recorded from 2010 to 2016, and Punjab too claims that it never monitored PM 2.5 values and the sources are not known to its own pollution control board, Goel added.
 
 Faridabad suffers mostly due to the pollution in the neighbouring Delhi. Its own sources include vehicles and construction dust and Delhi’s pollution is considerably high with additional sources from continuous municipal solid waste burning. Delhi’s pollution level has always remained higher than these two cities as indicated by our reports. Now, placing Faridabad has been placed above Delhi in the   which is not logical, he said.
