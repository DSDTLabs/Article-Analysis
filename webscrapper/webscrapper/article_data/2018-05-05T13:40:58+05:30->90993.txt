MADURAI: Fourteen of the 289 candidates appearing for the national eligibility-cum-entrance test (NEET) from   district will be travelling to   in Kerala to write the examination even as the state government declared Rs 1,000 as relief to each of them to offset their unexpected difficulties.

 Education department sources said that none of the 14 students had availed of the monetary benefit on Friday, as the department did not have cash to give them at short notice and the schools that were asked to give them were also closed as it was beyond 4 p.m, when the students came there.
 
 Some candidates who rushed to the chief education officer’s office in Madurai in the afternoon were told that they would have to approach their schools which were however closed. Ganeshan, father of  , went to the CEO’s office, only to be told that students from government schools alone could avail of the benefit announced by the government. Later, however, he was asked to approach his school which along with others had been authorised to give the advance of Rs 1,000 and later get it reimbursed from the CEO’s office. CEO   said that the students had been asked to approach the respective schools and receive the advance. Some of the parents said that it was unfair of the government to make such announcements at the last moment, as some of them had coughed up Rs 200 for auto fare to come to the CEO’s office and then paid an equal amount to go to the schools.
 
 A teacher from one of the schools said that this step was an eye wash as the schools were closed and they had nothing to do with these students as they had passed out. “This announcement comes out of the blue and they expect us to be at the desk and disburse the cash to students on a holiday. The CEO’s office sent an instruction, but I am sure that none of the students would have availed of the Rs 1,000 advance,’’ he said.
