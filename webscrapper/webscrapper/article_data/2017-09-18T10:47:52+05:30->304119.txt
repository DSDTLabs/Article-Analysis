CHENNAI: Prisoners at the   facility will soon get marching orders-only, they'll be strictly limited to within the jail premises.

 A week after participating in a mini marathon organised by prisons officials, the inmates of   prison will undergo marching drills, under the guidance of former   officers, to better discipline their minds and bodies.
 
 More than 250 jailbirds from Puzhal and eight other prisons on Sunday participated in a mini marathon on the campuses of nine jails across the state.
 
 Additional director general of police, prisons, C  , has ar ce, prisons, C Sylendra Babu, has arranged for inmates and jail officials to to take part in the martial drills, tentatively planned for an hour every day, and a marathon on the weekends.
 
 Prisons officials said the senior officer planned the runs and the marching practice, the latter with beating drums, as a means of intervention -by way of bolstering the self-confidence of inmates -following a spurt in cases of suicide among prisoners state jails. As many as four inmates committed suicide in Puzhal Central Prison this year.
 
 The officials said they had already started counselling sessions for undertrials and convicts who show signs of depression. “We want them to lead a healthy lifestyle,“ Sylendra Babu said “Many of them are stressed out.“
