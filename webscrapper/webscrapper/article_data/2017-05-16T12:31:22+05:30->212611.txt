BHUBANESWAR: Servitors of   in Puri have reignited an old controversy, demanding ban on access of Shankaracharya’s disciples on chariots, for which the top seer had boycotted his rituals on Rath Yatra in 2014. Servitors of 36 Nijogs (associations of priests), who were present along with temple officials in a meeting at Puri on Monday, demanded that only   be allowed to offer prayers to the deities on the bathing altar during   festival on June 9 and on chariots on June 25 Rath Yatra. 

 Sri Jagannath Temple Administration’s newly appointed chief administrator Pradeep Jena refused to speak to media on the contentious issue. “Temple’s managing committee will take a final decision,” Jena told media persons. 
 
 “We have high regards for Shankaracharya. Shankaracharya’s disciples should be treated like common devotees, who are not allowed onto the bathing altar and chariots as per his advice and subsequent Orissa high court directive in 2014. Tradition has it that the seer alone should avail the facility,” said  , a senior servitor.
 
 Shankaracharya’s spokesperson Manoj Rath termed the demand of priests as unfortunate. “For decades, the seer had been visiting the chariots with seven disciples. In 2014, the temple administration insulted him and barred his disciples from accompanying him to the chariots on the demands of some priests. In a serious age-old tradition, the Shankaracharya had boycotted his ritual on chariots. He resumed his ritual in 2015 Rath Yatra after the temple administration begged apology following massive public outcry,” Rath said.
