 Speaking to TOI, Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen legislator representing Karwan, Kausar Mohiuddin, who raised the issue in the legislative assembly said, “Several areas such as Golconda, Meraj Colony, Yusuf Tekri, Ibrahim Bagh, Ramdev Guda and Langar Houz, apart from other areas, are facing issues where it is becoming very difficult for residents to do repairs and construction of homes.
 
 On certain occasions, development activity has come to a halt. The Balkampet Nala work has come to a complete stop.” Explaining further, he said that the estimated cost for its clearing is between Rs 4 crore and Rs 5 crore and that it needs immediate attention.
 
 The Quli Qutb Shah Nagar near the tombs complex is also facing similar problems, he claimed. “One of the routes leading to the area has been blocked. It is causing a lot of inconvenience for residents,” he claimed.
 
 Touching upon the issue of representing that matter with defence personnel, he said, “Several representations have been made. I also wrote to the district collector and others, but little has changed on the ground. There are some very good army officers who want to help, but the problem needs quick resolution,” the member of legislative assembly said.
 
 While adherence to rules must be observed, he said that there have been occasions when residents, living near defence areas, who wanted to make minor changes to their houses have been stopped from doing so.
