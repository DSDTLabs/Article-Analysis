GURUGRAM: For the first time in the past three years, MCG has started   of   in the city to make sure that rain water is harvested in summer so as to avoid flooding during the monsoon.

 TOI had last month reported that desilting work never took place in Gurgaon and funds allocated for the same in 2014 have been lying unused.
 
 The district has over 400 ponds, out of which 208 have dried up. Some 186 ponds are dirty and 52 are clean. In 2014, the authorities finally came up with a plan to desilt 83 ponds in villages in the first phase.
 
 Officials said to start with, the civic body has began desilting work in Sector 40. “Desilting is important to prevent waterlogging in the area. We are carrying out desilting of drains on the sectors 31 and 40 dividing road as a pilot project,” said  , executive engineer, MCG. 
 
 Kalawat said the desilting work is being carried out with help of a super-sucker machine and the work will be completed in the next eight to 10 days. “We are carrying out desilting work at each and every manhole so that there is no scope of blockage, which generally leads to flooding,” he said.
 
 TOI had last month reported though over Rs 42 lakh was sanctioned for desilting of 83 ponds in 2014, not even a single pond has been desilted yet.
 
 Experts welcomed the move before the arrival of monsoon. “Desilting of drains allow enough water to flow into the waterbodies as the drains act as feeder channels for ponds. It’s is a good move to start desilting the drains well before the arrival of monsoon rains. It will help water flow down the ponds and boost groundwater recharge. Also waterlogging, which is a major issue in Gurgaon, can be addressed,” said  , a resident of Sector 40 and an activist.
