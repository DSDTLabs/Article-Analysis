Surat: The staffers of GVK EMRI 108 services staged a dharna at New Civil Hospital (NCH) in the city on Thursday. They want the management to fulfil its promises made to them by Monday. They have threatened to go on a hunger strike in Surat if their demands are not accepted by then. 

 The GVK EMRI 108 services staffers have 14 demands which include revoking suspension of 21 workers, reducing working hours from 12 hours to eight hours a day, insurance cover of Rs 3 lakh for each worker, increase in TA and DA, 15 per cent increment every year, Diwali bonus, separate room, toilet and three-month paid leave for pregnant women workers. 
 
 The GVK EMRI 108 services staffers have gone on strike twice in the past four months, forcing the management to threaten invocation of Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) to end the stir. There are 160 GVK EMRI services workers in Surat. The company has 37 ambulances and receives 10 calls per vehicle daily on an average in the city.
