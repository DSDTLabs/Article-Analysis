GHAZIABAD:  , the   who had filed a   in a Ghaziabad court after allegations of conspiracy in the January 28 Indirapuram accident probe involving his Audi Q7 surfaced, got bail on Friday.

 Arguing on his behalf at the chief judicial magistrate’s court, Rawat’s lawyer said there was no evidence against the doctor and that he was being falsely implicated in the case. The court granted bail on a personal bond of Rs 20,000.
 
 The conspiracy became apparent after a man namd Syed Imtiyaz Qadri, of Bareilly, surrendered in court, claiming to be the driver. It later turned out that he was an impostor and had stolen the identity of another driver, Ishak Ahmad, who lived in the same house in Bareilly. Ishak has given police his statement that he was framed. And Qadri told TOI in Mumbai last month, after his arrest there in a snatching case, he had been tutored about what to say in court, that he had never even seen an Audi and that he agreed to make a false statement for just Rs 7,000.
 
 All this put a question mark on the role of Rawat, who claimed he was in the Audi at the time of the accident but wasn’t driving the car.
