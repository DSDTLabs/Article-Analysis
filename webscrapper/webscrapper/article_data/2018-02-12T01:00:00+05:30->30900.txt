Trichy: It is only natural for many dog owners to consider their pets as family and shower them with great affection. But sometimes, what is intended to be an expression of love and care end up with negative results.

 Pointing to some of the dogs which turned up for the show at the government expo on Saturday, joint director-in-charge of district animal husbandry department Dr S Murugesan said that rising obesity was a problem among domesticated dogs. He felt that dog owners were unintentionally guilty of over-feeding their pets. And this, according to him, had resulted in dogs contracting diseases at a very early age.
 
 “Many domesticated dogs find it difficult to even walk. This is due to the fact that they are fed more than required and are not being given exposure to physical activity/ exercise,” he said. Murugesan added that this didn’t mean that one had to plan special diet for dogs. “Just keep it simple: make sure that the dogs are fed food rich in protein and fibre and reduce their carbohydrate and fat intake,” he said. 
 
 Murugesan said that certain diseases that used to affect dogs aged around eight to nine years were now seen to be common among two-year-old dogs. “In fact, Labradors, at the age of three or four, have started suffering from Myocarditis,” he claimed. On the other hand, the official also stressed on the fact that dog raisers should make sure their pets got at least two vaccinations — anti-rabies and 7-in-1 — every year.
