MUMBAI: Typically, a   is a student’s key card to enter the hospitality sector. But if you have not done this course, fret not. Companies still open their doors for you. 

 Take the case of   (IHCL), the country’s largest hospitality chain, in terms of revenue. Every year, IHCL hires about 60   from campuses across India, inducts them into its 18-month management programme and gives them an all-rounded experience on different operational functions. They are paid stipend and even given accommodation, if they are not from the city. “About 80% of them opt for  ,   and   at the end of the programme,” said P V Ramana Murthy, head-HR. “The rest join sales and marketing, HR, communications and other departments.” 
 
 Their careers and roles enhance over time, with several of them becoming general managers in 10 years, said Murthy. IHCL has over 26,000 people on its rolls, with most of them in operations department. 
 
 So, how does IHCL select talent from campuses? “Quality is key,” said Murthy. “Skills can be taught, but behaviour is everything. We look for the right kind of attitude. Is the person passionate about making a   in hospitality or is he just looking for a job?” The management programme, according to Murthy, may be a “green card” to enter IHCL, but the real learning happens on the hotel floors.
 
 IHCL, along with TISS, also offers a 36-month course for class XII students. The course fee is paid by IHCL and the students also get to work in one of the 100-plus Taj hotels for two days a week. After the course is completed, the students can either join Taj or any of its competitors. —Reeba Zachariah
