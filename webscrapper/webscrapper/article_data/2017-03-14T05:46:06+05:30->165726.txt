PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: After the NCP suffered a drubbing in   municipal election, resentment is brewing among a section of corporators. Senior corporator, Datta Sane, has openly challenged the appointment of PCMC opposition leader Yogesh Behl. Sane has claimed that he has the support of 24 out of 36 corporators.

 The NCP had won the 2007 and 2012 municipal elections with a brute majority. However, in the 2017 elections, the NCP received a drubbing with   winning 77 seats in the 128-member house. Chinchwad MLA Laxman Jagtap and Bhosari MLA Mahesh Landge, who had quit NCP to join BJP, were the key architects of BJP’s unprecedented success in Pimpri-Chinchwad
 
 The NCP, which has got just 36 seats, will be the main opposition in PCMC. Last week, the NCP appointed six-time corporator and former mayor Yogesh Behl as the opposition leader. Those in the race for the opposition leader’s post were senior corporators Mangala Kadam, Nana Kate, Datta Sane and Ajit Gavhane.
 
 Opposing Behl as the opposition leader, Datta Sane told TOI that he would form a separate group of corporators. “A meeting will be held on Wednesday just after the election for the mayoral post on Tuesday,’’ he said. Sane said that he has the support of 24 corporators. More corporators will come with us. There will be just two corporators with Behl. Close aides of Sane said that the NCP suffered a defeat because of a few party leaders in the city. The aides said that Sane was not even asked whether he would want to be the leader of opposition.
 
 Yogesh Behl said Sane, who is from Chikhli, had wanted to become the opposition leader.
