Crime master   is once again dominating bestseller charts with his latest novel in the   series, 
 . The twenty-fifth book in the series brings Alex Cross on trial and for the first time in his illustrious career, Cross finds himself on the wrong side of the law.

 The book follows Alex Cross being charged with murder as he is accused of an unjustified shooting at Washington D.C. This time, even the federal government is brought to court to bear against him. An unusually nervous Alex Cross seems entwined in a case with strong evidence against him. As the whole country eagerly waits for the trial, Cross's ex-partner John Sampson seeks to solve a case involving missing young women, linked to a pornographic website. Despite his troubled times, Cross helps Sampson, being the magnanimous hero that he is. Though a bit of a stretch, Patterson manages to manoeuvre the plot through the trials and tribulations Cross faces, keeping the suspense alive.
 
 The author effortlessly switches between the two plots running parallel in the book and provides wonderful twists and turns that make it a compelling read. James Patterson has once again established himself as an ace storyteller, with his riveting plot and interesting characters.
