CHANDIGARH: Reacting to reports of the arrest of Nabha jail escapee Gurpreet Singh Sekhon from the house of an NRI activist of AAP, Punjab Congress president   claimed on Wednesday that AAP supremo   had a nexus with “militants and gangsters in the state”.

 In a statement, Amarinder said he was concerned that the latest development came two weeks after Kejriwal himself had courted controversy by staying at a Sikh extremist’s home. “There is a strong nexus between AAP, militants and gangsters. They pose a major threat to the state’s security and safety,” he said and demanded an investigation by a central agency into the party’s links.
 
 He said thing had now come to a head in the wake of latest reports of Sekhon’s arrest from the home of AAP activist Goldy Gill. “He is an NRI who had been actively engaged in campaigning for AAP,” said Amarinder.
 
 Amarinder accused Kejriwal of making attempts to “radicalize” the youth of Punjab with its dangerous mix of extreme Left and extreme Right ideology, saying the state had suffered enough during its militancy period and could not afford to be plunged once again into terrorism.
