 Muhammad Uzair, the deceased, was the youngest child of his parents. Footage from   installed at one of the houses in the neighbourhood revealed he was last seen with his elder brother around 4pm.
 
 Naushad Muhammad (34), Uzair’s father, said he was playing with his seven-year-old elder brother, Muhammad Rehan, in the afternoon. “When Rehan returned home after 4pm, Uzair was not with him. He told me they had gone near the sewer line area to play and then they both headed towards the house. Then Rehan met one of his friends and got distracted,” he added. Neighbours joined Uzair’s family members in their search for the missing boy. “We started looking for him by 4.30pm . We informed the police around 8pm and they arrived by 9pm,” Naushad said. Around 10pm, after searching the entire neighbourhood, two of the neighbours suggested going near the manhole again. “When we went back to check, his slippers were found lying near the manhole,” Naushad said.
 
 Police said constrution debris and domestic waste had clogged the sewer line. “The sewer line is almost five feet deep and five-six feet wide. It was clogged, which would have made the survival of the child difficult,” said Parshuram Kumar, SHO, Kotwali police station.
