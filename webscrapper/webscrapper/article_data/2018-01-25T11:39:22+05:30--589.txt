PATNA: Union minister and   ( ) chief   on Wednesday demanded increase in the quantum of job quota for the extremely backward classes ( ) and other sections. 

 Kushwaha, who is junior Union human resource development minister, also attacked the state government’s educational system, alleging it was against the interests of the poor and deprived sections.
 
 Kushwaha, who was addressing his party workers at the RLSP state headquarters, said the state government has been periodically including one or another caste group from the one quota group to another. 
 
 This has increased the population of the groups concerned,   said and added it had become incumbent on the government to also increase the quantum of job quota for these groups.
 
 The quota for various groups currently is 12% for BCs, 18% for EBCs, 16% for SCs, 1% for STs and 3% for BC women. 
 
 Kushwaha said former CM and EBC stalwart Karpoori Thakur’s dream about the improvement of the standard of living of people of the poor and deprived sections would remain unfulfilled without the spread of education among the children from these sections, including girls.
 
 “Educated girls will challenge both child marriage and dowry. But the poor educational infrastructure in government schools has been adversely affecting the future of poor children,” Kushwaha said.
