NEW DELHI:   passed on Tuesday the   to ensure equal rights to people affected by HIV and AIDS in getting treatment, jobs and admissions in educational institutions.

 Terming the unanimous passage of the HIV and AIDS (Prevention and Control) Bill in the   as “historic”, Health Minister   said the government “stands committed for free treatment of HIV patients”. It was passed by the   on March 21.
 
 The bill assumes significance as it protects people living with HIV from specific acts of discrimination by the state, or any other person. 
 
 It also lays down penal provisions for any discrimination practised against a person with   and breach of confidentiality.
 
 Under the new law, central and state governments are obliged to provide for anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and management of opportunistic infections (infections that take advantage of weakness in the immune system and occur frequently).
 
 The protection mandated under the law extends to the fields of employment, healthcare services, educational services, public facilities, property rights, holding public office and insurance.
 
 “It is not the case that before coming of this bill, these people (infected with HIV ) were not empowered but with its passage, they will get more powers,” Nadda said.
 
 The total number of people living with HIV in India is estimated at 21.17 lakh.
 
 Around 86000 new HIV infections were reported in 2015, showing a 66% decline in new infections from 2000.
 
 In 2015, around 68000 people died of AIDS-related causes nationally. Though the bill was initially introduced in Parliament by the   government, the amendments to the legislation were revived by the   government in July 2016.
 
 Since then the health ministry has made various changes to the original bill to address several concerns raised by the the HIV community as well as state governments.
