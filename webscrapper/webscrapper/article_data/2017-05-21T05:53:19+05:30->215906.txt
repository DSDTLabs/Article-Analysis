BENGALURU: As the May 31 deadline set by AICC general secretary (  incharge) K C   to choose the   president approaches, many permutations and combinations are being worked out.

 The options, sources said, range from continuing with the existing arrangement of   as president to tweaking the   model of two deputy chief ministers. The exercise is not just about caste balance but also looking at the possibilities that the incumbent does not project himself as the chief ministerial candidate if the party returns to power.
 
 After eliciting opinion from seniors, MPs and legislators on the Congress strategy for the 2018 polls, Venugopal will be in Bengaluru on Monday for a similar exercise with district units' functionaries.
 
 Over five days, Venugopal, along with the four secretaries in charge of a revenue division each, will elicit opinions on the strengths and shortcomings of the party in the districts, the reasons for the party losing by less than 500 votes in some 30 districts in 2013 and hold discussions with seniors. Though the team did not broach the issue of who should be the KPCC president during their interactions with leaders and legislators in their last visit, those who met them gave their opinions anyway. Before winding up the meeting Venugopal told media that there will be clarity by May-end.
