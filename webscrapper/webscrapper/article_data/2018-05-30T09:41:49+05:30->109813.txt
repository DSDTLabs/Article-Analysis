PARIS: Fifth seed   made light of any injury concerns as he recovered from a poor start to beat Frenchman Nicolas Mahut in the   first round on Tuesday.

 
 The big Argentine was feeble in the opening set, winning just one game, but he picked up the pace to claim a 1-6 6-1 6-2 6-4 victory on Court Suzanne Lenglen.
 
 Del Potro, whose career has been plagued by wrist injuries, withdrew from this month's Rome Masters with a groin injury, sparking fears about his prospects in Paris.
 
 When he lost the first set in 25 minutes it looked ominous for the 29-year-old but there looked nothing wrong with his movement as he powered past the world number 116.
 
 Former US Open champion   is playing at   for only the second time since 2012 and will be a danger in the top half of the draw.
