PATNA: A day after the   station’s   was suspended following reports of his  , all the 13 officers and 12 constables of the   were on Monday transferred on the same charge. They were attached with the Police Lines.

 SSP Manu Maharaaj said he had been getting information about rampant liquor smuggling in the area with inputs suggesting involvement of policemen. “A special team visited the Jakkanpur locality and nabbed a man with country liquor. Probe led us to Sai Emergency Hospital, which was being used as a mini bar,” the SSP said.
 
 According to the SSP, the raiding team found people in drunken state and empty bottles in the private hospital’s operation theatre on Sunday night. The hospital has been sealed and its director Anupam Yadav arrested. 
 
 “It is just not possible for liquor smugglers to carry out their nefarious activities without the complicity of local police station,” Maharaaj said and added he has recommended departmental proceedings against all transferred police personnel.
 
 This is the third instance in Bihar and second in Patna when action has been taken against the entire team of a police station for its failure to enforce prohibition since it was legislated in the state in April last year. Axe fell on the personnel of Patna’s Beur police station in February this year.
 
 Meanwhile, 125 litre of country liquor were seized and 73 smugglers, including a woman, arrested by police during the last 24 hours in Patna under their Operation Vishwas launched under the leadership of additional SP Rakesh Dubey.
