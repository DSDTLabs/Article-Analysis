AMRITSAR: The India-Pakistan trade route through   integrated check post (ICP) has suffered a major blow due to ongoing strike of porters who are demanding rollback of revised tariff policy issued by the   (CWC). The strike is causing a daily loss of customs duty of around Rs 1.5 crore, say the traders.

 While talking to TOI on Tuesday, president of Indo-Foreign Chamber of Commerce B K Bajaj said porter charge Rs 4,500 and Rs 5,000 respectively for automatic shifting of gypsum and cement from Pakistan’s tipper trucks and bulkers.
 
 “While there is no manual labour involved in the process, we have been forced to pay the porter charges else then threaten to go on strike to clamp the trade,” he said. Under the new tariff policy, the traders have been exempted from paying these charges to the labourers.
 
 Traders informed that nearly 500 truckload of dry dates were parked on the Pakistan side of the ICP and expressed concern that the stock could start decaying due to rain.
 
 Stating that the department had generated around Rs 50 crore customs duty from the ICP last month, ICP deputy commissioner (customs) Balwinder Singh said, “The strike is causing loss of around Rs 1.5 crore of revenue to the state’s exchequer per day.” He said the CWC was also incurring losses and the cross-border trade was suffering due to the porters’ strike.
 
 There are 1,430 registered porters besides nearly 400 helpers who load and unload trucks at the ICP and they are on strike since September 9. One of the agitating labourer   said, “This is our right, we have been working here for years and our families depend on the ICP trade.” He said they never wanted to halt the trade but they were forced to take the extreme step.
