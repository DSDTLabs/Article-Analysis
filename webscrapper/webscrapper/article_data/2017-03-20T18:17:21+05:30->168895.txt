Actor   will be seen opposite 
  in upcoming 'Phillauri' and he says he feels privileged to have shared screen space with the actress. 

 "To be working with Anushka and Diljit Dosanjh was a privilege. Anushka is a tremendously good and hardworking girl and Diljit uses rhythm while acting and it's a different style of working. Diljit's performance is based on his rhythm, while Anushka is spontaneous", Suraj told PTI.
 
 The 23-year-old actor will be seen playing an NRI rapper in the movie. 
 
 "I got a call from the team of 'Phillauri'. I liked the script. It was exceptionally good. I auditioned for the film and they liked me," he says. 
 
 Suraj rose to worldwide fame with his titular role in Ang Lee's 2012 American survival drama film. 
 
 Two years later, he was seen in American biographical sports drama 'Million Dollar Arm' and appeared in Hindi film 'Umrika', besides featuring in season 5 of "Homeland". 
 
 "After 'Life of Pi', there was a lot of work coming my way but I was extremely choosy about what I do next. Also, I felt I was a kid and did not want to work for little bit. I was in school in New York and I used to work only during holidays." 
 
 Suraj is currently studying filmmaking at the New York University and is three months away from completion of the course. 
 
 He says post the course, he plans to focus on acting career. 
 
 "Due to my college I tend to do less work. After I finish my college I will get into it (acting), audition for films both here in Bollywood and Hollywood." 
 
 Suraj feels acting is not the only pick when it comes to cinema for him and he would eventually want to write and direct films.
