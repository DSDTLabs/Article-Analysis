TV actor   was forced out of action for two years after he suffered a knee injury while performing a stunt in his show, ' '. During the long recovery period, he put on several kilos and his weight touched almost 108 kgs. He says, “I put on a lot of weight while recuperating, but didn’t opt for any quick-fix formula. Instead, I decided to lose weight without   burners and get six-pack abs without steroids, which was tougher and took longer. I am glad I succeeded. I now weigh 70 kgs.” The actor adds further, “Youngsters are choosing cosmetic techniques to get good bodies, which is quite a serious issue. If you ask them to trek for three km, most of them will not be able to. 

 There is no focus on inner strength and true fitness. The irony is that our industry has created this pressure to look good, no matter what the 
 consequences.”
