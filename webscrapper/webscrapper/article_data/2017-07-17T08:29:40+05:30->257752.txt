CHANDIGARH: Chandigarh’s “street picture” should be recreated, but without disturbing the   of its buildings, felt people participating in TOI’s roundtable ‘Is it time to move beyond   here on Sunday.

 “The street picture should be changed and the drawing and design of SCOs should also be changed. The street picture is part of the overall governance of the city. The government should, from time to time, evaluate and address these issues,” said Vinod Joshi, architect and chairman of Chandigarh Beopar Mandal.
 
 An expert in   and former principal of Chandigarh College of Architecture, Rajneesh Wattas, agreed on this, but said the unique street façade of Chandigarh should not be disturbed. “The shop-cum-flats (SCFs) in sectors 1 to 30 were made when there was no global warming or gas cylinders, so the kitchens were created on the first floors of the buildings. These should be changed with administrative and political will. Bylaws should be simplified so that we can make optimum use of the space available. We are not asking them to create extra space, but should they let us use the space available,” said city-based industrialist Diwaker Sahuja.
 
 Joshi said the provision for change of the front elevation of SCFs/SCOs, replacing “brise soleil” (brick jail) with glass was allowed, but with a condition that the entire row of SCFs/SCOs had to submit the revised building plan with the front elevation. However, Joshi said, this condition was unjustified because most SCFs/SCOs were on rent or certain shop owners did not wish to bear the extra expenditure on the change of elevation, making the provision useless. “The controls on SCFs/SCOs should be revised,” he added.
