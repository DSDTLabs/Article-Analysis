NEW DELHI: Incidents of stone-pelting in the   have reduced by half this year due to “effective” action by security forces and probe agencies against separatists and others, the   said on Wednesday.

 CRPF director general   said that the stone pelting in the valley has come down to less than half in 2016 (424 till now), as compared to last year (1,590 total).
 
 Bhatnagar said that there are several factors which have played a role in this including new standard operating procedures, a new strategy to deal with the mob, action taken by other agencies like   against the organisers of such incidents and joint operation by forces. “We have not allowed violent mobs in J&K to disrupt operations,” he said As many as 75 militants have been killed by   this year in J&K while 252 have been apprehended and 118 arms have been recovered.
 
 “Our assessment is that situation in the Kashmir Valley has improved,” he said, adding the CRPF was coordinating with the NIA in its crackdown against separatists and their operatives.
 
 “We have not allowed violent mobs to interfere in the conduct of anti-militancy operations.
 
 There is a very close coordination between the J&K Police, the CRPF and the Army,” he said. The CRPF top boss said a number of steps were taken in the recent past like re-positioning of troops, new strategies and standard operating procedures, to achieve the results seen now.
 
 “With the use of less lethal weapons (pellet guns and pump action guns) we’re able to minimise injuries to troops and also to the mob,” he said.
 
 “The number of our personnel injured has also come down to one-third of what was the picture last year,” the 1983-batch IPS officer of UP cadre said.
 
 Bhatnagar said terrorist incidents in the Valley have also “come down”, adding that some changes have been effected in security drills till the remaining part of the Amarnath yatra.
