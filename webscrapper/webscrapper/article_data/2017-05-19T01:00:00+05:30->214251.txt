Youngsters hanging out at   in Varanasi were in for a surprise on Tuesday evening when they saw filmmaker   taking a stroll along the ghats. Kashyap was there looking for locations to shoot his film Mukkebaaz in the city. The students then walked up to Kashyap, who was dressed casually in a T-shirt and jeans and requested him for a selfie and an autograph, to which he happily agreed. 

  Aparna Lahiri, a third-year student of Applied Arts at  , tells us of her chance encountyer with the 'Gangs of Wasseypur' filmmaker. "I was chatting with my friends on the ghat when we spotted him walking towards us. We were delighted to see him, and requested him for a photograph. He even invited me at the location of his film when I told him that I have assisted in local film projects."

  Later, Anurag also enjoyed tea at a kiosk at Rewa Ghat during his walk, meeting people and chatting with those who recognised him. Varanasi is a familiar place for the filmmaker, as his parents reside there and he has also shot Gangs of Wasseypur (GOW) in the surrounding areas of the city.
 
 'Mukkebaaz', which was earlier shot in Bareilly, has actors Jimmy Sheirgill, Ravi Kishan and Varanasi actor Vineet Singh in important roles.
