BENGALURU: The   in Karnataka has been slammed in the editorial of Shiv Sena’s mouthpiece Samna for making an issue of   president   supposedly having consumed non-vegetarian food before visiting Kanakachala Lakshmi Narasimha temple in Kanakagiri, Koppal district, during his recent four-day tour of   region. 

 Samna on Thursday said the BJP was getting the jitters after Rahul’s successful temple run in Gujarat, which he was now replicating in Karnataka. 
 
 “Rahul, through his soft Hindutva, was pinning the BJP down, which has became a cause of concern for them. It is immaterial what Rahul ate and condemnable that the BJP has made it an issue despite evidence being provided that he had only vegetarian food. What was in Rahul’s plate, only he knows. But the BJP is getting stomach cramps on it,’’ it stated.
