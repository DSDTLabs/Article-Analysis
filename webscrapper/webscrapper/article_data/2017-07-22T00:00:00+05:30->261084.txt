Neer Dose, in which   played a commercial sex worker, was, in many ways, a defining role for the actress. But as is the case more often than not, the movie offers she got thereafter pitched her in similar roles. “While I was happy that people recognized me as a performer, that was not a space I was looking at getting stuck in. I also did not want to go back to doing the routine heroine song-and-dance act, so I took a break and focused on family and doing things I hadn’t done in a while,” says Hariprriya, who is sitting tight with a good lineup of films slated to hit screens in the latter half of the year.
“It’s been a good year in terms of the characters I have got to play. All my roles are different from each other, offering me something fresh to work on, be it in Bharjari,   or Katha Sangama. Samhaara, for instance, has me in two distinct looks, in a role that is very rare to come by for a heroine, while Katha Sangama, which has me in one arc of the seven-story anthology, directed by Kiran Raj (who was an associate on Rikki), gives me the opportunity to be a part of the wave of new-age cinema in Kannada,” adds Hariprriya.
 Up next, the actress is headed to the set of the magnum opus  , which has Darshan in the lead. Rumour has it that Hariprriya’s character represents maya (illusion), which can be attractive or destructive, as the case maybe. Ask the actress and she remains tightlipped about her role. “All my portions will be with Darshan,” is all that she tells us.
