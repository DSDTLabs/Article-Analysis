PATNA: In a first, the   (BSEB) has been directed by the state government to conduct online admissions for Class XI and graduation courses in government schools and colleges in the state from the 2018-19 session.

 Admissions to 3,277 schools as well as colleges of 11 universities will be processed through this centralised system. These 11 universities do not include Patna University, Aryabhatt Knowledge University and   Arabic and Persian University.
 
 Giving this information on Friday, BSEB chairman Anand   said a mobile app and a software were being developed for the purpose of registration for these admissions. The mobile app would be developed within 15 days, and the information related to the schools and colleges would be made available online soon thereafter. 
 
 “The app and the portal will have all the details regarding the number of seats, quota system, courses on offer and fee structure etc,” he said.
 
 Registration with the portal will be free, but students will be charged Rs 300 for application form. “Admission seekers can give preferences for admission to up to 20 colleges or schools,” Kishor said.
