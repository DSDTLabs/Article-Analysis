Lakhbir, along with some other youths, had gone to talk to Gagandeep in this regard at the village bus stand. Seeing a group coming towards him, Gagandeep took it otherwise and fled the spot, leaving his motorcycle behind. The boys, including Lakhbir, had damaged Gagandeep’s motorcycle. The matter reached the police station but a compromise was reached.”
