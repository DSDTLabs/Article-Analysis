MUMBAI: Just days before the BMC  , activists from the Save   movement and members of the Aam Aadmi Party ( ) said that they had all taken a decision to cast their vote depending on political parties’ stand on saving Aarey  , the green lung of Mumbai. With the hashtag #VoteToSaveAarey, activists want to spread the message among Mumbaikars that they should not vote for a political party that does not pledge to save the green space. 

 On Friday, members of AAP and the Aarey conservation group said they would be approaching various parties to give them a commitment that they would save Aarey. Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation, which is executing the Mumbai Metro III underground corridor from Colaba to Seepz, was allotted 30 hectares of land inside Aarey Colony by the government for a car shed.
 
 National executive member of AAP, Preeti Menon Sharma said: “Aarey is the last green lung of Mumbai and the state government wants to use it for setting up a Metro car shed. We realized that elections are the only time when people’s voice is heard and therefore we have decided to get a commitment from every party to protect Aarey. In fact we feel that people should categorically vote against any party that goes not pledge to save Aarey.” 
 
 Amrita Bhattacharya from Aarey Conservation Group said: “It’s surprising that we have to tell the government to save Aarey.” Actor and   Raghu Ram said if a party does not give a commitment to save Aarey they would campaign against its candidate. 
 
 A video message on why Mumbaikars must vote to Save Aarey has also been created and played on social media.
