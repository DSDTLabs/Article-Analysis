KOLKATA: Trinamool’s former   called on   leader   on Friday, a day ahead of BJP announcing its candidate for the Noapara assembly bypoll. 

 Basu gave vent to her resentment over Trinamool’s ways yet again, fuelling speculation that she might contest the bypoll on a BJP ticket. 
 
 “I have been kept away from party activities in Noapara. It is an insult to me and my departed husband,” Basu said. Her quitting Trinamool became all the more apparent after party secretary general   told media that Basu’s joining BJP would be a political blunder.
 
 The arch-rival of TMC’s Bhatpara MLA Arjun Singh, Basu wields influence in Barrackpore North Municipality and Barrackpore Cantt area. 
 
 According to Trinamool sources, a section in the party may break ranks and join BJP, given the factionalism within Trinamool. With   still having a considerable support base in Barrackpore, Trinamool may come under serious challenge in the constituency.
 
 Singh’s rise in Barrackpore politics following Roy’s exit has fuelled fears that he will muzzle dissent in his own way. CPM North 24 Parganas secretary Gautam Deb said: “We will respond to Singh the way he takes — lathis for lathis, bullets for bullets.”
