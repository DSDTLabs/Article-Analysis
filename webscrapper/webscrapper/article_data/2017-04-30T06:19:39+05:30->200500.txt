PATNA: A private chain of hospitals,  , started its   services on Saturday at its new branch in the erstwhile   building at Rajendra Nagar in the city. Cardiologist Dr Prabhat Kumar has been appointed the vice-chairman of its Patna branch, to be known as Medica Magadh Hospital. Dr Prabhat was earlier associated with the Heart Hospital.

 Dr Prabhat said services like angioplasty, emergency cardiac surgery and bypass surgery would be available at the hospital. 
 
 He said the   doctors would also perform aortic valve surgery which is rarely done in Bihar. He pegged this as the USP of the hospital. In this surgery, a valve can be replaced with artificial one through a minimally invasive procedure, that is, a surgery in which incisions of small size are made as compared to other surgeries. 
 
 With regards to paediatric surgery, he said the hospital would start it in future. It would be done by cardiac surgeons and not by paediatric surgeons. It may be mentioned that Bihar has no paediatric surgeon till date.
 
 The hospital is still to start its indoor services. “We will start them very soon. It will be a 100-bed hospital,” the vice-chairman said, adding the total manpower of the hospital, including doctors and paramedical staff, is around 90.
 
 The president of the hospital group, Dr Sudhanshu Rai, and its co-founder Dr Aenabh Dev Gupta were also present on the occasion. It has branches in some cities of  , Assam and West Bengal.
