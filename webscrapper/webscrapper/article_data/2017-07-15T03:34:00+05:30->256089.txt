Panaji: A Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Goa Police, on Friday visited the dump site at Vaghus, Pale, in Bicholim taluka, which the directorate of mines and geology had not yet verified. SIT officials, accompanied by officers of the directorate of mines and geology visited the site following a disclosure by trader Philip Jacob who was arrested recently. Jacob is accused of purchasing more than 10 lakhs metric tons of iron ore worth over Rs 300 crore, said a SIT official.  The department is yet to verify a large iron ore dump that still remains at the site, said a SIT official. They said that so far their investigation has revealed the names of the mine owners involved who had received over Rs 100 crore from Jacob via bank transfers and cash payments. These mine owners dumped iron ore from different leases at the site, and in connivance with some officialas of the diretorate of mines, illegally exported it without paying royalty. Jacob and other traders were involved in the illegal trade, said a SIT officer.  The inspection team was led by PI Dattaguru Sawant.
