BHOPAL: A 17-year-old boy, who scored 97% in Class 10 and had left home to prepare for IIT-JEE, killed himself on Monday evening, saying he was lonely and didn’t want to live because his family wasn’t giving him enough time.

 The victim, Ravi Sahu, was depressed that his father, a farmer, wasn’t speaking much to him these days. The anguished father, who came over from Jhansi to take the body for the last rites, said they weren’t calling Ravi often enough for fear of disturbing his studies.
 
 Ravi, a Class XII student, was sent to   to prepare for IIT-JEE after his impressive score in the Class X board exams raised his hopes and that of the entire family, say police. He was in Class XII in Saraswati School in Bhopal’s Pushpa Nagar and would attend coaching classes instead of going to school regularly.
 
 He lived with his cousin, who works in a college, and his wife in Ashoka Garden area. But the Jhansi boy was unhappy in Bhopal. His last note says that his best days were when he was back home with his family. He felt his parents did not pay attention to him any more, say police. 
 
 His suicide lists his family not giving him time among other things like “issues with his life” and “family problems”, said police. Ravi was alone at home when he hanged himself. His cousin and his wife returned at night to find his body and called police.
 
 Sub-inspector Atul Dixit of Ashoka Garden police station said Ravi was a bright student, who had chosen mathematics. “It appears he killed himself because he felt his family wasn’t giving him enough time. The exact reason is yet to be clear,” said Dixit.
 
 Ravi;s father, Asharam Sahu, is farmer in a village in Jhansi and also runs a tent house business. The boy has two sisters. His family came to Bhopal on Tuesday to take the body after autopsy. According to Dixit, the father said that he and other family members did not talk much with him because they did not want d to disturb his studies.
