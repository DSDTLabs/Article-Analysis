The   (IAF) has set up a first-of-its kind laboratory for repairing, calibrating and extending the shelf-life of its chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) equipment at the 9   (BRD) at Chandannagar recently.

 Air Marshal Hemant Sharma, air officer commanding-in-chief of the IAF's Maintenance Command, inaugurated the new lab recently.The 9 BRD, a key unit of IAF Maintenance Command, which is headquartered in Nagpur, is responsible for repairing and serving avionics and various other ranges of electronics equipment of the IAF.
 
 The idea behind the new facility is to avoid delays in repairing CBRN equipment, which are often used in survival drills conducted by the IAF personnel, sources said.
 
 A senior IAF officer from Maintenance Command told TOI over phone on Monday, “Since the IAF has been carrying out survival drill regularly at various   stations; it is important to have CBRN equipment like special NBC suit, mask, filter, etc. in good shape." In the past, the IAF had to send these equipment to the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for repairs. This would entail several clearances which were time consuming and tedious, the officer added. The command's endeavour is not only to repair equipment quickly but also consider cost effectiveness, he said.
 
 “We are quite hopeful that this laboratory would help us in reducing cost required for repairing CBRN equipment annually," the officer said. The IAF has been making effort towards creating awareness among air warriors followed by reinforcing the gained knowledge by carrying out practical drills and training sessions a number of times, the IAF sources informed.
 
 The officer said that the current training was focused on preparing air warriors towards becoming confident enough to handle the nuances of CBRN warfare or disaster management and, gradually , become confident to handle the situation effectively.
