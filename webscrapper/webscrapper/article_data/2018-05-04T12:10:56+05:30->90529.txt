CARDIFF:   (QA) group chief executive Akbar Al Baker has a private pilot licence and has steered the airline he has been heading for 21 years now. He is now planning to expand his conglomerate’s operations in a big way outside, what he terms ‘illegal’ blockade-hit Qatar. He spoke to TOI in   and revealed his new plans for India — that go beyond airline. Excerpts:

 
 
 
 Rahul Bhatia (IndiGo cofounder) is a dear friend. He has a very well-run airline. I have said many times and will say again that if there was an opportunity for us to take a large stake in IndiGo, QA will be interested. But that has to happen prior to me launching an airline (in India). Once I launch an airline there, then I will not be interested in anybody’s shares.
 
 
 
 We are not bidding for Air India. I know that there are entities claiming QA is interested in AI. That is not true.
 
 
 
 Some private airlines from time to time keep mentioning that they are in talks with QA. That is not true. We are not in talks with anyone. This is done to boost share prices by (either the airlines making those claims) or individuals hoping to buy and sell shares based on such false announcements. For last 6-7 years, I have been saying such claims are made to boost (their) share prices.
 
 
 
 Beyond the airline, the only other area we will enter India is hospitality. We will do this on our own. (QA has a hotel company under the brand Dhiafatina). We will have five star hotels and are always scouting for sites. I have not fixed any target so far in terms of how many hotels in India and by when. We are taking our ground handling to three other countries, including  . However, since India does not allow foreign companies in this area, we are not taking that to India.
