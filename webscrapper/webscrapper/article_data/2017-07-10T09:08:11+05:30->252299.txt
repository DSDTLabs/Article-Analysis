PUNE: A sessions court here has convicted and sentenced a 39-year-old man from   in   to one-year simple imprisonment for sexually harassing a nine-year-old girl in   on March 28, last year. 

 Additional sessions judge   relied on the steady evidence provided by the survivor and other evidence on record while convicting the accused,  , in a judgment pronounced on July 7. 
 
 Pawar was found guilty of offences punishable under Section 509 (intentional insult to outrage modesty of woman) and Sections 11 read with 12 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The court sentenced him to one-year in jail on both these counts although, the sentences are to run concurrently, it ruled. 
 
 On that day, the survivor was washing clothes when the accused flashed her. 
 
 The court observed that during the search cross-examination, no material contractions or omission came in the evidence recorded by the girl’s mother. The girl was cross-examined but the defence could not bring out any contradiction on record. “The evidence of the girl also corroborated the evidence of her mother,” the court observed. Similarly, the investigation by the police completely corroborated the case put up by the prosecution, the court added.
