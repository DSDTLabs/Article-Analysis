Vijayawada: Volatility in the banking sector has led to the much-anticipated Hybrid Annuity Model ( ), proposed by the Capital Region Development Authority (  ), finding no takers. It was proposed to construct roads for villages in Amaravati.

 Under this model, those who win the project will take loans from the banks and then use the fund in the project. The CRDA will eventually payback the   to the banks. 
 
 The urban body had invited tenders for the project. But the plan fell through after contractors revealed to that they have been unable to raise the loan. Banks are not ready to sanction loans for infrastructure projects said officials.
 
 Before the introduction of HAM, the Union government followed three different models –PPP Annuity, PPP Toll and EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) — while opting for private sector participation. 
 
 HAM was proposed as the existing model posed several complex problems. Given the government’s vision to lend impetus to India’s growth rate, it found that a large number of infrastructural projects were blocked in bureaucratic web. This not only led to a waste of time but also added to India’s existing NPA problem.
 
 The CRDA has now decided to raise the loans on its own.
 
 HAM is a mix of two existing models – BOT Annuity and EPC. In BOT annuity, a developer takes up the project, operates it for a certain duration and transfers it back to the government. The government pays the developer in phases. Under EPC model, the cost is completely borne by the government. In HAM payment is made in a fixed amount for a considerable period and then in a variable amount in the remaining period. This hybrid type of payment method is attached under the HAM.
