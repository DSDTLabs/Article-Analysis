SIVAGANGA: Pro-jallikattu supporters staged a protest against Kollywood actress Trisha, who is currently shooting for her upcoming film in Sivaganga district, for her association with   (PETA). The protest forced the film crew to call off the day's shoot on Friday. 

 Trisha is currently shooting for Garjanai, an upcoming Tamil thriller, which is inspired by the Hindi film NH10 featuring Anushka Sharma in the lead.
 
 Trisha has been shooting in the villages near Karaikudi for a while now. The protesters thronged a spot in   village near Kallal after they came to know that the shooting was to take place there and were expecting the actress to make her presence. But, only a caravan and a van carrying equipment were present. The protesters then raised slogans against the actress and police had to rush to spot to pacify them. 
 
 As news about the protests broke, the actress preferred to stay put at the hotel.
 
 Meanwhile, police found that the shooting in a village near Kallal in the district was being held without proper permission and booked one of the managers, Kumar for the violation.
 
 At a time when jalliakattu is widely discussed in Tamil Nadu, stars from the cinema industry are closely monitored by public for their stand on the issue. While actors like Kamal Haasan and Silambarasan have been lauded for their pro-jallikattu stand, those opposing the conduct of the event are receiving brickbats on social networking sites. Even those who had association with Peta are being trolled on social media.TNN
