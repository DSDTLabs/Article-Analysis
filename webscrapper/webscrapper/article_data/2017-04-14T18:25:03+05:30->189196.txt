CHENNAI: Egypt's   stopped the brave run of India's promising   in the final of the  , a   event held in Johannesburg late on Thursday.

 Elsherbini too, like Velavan, was yearning for his maiden PSA title and duly grabbed his chance to win 11-8, 11-7, 12-10, 11-8. Accuracy was the Egyptian's forte and even though the Indian showed the ability to counter many of his rival's attacking strokes with his gliding movements on the court, the test proved too stiff. Velavan did pluck one game but the 55 minute tussle swung away from him in the final analysis.
 
 Earlier, the Chennai lad had made his maiden PSA final after getting the better of third seed   of England 12-10, 11-7, 11-9. Velavan, who won the British Junior Open earlier this year, edged the Englishman in the close opening game before taking control of proceedings.
 
 His compatriot Harinder did not have things his way and went down 8-11, 6-11, 5-11 to Elsherbini in the semifinals.
 
 Meanwhile, it was curtains for   as well as she lost to second seed   of France in the quarterfinal of the women’s world squash championship on Wednesday.
