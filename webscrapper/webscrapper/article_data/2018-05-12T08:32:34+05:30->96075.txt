CHENNAI: With talks failing, schools affiliated to   ( ) will once again not be a part of the   admission portal launched by the state government last year.

 Neither the CBSE regional office in Chennai nor the state government, which issues recognition to  , has data pertaining to the number of students admitted under RTE in the past five years.
 
 Except for a handful of CBSE schools, most have completed the admission process without reserving seats under RTE as they have not got reimbursement funds yet, said a senior official from the  . “We are taking efforts to regulate and ensure that they will be brought into the online portal from next year,” he said.
 
 S Arumainathan, president of  , said none of the CBSE schools in Chennai gives them RTE application forms as government is yet to release the pending amount.
 
 “Top schools, both CBSE and private matriculation, complete admission after receiving donations and submit RTE applications on their behalf. By this, they reduce the chance of other deserving applicants from getting a seat. Only one or two, who haven’t been admitted by the school management, get admitted under RTE,” said Eswaran from MDMK.
 
 Rejecting this, S Vishalakshi from   said the entire process was online and there was completely transparency. “The government should not delay in releasing the funds. So far, we haven’t received a single penny for admitting students under RTE in 2016-17 and 2017-18.” 
 
 Though the Act says the reimbursement process should be completed by January in the same academic year, delay by central government has hit proper implementation of these provisions. 
 
 “With no financial support from the Centre, the state is bearing the entire burden and amount for 2016-17 will reach the schools in a week’s time,” the school education department official added.
