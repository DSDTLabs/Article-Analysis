AHMEDABAD: Airfares on the Delhi and Mumbai sectors from Ahmedabad have reported a sharp rise for the upcoming week, ahead of   into the city. Estimates by tour operators indicate that airfares to Delhi and Mumbai have surged by at least three times on account of Plast-India 2018 which is organized in Gandhinagar from Wednesday to Sunday.

 “Airfares have gone up significantly especially towards Mumbai. For instance, a roundtrip flight Ahmedabad-Mumbai-Ahmedabad would typically cost Rs 5,500 and when booked in the last minute, the same would be around Rs 8,000. Currently, the fares for last minute bookings for a round-trip flight are around Rs 32,000,” said Sharad Kabra, director of a city-based holiday and travel company.
 
  
  The same is true for the   sector, wherein the prices have increased upwards of Rs 11,000 for a one-way, direct, economy class flight currently.
 
 The primary reason for increase in prices is the dynamic pricing policy implemented by airlines. However, industry stakeholders feel that the government should impose a cap on the dynamic prices as it becomes exorbitant. “During festivals, we’ve noticed the trend of airfare surge however, of late, mega business events are planned a year in advance and thus, airlines tend to increase the airfares for specific sectors during the specific dates,” said Anuj Pathak, secretary,   and Tour Operators Association of Gujarat (TAG).
 
 “This time around, even corporate prices which often come at a discount are running high. Even as the availability is good, airfares skyrocket beyond limits on certain dates. The government must impose a cap on the dynamic pricing to curb this,” he added. Travel operators claim that even the corporate rates have been running high by at least 40%.
