AJMER: The state   claimed that the quality of education in Rajasthan has increased 8-20% in last two years. The department made this claim based on National and State learning Achievement   report of NCERT (National Council for Education Research and Training) and SIRT (State Institute of Research and Training) of Udaipur. State education minister Vasudev Devnani said that this is a positive indication in the sector of quality education and Rajasthan is moving ahead in this field.

 The combined report of NCERT and SIRT stated that in 2016 students are doining well in Hindi, Mathematics and Science subjects and there is increase of 8-20%. The survey also revealed that understanding of education has increased and students have gained ability to score more marks in comparison to previous years.
 
 The survey also revealed that teachers are now more smooth with the new evaluation system and are therefore evaluating students with different methods to analyse their understanding of the subject. The survey shows that not only education but also quality education which was lacking mostly in government schools is now pacing up. 
 
 Both these surveys were conducted in all 33 districts of the state as part of which four blocks in each district were taken to evaluate the education standards. The survey reached to this conclusion after sampling of 2,580 schools that examined 40,596 students of classes III, V and VII. 
 
 As per the analysis it was also found that Comprehensive and Continuous Evaluation (CCE) system has been adopted well both by students and teachers. 
 
 The survey also revealed that teachersâ€™ acceptance of CCE has increased the quality of education in classrooms. 
 
 State minister Devnani said that merging of schools, teachers-students average in classrooms, availability of subject teachers in schools and continuous evaluation is the key of progress of quality education in Rajasthan.
