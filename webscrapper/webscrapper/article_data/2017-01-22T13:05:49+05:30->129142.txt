Actor  , who was last seen in ‘Wajah Tum Ho’ will soon be seen hosting an action and adventure  . In a statement Gurmeet said, “This is the first time that a hard-core action-based series is being made for the web. I love performing stunts, the more dangerous they are, the more I am driven. The best part about the series is that I will be performing each and every stunt before the contestants do it.”
