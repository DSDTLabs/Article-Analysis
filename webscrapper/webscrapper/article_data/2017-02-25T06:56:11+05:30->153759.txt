FATEHPUR:   chief   on Friday accused Prime Minister   of ignoring issues of national interests to play communal politics and influence voters in UP assembly elections. 

 Mayawati said instead of worrying about issues like the US curtailing H1-B visa that could potentially affect the country's IT industry, Modi was worried about 'Qabristan', 'Shamshan' and 'Kasab'. "He is not even bothered about the killing of an Indian in the US. The neglect was not less than 'criminal' for a person holding the seat of the PM," she said.
 
 Addressing a rally in Fatehpur, Modi had said: "If you create Qabristan (cemetery) in a village, then a shamshaan (cremation ground) should also be created. If there's an uninterrupted electricity supply for Ramzan, then it should be so for Diwali too."A day later,   national president Amit Shah said the people of UP should get rid of KASAB (Ka for Congress, Sa for   and B for Bahujan Samaj Party).
 
 The BSP chief said that Modi and his colleagues were deliberately issuing statements with communal overtones to influence voters in UP along religious lines. She said the BJP government had already pushed the people into a grave crisis by demonetising currency. "The issue continues to haunt the BJP," Mayawati said.
