  It explores how the relationship between a father and his son changes over time, if at all. I’m sure the audience will be able to relate to the story.
 
 
  I play Aryanil, who is settled in the US and comes to India to visit his old, ailing father. An intimately sensitive man going through an unsettling phase in his personal life, Aryanil is deeply attached to his father, but he is cut off from the soul who once shaped his life. Within the five days of their reunion, lost chapters curiously reopen and incidents that were long forgotten suddenly become relevant. In the process, Aryanil is faced with a fresh crisis.
 
 
 
 
 
  I was never strict with my children. In fact I always tried to be their friend, as that’s how my father used to be with me. I told them I can only be their guide and ultimately it’s their life and they have to shape it the way they want.
 
 
  The dynamics of a father-son relationship changes with time. So, Mishuk and I are more like friends now. I am not a strict father, as I feel too much of strictness can make a child stubborn. My father ( ) used to live in Mumbai, so whenever Baba used to be home, it was party time for us. To me, Soumitra jethu is no less than a father and this film will always be special for me, as I got to work with a stalwart like him from such close quarters.
