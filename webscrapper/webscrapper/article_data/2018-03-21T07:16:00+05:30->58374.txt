GREATER NOIDA: The   on Tuesday issued notices to as many as 24   for failing to deposit 10% registration amount and submit detailed project reports (DPRs) even a month after signing   with the Authority.

 Some 28 companies signed MoUs worth Rs 10,074 crore with YEIDA before and during the two-day Investor’s Summit in Lucknow on February 21-22. Of these, only four companies — Param, Ramsons, Buildmech and Yatharth — have given the money and the detailed project reports (DPRs) to the Authority so far, officials said.
 
 “These 24 companies have been given time till March 31 to complete the formalities failing which Yeida’s allotment committee will take a call on the projects,” Shailendra Bhatia, officer on special duty to Yeida, told TOI.
 
 The combined investment to be done by these four companies turns out to be more than Rs 1,250 crore. While Param is keen to invest Rs 950 crore in a food processing plant, Yatharth is interested to invest Rs 300 crore. Ramsons and Build Mech are also interested to invest Rs 20 and Rs 4 crore, respectively.
 
 A total of 674 acres of industrial land in sectors 29, 32, 35, 24, etc has been earmarked by Yeida for these projects.
 
 An investor can now get multiple clearances from a single-window portal (SWP) called Nivesh Mitra which will automatically direct departments like fire, electricity, tax, etc to provide necessary clearance for the said project.
 
 Yeida has also been linked with the SWP and officials say that two services will be provided by the Authority to the investors online — land allotment and map approval.
 
 “The multiple permissions/no objection certificates (NOCs) required from fire/tax/electricity and other departments can now be applied for at SWP and same can be obtained from SWP itself after some time,” Bhatia said.
