 “How many bars will you shut?“ asked truck driver   even as he got busy parking his vehicle at the   crossing on the   on Thursday morning. Singh says the various dhabas and even crossings are now the `watering holes'. “You ask for the brand and you get it. Of course, you need to shell out more. But then the deal is very clear -if they cannot arrange for the liquor, we do not pay for the meal,“ says Singh.
 
 Citizens who visited Kolaghat recently say they have been approached by individuals at smaller hotels. So what are the rates? “ A bottle of beer which costs anything between Rs 150 and Rs 250 are being sold for Rs 50 to Rs 75 more. The costlier ones so ught by motorists are being sold at larger profits.
 
 “Despite the high costs, we found people are wil ling to pay extra to get the liquor,“ explained a tou rist who returned from Kharagpur on Tuesday night and stopped over near Kolaghat.
 
 Truckers with whom TOI spoke said they are getting leads through word-of-mouth.“The first two days were tough. But as we stopped over at night, the word spread. Initially, we had to wait for the delivery . But if this continues, the stocks will be found through the day,“ said a driver.
