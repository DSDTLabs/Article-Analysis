MYSURU: In a symbolic   the Supreme Court order on the sharing of the River Cauvery’s waters, members of the Kannada Chaluvaligarara Sangha carried stone slabs on their heads.

 The protesters gathered near the statue of Mahatma Gandhi, close to the Mysuru Law Courts complex, dubbed the apex court’s verdict ‘unfair’ to Karnataka. “The Supreme Court has ordered Karnataka to release 4tmc of water to Tamil Nadu, which is grave injustice to the farmers of Karnataka. There is no water for the people of Karnataka,” said the protesters.
 
 Voicing their reservations over the possible formation of the   Water Management Board, the protesters said, “Over 90 cities, 20 taluks, and two lakh villages will be parched, and two-thirds of Bengaluru will not have drinking water if the board is formed. It will prove disastrous for Karnataka.”
 
 Although Krishna Raja Sagar, Harangi, Hemavathi and Kabini reservoirs were in Karnataka, the water would not belong to the state, they feared. “It is crucial to unite behind former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda and fight for our water,” the protesters said.
