MUMBAI:   slapped a fine of Rs20,000 on a Mumbaikar and dismissed his petition that sought a   of his estranged wife for  . Justice Girish Kulkarni said it was attempt to harass his wife and agreed with the woman that the plea was an "abuse of the process of law". 

 Justice Kulkarni said the family court was right in rejecting the man's application, which saw it as a bid to claim belatedly that his wife was of "incurably unsound mind" a ground for divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act. The fine has to be paid to his wife within four weeks. 
 
 "The family court judge correctly observed that the man merely stating about physiological, biological and mental medical check-up, was not sufficient. Nowhere it was described what he meant by physiological, biological and mental medical check-up. So also he is vague and has not detailed as to the nature of the medical check-up he intends (his wife) to undergo," said Justice Kulkarni. "The plea, sought to be raised on behalf of the man, was raised after more than two years from filing of the (case in the family court for divorce) as an afterthought. It clearly appears it is an attempt by the man to cause harassment to the wife," the judge said. 
 
 The man had filed a divorce petition against his wife before the family court in 2015. In 2017, he sought a "complete physiological, biological and mental medical check-up" of his wife, who he claimed was suffering from "acute mental sickness". The family court rejected his application and he filed an appeal in the HC. The only "evidence" he could produce was a note by an orthopaedic surgeon recommending that his wife undergo sonography.
