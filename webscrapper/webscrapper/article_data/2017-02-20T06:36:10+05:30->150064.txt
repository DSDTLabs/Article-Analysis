MUMBAI: More than a month after the fracas over replacing Mahatma Gandhi's pictures with that of PM   in its diaries and calendars, the Khadi & Village Industries Commission (KVIC) has been served a memo by the Centre for its decision, official sources said here.

 The ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME) has shot off a detailed memo to KVIC stipulating stringent guidelines to be adhered to in future.
 
 The memo has ordered the KVIC to henceforth send any such proposal for the approval of the  , routed through the ministry of MSME, which has administrative jurisdiction over KVIC. “KVIC has to ensure that the office of ministers secretary is kept informed of any such major eventactivities which are undertaken by KVIC as part of its promotio nal activity,“ the memo of February 14 makes clear.
 
 It asked the KVIC to ensu re that in future, it should send any such mails to the official email ids of the PS of the ministers, secretary and officers of the ministry.
 
 “The private email ID should not be used for any official correspondence. The directives should be followed scrupulously ,“ warned the memo, signed by KVIC deputy CEO YK Baramatikar.
 
 The memo effectively debunked the claims made by KVIC brass that it had reportedly sought the PMO's clearance before replacing Mahatma Gandhi's pictures with Modi's in its 2017 wall calendars and desktop diaries.
