 “There are elaborate modernization plans and the number of ships and aircraft will go up in the next four years. We now have 135 ships and 64 aircraft. By 2022, we plan to have 200 ships and 100 aircraft. Last year, three ships were added to the fleet. We plan to add three more by March, 2019. The new assets are also upgraded ones. The Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV) Vijaya will be based at Paradip and will carry out operations in the Bay of Bengal. We are also planning to procure new helicopters. These will include heavy helicopters, some of which also be based at Bhubaneswar,” Nautiyal said.
 
 According to the ADG, Visakhapatnam will also be getting an advanced OPV soon. These Vikram Class OPVs are being built by L&T and have a long range allowing greater endurance. These ships can also carry helicopters for surveillance and combat roles as well as search and rescue operations.

The force has played a crucial role in saving lives of fishermen, both from India and Bangladesh, in the Bay of Bengal and officials believe that the new assets will come as a shot in the arm. 
 
 “We shall also be getting 17 radar stations in Phase-II of the government’s effort to bring the entire coastline of the country under surveillance. These assets will come in very handy,” Nautiyal said.
