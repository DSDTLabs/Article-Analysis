VIJAYAWADA: Unauthorised garbage dumping is causing problems in  , which got the tag of India’s ‘Cleanest Big City’ in Swachh Survekshan- 2018. 

 While   ( ) is trying to give a new shape to the B R Ambedkar Inner   Road, builders in the city are dumping debris and construction wastes there. 
 
 In order to curb the dumping of garbage on vacant spaces in the city, the civic body started greenery and beautification works. 
 
 Around 200 CCTV cameras were installed at dumper bins and canal bunds in the city. Besides, the officials arranged protective meshes on bridges to prevent people from dumping garbage in the canals, and this measure also yielded positive results. 
 
 To avoid being penalised by VMC, builders and commercial units started dumping garbage on both sides of the inner ring road. Tonnes of garbage piled up on Inner ring road from   flyover to   ring are damaging the look of the city and causing inconvenience to people. “The inner ring road is filled with garbage and VMC officials are ignoring the cleaning process of the flyovers at Ramavarappadu. Dumping of garbage has doubled up recently, though civic authorities are taking stringent measures to curb it in the city. The inner ring road is the face of the city and many tourists passing through the area will feel bad about the city,” said K. Ganesh Kumar, a resident of Hanuman Nagar in Ramavarappadu
 
 The civic body’s intention to turn the inner ring road into hangout hub is getting diverted with the open dumping of garbage there, said Anupama. G, a techie. Civic body should take stringent action against the builders for polluting streets and show alternative ways to make the city clean.
 
 Sanitation wing of VMC says that the issue is in their notice and heading to take stringent action soon.
