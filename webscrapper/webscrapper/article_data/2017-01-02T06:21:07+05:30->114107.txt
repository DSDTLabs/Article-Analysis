MUMBAI: In an attack on   (IT) authorities for recent raids on Trimbakeshwar temple priests, Sena mouthpiece   accused the   regime of targetting Hindus while turning a blind eye to alleged ill-gotten wealth by other communities' shrines.

 “The   and Lalu Prasad, Mulayam Singh Yadav brand of secularism pales into insignificance before the Centre's,“ Saamna said in a recent editorial.Its comment is an indication that Sena is set to play the Hindutva card to garner non-Marathi votes in the 2017 BMC polls, said analysts. “The I-T raided residences of Hindu priests but didn't show courage to come down heavily on Christian priests... Radical forces get funds from some special mosques...“ Saamna said.“The priests haven't made money from gambling or liquor trade. They perform rituals...Why the I-T raided their homes is a puzzle,“ said Saamna.
