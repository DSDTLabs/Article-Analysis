PUDUCHERRY: Hundreds of  , who visited the Union territory of   on Saturday, were put to great hardships as they were stranded at the Tamil Nadu-Puducherry border without any transportation facility to reach the Union territory due to the dawn-to-dusk   called by the DMK, Left parties and VCK and allies of ruling Congress party to register their protest against ‘undemocratic and autocratic style of functioning’ of lt governor Kiran Bedi.

 The tourists, who managed to reach Puducherry by train and bus could not commute to the major landmarks as buses,   and tempos were off the roads. They depended on small eateries near the hospitals as a majority of the hotels without accommodation facilities did not open on Saturday. Those who reached Puducherry in four wheelers were also scared to go around the town fearing attack from the protestors.
 
 “Protesters broke the windscreen of a   bus forcing the vehicles already in the bus stand to remain stationary and sending a warning to the ones that were on their way over to Puducherry. A few buses plying between Puducherry and Chennai were parked just past the Puducherry-Tamil Nadu border and had been waiting for hours for a few passengers. But travellers had a tough time reaching the spot since autos simply refused to go anywhere near the border fearing attack from the protestors” said a tourist from Chennai.
 
  “The passenger will get off safe but when returning to town, but our vehicles are likely to get pelted with stones and I can’t afford a broken wind screen,” an auto driver said.
