HYDERABAD: At a time when the state government is spending crores of rupees to increase the green cover under its flagship programme 'Telanganaku Haritha Haram', students of   (UoH) have alleged that trees are being chopped down in the university and sold. While the varsity has denied this, students have alleged that not only outsiders but even varsity administration is uprooting trees at the campus forconstruction. 

 "We caught some outsiders   inside the campus on Sunday. There were five men and they had cut around 30 trees and were throwing the logs across the compound wall. Every time when something like this is brought to university's notice, they deny it. Even the varsity itself had earlier cut down trees at Buffalo lake area, cleared a 5-km stretch and now they are doing the same for construction of a school near an archaeological site," Ravi J, a student, said.
 
 Students also alleged that poor security had allowed illegal timber smugglers to have a free run inside the campus.
 
 But UoH security officer TV Rao debunked the accusations. "This is a rumour that students are spreading. The university has never cut down trees except when they have to take up construction. We are spending lakhs for tree plantation drive, why would we cut down trees? Neither has the university given permission to outsiders to chop trees," said Rao. Forest department officials were also not aware of Sunday's incident, adding that they had not received any official complaint from either students or university authorities. "No one has brought this issue to our notice. 
 
 Also, no one has taken prior permission to cut down trees. So, if someone had really cut down trees, we will prosecute them. And based on the kind of tree they had chopped they will either be fined, jailed or both," said forest official   V.
