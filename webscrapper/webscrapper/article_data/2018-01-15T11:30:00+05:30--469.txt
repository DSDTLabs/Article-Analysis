 Pushpa Bagade, English teacher, said initially she started extra classes to encourage students to get good marks in the  . “As English was tough for many students, I started this initiative. Later, our headmaster and other colleagues contributed for snacks and started taking extra classes. The SDMC members and parents encouraged us. Most of the time, I send students, especially girls, home in my car as they don’t have proper transport facility late evening,”she said.
 
 “Transport and security is a hurdle when we take extra classes in the evening. But, we resolved it by making our own arrangements. Our extra classes have been shifted to the Urdu school which is in the heart of the village and has adequate lighting,” said Mathematics teacher Usha M.
