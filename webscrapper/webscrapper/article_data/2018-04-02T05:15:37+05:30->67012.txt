President   lit into   Inc for the second time in three days with a pair of Twitter messages that said the online retailer "must pay real costs (and taxes) now!"

 The president on Saturday claimed, citing reports he didn't specify, that the   "will lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon".
 
 Amazon has said the postal service, which has financial problems stretching back for years, makes money on its deliveries.
 
 Amazon shed $53 billion in market value on Wednesday after news website Axios reported that the president is "obsessed" with regulating the e-commerce giant, whose founder and chief executive officer, Jeff Bezos, also owns the Washington Post newspaper Those losses were pared on Thursday, the final day of a shortened trading week, even as Trump tweeted that Amazon was using the postal service as its "Delivery Boy."
 
  spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said on Thursday that while the president was displeased with the e-commerce giant, and particularly instances where third-party sellers on the site didn't collect sales tax, there were no administrative actions planned against Amazon "at this time".
 
 Amazon.com and the Washington Post have been regular punching bags for Trump. In July, the president mused about whether the newspaper was "being used as a lobbyist weapon" to keep Congress from looking into Amazon's business practices. He echoed that comment on Saturday, saying the Post "is used as a 'lobbyist' and should so REGISTER."
 
 Amazon regularly uses the USPS to complete what's called the "last mile" of delivery, with letter carriers dropping off packages at some 150 million residences and businesses daily. It has a network of more than 20 "sort centers" where customer packages are sorted by zip code, stacked on pallets and delivered to post offices for the final leg of delivery.
