SURAT: A police head constable suffered heart attack when he tried to escape after he was caught red-handed accepting bribe by the city anti-corruption bureau ( ) team on Wednesday. 

 Ghanshyam Bedre, a head constable in   police station, was nabbed while accepting Rs 15,000 bribe by team of police inspector N S Chauhan, near Old Surat sub-jail. A man, who had financial dispute with another person, had lodged a complaint with ACB against Bedre, alleging that Bedre had pressurised him to pay Rs 25,000 to avoid legal actions. Recently, the complainant had paid Rs 10,000 to Bedre and was to pay remaining Rs 15,000 on Wednesday. 
 
 The complainant met Bedre near Udhna crossroad and sat in former’s car along with one witness. Another witness had come in front of the car to see the transfer of money. When Bedre realised that it was a trap he tried to escape by driving off in the car. In the bid to escape, the head constable hit one of the witnesses, a   official, who suffered a fracture in the leg. 
 
 ACB team chased Bedre and nabbed him near old Surat sub-jail campus, a few metres from Udhna crossroads. Soon after being nabbed Bedre complained of chest pain and was admitted to a private hospital. Doctors claimed that he had suffered a heart attack.
 
 From Bedre’s car police recovered two liquor bottles, Rs 1.60 lakh in cash and Rs 150 in Nepali currency.
 
  In another case, ACB team led by police inspector CM Jadeja, arrested KM Malivad, police sub-inspector posted in   police station, while accepting bribe of Rs 20,000 in the police station itself. Another accused Rajesh Patel, who escaped from the location, was also booked for aiding Malivad. 
 
 The Malivad had allegedly demanded bribe for helping brother of the complainant in a prohibition case in which he was arrested. The accused had demanded bribe for not seeking police custody of complainant’s brother. Police used audio recording device during the trap.
