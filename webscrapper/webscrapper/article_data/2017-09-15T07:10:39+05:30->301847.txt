 Three weeks after the birth of her daughter, she came back to her marital home. But she was not allo wed to enter. All efforts to reason failed. On Thursday , Debjani came back again, with her daughter. This time she refused to return. Her plight drew attention of the neighbours. They were infuriated when their pleas to the local   for intervention didn't evoke any response.
 
 Debjani's father Kartik said, “I was desperately trying to reach out to Lalbazar. They asked me to call the Nabanna control room. I made a call and they recorded my plea. Soon after, we saw the cops coming.“ When the police efforts get Dipankar and his mother see reason failed, Debjani and her daughter were escorted into the house.
 
 Dipankar refused to speak to the reporters. His mother claimed she feared for her life from Debjani.
