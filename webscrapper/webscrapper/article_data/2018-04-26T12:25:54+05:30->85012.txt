HYDERABAD: The public meeting on April 29 to mark the launch of   (TJS) political party is unlikely to see any joining or defections of leaders from other parties into the TJS. 

 The Telangana Joint Action Committee ( ) and the Telangana Jana Samithi think-tank has decided to confine the meeting to speech of M Kodandaram who will announce the objectives of TJS and the way forward to fulfil the dreams and aspirations of people.
 
 A huge stage is being planned to accommodate 1,000 people representing all sections of the society, mainly family members of Telangana martyrs, farmers and unemployed youth who committed suicide and dalits among others who were inflicted with third degree torture in Nerella.
 
 "One or two people representing almost every section of the society in Telangana, would get a seat on the stage. TJAC and TJS have decided that it would be a huge stage. We are expecting at least 1.5 lakh people to attend the public meeting at Saroornagar stadium," TJAC official spokesperson, Venkat Reddy, told TOI. 
 
 TJAC and TJS leaders including former MLC Dileep Kumar have lodged a complaint with the   alleging that some police officers are not allowing them to erect flags and conduct party programme and street corner meetings. "We have urged DGP   to ensure that police does not stop the vehicles in which TJS leaders, workers and supporters would be coming for the public meeting. It is a political party's public meeting and police should not be a spoilsport," Venkat Reddy said.
 
 TJAC and TJS leader G   said TJS would construct a grand Telangana Martyrs memorial and a park. For this purpose, prof Kodandaram has already appealed to the farmers and kin of martyrs to bring a plough so that they can be melted and used in building a martyrs memorial. "The ruling TRS had announced to construct a grand martyrs memorial, but failed to do it so far," Vidyadhar Reddy said.
