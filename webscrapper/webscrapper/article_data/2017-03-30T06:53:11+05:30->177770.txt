AHMEDABAD: Muslim women from the city are set to stretch out to yoga in their quest for fitness. An NGO will run the yoga classes and about 32 Muslim women from across the city have enrolled so far. The classes are expected to start from next week on private premises in Khanpur. Interestingly, Congress councillor   from Khanpur is among those who have enrolled.

  “Yoga is associated with Indian culture and has nothing to do with religion,” said Kadri. “I don’t mind performing the surya namaskar as it is not a prayer but a collage of 12 asans.”   of the NGO said that yoga would make Muslim women more health-conscious. “More importantly, we want Muslim women to break social barriers,” she said. “Yoga is a science and has nothing do with religion.” There was an uproar last year when some Muslim clerics showed resistance to yoga, especially the surya namaskar, which they said was un-Islamic.
 
 Syed said the classes would be conducted by  , 43, a resident of MB Towers in Khanpur. “Tasneem runs a yoga class attended by 35 women, mostly Muslim,” Syed said. Tasneem, a mother of two, said she overcame an acute thyroid problem with the help of yoga and so recognizes its power.
 
 “I learnt yoga and then started a class. Muslim women have taken to yoga in large numbers to stay fit,” said Tasneem. “Even if you are a homemaker, yoga will help you remain fit and ward off diseases. Yoga is an important part of Indian culture and science, and when the whole world is embracing yoga we, as Indians, should not lag behind.”
 
 Tasneem said yoga does not demand a particular dress code. “I have women coming to my classes in burqa too” she said. Faeza Soniwala, 30, one of Tasneem’s students, said she practises yoga daily and doesn’t think she doing something un-Islamic. “I have been feeling fit and full of energy since I took up yoga,” Soniwala said.
