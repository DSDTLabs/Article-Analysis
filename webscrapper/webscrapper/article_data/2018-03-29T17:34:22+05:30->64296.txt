NEW DELHI: On Wednesday,   and   were banned by   (CA) for 12 months each for their involvement in the ball-tampering controversy that erupted last Saturday during the Cape Town Test match, while  , who had claimed he used sticky yellow tape, was banned for nine months.

 
 
 On Wednesday, the CA Board convened in Johannesburg to determine the sanctions imposed on the guilty trio and not long after, the verdict was revealed. 
 
 
 
 Here are the highlights of CA’s investigation and sanctions: 
 
 - The tampering trio has been banned from all international cricket and domestic cricket in Australia, but can play county cricket and in the IPL (though the IPL Commissioner has since said that Warner and Smith’s contracts have been cancelled). They have also been encouraged to return to club level to help re-connect with the cricket community.
 
  
  
 
 
 - Smith was found to have directed "that evidence of attempted tampering be concealed on the field of play" which equates to telling Bancroft to conceal the sandpaper in his trousers. 
 
 - The former captain was also found to have "misled match officials and others regarding Bancroft’s attempts to artificially alter the condition of the ball" and "misleading public comments regarding the nature, extent and participants of the plan".
 
  
  
 - The former vice-captain Warner has been found to be responsible for “development of a plan to attempt to artificially alter the condition of the ball", and "instruction to a junior player to carry out a plan".
 
 - The 31-year-old was also charged with influencing a junior team-mate on how to tamper with the ball "including demonstrating how it could be done".
 
 - Bancroft, 25, was charged on the basis of being party to efforts to alter the conditions of the ball, following through with his vice-captain’s instructions, following his captain’s directive to conceal the evidence and his on-field lies to the umpires.
 
 - It was found that sandpaper was used by Bancroft on Saturday to rough up the ball, which is in contrary to what he said after play that day when speaking to reporters with Smith. 
 
 - As per CA’s verdict, Smith and Bancroft will have to wait 12 months after the end of their ban before they can be considered for leadership roles. Warner will never be considered for any leadership role. 
 
 - Wicketkeeper Tim Paine, who will lead Australia in the fourth and final Test against South Africa starting Friday, will be the permanent captain.
 
 
 
 - The fourth Test against South Africa, and five ODIs and one Twenty20 on a mini tour of England from on 13 June.
 
 - Under the Future Tours Programme, Australia could play India, South Africa and Lanka between Oct 2018 and Jan 2019.
 
 - They will all be eligible to play in the 2019 World Cup from 30 May to 14 July.
 
 - The next Ashes series is also scheduled for the summer of 2019.
