NEW DELHI: Standing committee chairman Tilak Raj Kataria of North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Friday directed the building department to issue a 48-hour notice to   before carrying out any   drive. The corporation is also planning to request the Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee to extend the deadline for depositing use conversion charges by 90 days. 

 “Traders are facing a lot of problems due to the sealing drive and they should at least get some time to remove the goods from the shops. Delhi Municipal Corporation (DMC) Act also has such a provision,” said Kataria. 
 
 The traders should also get some time to pay the charges as per the new rates notified by  , he added. “We have already written to lieutenant governor   and chief minister   for notification of 351 roads under commercial usage. The deadline needs to be shifted as during that period the government can notify the roads, giving traders some relief.”
 
 Preety Agarwal, mayor of the north corporation, on Friday requested urban development minister Satyendar Jain to notify 156 roads under its jurisdiction as commercial roads. “The minister claims that we have not replied to their letters over the notification of roads while the corporation has sent all replies. The government should coordinate instead of playing politics over this issue,” said Agarwal. 
 
 The monitoring committee has directed the civic bodies to ensure that the traders at 106 local shopping complexes deposit use conversion charges by January 15. 
 
 All councillors in the city have been asked to organise a camp in their respective ward to collect use conversion charges. “We are working to find ways to provide relief to traders. We can’t go against the Supreme Court’s decision but at the same time we don’t want the traders to suffer, too,” said south corporation mayor Kamaljeet Sehrawat.
