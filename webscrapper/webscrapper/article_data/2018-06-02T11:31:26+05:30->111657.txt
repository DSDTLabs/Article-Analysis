PANAJI: Sameer Sardana, who was arrested from the   railway station dormitory in February 2016 on suspicions of   links, has applied before a South Goa court to quash the condition imposed on him not to leave the country without its permission.   in his application stated that, despite detaining him for 12 days, no incriminating evidence was found against him.

 “Possession of literature on different subjects cannot be a ground to claim that he is linked to any banned terror outfit, either beyond pre-operational level or otherwise,” his application made through advocate   stated. The application is likely to come up for hearing next week.
 
 Vasco police inspector has opposed the plea. The PI said that though Sardana could not be linked directly to any terror outfit and the anti-terrorist squad has not received any evidence to link him to any terror case, the ministry of home affairs ( ) is yet to reply to their letter seeking a factual report on Sardana.
 
 At the time, Goa police had written to MHA asking it to verify Sardana’s character and his antecedents in South Asian countries. The MHA, in its preliminary reply, had said that they had not found any evidence to establish Sardana’s links to terror activities either in India or abroad, the PI said. 
 
 Sardana said the ban on his travel outside India has left him unable to secure livelihood in foreign countries. Besides, adverse media publicity, he said, has dealt his life and career a serious dent. “Hence, there are no chances of him getting any respectable employment in India,” his application stated. Despite having two years at their disposal, Sardana said police have not registered an FIR against him.
