PANCHKULA: National Students Union of India ( ) activists allegedly breached the security cordon of chief minister   and raised slogans against him here on Friday. They also showed black flags to the CM as a mark of protest.

 Apparently, the   police was taken aback on Friday when four to five NSUI activists led by former PU student’s council president   and   and three others allegedly breached the CM’s security cordon and started raising slogans against the chief minister.
 
 The incident occurred when CM Manohar Lal   was coming out an auditorium of   after attending a function organized to mark National Youth Day.
 
 The NSUI activists started raising slogans against the CM and also showed him black flags. They alleged that the security did not allow them to ask questions to the CM.
 
 Witnessing a breach, the CM security guards when swung into action, three NSUI activists fled from the spot but Divyanshu Bhudhiraja and Hardik Nain managed to reach the CM and were seen arguing with him.
 
 The CM talked to them for about 10 minutes and was seen cautioning them not to raise their hands while talking to him. As the CM came out of the hall, the NSUI activists approached him but were stopped by the personal security guards of the CM.
 
 When the CM was told that they were the activists of NSUI then the minister asked his officials to bring them to talk. In his interaction, the CM told Bhardwaj that they could have always come to his residence if they needed to talk as he had never stopped anyone to approach him.
 
 Bhardwaj, on the other hand, said that he just needed one minute of CM’s time to understand what the Khattar government was doing for the unemployed youths of its state; and where was he when   was burning?
 
 Bhardwaj, however, said that the CM did not answer any of his questions and kept on preaching moral responsibilities.
