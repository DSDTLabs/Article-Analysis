THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: "I am not retreating but crouching to pounce," said   to the applauding   to see him at the   ground at Attakulangara. 

 The writer who ignited a controversy by posting on his Facebook "Perumal Murugan, the writer is dead. As he is no God, he is not going to resurrect himself" in protest against the threat levelled by fanatics against his work in 2015, was speaking on the topic 'Writing and Resistence' at an event organised by   on Saturday. The Tamil writer who is an introvert and prefers solitude by his own admission said that he was overwhelmed by the support he received from Kerala during the controversy regarding his   (One part woman). "I myself am tagged with the identity of being a Hindu. So, I believe that I have the right to use the names of the Gods of the religion," he said. 
 
 Speaking about the controversy when fanatics bayed for his blood alleging that he hurt their religious sentiments, Murugan termed that as "a dark phase of his life which he could not forget even if he wants to. I come from a family of agriculturalists and though I myself am a teacher I have the love for peace and solitude engraved in me. So, all the controversy and ensuing publicity was an anathema to me and I tried to hide from all the attention," Murugan said. "I am being invited here as I protested against intolerance. I have never wished to be popular. I love my privacy," he said. 
 
 Murugan also said how hard he tried to deny invitations from various quarters in Kerala to attend public functions post-Mathorubhagan controversy. "On an average, I got three calls every day. But, I turned down every invitation thinking about my family. My friends also exerted pressure on me to accept some of those invites,"he recalled.
