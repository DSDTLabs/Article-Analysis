CHANDIGARH: Thieves stole Rs 5 lakh and   worth Rs 80 lakh from the house of a businessman in Sector 42 on Tuesday.

 In his complaint to the Sector 36 police station, Rajinder Gupta, the house owner, said the jewellery and cash were kept in two lockers on the ground and first floor. The   came to light on Tuesday morning, when Gupta checked the lockers. He inquired from other family members and informed the police.
 
 Police said Gupta, who owns a hardware shop in Mohali, suspects the cash was stolen in small amounts in the last few days and the jewellery in one go.
 
 Cops from Sector 36 police station, including Harjit Kaur, DSP (south division), and Jaswinder Singh, DSP (operations cell), and a crime branch team reached the spot. Harjit Kaur said there were no signs of forced entry as the locks were intact. The lockers were also not broken. Police suspect it could be an insider’s job.
 
 “Prima facie it looks like an insider’s job. It seems like the thief is someone who stays in the house,” said a cop.
 
 Gupta lives with his wife, son and daughter-in-law. Three helpers, including two women, who work in the house during the daytime, are being questioned, said a police officer. One of them said Gupta’s son had got married in December 2016 but he did not have cordial relations with his wife. Gupta’s daughter-in-law had gone to her parent’s home in Karnal in March and returned on April 8.
 
 A forensic team collected finger prints and other evidence. Police have registered a theft case against unknown persons and started investigations.
