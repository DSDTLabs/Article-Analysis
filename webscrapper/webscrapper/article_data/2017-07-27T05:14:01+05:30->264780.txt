BHOPAL: Already facing a shortage of specialists and scaling down number of operations, the   Memorial Hospital and Research Centre ( ) is starring at shutting down four main departments. 

 At least four doctors from BMHRC are likely to join   Bhopal.
 
 Sources said that patient services in cardiology, cardiothoracic and vascular surgery (CTVS), radio-diagnostics and onco-surgery departments at BMHRC could be adversely affected.
 
 The specialists have been demanding implementation of recruitment rules (RR), that would pave the way for their absorption as full-fledged   government employees. The demand for RR has been pending with Union government for six years and has led to many confrontations with department of health research (DHR) which administrators BMHRC.
 
 Earlier in March, DHR appointed RR rules committee held deliberations at BMHRC and submitted its report. Sources said that RR rules of CGHS service has been ruled out. An RR for BMHRC faculty and doctors would introduce training and teaching facilities was envisaged. Now, the super-specialty hospital runs BSc nursing and general nursing that are starring at a complete shutdown. Admission to BSc nursing through AIIMS was annulled, last year.
 
 “We have been let down by DHR and BMHRC administration which has failed to retain talent in the hospital. If these policies continue, gas victims’ patient services would be impacted,” said a doctor. Dozens of specialists have quit the superspeciality hospital in the last six years. 
 
 When contacted DHR secretary Dr Soumya Swaminathan did not respond. BMHRC public relations officials were unreachable.
 
 More than 5 lakh victims of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy are totally dependent on free medical care from the 350-bed hospital. 
 
 BMHRC also has eight out-reach units. It has a budget of about Rs 140 crore per year.
