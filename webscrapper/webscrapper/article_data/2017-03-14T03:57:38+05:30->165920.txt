NAVI MUMBAI: After demolishing around 15   in   on Saturday,   chief Sudhakar Shinde has made it clear that he will be initiating action against such kilns which produce hazardous gases. The latest civic action against illegal kiln operators was taken after complaints from residents’ groups in sectors 34, 35, 30, 10 and 8.

 The kiln operators were served notices but paid no heed to them, prompting the civic body to take action. The PCMC team was armed with poclains and fire tenders to douse smoke and demolish the kilns.
 
 “We had given notices on the kiln operators but they did not comply, forcing us to demolish them,” said Shinde.
 
 He has appealed to the citizens to immediately inform the civic authorities and fire department about any fire or smoke from such kilns in the neighbourhood, so that prompt action can be taken. PCMC will now be cracking the whip on such activities in Kamothe and adjoining areas soon.
 
 Shinde told TOI, “There are no authorized   in the PCMC area and stringent action will be initiated against the illegal ones. If citizens come across any fire or smoke they should report it to the nearest fire stations and we will extinguish the fire and take action against the kiln operators.”
 
 Residents of Kamothe, Kopra, Taloja, Kalamboli and Panvel are feeling the pinch of rampant pollution due to the thick smoke from kilns.
 
 “Toxic gases from brick kilns are creating health hazards,” said Kamothe resident Sairaj Kumar.
