CHANDIGARH: The Punjab cabinet sub-committee on Friday finalized the draft policy for regularization of unauthorized colonies developed till April 1. The committee in principle decided that after 2018, no unauthorized colony in the state will be regularized. 

 The sub-committee, led by health and family welfare minister Brahm  , includes local government minister  , finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, rural development and panchayat minister   and technical education minister  . The draft policy will now be put up before the Punjab cabinet for final approval.
 
 On the policy, Mohindra said, “It will be open for 12 months from the date of its notification. The colonizers who could not apply under previous policies could apply under it. Regularization charges paid under previous policies, if any, will be adjusted under it.”
 
 The amount received from the regularization of a colony would go towards providing basic infrastructure there. The charges could be paid in instalments within a year. To regularize colonies within as well as outside the municipal limits, committees of officers would be constituted. Each committee will scrutinise cases within three months, the minister added.
 
 Mohindra said residents would form residents’ welfare associations (RWA) for each unauthorised colony. “These RWAs can also submit application for regularisation. Stringent action will be taken against the colonisers whose unauthorised colonies come up after April 1, 2018,” he added.
