Indore: Industries of the region have expressed disagreement against the MP Power Management Company’s proposal to hike power tariff by about 4 per cent in fiscal year 2018-19. Industrialists of Pithampur, state’s largest industrial belt, have objected to the price rise that would if approved will be third hike in a row.  According to Pithampur Audhyogik Sangathan, industries are getting electricity at a rate of about Rs 7–Rs 7.5 per unit.  The sangathan president Gautam Kothari said, “Industries are already suffering due to GST and poor global market. Hike in electricity charges will overall affect the efficiency of the company hitting its competitiveness in the local as well as global market.” The MP Power Management Company raised the power tariff by 10 per cent both in FY 2016-17 and FY 2017-2018.  Kothari said, “Power rates are already steep and at this point if they are increased further how will industries survive?” There are about 1,500 industries registered with AKVN in Pithampur industrial belt. Besides this, there are small industrial belts at Sanwer road, Pologround and Palda.  Participants said that despite being a power surplus state, power tariff in MP is very high as compared to other neighbouring states. Arvind Bandi, owner of a paper converter factory said, “We are a surplus electricity producing state despite that power rates are being hiked every year. Government should support the local industries by cutting down the rates.” Industrialists said when the state can supply surplus electricity to Delhi Metro at Rs 2.97 per unit then why not support local industries that give them crores of revenue. Western Region Power Distribution Company managing director Akash Tripathi said, “The power company has proposed the rise to fill the losses made by east, central and west discoms. It will be very reasonable unlike last year’s steep hike.”
