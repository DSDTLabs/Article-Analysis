BHOPAL:   Anandiben Patel joined the ‘pakoda chorus’ on Saturday, saying that one can build a career by frying fritters. 

 At a function organized by   in Harrai of Chhindwara town, she said it is wrong to stage protests in the name of ‘pakoda’, since “making pakoda is a skill”. “If someone doesn’t cook good pakoda, then who will eat at his outlet? A good pakoda seller can open a restaurant in two years and can even own a hotel in 6-7 years,” she said. 
 
 PM Narendra Modi’s what’s-wrong-with-selling-pakodas remark has triggered a political slugfest across the country. In MP, the Youth Congress has held pakoda protests in 90 towns and cities, including Sehore, Rewa, Panna, Chhattarpur, Indore and Bhopal. BJP has countered with its own pakodas.
