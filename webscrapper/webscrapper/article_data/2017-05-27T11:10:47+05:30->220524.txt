PUNE: The economic offences wing of the Pune police would seek help of the   for tracing suspected transfer of funds to the US by Mumbai-based businessman  , arrested for allegedly cheating at least 4,000 people promising them bungalow plots or handsome returns on investments. 

 "We suspect Sajnani has transferred substantial funds to his son in the US," senior inspector   of the economic offences wing (EOW) said on Friday. "We shall seek help of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on this matter," he said, adding that Sajnani could have made huge investments in Karnataka and Kerala and the possibility of he committing similar offences there was not being ruled out.
 
 Investigations revealed the 440-acre land at Pingori village in Purandar taluka, used for allegedly cheating people, was a part of the green zone. "The conversion of plots to non-agriculture use and construction there is never possible," Puranik said.
 
 Sajnani was arrested on Wednesday by the EOW from Mumbai for duping at least 4,000 people. He had floated a company,  , with four others. They advertised a project of non-agricultural 1,000sqft bungalow plots at Pingori for initial investment of Rs 1 lakh-Rs 3 lakh. 
 
 If investors were not interested in the plots, the company assured returns of 20-25% per annum on investments.
 
 Sajnani, in the custody of EOW till May 30, was taken to Pingori on Friday. "He had purchased the land in 2010. The plots he had shown on his website are on the top of hillock," Puranik said.
 
 Investigations revealed Sajnani had sold the same land to 11 other people, including three medical practitioners. "When the investors learnt they were duped, they forced Sajanani to make the sale deed on the land on their names," he said, appealing to the people duped by the suspect and his accomplices to approach the police.
