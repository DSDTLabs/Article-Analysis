CHENNAI: The last few days have been quite tough for   following his wife Hasin Jahan’s allegations. However, with the   clearing him of corruption charges and offering him a contract, a “relieved” Shami is now focussed on getting himself back on the field ahead of the upcoming IPL.

  
 
 
 
 Having endured “mental torture” over the last 15 days, Shami, who is set to represent   in IPL, has turned to the   (ACA), run by Bengal batsman  's father, in Dehradun to rejuvenate himself mentally and physically.
 
 ACA head coach Manoj Rawat said Shami wanted to train in the academy for two days as he felt it was a “calm place” for him to get back into playing mode. “He trained for more than an hour Friday and is expected to leave for Delhi on Sunday after another session,” Rawat said.
