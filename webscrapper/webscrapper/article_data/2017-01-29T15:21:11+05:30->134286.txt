MANGALURU: Indian knowledge traditions had answers for problems that human beings faced and the ancestors followed it. However with advent of chemical technology, humans are moving towards destroying nature, noted E Vadivel, chairman of Agri Systems, Coimbatore and former dean (horticulture), Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. It is therefore imperative for society to take a relook at solutions that it is accepting as cure for the various ills, he noted.

 Making a presentation on Indian cow breeds based agriculture, organic farming, enhanced yield and role of panchagavya in improving quality on second day of three-day   organized under the aegis of Sri Ramachandrapura Math, Vadivel said it has been scientifically proven that use of panchagavya increases crop yield. Panchagavya is made of cow urine (gou mutra), cow dung, milk, curds and ghee and has yield enhancing properties.
 
 Rev Fr Antony Lobo, parish priest, Gurupur Church said, “We are Indians. There is no distinction in the milk that cows give. And no person who has reared a cow can ever become poor. Cattles have since time immemorial been beneficial to both mankind and to the nature. Let the message that one should love cattle and calves go out strong from the event.” Fr Lobo also demanded that the event should send a message against cow-slaughter to the authorities concerned.
