CHANDIGARH: A district court sentenced three youth to seven years of imprisonment here on Tuesday for stabbing a Burail villager and snatching his mobile phone. Convicts Lucky,   and Ankit will also have to pay a fine of Rs 3,000 each. 

 The case against them was registered at the Sector 34 police station last year on the complaint of vegetable vendor Amit. In May last year, Amit was walking in a park near his house when the convicts accosted him and tried to snatch his mobile phone. When he resisted, they attacked him with a knife and took away the handset.
 
 Police reached the spot upon information and moved Amit to the Sector-32   (GMCH). The three were, later, arrested. The defence counsel argued that the three men had been implicated, since no motive could be proved behind the crime. He claimed it was a false case, with no connection to the park incident, and so the three men should be acquitted. After the arguments finished, the court held all three men guilty and awarded them seven years of imprisonment.
