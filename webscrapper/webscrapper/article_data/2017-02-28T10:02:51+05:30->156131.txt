KOCHI: Even while private telecom companies are digging roads in the city for laying optical fibre cables, the   officials allege that the police are least bothered to act in such matters.
Last month, mayor   had given a complaint to the police seeking action against Airtel which allegedly dug up the road causing damages to the road. As the city police failed to take action even after a week, the mayor forwarded the plaint to DGP . Though the police registered a case, the police have not investigated the matter. “We have registered a complaint in this regard,“ said M P Dinesh, city police commissioner.
 
 Last week, labourers dug up   near   for laying cables of private telecom company. Though corporation works standing committee member and councillor from the area, Harris P M informed the crime to the police, they didn't take any action. “While conducting inspection by engineers from corporation at the site on February 24 in my presence, it was found that the cable belonged to Airtel,“ he said.
 
 Meanwhile, opposition parties staged a protest in front of the corporation office on Monday. According to the opposition, the ruling front has failed to implement the plan fund projects. The delay may lead to the corporation losing crore of rupees.
