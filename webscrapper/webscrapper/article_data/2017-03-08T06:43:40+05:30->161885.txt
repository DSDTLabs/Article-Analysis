JAIPUR: Taking safety measures, the forest department even on Tuesday kept the entry to   closed for morning walkers. 

 The forest department teams remained on toes to track the female   and its cub which have taken shelter in the park. As teams were camping in   to track the movement of leopards, the park was closed for the visitors. Many residents who came for morning walk returned disappointed. 
 
 A senior forest official said, “The teams want the leopards to move back to their habitat in Jhalana Forest on their own and tranquillizing them was the last option.” 
 
 Late on Sunday night, the leopard and its cub had strayed into the city from Jhalana forests near Smriti Van.
 
 The feline was for a while separated from her cub and roamed across JLN Marg, giving a nasty surprise to late night commuters. The two were soon reunited and headed back to the forest area after finding themselves in the midst of human commotion.
 
 According to reports, the mother leopard crossed the   thrice in search of the cub.
 
 Forest officials, however, stuck around the spot as they knew the leopard had two cubs. Officials thought the big cat would come searching for her other cub and closed the Smriti Van.
 
 It was later found that the mother leopard had strayed into the city with just one cub. “The territory of this leopard is close to Smriti Van and JLN Marg. The mother came onto the road in search of her cub a day before. As they have not returned to the forest the park was closed even on Tuesday,” added an official.
