Visakhapatnam: The century-old district   building is undergoing a facelift in an attempt by the government to draw tourists to the colonial-era structure.

 Two lifts were recently inaugurated by chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu at the collectorate in order to facilitate senior citizens and differently-abled visitors. The lifts have been given a vintage look in keeping with the overall ambience of the heritage structure.
 
 To provide amenities to the general public, provision for purified drinking water and bio-toilets have been made. As a safety measure, video surveillance system for the entire collectorate building and 24 hours of private security have been added. The collector office will also have the facility of WIFI through AP Fiber Net.
 
 In addition to the facilities, initiatives are being taken to attract tourists to the heritage site because of its historical significance in the city. The entire collector’s building would be illuminated with different colour of lightings. Also, inscriptions which will give an insight into the history of the building to the tourists will be placed in suitable places. A park which has been developed recently inside the premises will be open for the visitors to relax. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, District Collector Pravin Kumar, said, “An amount of Rs 70 lakhs was sanctioned under the Scheme for Implementation of Persons with Disabilities Act (SIPDA) by the Central Government for the lifts around 8 months ago. The estimated expenditure for the other facilities that have been added is around Rs 3 crores.”
 
 He also added, “There is a proposal to construct a new meeting hall behind the existing building with exclusive entrance from the ZP road. The other portions of the building will also be renovated and construction of command communication centre has also been planned. ”
