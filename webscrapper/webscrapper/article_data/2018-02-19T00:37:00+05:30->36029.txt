Tirupur: As many as 55 people - 50 bull tamers and five spectators - were injured and one bull died in the first jallikattu event held in the district at Alagumalai near Palladam. The event which saw participation of 505 bulls and 550 tamers was witnessed by 50,000 people. 

 On hot Sunday, the galleries were overflowing with crowd which seemed to enjoy each and every moment of the event. Occasionally, collector K S Palanisamy has to nudge some lazy tamers to take part in action. Otherwise, there was no lack of exciting moments and showcase of skills by tamers and bulls.
 
 The top performer among tamers was Vignesh from Usilampatti in Madurai, who tamed 10 bulls despite sustaining minor injuries on his head. The next best performance was shared by Bharath Kumar and Rajasekar, who too were native of Madurai, for taming eight bulls each. Senthil of Kethampatti in Dindigul district came third by taming six bulls. 
 
 The top performers were given two-wheelers apart from prizes including chair, silver utensils, home appliances, electric pump and gold coins. Adding flavour to the event, some extravagant political leaders were seen announcing cash prizes to bulls’ owners and tamers. 
 
 The district administration and the police department have ensured that the event, held between 8am and 4pm, was organised as per the guidelines of the Supreme Court. Since the valour sport was new here, the organisers took technical support from a team led by Tamil Nadu jallikattu peravai president P Rajasekaran. The tamers were fielded in batches to give chances to all of them and each batch wore different-coloured jersey.
 
 But to put a dampener on the event, a bull died after it fell in a nearby canal. “At the end of the bull’s run, the owner, Karuppasamy of Pudukottai, chased the bull to stop it. Unfortunately, the bull fell into nearby canal and died,” said a police officer.
