The Greek God of Bollywood,   seems all geared up for the New Year in the first month itself! Kickstarting January with four magazine covers and an upcoming movie, ‘Kaabil’ releasing at end of the month—Mr. Roshan is setting the bar high. On his birthday today, we’d like to wish him a very Happy Birthday and take a moment to appreciate the drool-worthy cover boy of 2017: 
 
 
  
  
 Charming as ever, Hrithik graces the latest cover of Filmfare India.
 
 
  
  
 
 Hrithik makes this cover look just like a classic Grecian portrait!
 
 
  
  
 
 We love the unbuttoned shirt on him!
 
 
  
  
 
 Shirtless Hrithik! Need we say more?
