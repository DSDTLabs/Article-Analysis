GREATER NOIDA: A 55-year-old-man attacked his   with a spade on Saturday morning after he had a fall-out with the woman he had been staying with illicitly for over a decade in  's Knowledge Park area.

 Kallu Yadav (55) had been staying with the 40-year-old victim for the past 10 years despite the fact she was married to his younger brother Nempal.
 
 According to police, Kallu and the woman had a bitter argument on Friday night. “The two had an argument. In a fit of rage, he went out and planned to kill the woman,” said a police officer from Knowledge Park police station.
 
 Kallu went to   village from where he bought a spade and some namkeen after which he arrived at the shanty.
 
 “He gave the namkeen to the children and sent them outside. While in the room, he attacked the woman with the spade on her head and hand,” said the officer.
 
 “The victim was admitted to Kasna medical college by neighbours,” SHO, Knowledge Park, Prabhat Dixit told TOI.
 
 She was referred to Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital where she remains serious but is out of danger, he said.
 
 The woman was staying with her two kids in a shanty in the under-construction site of the Jaypee Aman society in Sector 151 which Kallu used to frequent. She has two children –a daughter aged seven and a son aged 10.
 
 Kallu had also taken a room on rent in Tughalpur village and used to shuttle between the shanty and the room.
 
 Sources said that since the woman married Nempal- a boss-eyed man, she had been staying with her brother-in-law who had left his legal wife with whom he has a son.
 
 “Kallu's legal wife is not very good-looking and he had left the woman soon after his younger brother married the victim," sources said.
 
 “Kallu’s legal wife, his teenaged son, Nempal and the rest of the family stays in Noida’s Sadarpur area,” Dixit said.
 
 Police arrested Kallu from near the ATS roundabout at 11.45 am on Sunday.
