CHANDIGARH: The   division is busy with the preparation plan for upgrading the signalling system at the   which will be part of a double-lane project between Dappar-Chandigarh. 

 According to sources, there are two options for the execution of the double lane project- traffic will be shut for the area and trains will be partially cancelled. The division has decided that the trains will be partially cancelled during the period of the project.
 
 Currently, the division has an auto signal system for train movement, but during the implementation of the double lane, the traffic will be managed manually by the staff. Sources said that there would be a manual managing of railway traffic when the electronic panel through which the traffic was managed would be dismantled to install the new system. The affected area will be Chandigarh and Ghaggar during this process.
 
 After the double lane is ready for final inspection, the division will seek time from the   (CRS) so that the stretch is open for the traffic.  , divisional railway manager, Ambala division, said that for the interlocking of the double lane, the authorities are chalking out a plan for partial diversion and cancellation of the trains. He said itâ€™s a lengthy process in which arrangements for signalling and tracks during the final completion of the double lane will have to be made. He said the trial run of the train will be held in March. 
 
 In March this year, the railway authorities conducted a trial run by running a locomotive on the tracks and the new bridge on the Ghaggar River. The double laning of the 22-km distance between Dappar and Ambala cantonment railway station has already been completed, whereas construction of the 23km- stretch between Chandigarh and Dappar is under progress.
