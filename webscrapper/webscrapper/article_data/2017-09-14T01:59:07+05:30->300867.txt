FATEHGARH SAHIB: The   led by its chairman, Kuljit Singh Nagra on Wednesday took stock of the alleged misappropriation of public funds in the construction of the Modern Cattle Fair Ground at village Nabipur situated at GT Road. The cattle fair ground had been constructed at a cost of Rs.7.50 crore.
 
 The committee comprising of legislators Harpartap Singh Ajnala, Nirmal Singh, Satkar Kaur, MLA, Sangat Singh Gilzian, Amarjit Singh Sandoya, held the meeting with Director, Panchayati Raj, C. Sibun, at the local Bachat Bhawan after which they also visited the Modern Cattle Fair Ground and inspected the construction work. 
  
 The committee found serious lapses in the construction of the Modern Cattle Fair Ground. It was noticed that potholes inundated with water had appeared all over the ground despite the fact that a sum of Rs. 19.88 Lakh was spent on raising the level of the Ground in 2016. The mangers for cattle were also found in dilapidated condition even before making it operational. Besides, unsanitary conditions were found on the ground. The committee asked the Director, Panchayati Raj to fix the responsibility of the concerned officials and the contractor and to take stern action against them for the irregularities that were spotted at the ground. Nagra said that it was beyond any doubt that the public funds were not put to proper use at the ground.
  
 Besides, the committee also issued directions to ensure holding of regular cattle fairs here from October 2 here to make it convenient for the livestock keepers of the   and the adjoining districts to buy and sell cattle. ADC ( Development) Hardyal Singh Chatha was also asked to ensure proper sanitation of the ground.
