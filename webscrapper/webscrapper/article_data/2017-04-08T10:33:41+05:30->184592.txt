PANAJI: Legendary batsman Sir   came down heavily on Australian cricketers, saying they could be "very, very rude." "I have no regrets saying the Aussies can be very, very rude. There are times when they overstep their boundaries. One of the things, with the introduction of the   ( ), a lot of these guys are coming to this part of the world to earn a living. If there is one advice I will give to these guys, 'never try and curse the hand that helps to feed you'," said Richards.

 Richards spoke favourably about, not surprisingly,  , particularly after the India captain gave the Australians as good as he got during the fiercely-contested Test series which concluded last month. Richards himself has never been fond of the Aussies. One of the most destructive batsman of all time was taking part in the Leadership Summit at the Goafest 2017, at a place that reminded him of his home in Antigua, particularly the "coconut trees", as he put it. For little more than an hour, he captivated the audience with his bold admissions and honest opinion, and when it was all over, he stepped out to a standing ovation from the capacity crowd.
 
 Calling cricket a "soft sport", Richards said, "To be fair, I've always felt I was a lot privileged. (Other sports) like Formula One and 500-CC motorbike sports, they do daredevil stuff. Cricket is soft stuff. Very soft. There are much more dangerous activities in the world today than cricket. "
