LUDHIANA: Senior leaders of Aam Aadmi Party ( ) and Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) will hold a meeting on Monday evening to discuss distribution of seats for upcoming MC elections. Party leaders said they are likely to take a concrete decision during this meeting. Two meetings of local leaders were held recently but they could not take a decision on all the 95 seats. 

 The meeting will be convened by opposition leader Sukhpal Khaira of AAP, co-president Aman Arora and both LIP MLAs Simarjit Bains and Balwinder Bains. LIP MLA Simarjit Bains refused to divulge details but said they might take a decision on Monday. Recently, there was a dispute between local leaders of AAP and LIP over distribution of seats when AAP district president   accused LIP MLA Simarjit Bains of announcing candidates without both parties taking a decision on seat sharing. When the matter reached state leaders of AAP, they formed a 13-member   to end the dispute. 
 
 Committee members included Daljit Grewal, Ahbab Grewal, Darshan Singh Shankar, Suresh Goyal, Rajinder Pal Kaur and Kultar Singh Sandhwa from AAP and Parminder Singh Soma,   Cheema,   Sivia, Baldev Singh Pardhan, Vipan Sood Kaka and Jaswinder Singh Khalsa. Meanwhile, AAP MLA from Jagraon, Sarabjit Kaur Manuke was also included in the committee as convener. The committee has held two meetings but there is a tussle for a few seats. Therefore, state-level leaders will conduct a final meeting.
