 of   fame is exploring new avenues. She recently auditioned for   Rising in Pune. All of 18, she was the youngest contestant on the show, but she exuded oodles of confidence as she performed in front of gang leaders  ,  , Rannvijay Singha, Karan Kundra and Prince Narula.

 Samyuktha, who claims to know 12 dance forms, was challenged by Neha to perform four of them. While she grooved to Gilheriyaan and belly danced to Pinga, she shone in a duet with Prince Narula. By the end of the audition, all the judges wanted Samyuktha on their gang. Neha, who was in awe of the actress, said, “It’s amazing how good you are. You are beautiful when you dance and your movements are so crisp and correct.”
 
 Speaking about the audition, Samyuktha says, “I met Raghu two weeks before the auditions, and he urged me to go for it since I am passionate about it. It has been my dream to be on this show since I was eight years old. Now that I am 18 and legally allowed to be on it, I decided to give it a try. I didn’t have any hopes of doing well in the auditions, but I knew that my personality and a strong mind will see me through. My only motto on the show will be to not abuse anybody and not let anybody abuse me.” Will the show impact her movie career? “This show isn’t a medium for me to get anywhere. I will be where I am destined to be because of my hard work. But I realize this show is risky, because one wrong move on national TV can ruin your career. So, I have decided to be myself, and not lose my cool.” — Stuti.Agarwal@timesgroup.com
