NEW DELHI: Punjab chief minister and   stalwart   Amarinder Singh would be the party’s star campaigner in the   Garden assembly by-election and the forthcoming municipal elections. 

 This was announced on Thursday by Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee chief Ajay Maken. DPCC would accord a public reception to the Punjab CM in west Delhi on March 30. “This will be the first public reception for him in Delhi after he led the Congress to a thumping victory in Punjab,” a party statement read. 
 
 Delhi Congress would also launch its election campaign, ‘Dilli ke baat, dil ke saath’ through Facebook lives on March 25, followed by a panel discussion headed by former Union minister Jairam Ramesh at India Habitat Centre on March 26 on solid waste management and sanitation. A ‘Chaat pe Charcha’ meet would also be held at Bharat Nagar on March 27. 
 
 Congress is fielding sitting councillor from Khyala municipal ward, Meenakshi Chandela, for the Rajouri Garden assembly seat. Chandela is a two-time councillor and so is her husband Meghraj Chandela.
 
 This bypoll on April 9 is being seen as a critical one, as whichever party wins it would feel more confident for the municipal polls. The Rajouri Garden seat fell vacant after AAP MLA Jarnail Singh resigned to contest the Punjab elections.
