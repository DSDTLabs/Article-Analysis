GORAKHPUR: Lashing out at the chief minister for his slogan of 'Kaam Bolta Hai,'   national general secretary   said it was the high crime rate in the state that spoke volumes about the current government. Addressing a public meet at Bhathat Bazar in Pipraich on Tuesday, Siddiqui said, "Gunda raj (rule of hooligans) is the speciality of the SP government. The Bundelkhand rape cannot be forgotten where a woman and her daughter were gang raped. SP's slogan is 'free hold plot is ours'." 

 Taking a jibe at the SP-Congress alliance, he said, "If work speaks for itself, what was the reason behind the alliance with the  ? Before 2012, Akhilesh was neither a CM nor he had he any development work to his credit so no alliance was needed. Now, when he has completed five years in office, he needed an alliance? That shows his work is not speaking." 
 
 Siddiqui criticized Modi over his expensive clothes. "Modi says he used to sell tea but now he wears clothes worth lakhs. Can someone tell me where the money came from?" 
 
 "Good days have come only on television and radio on which   spent a lot of money. In eight states, the BJP has government but no farmer's loan was waived and no unemployed people got bread and butter there," he said.
