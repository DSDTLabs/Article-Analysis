PILIBHIT: A 17-year-old boy, who was kidnapped on August 4 last year, was found by police in girl's attire and make-up at a circus in   on Thursday. According to police, the boy -   of   village - was kidnapped on August 4 by two people who allegedly wanted to sell him to transgender community. An FIR in this connection was lodged at   police station under section 363 (kidnapping by enticement) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). 

 Police have, meanwhile, sent the boy for a medical examination to ascertain if he was castrated. Further action would be taken in accordance with the medical report, said police. Divulging details, Puranpur police station SHO   said he received information that the boy was working with a circus company in Bareilly, where he used to play woman's character. SHO said he somehow managed to bring back the boy to Puranpur on Thursday.
 
 The boy told police that he had willingly gone to Bareilly, along with members of transgender community, because he was fond of disguising himself as a girl, said SHO. 
 
 "Although the boy confirmed that he was not subjected to any physical change, we have sent him for a medical examination to ascertain whether he was emasculated medically," Singh said.
 
 If the boy was found to be a minor, he would be sent to a shelter home as he was reluctant to live with his family, said the SHO. In case, he is an adult, he will be left to decide his own course. "We will produce him before a judicial magistrate for the recording his statement," said SHO.
 
 Even though the boy disappeared last year on August 4, an FIR in the kidnapping matter was lodged at the Puranpur Kotwali police station only after the order of Pilibhit's chief judicial magistrate on November 4. In the FIR, Nasir Ahmad - the father of the boy - accused   and Raju of kidnapping his son for selling him to the transgender community.
