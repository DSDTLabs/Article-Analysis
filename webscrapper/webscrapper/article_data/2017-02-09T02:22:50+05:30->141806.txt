NEW DELHI: Police have rounded up some local criminals for questioning in connection with the theft of the Nobel replica from social activist Kailash Satyarthi’s Kalkaji house on Tuesday. 

 Cops said they found suspicious movements in the   footage received from Aravalli Apartments and trying to identify those people. The security guard posted at the apartment’s gate too is being questioned in this regard.
 
 Probe revealed that at least a dozen burglars had targeted three houses in the apartment complex almost simultaneously between 1.30am and 2am on Tuesday. They had locked the gates of other houses and took advantage of a wedding party nearby to break open the gates. The CCTV footage collected from the area revealed the movement of four men. The footage from five cameras facing the three entrance gates to the housing complex were being examined.
 
 There are three-four theories that the police are working on. It seems that one of the accused was a regular to the area, so he covered his face to hide his identity. There is also a possibility that he might have just covered his face as a precautionary measure to avoid detection. Cops suspect that the burglars might have scaled the fencing near the gate number 2 as the spot remains dark past midnight. 
 
 After breaking into a ground-floor apartment, belonging to a businessman named Arnab Mukherjee, the burglars entered the first-floor flat of one Sameer Tiwari. Police commissioner Amulya Patnaik is personally monitoring the investigation on hourly basis. Police are trying to trace the entry and exit routes of the accused in order to establish their exact motive and modus operandi. They are also working on the “insider theory” that someone who works in the apartment complex could have leaked information about the houses.
