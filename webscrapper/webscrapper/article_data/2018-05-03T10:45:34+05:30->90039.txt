CHANDIGARH: Noted lyricist and Hindi poet   on Wednesday appreciated   government's decision to regulate the content of Punjabi songs. He said the audience is not getting to hear the music of their choice and the musical hits are being forced upon the public. 

 Kamil was talking on the sidelines of 'Rukhsat' - a farewell organised by the department of Hindi at the B L   in   on Wednesday.
 
 When asked why the lyrics written for Punjabi songs in Bollywood were so different, he said, "You are the reason behind making Guru Randhawa's Lahore a success. Don't question me. Question yourself as to why you made it such a hit?"
 
 Moreover, he said the language departments at the Indian universities are suppressing the upcoming generation of authors. Speaking of the current poetry scenario, Kamil said the youth cannot be attracted by the use of heavy vocabulary in poetry. He said "I established The Ink Band - India's first poetry club. I succeeded in making a connection with the youth by using simple yet beautiful words."
 
 Kamil explained the difference in approach while writing lyrics for films. "You write for the character in the film. You don't write for yourself.   wrote   in Sultan, I didn't. Also, in films, the complete literary work is not used," he said.
 
 He also shared his personal experience of the song he wrote for the movie Newton.
 
 When questioned about the poetry suitable for the age group 3-10 years, Kamil elaborated about his involvement in the Chakmak children magazine printed in Bhopal. He regularly interacts with the poets aged between 9 and 12 and answers their open-minded questions.
 
 Kamil also talked about his upcoming book 'Kaali aurat (Filmfare) ka khwaab', which is slated for release next month.
