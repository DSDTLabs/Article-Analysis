A total penalty of more than Rs 11.25 lakh has been imposed on them, including the office-bearers, according to a CCI order.

 The CCI gave the order on the basis of a complaint by director   who alleged that these organizations forced actors, technicians, producers and financiers not to associate with his films.
 
 The CCI has also slapped fine on actor and sitting Lok Sabha MP  , who is the president of AMMA, actor Edavela Babu, directors Sibiy Malayil and   and production controller K Mohanan who are office bearers of these organizations.
 
 As per the order, AMMA, FEFKA, FEFKA director’s union and FEFKA production executive’s union should pay a penalty of Rs 4,00,065; Rs 85,594 ; Rs 3,86,354 and Rs 56,661 respectively. Moreover, these organizations and their leaders should cease and desist from indulging in anti-competitive conduct.

 Filmmaker Vinayan said that the CCI order justified the stand taken by him. “They turned against me because I challenged their unhealthy practices. I have been fighting a lone battle for the past eight years. This order will be helpful for the next generation in Mollywood,” Vinayan said. “The leaders of these organizations should now rethink on imposing such bans,” he added.
