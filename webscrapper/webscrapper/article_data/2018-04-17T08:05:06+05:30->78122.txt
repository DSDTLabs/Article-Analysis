JAIPUR: The   (JMC) has softened its stand against   (RR) and decided to provide fire 'no objection certificate' (NOC) for all the six upcoming IPL matches to be held at Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Stadium. 

 This year, the organisers had planned to host seven matches at   after a gap of four years. However, due to JMC's ongoing dispute with RR and Rajasthan Cricket Academy (RCA) over revenue, a conditional   was issued for the first match.
 
 According to sources, the issue was settled following state government intervention after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) threatened to cancel all the matches in the city. "At a recent meeting held with chief secretary Nihal Chand Goel and mayor Ashok Lahoti, it was decided that the JMC will provide 100 firemen during the matches, paid for by RR. The money has not been deposited till date. However, the JMC has decided to issue an NoC for further matches," said a source.
 
 In the same meeting, it was also decided that the organisers would deposit the actual cost for maintaining sanitation and cleaning sewerage and drains during matches. Sources in the JMC further said, "The actual cost has not been deposited by the organisers till date. However, we are hoping that they would deposit the money before other matches."
