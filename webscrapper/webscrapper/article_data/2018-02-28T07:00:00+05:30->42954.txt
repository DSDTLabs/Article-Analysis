GHAZIABAD: A resident of Mahagun Puram housing society in Mehrauli has lodged a   complaint against the developer, the maintenance service provider and members of the apartment owners’ association after a fire damaged a major portion of his   last week.

 Dinesh Kumar alleged that the private company responsible for maintenance, CSK Private Limited, had installed faulty water sprinklers and fire alarm system and accused the apartment association members of siding with him. Kumar also claimed that the private company owner had been issuing threats to withdraw the complaint.
 
 Despite repeated attempts, CSK officials could not be contacted. 
 
 The president of the apartment owners’ association, IC Jindal, said they had no role in the incident and that the private agency providing maintenance should be held accountable.
 
 A major portion of Kumar’s ninth-floor flat was burnt on February 19 when he had gone out with his family to a relative’s place to attend a birthday party. Kumar, a businessman, claimed that despite paying a monthly maintenance fee of Rs 3,000, the private agency had installed faulty fire-fighting equipment, which caused him a loss of Rs 10 lakh.
 
 The FIR was lodged at Kavi Nagar police station under sections 288 (negligent conduct with respect to pulling down or repairing buildings), 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 427 (mischief causing damage) of the IPC. SHO Samarjeet Singh said they were investigating the matter.
 
 Kumar claimed that the accused had been issuing threats to withdraw the police complaint. 
 
 He has also written to the chief minister’s office, saying the accused should be held responsible if anything happens to him or his family.
 
 “The members of the apartment association and the private firm are now threatening me to get the FIR quashed. Besides the CM office, I have also submitted a fresh complaint to the local police,” said Kumar.
