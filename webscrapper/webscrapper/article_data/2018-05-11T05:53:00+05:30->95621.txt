NAGPUR: Sushil Chandra, Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS), Central Circle, Mumbai, on Thursday started the inquiry into the Howrah-Mumbai Mail engine fire tragedy, in which assistant loco pilot (ALP) SK Vishwakarma from Ajni Railway Colony had died.

 The incident, which occurred on May 6 between Talni and Dhamangaon section, 90km from here under Nagpur Division of Central Railway, created furore across the Indian Railways, and Government of India set up a statutory public inquiry.
 
 Chandra reached the city on Thursday and visited Ajni Loco Shed, where the stricken loco from Santragachhi has been kept. He was there from 8am to 10.30am.
 
 Sources said the CRS later headed to Wardha, and visited Talni to inspect the spot where the tragedy took place. Chandra returned to Wardha station and recorded statements of at least 30-35 staffers, some of them from Santragachhi under South Eastern Railway (SER), where the loco is based. Chandra was there at Wardha for over three hours.
 
 “The CRS will continue the inquiry after 3-4 days. Though it was an open inquiry, the general public did not come forward to depose before the team. All the statements that were recorded were of railway employees,” said sources.
 
 On inspection of defective engine, railway officials said what went wrong can only be ascertained after lab tests, which are being conducted. “The CRS inquiry report will be submitted to the   in a month,” they added.
 
 As reported earlier, when the train was running at 80-100 kmph, the engine had caught fire near Talni. There was smoke emanating from the engine and sources say there was also a blast after which ALP Vishwakarma (32) fell down.
 
 Passengers of the train had a miraculous escape as loco pilot DL Bramhe showed presence of mind and applied the emergency brakes to stop the train. In the process Bramhe too suffered minor injuries and is undergoing treatment at a private hospital.
