 On June 11, the residents of the Kasarvadavli village found a pack of dogs chasing the young jackal. The residents shooed the dogs away and called the volunteers of Thane SPCA to rescue it.
 
 On observing that the jackal was extremely feverish and covered with ticks, the members of the SPCA immediately took the severely injured animal to its veterinary hospital where it received basic medication. Later the animal was moved to a Mumbai-based vet Dr Deepa Katyal for further treatment.
 
 As the jackal was nearly on her death bed, Dr Katyal gave her 300cc bottle of saline and some multi-vitamins as well as some tick medication to liven the jackal up a bit.. However, she noticed that the jackal had significant amount of discharge oozing out of her eyes and nose, which coupled with the fever, were symptoms of the viral and deadly canine distemper.
 
 “We had taken blood tests and confirm that the animal was suffering from canine distemper. This is a viral disease that is contagious, potent and incurable. Her condition deteriorated by Tuesday and she suffered a respiratory and cardiac failure and died,” said Dr Shailesh Pethe, SGNP’s veterinary officer.
