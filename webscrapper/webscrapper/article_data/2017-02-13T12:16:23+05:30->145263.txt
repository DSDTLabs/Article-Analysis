DEHRADUN: In their last-ditch effort to sway the voters, the star campaigners of the BJP and the Congress held several rallies on Sunday across Uttarakhand, which is going to polls on February 15.
 
 From the BJP’s side, several crowd-pullers like actor Hema Malini, folk singer Manoj Tiwari, Smriti Irani and Union minister   addressed several gatherings, extolling the virtues of the saffron party and flaying the ruling dispensation.
  On the other hand, ruling Congress’ star campaigners also set the poll pitch ablaze. Actor Raj Babbar, cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu and former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh canvassed for their party on Sunday.
  
 Malini joined the BJP’s campaign on Sunday with a rally near Lansdowne Chowk in Dehradun. Canvassing for BJP candidate Khajan Das, who is contesting from Rajpur constituency, the Mathura MP started her speech by saying ‘radhe radhe’ (a religious chant).
  “Devbhoomi deserves a clean and honest government, which only BJP can provide. By voting for the BJP in Uttarakhand, you will be strengthening the hands of Narendra Modi in Delhi and opening the doors of development for the hill state,” she said.
  
 Addressing a gathering in Almora, Union minister Smriti Irani came down heavily on the ruling Congress. “In the months of summer, Almora residents don’t have enough drinking water. And during the monsoon, locals drink water from the Kosi River, where dead bodies of animals float,” she said.
  
 Meanwhile, Union minister Nitin Gadkari reached Kotdwar to address a public meeting in favour of BJP candidate  . Addressing the crowd, Gadkari said, “The upcoming polls in the Himalayan state are going to be historic, as these polls will not be the deciding factor for any particular candidate but will decide the future of the people Uttarakhand.”
