Lucknow: The heat wave conditions in UP have brought the spotlight back on power shortage, accentuated by non-operational thermal power stations in the state. According to a latest report of UP   Load Dispatch Centre, power stations with a total installed capacity of over 2,200 MW remain shut even as mercury crosses a 40 degree Celsius-mark. The intense heat wave has also led to demand of 14,000 MW. 

 The report shows that independent power producers (IPPs) comprising private sector and central sector power plants with around 1,750 MW installed capacity alone are shut for maintenance or have been closed down because of shortage of coal. And, they are expected to get fired up only by April-end or in the first week of May.
 
 The IPPs which are shut include 660-MW Bara, 300-MW Rosa, 110-MW Tanda, 660-MW Lalitpur and 200-MW Singrauli. While Bara has been closed till April 9 on account of coal shortage, the Lalitpur plant will remain closed till May 1 for maintenance work. The Rosa, Tanda and Singruali units, too, have been shut for annual over-hauling, an exercise which spans over a period of at least 30 days. In fact, the Singrauli plant, owned by NTPC, is scheduled to resume working only from May 3.
 
 Likewise, among the state sector power plants which remain shut for maintenance are a unit each of 50 MW, 94 MW and 200 MW in Obra, one 60-MW unit in Harduaganj and a 110-MW unit in Parichha. This way, the state sector power plants of over 500 MW remain shut for maintenance.
 
 The demand for power in UP has touched 14,000 MW. This is being somehow met with the help of centrally allocated quota. The report shows that against a quota of 4,943 MW, UP was getting over 5,200 MW of power from the central quota. On the other hand, the state-owned power plants wheeled in 4,250 MW of power, while another 750 MW of power was supplied by the co-gen companies (sugar mills).
 
 According to the supply chart of UPPPCL, urban areas and rural areas are scheduled to get 24 hours and 18 hours of power supply respectively. Power sector experts said the rise in day and night time temperatures will test the distribution and the transmission network of the state in the days to come.
