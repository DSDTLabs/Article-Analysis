 Nashik: The civic body has launched a massive demolition drive against illegal marriage lawns and ashrams in the city. On Monday, it razed the illegal Asaram Bapu Ashram belonging to self-styled godman Asaram Bapu who has been recently sentenced to life-term by a Jodhpur court for raping a minor.
 
 The anti-encroachment squads of the NMC removed nine unauthorised sheds, including concrete structures, in the ashram located in floodline in the Gangapur Road area.
 
 The squads also demolished the unauthorised structures of Greenfield Lawns, adjacent to the ashram.
 
 “Initially, we are focusing on removing encroachments within the floodline. Thereafter, we will take action against other unauthorised wedding lawns,” NMC officials said.
 
 Three squads armed with three excavators carried out the demolition drive, conducted under the guidance of municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe and additional municipal commissioner Kishor Borde. The drive was led by deputy municipal commissioner Rohidas Bahiram. A large posse of policemen were deployed to prevent any untoward incident.
 
 The ashram trust moved the district civil court against the NMC’s action in the afternoon. The trust, in its petition, has contended that it is protecting around 40 cows there and it conducts activities in the interest of public and action being taken by the NMC is not as per the law.
 
 According to NMC officials, the court has directed the civic body to maintain status quo up to May 28.
 
 A series of anti-encroachment demolition drive is being implemented in all six divisions of the city for the past three months following instructions from Mundhe.
 
 The civic administration has warned encroachers, including hawkers and vegetable vendors, to refrain from encroaching on footpaths, roads and squares as it causes inconvenience to pedestrians.
 
 The civic body has also warned that it would continue to take action against encroachments along city roads and footpaths.
