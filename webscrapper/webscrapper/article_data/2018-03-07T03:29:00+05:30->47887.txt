MUMBAI: A Hindu woman who has converted to Islam is entitled to claim a share in her father's property if he dies without leaving a will, the   has ruled. Justice   refused to overturn an order of a trial court that had restrained a 68-year-old Mumbai resident from selling off or creating third-party rights in his deceased father's flat in Matunga, following a claim by his 54-year-old sister who lives in Andheri. 

 The man claimed his sister had converted to Islam in 1954 and was therefore disqualified from inheriting the property of their father, who was a practising Hindu.
 
 The judge said while the personal law of a person who has converted to Islam, Christianity and other religions will apply in matters of marriage and guardianship, while deciding inheritance the religion at the time of birth has to be taken into account. "The right to inheritance is not a choice but it is by birth and in some cases it is acquired by marriage. Therefore, renouncing a particular religion and to get converted is a matter of choice and cannot cease relationships which are established and exist by birth. A Hindu convert is entitled to his/her father's property, if father died intestate," said Justice Bhatkar. The court pointed to Section 26 of the Hindu Succession Act, which says the law does not apply to children of converts. But it is silent on the converts themselves, and thus they are not disqualified from staking claim to their deceased father's property.
 
  The judge cited the fundamental right to religion guaranteed by the Constitution and added "in our secular country, any person is free to embrace and follow any religion as his/her conscious choice." The woman had filed a suit in 2010.
