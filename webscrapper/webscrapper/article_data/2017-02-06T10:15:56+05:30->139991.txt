GUWAHATI: The   has directed   to transform their   from isolated subject-based curricula to an interdisciplinary approach. 

 Traditionally, instruction in schools has tended to keep the various subjects separate from each other. By contrast, interdisciplinary instruction begins with a theme which is then investigated using those disciplines that can assist in the enquiry.
 
 Why should an interdisciplinary approach be used for students in the elementary and middle schools today? Before I answer this question, consider how a group of children generally receives instruction. Observe how students are taught about Assam during an eight-year period. In the first grade, they usually study about families. One story might be about an  . The children may have learnt an Assamese folk song in the second grade and a traditional dance in the third. In the fourth grade, a craft teacher may have had the children experiment with weaving. Finally, in middle school, they study the historical and geographical aspects of the Seven Sisters. 
 
 Instead of being given an interdisciplinary understanding of Assam, students are offered isolated bits of information in a fragmented manner across eight years. In the child's mind, the concepts and information remain unrelated. Hence the need for interdisciplinary study.
 
 Most real life, day-to-day problems are solved using interdisciplinary skill sets. For example, when we purchase a new home, investment (economics) is a major factor but not the only one. Location (geography), architecture (art), nearby educational and health facilities, and other aspects of the neighbourhood also need to be considered before a final decision can be made. Interdisciplinary instruction realistically follows this example by encouraging students to use the skill sets associated with any discipline that can be applied logically to the themes they are exploring.
