AURANGABAD: In the absence of manpower as well as expertise, the civic authorities have decided to appoint a project management   (PMC) firm to prepare a   for 44 proposed city roads. Interestingly, the authorities have already started the process of appointing a PMC firm even before receiving the funds for the roads.

 Sikander Ali, an executive engineer on Saturday told TOI that the civic body would appoint a PMC by March 23.
 
 “We are now preparing an estimate of roads so that we could avail the state government funding, but for the detailed project report we will need a PMC,” said Ali.
 
 “As per the instructions of the state government, we are planning the construction of various roads with footpaths, road dividers and side drainage. It involves a lot of technical work which will have to be carried out through the PMC. Moreover the PMC will also supervise the execution of the road,” he said.
 
 Over the years, the civic body has developed a tradition of appointing PMCs for most of the projects for which it has to shell out 2% of the total project cost. Sources believe that the civic body has appointed PMCs on many projects where it was not essential.
 
 On several occasions the municipal administration has faced sharp criticism from the standing committee and the general body on appointment of PMCs for roads and other projects. 
 
 Earlier in 2015, in an attempt to curb irregularities in the civic body, then municipal commissioner   had disallowed the municipal authorities to appoint project management consultancies (PMCs) for various project expect that for the Rs 456 crore drainage project. Kendrekar had said that the municipal authorities should handle the projects on their own and save the public money spent under the head.
