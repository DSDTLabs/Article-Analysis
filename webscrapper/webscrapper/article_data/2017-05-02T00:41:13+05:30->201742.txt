NAVI MUMBAI: The Shiv   on Monday made a strong attempt to nullify the BJP’s strategy to gain mileage from the notification of the Panvel City Municipal Corporation (PCMC) last year. 

 Sena party secretary, Adesh Bandekar, a popular Marathi actor and a sampark pramukh in Raigad district, told TOI on Monday, “Any government decision is a joint decision if there is an alliance. This is even the case with the   issue. The Sena has decided to contest on its own strength.’’
 
 With the over 4 lakh electorate spoilt for choice, the PCMC polls is expected to be a keen contest. All major political parties contesting for the first Panvel civic polls, to be held on on May 24, are trying to form ties with the potential winners for the 78-member corporation.
 
  Meanwhile, Raigad district Congress president R C Ghara said, “Our talks with PWP and Congress are still on and we have asked for 30 seats. The talks are likely to be finalised by Tuesday after which we will file nominations.’’
 
  The filing of nominations started on Saturday and will close on May 6. 
 
  With the break in alliance talks with the Sena, CM Devendra Fadnavis doesn’t seem to be ready to take any chance and has started taking personal interest in the polls. He is being briefed by an independent agency and also gets daily inputs from party leaders.
 
 BJP’s Panvel MLA Prashant Thakur told TOI on Monday, “There’s an election war room that keeps updating the chief minister. He has notified the formation of the corporation and is very keen about the civic polls.’’ The party was also planning a public meeting of Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari.
