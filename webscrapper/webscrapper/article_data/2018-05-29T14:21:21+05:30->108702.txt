VIJAYAWADA: Paying tributes to NT   on his 95th birth anniversary, CM   said a lesson on the founder-president of TDP will be incorporated in school  .

 
 
 Speaking on the second day of the TDP’s   here, Naidu said that   contributed a lot to the welfare of the Telugu people, and demanded that Union government should confer Bharat Ratna on him. 
 
 Naidu said that NTR, even after crossing 60 years of age, wanted to work for the welfare of the people, and floated the TDP, which became a huge success. “I am working for continuing his ambition of serving the Telugu people,” he said.
 
 “We will install a big statue of NTR in Amaravati,” the CM said.
 
 Earlier, paying tributes to his father, TDP MLA N Balakrishna, said he was fortunate enough to be NTR’s son. “I am playing the role of my father in his biopic. No son in the world has got an opportunity to play the role of his father in a film. Krish will handle the film, and it will be released during Pongal season next year,” he said.
 
 TDP MP and Tollywood actor, Murali Mohan, said that he never touched the feet of any one. But when he first met NTR, he touched his feet. “People used to recognise me as younger brother of NTR as I played the role of his brother in the film Annadammula Anubanhdam,” he said. 
 
  leader, daughter of NTR, D Purnadeshwari demanded that a lesson on NTR should be incorporated in the textbooks. “It would have been better if   (her brother) was to be seen on the dais of Mahanadu,” she said.
