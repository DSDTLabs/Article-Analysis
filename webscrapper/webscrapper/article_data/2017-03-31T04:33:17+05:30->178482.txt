NEW DELHI: Sparks flew in   on Thursday when power minister Piyush Goyal locked horns with his predecessor   of   on whether the Centre’'s claim of being power surplus was resulting in consumers actually getting electricity.

 The   also witnessed noisy scenes during the sometimes heated exchange between the two young politicians, with Congress alleging that the government’s ‘power for all’ was a “tall claim” and Goyal hitting back by saying it was UPA’s failure.
 
 Speaker   had to intervene, asking Goyal and Scindia to “keep their calm”, as the two exchanged sarcastic barbs and jibes over the “real” situation.
 
 Raising the issue during question hour, Scindia alleged that 7 crore households were still without electricity.
 
 Goyal retorted with sarcasm by saying Scindia himself had exposed the “performance” of his party, which was in power for 50 years since Independence. Goyal said the NDA government had turned around the power situation to a great extent and there were legacy issues left behind by Congress that were being sorted out. The minister said
 
 enough power was being generated in the country ever since the NDA took over in 2014 and the country could now meet even a 50% rise in demand. But Scindia stuck to his guns with a simple question: if the country was surplus, then why were blackouts rampant throughout the country.
 
 Goyal said these were all legacy issues as Congress had left the sector moribund when it was voted out. He pointed to Rajasthan, saying Congress had left behind a legacy of Rs 15,000 crore annual loss. Goyal said UDAY, the scheme to restore financial health of discoms, would change the situation.
