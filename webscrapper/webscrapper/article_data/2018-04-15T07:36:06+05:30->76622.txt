CHANDIGARH: Contending that Punjab government’s move to appoint MLAs as legislative assistants would amount to circumventing the Punjab and   high court verdict, passed while setting setting aside the appointment of chief parliamentary secretaries (CPSs), a legal notice has been sent to the state to not go ahead with the move.

 The legal notice sent to Punjab chief minister Captain   by activist lawyer H C Arora says the proposed appointments will place a huge burden on the state exchequer, which is already reeling under the burden of a huge salaries paid to officers on special duty (OSDs).
 
 Arora submitted that the  , in a judgement in July 2017, made it clear that the state legislature lacks the competence to make such an act for the creation of posts of chief parliamentary secretaries.
 
 “Thus, by inventing a new nomenclature, your government, or the  , cannot be permitted to create posts of legislative assistants for keeping ruling party MLAs in good humour. Such a legislation would enable the MLAs to conduct like deputy or state ministers, under the garb of ‘legislative assistants,’ which would be violative of the Constitution, which mandates that the total number of ministers, including the CM, in the council of ministers in a state shall not exceed 15% of the total number of MLAs of that state,” said the notice.
 
 The Punjab CM has been requested by Arora to desist/refrain from circumventing court verdicts by appointing ‘legislative assistants’ from among MLAs of the ruling party, failing which he will file a public interest litigation (PIL) before the Punjab and Haryana high court.
