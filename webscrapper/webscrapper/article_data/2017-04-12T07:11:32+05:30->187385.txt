NASHIK: A state-level   on glut and price volatility of vegetables, especially onions, has been organised by the National Horticulture Research & Development Foundation ( ) at Chitegaon on Wednesday.

 Increase in production of fruits and vegetables is necessary to meet the increasing need of our country. However, due to perishable nature of fruits and vegetables and more dependency on climatic factor, many times these crops face either glut or shortage thereby affecting farmers as well as consumers.
 
 “The glut situations are observed in many crops like tomato,  , potato as well as garlic which lead to heavy fluctuations in area and production in subsequent years. The seminar will focus on various issues related to the topic and formulate policies and strategies to avoid the problems faced by the farmers,” said an official from NHRDF.
 
 The prices of vegetables are decided on the demand and supply ratio. Onion prices go up if demand is more as compared to supply and the prices crash if supply is huge as compared to the demand.
 
 The average wholesale onion prices have declined to the range of Rs 400 to Rs 500 in the past six months due to arrivals of onions in large quantity at the   markets. It costs Rs 1,000 for producing one quintal onion. Accordingly, farmers incur losses if the prices go below that. Hence, this workshop will help farmers understand the glut management for vegetables particularly onions. 
 
 Divisional revenue commissioner   will inaugurate the event.
