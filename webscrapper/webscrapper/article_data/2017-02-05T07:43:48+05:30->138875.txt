HYDERABAD: The mercy petition of an Indian man jailed in   has been rejected by the authorities there. An MBA graduate, 32-year-old Mohammed   from Malakpet in the city had been sentenced to a one-year jail term and also to suffer 300 lashes in December last year, on charges of theft. 

 Hussain had protested the order saying that he was robbed of the amount belonging to the company when he had gone to deposit it in a bank on August 25, 2016 in Riyadh.
 
 Hussain who was working as a marketing auditor for   and Sons is now lodged in the Wadi Al Dawaser Jail.
 
 Following his conviction, Hussain's mother Hoor Unisa in a letter to external affairs minister   on December 31, 2016 had asked that her son be rescued. The Indian Embassy in Riyadh delivered the mercy petition on behalf of the family of the convict to the Saudi Arabian government.
 
 However, the embassy informed the family on February 2 that the mercy petition had been rejected. The family has been asked to file an appeal against the judgement in a higher court in Riyadh, as is done in the normal course.
