VADODARA: The Baroda University Teachers Association (BUTA) will witness a direct contest between   and Janak Shah for the post of BUTA president. 

 On Tuesday, which was the last day of withdrawing nominations, K V R Murthy pulled out his nomination from the post of president leaving Dangarwala and Shah in the poll fray. 
 
 It will be after a gap of a decade that election for BUTA president’s post will be held at M S University campus. Interestingly, both Dangarwala and Shah are teachers at MSU’s Faculty of Commerce. 
 
 It was in 2007 last that elections were held when Dr I I Pandya had defeated Shah with a huge margin. 
 
 Election for the president’s post will now be held on July 15 as all other seats of office-bearers of the new body for the term between 2017 and 2019 have gone uncontested. There are nearly 300 teachers who are eligible to vote. 
 
 Murthy from Faculty of Technology and Engineering has continued as vice-president of the association as Dhiraj Patel from Faculty of Science, who had earlier filed his candidature for the post pulled out on Tuesday. 
 
 Nikul Patel from Faculty of Technology and Engineering had already got elected uncontested to the post of general secretary as he was the only one to file nomination for the post which he was holding in the old body as well. 
 
 Dharmendra Shah from Faculty of Science has won uncontested for the post of secretary (administration) as Janak Shah has pulled out his candidature from the post. Dhiraj Patel had already won uncontested as he was the only one to file nomination for the post of secretary (organisation). 
 
 Since, the association has not received a single nomination for the post of secretary (finance), the new body will opt a person as secretary (finance). 
 
 The old body which had got elected uncontested for 2015-17 had Sanjiv Vaid as president and   as secretary (administration).
