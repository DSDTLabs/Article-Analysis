CHENNAI: The Madras   on Friday directed the National Commission for Scheduled Castes to consider within six months the representation of   fishermen community to include them in the list of scheduled caste.

 The first bench of Chief Justice   and Justice   passed the order on the plea moved by Fisherman Care. The petitioner also wanted the government to reserve six legislative constituencies and three parliamentary constituencies for the community in the state.
 
 According to the petitioner, the   report on backward classes in 1980 had said that certain sections of some occupational communities like fishermen, banjaras and bansforas still suffer from the stigma of untouchability. They have been listed as OBCs, but their inclusion in the lists of scheduled castes may be considered.
 
 “Mandal Commission has recommended for inclusion of   community in the list of scheduled castes/scheduled tribes and to carve out the areas of their concentration into separate constituencies at the time of delimitation,” the petitioner said. “This apart, the M S   committee had also recommended to the parliamentary committee to consider a separate legislation on the lines of the scheduled tribes and other traditional forest dwellers (recognition of forest rights) Act, 2006 for recognising the traditional rights and fishing occupation of the fishermen community,” the organisation added.
 
 Claiming that the participation of the fishermen community in the legislature, judiciary and executive is nearly nil, the petitioner said, “In a democratic setup, every individual and community has a legitimate aspiration and right to participate in ruling this country.
 
 Therefore, it is high time to implement the Mandal Commission recommendation and to carve out the areas of their concentration into a separate constituencies at the time of delimitation.
