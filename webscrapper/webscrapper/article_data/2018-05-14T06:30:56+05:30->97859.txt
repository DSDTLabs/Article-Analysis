BENGALURU: Buying a second-hand car from a city  ? You could be a victim of odometer tampering or end up purchasing a damaged vehicle. Odometer measures the distance travelled in the vehicle.

 In April 2017, IT professional Sijo K Philip from Sahakarnagar decided to buy a second-hand car and went to SLV Car World on Outer Ring Road in JP Nagar Phase II. The sales personnel showed him a 2011 Honda Civic model and claimed the vehicle had travelled only 50,947km (as visible on the odometer) and was in a good condition.
 
 Believing them, Philip shelled out Rs 6.2 lakh for the second-hand sedan before driving it home on April 10, 2017. After 15 days of driving, the techie visited an authorised Honda service station in the city and got a shock of his life.
 
 Technicians told Philip that his Honda Civic was last serviced properly in 2015 and the engine and other internal parts were damaged despite the sedan looking chic from outside. On examining the car, they said the odometer was adjusted to show a meter reading of 50,947km, even though the car had actually travelled over 90,000 km.
 
 Realising he had been conned with a substandard sedan, Philip raised the issue with SLV Car World representatives, including its proprietor Keshavalu Reddy. However, they allegedly didn’t respond to his grievance.
 
 Philip then approached the Bangalore Urban 2nd Additional District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum on September 26, 2017 with a complaint against Reddy. 
 
 In the seven months of litigation that followed, Philip produced all documents to establish the fraud, including tampering of the odometer, damaged engine and other internal parts. The opposite party didn’t appear throughout the proceedings and was treated as ex parte by the consumer forum.
 
 On May 7, the forum ruled in favour of Philip and ordered Reddy to pay compensation of Rs 1.50 lakh within 60 days for unfair trade practices.
