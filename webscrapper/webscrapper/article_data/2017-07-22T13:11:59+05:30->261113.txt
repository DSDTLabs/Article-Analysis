PUNE: On the six occasions that he dined out after the rollout of the GST,   has had to shell out almost Rs 700 as tax.

 Hotel owners said the footfall has reduced by almost 20% since the GST came into effect.
 
 “Every time the bill reaches the Rs 500 mark, almost Rs 100 levied on it as tax. Prices have definitely gone up. One meal used to cost me around Rs 330 earlier, but now I pay around Rs 370 for it,” the 24-year-old Desai said. Unable to afford the revised prices, he now prefers eating home-cooked food.
 
 Many   who eat out regularly have also felt the pinch. “I would buy coffee from a restaurant every day at Rs 45 before GST came into effect, but now it costs me nearly Rs 50. It might seem an insignificant amount on a daily basis, but cumulatively it is an addition of almost Rs 150 to my monthly expenses. As a student, the extra amount weighs in on my pocket,” 21-year-old music student Shivani Mirajkar said.
 
 She added, “The whole point of GST was to simplify the tax system. However, it has only become cumbersome. People are still confused about about the costs of commodities.”
 
 Pratap Patil, a medical equipment supplier, said, “Before GST’s implementation, I used to dine out with friends. But since it is costlier now, we have identified a few low-cost restaurants to dine. Eating in air-conditioned (AC) restaurants makes the pocket lighter by around Rs 2,500,” the Sinhagad Road resident said.
 
 Some of the restaurants have installed fans and coolers instead of airconditioners as the tax slab for AC restaurants is 6% higher than the non-AC ones, said Vardhan Borgave, a resident of the same area. 
 
 “However, I feel that with the implementation of the GST the understanding of taxes has become much easier,” he added.
