PUNE: A group of scientists from   (NRCP), Solapur, in collaboration with   (IIHR), Bengaluru, has developed a new   called “NRCP H-6“, which has a high content of   compared to the existing  .

 Iron and zinc content in the fresh arils in NRCP H-6 are 6.10mg and 0.69mg respectively per 100g against 2.8mg and 0.52mg respectively in the popular variety Bhagwa.
 
 Speaking to TOI over phone, NRCP director R K Pal said, “Having high iron and zinc content in fruit is a very good sign as it can be extensively used as a dietary supplement by processing it into high-value nutraceutical product in the near future.“
 
 In India, pomegranate is cultivated on 1.93 lakh hectare with an annual production of 21.98 lakh tonne and average productivity of 11.39 tonne per hectare. 
 
 Currently, Bhagwa, Ganesh, Ruby, Jalore Seedless, G-137, Arakta and Mridula are some of the popular varieties of pomegranate in the country.
 
 With the objective of developing a new variety of pomegranate, which is superior in yield and quality to Bhagwa (Standard Check), hybridization work started at NRCP during 2008.
 
 In this, Bhagwa was used as female parent while [(Ganesh x Nana) x Daru] developed at ICAR-IIHR was used as male parent.
 
 Multi-location trials of the variety are undergoing in Rajasthan, Karnataka and Maharashtra. The preliminary results are positive.
 
 The variety will be released by Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh on April 30 at NRCP, Solapur.
