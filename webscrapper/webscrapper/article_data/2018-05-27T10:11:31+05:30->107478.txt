CHANDIGARH: Haryana government has made it clear that   for Karnal   is to be procured purely on voluntary basis and there is no question of any discrimination or coercion in this matter.

 
 An official spokesman of the civil aviation department described the reports expressing concerns regarding   of land as factually incorrect and divorced from truth.
 
 He clarified that 280 acres had already been notified by the civil aviation department on e-Bhoomi portal of the state government under the policy for purchase of land voluntarily offered to government for development projects. This policy was notified by a state government notification on February 6, 2017. The two objectives of the policy are â€” firstly, a farmer is assured of approaching the government as a potential buyer for its projects; and secondly the government can elicit a response from landowners keen on the benefits of a particular project that they willingly sell their land to government for it. This makes it clear that the land is to be procured purely on voluntary basis and there is no question of discrimination or coercion in the matter, the spokesman said.
 
 He further explained that the state government had decided to extend the existing airstrips in all five aerodromes of the state to leverage this infrastructure to take maximum advantage of the booming opportunities in the civil aviation sector in view of the initiatives taken by the central government.
 
 While Hisar aerodrome is being developed as an international aviation hub, the other four airstrips at Karnal, Pinjore, Bhiwani and Narnaul shall be extended up to 5,000ft to accommodate medium-sized aircraft for various activities like parking, sub-basing, MRO (maintenance, repair, and overhaul), flying training as well as adventure sports for which the civil aviation department shall be publishing an expression of interest very shortly.
