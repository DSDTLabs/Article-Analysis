Ahmedabad: Gujarat high court on Tuesday asked the Centre to show the status of an inquiry against a judicial member of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Ahmedabad ( ) after a lawyer filed a petition seeking his removal on the grounds that he is “incompetent”.

 The division bench of Chief Justice R S Reddy and Justice V M Pancholi sought the Centre’s reply in two weeks after petitioner-advocate Sunita Chaturvedi complained that the government has not filed its reply for the last four months.
 
 Chaturvedi alleged that CAT judicial member M Nagarajan is “incompetent” in carrying out his work. She said Nagarajan acts as both judge and lawyer on certain cases, and even adjudicates his own drafted petition. She requested the HC to direct an inquiry against him under section 9 (2)(3) of the Administrative Tribunal Act.
 
 The petitioner said that due to the judge’s incompetence, certain matters were listed after long delays. Further hearing in this case is posted on March 2.
