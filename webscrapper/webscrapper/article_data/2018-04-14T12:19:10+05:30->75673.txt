PATNA: The Patna   has asked state chief secretary to form a committee involving officials of different departments to suggest ways to improve civic amenities in   town.

 A division bench of the high court, comprising Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice Rajeev Ranjan Prasad, passed the order while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by one Dheeraj Kumar of Darbhanga, who complained of poor drainage facility and disposal of biomedical waste in an unscientific manner in the town.
 
 The court came down heavily on authorities of different departments for playing “blame game” over the issue. The matter will now come up for hearing in the court after two weeks.
 
 The   told the court that due to lack of proper drainage system, waterlogging becomes a major problem in Darbhanga town during monsoon. “The town has more than 100 medical centres. However, no system has been put in place for disposal of biomedical waste,” the PIL stated.
 
 Petitioner’s counsel Shama Sinha said the proposed committee would comprise officials of Bihar State Pollution Control Board, Darbhanga Municipal Corporation, railways and some other departments.
