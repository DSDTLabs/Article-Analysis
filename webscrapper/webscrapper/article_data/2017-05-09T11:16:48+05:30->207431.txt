JALANDHAR: City Congress MLAs came down heavily on officials of   municipal corporation, Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) and   (PWSSB) for its dismal performance in controlling waste water management and dirty water in the drains without treatment. They also levelled corruption charges on the officials. 

 The allegations made in the presence of environmentalist Baba Balbir Singh Seechewal, Jalandhr MP Chaudhary Santokh Singh and deputy commissioner (DC) Varinder   Sharma were embarrassing for the officials. 
 
 Former hockey Olympian and Jalandhar Cantonment MLA Pargat Singh alleged that despite spending crores on waste water management, the officials had failed to enforce the law. He added PPCB officials were more occupied making money from defaulters rather than plugging the pollutants at the source. Pargat added that green agenda was part of their party manifesto and MLAs would pursue it. 
 
 Jalandhar (West) MLA   grilled the officials on how sewage treatment plants (STPs) designed to function till 2025 were not able to even cater to the current requirement. As Seechewal detailed the issue and also raised fingers at the lapses, Rinku said it exposed the inefficiency of the official machinery.
 
 Jalandhar (North) MLA Avtar 'Bawa' Henry minced no words taking the officials to task. He said their inefficiency had created horrible conditions in and around the city. Jalandhar (Central) MLA Rajinder Beri and   MLA Surinder Chaudhary were also present on the occasion.
 
 Sources privy to the meeting informed the officials were fumbling for answers. The meeting was held at the initiative of Seechewal who informed MLAs that dirty water continued to flow in   drain creating sickening conditions for the people.
