 “Why is it that during the years that your family ruled India, India’s per capita income was growing less than the world average? And yet, in the years since your family relinquished the prime ministership of India, India’s per capita income has grown substantially faster than the world average?” Basu asked Gandhi.
 
 The Congress president asked Basu what his “hypothesis” was, at which the professor referred him to his book, Asia Reborn. At this point in the video, another audience member asks a question, heaping praise on Gandhi and his party.
 
 The Congress party shared a 4 minute 26 second video of the interaction on its official Twitter handle with the tweet, “With political discourse hitting new lows everyday (sic), Congress President   shows how to gracefully handle detractors and call their bluff. #RGinSingapore #IndiaAt70.” Basu replied to this with: “This is a classic fake-news video. You are using my image to falsely advertise your politician, showing a sequence of events that did not occur. Withdraw this false video, or prepare for prosecution in Singapore’s courts!” Basu had shared a 2 minute 22 second video of the interaction.
