 The actress confirmed the news to Bombay Times and also revealed that the wedding will happen in Shimla. The pre-wedding functions will take place in Mumbai and Ludhiana (Abhinav’s hometown). The actress is currently working on her leave for the wedding and feels she won't get more than a 10-day break . 
 
 The wedding will be a mix of Himachali and Punjabi rituals, as Rubina is a Himachali and Abhinav, a Punjabi. Talking about the wedding Rubina earlier stated in the report, “We both wanted it to be an outdoor affair. Abhinav, being an adventure junkie, wished to exchange vows amidst the mountains, in the lap of nature. I, too, wanted a day wedding with lots of natural light and greenery around.”
 The actress also revealed in the interview that she doesn’t have any jitters related to the wedding, “I am not someone who will have jitters. The idea is to grow old together and know each other better, gradually. I am looking forward to exploring new things with him by my side. I believe that one shouldn’t know everything about his/her partner at one go. Slow discovery of each other lends newness to the relationship and keeps the spark alive.”
