Kolkata: Investigation into the attack by an assistant bank manager on the branch head at their office in BBD Bag has now revealed the accused may have hit out since he felt “neglected” by his seniors. Police sources said the accused, Santimoy Dutta Gupta (59), a resident of Netaji Nagar, was upset that his complaints of bullying against his senior were allegedly repeatedly dismissed by the top management.

 Sources also maintained it was a grass-cutter that was used to attack Nupur Bhattacharya (56). “It was procured late in the evening by Santimoy on the spur of the moment. He claimed he had bought it from Chandni Market,” said an officer.
 
 These revelations came on a day doctors at Medical College declared Nupur fit to be discharged. “We have brought her home though she is still in trauma. She told us Santimoy was a regular at her residence and as recently as a few days ago, the accused had sought advice from her husband on how to keep his blood sugar under control,” a relative said. 
 
 Nupur said she did not have any argument with Santimoy on the day of attack. “She did, however, tell us that Santimoy’s health was an issue and that she had asked the higher-ups to relocate him to some other branch where his workload could be reduced,” said Nupur’s brother-in-law Bharghav Bhattacharya. 
 
 The cops said they will record the victim’s formal statement in the case soon. “We have spoken to the third employee — a woman — who was not present on the spot. The CCTV footages are being studied. We are hopeful of piecing together a few missing links of this case at the earliest,” said a Lalbazar official. Santimoy’s family has submitted his medical record to cops, claiming he is being “framed.” The bank management, though, refuted charges that Santimoy was being “bullied.”
