JAISALMER: Much like the thousands of tourists who come from Bengal, Suli and her husband   had a special reason to come to Jaisalmer. While roaming around the lanes of the desert town, the couple had hoped to visit ‘Mukulbari’ — the house of fictional character Mukul from ‘Sonar Kella,’ the mystery novel written and made into a film by  .

 Like most others, the two were disappointed when they saw the house, located right opposite Sonar Fort, lying in ruins. The structure, shown in the 1974 movie, is now neglected and coming apart.
 
 “We must have seen the movie a hundred times and I distinctly remember the scene when Mukul, who is being followed by the villain, enters this house. We thought ‘Mukulbari’ may be one of the protected sites, but were disappointed to see that it has not been maintained,” said Suli.
 
 “The administration and the state government should make efforts to conserve this heritage site,” added Suman.
 
 Another tourist, Partho Das from Kolkata, said he had hoped to see ‘Mukulbari’ as shown in the movie, but was shocked to see its present condition. “Lakhs of tourists come here to see ‘Mukulbari,’ but all of them would be quite disappointed. The government should take action. Even the guides here make it a point to tell us in Bengali about the house and incidents related to the shooting of the movie. This shows how frequently it is visited by Bengali tourists. It must be protected,” he said.
 
 Last year, Satyajit Ray’s son Sandeep Ray had come to Jaisalmer and made a documentary.
 
 Mukulbari is situated opposite   at Sonar Fort. It is in such a bad condition and may even collapse during heavy rains or any other natural disaster. The house is owned by four people who stay in other states. There’s a dispute over the property and a case is going on in the court.
