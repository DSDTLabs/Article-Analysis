NEW DELHI: Road transport and highways minister   on Tuesday set the target of constructing 45 kilometers per day during 2018-19 and the target for award has been set at daily 55 kilometers. 

 
 While the high construction target seems tough to achieve considering that all wings of the highways ministry could build only 27 km a day, sources said this has been done to push maximum highway construction during the poll year.
 
 “We will try to award about 20,000 km of national highways during this fiscal, which is 25% more than last financial year’s 17,055 km. We will try to complete 16,420 km till March against the last year’s achievement of 9,829 km. I am confident of building 40 km per day in 2018-19,”   told reporters after a marathon meeting with officials from NHAI, road ministry and state governments.
 
 A ministry official said a huge number of projects are under implementation phase and hence achieving the target could be possible. “We pushed the construction from only 11 km a day to 27 km in the past four years. Several decisions have been taken to streamline construction, increasing the pace of land acquisition and obtaining green approvals,” he added.
 
 Focus on building more highways is also set to push economic activities and increase employment opportunities, which are two priority concerns of the   government.
