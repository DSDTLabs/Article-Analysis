Sandalwood choreographer-director  's son   is currently in  , where he has gone from his sports academy —   — to represent India in football in an under-15 tournament called Gothia Cup. The youngster, aged 14 from Bishop Cotton’s Boys School, plays as a forward in the team and will be playing against teams from Europe in the initial rounds. There will be teams from 80 nations in this tournament and Aryan, a big Cristiano   fan, is hoping to score many goals to ensure India fares well. 
Imran, about his son, says, “Coming from a conservative family like mine, when I chose films, it was a big culture shock. So, when Aryan expressed his passion for football four years ago, we were equally startled, since both my wife   and I are associated with showbiz. But, today, seeing him do so well and represent the country, we are thrilled to support him in his endeavours. In fact, last year, he was awarded the best player in the under-12 team in India and he is so passionate about the sport that he has pictures of Ronaldo painted across his walls in his bedroom. We often joke about how he goes to sleep with his football and wakes up to pictures of his idol. We, as a family, are hoping his team emerges victorious in this tournament.”
