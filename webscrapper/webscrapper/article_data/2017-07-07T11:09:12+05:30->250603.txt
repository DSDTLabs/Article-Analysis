GUWAHATI: The  , about 150 km from here, is facing an alarming spike in   pressure over the last six months, park authorities said. The park, also known as mini  , is now witnessing the use of automatic rifles by poachers, a trend never seen earlier. 

 "To be precise, the poaching scenario in Orang has taken a hydra-headed form. If one gang is cracked down on, another emerges. There is a constant formation of new gangs and alliances between poachers are being struck rapidly even after a step-up in our operations against them," a senior park official said.
 
 On June 27, one AK-56 rifle, one .303 rifle, a silencer and ammunition were seized from two poachers - Mujibur Ali and   from the Dalgaon area in Darrang district. The duo was arrested following a tipoff.
 
 The park official said the seizure of AK-56 from poachers who are residents of villages around Orang has become the most worrying thing. "Possession of AK-56 rifle gives a clear indication that poachers are improving their firepower to take on forest officials. It also raises the possibility of a nexus between poachers and militants," the official said.
 
 Across the northern boundary of the park, officials said, surrendered militants of NDFB were also found involved in poaching activities. In April this year, one surrendered militant was arrested in connection with poaching in Orang. "On the southern side of the park, poachers from Nagaon district are active. So there is always a contact between poachers on the southern and northern fringes of Orang," the official said. 
 
 Park officials said the increase in poaching pressure on Orang is directly correlated to the stepped up anti-poaching measures, with the deployment of a large contingent of armed forest personnel in Kaziranga.
