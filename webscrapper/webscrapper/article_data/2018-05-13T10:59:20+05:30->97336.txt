HYDERABAD: Is there a mechanism to check if the ?8,000 per acre being given to each farmer towards investment support is being utilised for the purpose it’s meant for? To this, municipal administration minister   said on Saturday: “Wish our banks asked these questions before trusting industry bigwigs with thousands of crores of loans. Wish we in government asked ourselves the same tough questions before offering monetary incentives to industry. We need not doubt our farmers with this measly support, brother.”

 The minister was replying to a question posed by one K   on Twitter. “Sir, how are you going to ensure that the money given to farmers under the scheme will be used by them only for the purpose intended? This is a very important question that you need to answer. I am willing to donate to the cause if there is a mechanism in place to ensure there is no misuse,”   asked.
 
 Meanwhile, KTR has announced that several farmers are coming forward to voluntarily give up the cheques received in the scheme. “In Mustabad mandal, we have more than 10 farmers who decided to give it up. My compliments to them and others who have been sending messages wanting to contribute,” he said with the hashtag “GiveItUp”.
 
 In  , where he distributed cheques to farmers on Friday, schoolgirl   was felicitated after she donated Rs 30,000 from her savings. She spoke as to how   had motivated her by introducing the scheme.
 
 KTR, who participated in the   programmes at Gambhiraopet and Mustabad mandals, said, “No state government programme that I’ve been part of in the last nine years as a legislator has given me more satisfaction than Rythu Bandhu.”
