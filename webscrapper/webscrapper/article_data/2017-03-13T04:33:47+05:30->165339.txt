LUCKNOW: A day after his wife Swati Singh emerged victorious from Lucknow’s   constituency, expelled BJP leader   Singh’s suspension was revoked by UP BJP chief  .

 On Sunday morning, a press release on behalf of Maurya stated that Dayashankar’s expulsion had been revoked with immediate effect. Former BJP UP unit vice-president, Singh landed in controversy last year after making unsavoury remark against   chief   leading to uproar both inside and outside Parliament.
 
 It prompted finance minister   to tender unconditional apology and Singh was sacked from the party. A few days after Singh’s expulsion, BSP workers indulged in unsavoury remark against Swati.
 
 However, on Sunday, they alleged that the party had “shown its true colours” and the move indicated how BJP considered the status of women.
