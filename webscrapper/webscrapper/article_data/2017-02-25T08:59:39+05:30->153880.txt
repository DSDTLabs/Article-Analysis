HYDERABAD: The Telangana government has sought Rs 8,000 crore from the Centre for upgradation of five state highways into   in the 201718 financial year.

 The Suryapet-Kham mam stretch, which provides crucial connectivity to the famous   in Bhadrachalam, is on the list. The   is 78 km away from Khammam town. It has been a long-pending demand of people to develop the road between Suryapet and Khammam town. While the entire stretch from Hyderabad to Suryapet is a four-lane  , the road width gets reduced to two lanes once the motorist takes a left turn from Suryapet to go towards Khammam.The stretch between Suryapet and Khammam town needs to be improved as the remaining stretch between Khammam to Bhadadri via Wyra, Tallada, Kothagudem is comparatively better.
 
 Officials said the state government has decided to take up development of roads in a big way in the ensuing fiscal. Almost 8,000-km of road network will be developed under Public Private Partnership. “The entire 8,000-km of roads will not be developed in 2017-18 alone, but work will start on widening them and the project will be completed in a phased manner depending upon the response from private agencies,“ a senior official in roads and buildings department said.
 
 Roads and Buildings minister Tummala Nageswara Rao said the state government will write to the Centre seeking funds for development of the state highways into national highways. The Union road transport ministry had responded positively when the minister-led delegation had proposed these five roads during their last visit to Delhi, he added.
 
 Tummala added that the state government was able to convince the central government following which the Union road transport ministry agreed to fund the development of 2,776-km of state highways into national highways.
