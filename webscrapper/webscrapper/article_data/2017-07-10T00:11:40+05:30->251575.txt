Hyderabad: The   and its student wing NSUI will undertake a 93-km   from Tandur to Shadnagar to expose the ‘failure of TRS government’ in providing basic amenities in schools and hostels.

 The padayatra will start at 10.30am from Bhadradri Chowk in Tandur on July 11. This is a follow-up of the Vidyarthi Chaitanya Yatra taken up by the NSUI two months ago. TPCC president Uttam Kumar Reddy, AICC leaders Deepender Hooda and Mukul Wasnik and NSUI state presidents from across the country will take part.
 
 “The plan is to cover 18 km on Day One followed by 13 km the next day. En route, we will stay at function halls and temporary tents. The schedule is to reach Shadnagar on July 16 night and visit hostels in the area on July 17,” Balmoori Venkat said. tnn
