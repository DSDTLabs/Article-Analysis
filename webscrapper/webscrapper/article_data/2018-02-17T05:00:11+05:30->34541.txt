MUMBAI:   has finally released the first set of   from the November-December 2017 exam on Friday evening, including semester V results for final year BSc and B Sc-IT students. 

 Of the 18,140 students who took the TYBSc exam, around 51% cleared it, with results of only about 377 students kept on reserve. Of the students who cleared the exam, 1,033 got an outstanding grade. In the TYBSc-IT exam, 49% of the 11,745 students who took the exam cleared it, with less than 100 results kept on reserve. 
 
 In the March-April 2017 exam, the results of several students were kept on reserve after papers went missing during the newly introduced online assessment process. This time, the MU had taken extra precaution to ensure papers were counted well before scanning. University officials had claimed that results of all students would be announced simultaneously and no results would be kept on hold.
 
 So, far, 198 of the 402 results have been announced. But the results announced on Friday were the first set of major results, which affected more than 10,000 students . Whether the results are error-free will be known after students access the results on the site on Saturday. 
 
 TYBCom results, which has the maximum number of stud-ents enrolled, are the most awai-ted, affecting nearly 80,000 stud-ents. Many are worried that there wonâ€™t be sufficient time to ap-ply for re-valuation before the final semester exams in April. tnn
