THRISSUR: Even though the water from Peechi dam has been relelased, around 800 acres of   at Parappur region has been affected as water hasn’t reached here.

 According to K K Kochumuhammed, president of  ,“people have been taking more water than the required amount in some regions with the water pumps leading to water shortage in the other parts of the Kole. Though the district administration issued orders not to draw water from canals using pump sets, there is no system in place to monitor it.”
 
 Malampuzha, dam has water for drinking purposes of Palakkad town and six adjoining grama panchayats. But could not provide irrigation water for the second crop of paddy cultivation in Alathur, Palakkad and parts of Chittur taluk, affecting paddy cultivation in the ‘rice bowl’ of Kerala.
 
 As per the farmerssecond crop cultivation has begun in some parts of the Kole lands due to which water consumption has increased in such regions. Thus the water opened out from the dam takes time to reach the end part of the kole.
 
 “In the past, we used to conduct regular meeting of the Kole advisory committee in which we decide the ‘kolepadavu’ that go for the paddy cultivation. The time table for each step of farming will also be set up after discussing with the representatives of the ‘kole padasekhara samithi. But this year due to various reasons such meeting were not called upon and some farmers went their own way in farming,” added Kochumuhammed.
 
 At present, paddy from 30 percent kole lands has been harvested. But the uncertainty in procurement price still haunts the farmers who struggle between the climate change and water shortage. “Though we have been promised to call up a meeting of higher officials by including the civil supplies, it did not happen yet,” said Kochumuhammed. He added that the farmers should get a fair compensation for the loss they faced this year.
