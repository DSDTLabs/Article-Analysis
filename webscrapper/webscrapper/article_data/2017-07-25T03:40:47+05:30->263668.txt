NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday managed to parry an impending stay on commercial cultivation of   mustard by agreeing to place technical data on the contentious issue before the  .

 After a bench of Chief Justice   and Justice D Y Chandrachud said “either you hold your hands till the court decides the controversy or we stay commercial cultivation of GM mustard”, additional solicitor general Tushar Mehta attempted to give an impression that even if the Centre cleared commercial cultivation of the crop, actual sowing would not start before two years.
 
 “The research wing of Delhi University has just 15 kg of GM mustard seeds. If the government gives the go-ahead, it will sow this for production of seeds needed for commercial cultivation.
 
 This process will take two years. So, the court could still decide the legality of commercial cultivation prior to largescale cultivation for commercial purposes,” Mehta said.
 
 Petitioner NGO ‘Gene Campaign’ through advocate Prashant Bhushan red-flagged the ASG’s proposal. Bhushan recounted the experience of GM rice in Texas, US, which contaminated longgrained rice production, leading to a ban on its import by EU countries and Russia.
 
 “The stage today is not closed greenhouse experimentation on growing GM mustard. If the government permits greenhouse experimentation, we have no problem, But the moment it is cultivated in open field, one does not know what effect it will have on nearly 5,000 indigenous varieties of mustard grown in India. The   Engineering Approval Committee (of the government) is riddled with conflict of interest and cannot be trusted for an independent evaluation of the grave risk posed by GM mustard,” Bhushan said.
 
 Irked by Bhushan’s detailed presentation on GM mustard’s threat on the environment and India as a biodiversity centre for mustard, Mehta said, “Let the scientists involved in the research file an affidavit giving technical data rather than an advocate briefing about it.”
