BENGALURU: A day after CM   claimed that he has proof about the alleged ‘secret pact’ between JD(S) and BJP, former Prime Minister H D   alleged that Siddaramaiah had met   with an intention to join BJP when   did not make him the opposition leader in 2008. 

 
 Gowda on Monday said it was only after this that the then AICC president   replaced Mallikarjun M Kharge with Siddaramaiah as the opposition leader. “I knew all this but I chose to remain silent as I did not see the necessity to speak about it,’’ Gowda said. 
 
 By telling people that BJP and JD(S) have an understanding, Siddaramaiah is trying to create confusion among voters, he said.
 
 
 
 In a bid to woo Telugu voters in Karnataka, the JD(S) has announced that if voted to power, it will construct a Telangana Bhavan in Bengaluru. 
 
 According to a press release by the Kannada Rastra Telangana Association, JD(S) manifesto committee chairman PGR Sindhia gave this assurance to them at a meeting they had in   assembly constituency in Bidar on Monday. 
 
 Sindhia is the JD(S) candidate from Basava Kalyan constituency. Sindhia said the promise of constructing a Telangana Bhavan would be fulfilled immediately after the party comes into power.
