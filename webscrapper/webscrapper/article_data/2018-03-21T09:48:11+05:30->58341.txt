LUCKNOW: A day after   president Rahul Gandhi’s public nudge to the veterans to step aside, they have started leaving their positions on their own. Following Shantaram Naik's resignation from the post of   chief, saying that he did so on Rahul’s advice, UP Congress chief   announced his resignation late on Tuesday.

 
 With speculation swirling that Gujarat PCC chief Bharatsinh Solanki might also follow suit, the party appeared to be looking at a potential spate of resignations. Rahul in his speech had made clear that the time had come for veterans to leave the centre stage.
 
 So, just three days before crucial voting in the state for   polls, Babbar stepped down. Although there was no official word about it, Congress sources told TOI that his resignation was yet to be accepted and he would continue to hold the post till the time his successor took over.
 
 Sources said there were four front-runners for the key post, but the party was likely to project a Brahmin face to counter BJP’s moves to consolidate non-Yadav OBC and non-Jatav dalit vote bank.
 
 Although Babbar was not available for comment, his cryptic tweet, quoting noted poet Kedarnath Singh acted as a giveaway about his move. “Aaj ghar main ghusa toh ajeeb drishya tha, suniye — mere bistar ne kaha — yeh raha mera isteefa (resignation), main apne kapaas ke bheetar jaana chahta hoon (Today when i reached home, my bed offered its resignation, telling me it wants to go back to its original self (turn into cotton),” the quoted lines from the Jnanpith Award winner said.
