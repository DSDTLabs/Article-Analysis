CHENNAI: After three years of construction, an additional bridge across the Cooum in Aminjikarai has been opened for traffic. 

 The Rs 8crore project was started in early 2014 and was to be completed in 18 months but got delayed due to resistance by land grabbers.
 
 Officials say the bridge and the two new flyovers — one leading from   to   and the other from   to   — will help clear snarls from Koyambedu to Chennai Central. Commuters, however, have a different take, saying the new three-lane link has only widened a 60-metre stretch across the Cooum. Bottlenecks remain in the 1-km stretch till Pachaiyappa's College, which is further narrowed by encroachments at Aminjikarai market.
 
 The stretch from the bridge till Anna Arch is also harrowing for pedestrians. “Although the junction at Anna Arch is safe, walking till there from either side is a nightmare,” said N Gopakumar, a resident of SBI officers’ colony, Arumbakkam. Footpaths are either absent because buildings have encroached on them or are barely visible beneath temporary stalls. “Most of us walk on the road,” he added. Traffic police, too, acknowledge that pedestrian movement slows traffic from the arch all the way to Aminjikarai market. 
 
 In the meantime, officials in the metro wing of the state highways department said work will soon begin to demolish the old bridge adjacent to the new one as it has weakened over the years. “It will make way for a four-lane bridge. In all, we will have ten lanes,” an official said.
