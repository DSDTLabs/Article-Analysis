MUMBAI: More   in Mumbai chose to bring in   at home or at   than in bars and restaurants. While consumption of beer and country liquor increased on these festive days, the more expensive India-made foreign liquor ( ) got a thumbs down, reveal excise department statistics for December. 

 Besides, the eleventh-hour permission from the department to host private parties at bars, clubs and on society lawns within 500 mt of highways did not translate into significant attendance. Organizers could not advertise their packages and ensure more bookings for such parties, said a hotelier.
 
 Industry experts blame the drop in footfall to demonetisation, last-minute withdrawal of the ban on liquor licences for events near highways and Christmas and New Year falling on weekends that spurred many to head to tourist spots.
 
 "By the time permission for parties along highways was given, many had moved out of the city. We saw more orders for home delivery this time than rush for party bookings," said a hotelier.
 
  An excise department official said currently liquor shops make up 90% of sales compared with the 10% that bars and hotels do, indicating that people largely prefer to drink and party at home. 
 
 More expensive wines, too, show a marginal increase across the metropolitan region, said hoteliers. Consumption of IMFL showed an increase only in the suburbs and that too marginally while in the other areas, it has declined. Experts say recent reports of adulteration highlighted by the excise department have prompted people to switch to wine, though it is more expensive than IMFL.
 
 The excise department's revenue has gone up following a rise in taxes on liquor last year. "But even the increase is not up to expectationOur monthly average shows that we have to score at least 8% to 9% growth over the same month last year but it's just 2.5% to 3%," said a source.
