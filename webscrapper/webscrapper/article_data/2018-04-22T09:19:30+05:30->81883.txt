After you feel a buzz in your pocket or see a flash on your phone, your attention is already fractured.

 Since it can take close to 25 minutes to get back on track after a distraction, according to researchers who study productivity, this is obviously a recipe for a distracted day where not much gets done.
 
 Fortunately, we are learning better ways to handle smartphone notifications, according to research being conducted at  's Center for Advanced Hindsight, which was presented by senior behavioural researcher   at a recent   conference.
 
 Fitz and collaborators have found that batching notifications into sets that participants receive three times a day makes them happier, less stressed, feeling more productive, and more in control. That works better than getting notifications once every hour, or even blocking them completely. "Turning them off doesn't really work," Fitz said. "But we can (get notifications) in a smarter way."
 
 He says the ideal system would be context-aware, to recognise the best times for a person to get a batch of notifications and might allow certain particularly important notifications through.
