MOTIHARI: The termination of two assistant professors— Prof Amit Kumar Ranjan and Prof Shashikant Ray—of Mahatma Gandhi Central University (MGCU) in Motihari on Septembers 28 has generated much heat on and outside the campus on September 29. 

 While students sat on a dharna terming the action as illegal and deliberate, the two teachers who were axed, sat on a daylong hunger strike at the university gate. They alleged that the vice chancellor is a ‘regionalist’. 
 
 Sources in the university said Prof Ray in an FIR lodged on Saturday claimed that he was be threatened to withdraw the agitation by the university management or else he will be killed. The agitating students said both the teachers and the students are being discriminated on the basis of region. “We know that Prof Amit and Prof Shashikant were terminated without citing any reason and no show-cause notice was served to them. The move was taken only a month before their probation was about to end only because they are from Bihar. We have come to know that two students have also been terminated and it is intolerable,” said the agitating students. 
 
 Prof Shashikant and Prof Amit even alleged that VC Arvind Agarwal was targeting the Biharis which was not acceptable. 
 
 When contacted the VC said, “There was no truth in the allegation being levelled against him on anyone in the management. The executive council took the decision. It was a mere coincidence that all those terminated belong to Bihar,” he said.
