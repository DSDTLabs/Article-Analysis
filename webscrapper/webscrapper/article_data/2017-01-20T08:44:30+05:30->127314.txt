SURAT: The world’s largest diamond cutting and polishing industry in Surat is in the spotlight, but for wrong reasons. Four persons to die in the recent hooch tragedy and a few others who are in hospital after consuming spurious liquor belong to the diamond industry.

 Pradip Haresh Vaid, Kirtisinh Sardarsinh Waghela, Prakash Thakore and   had died in the last three days after consuming spurious liquor mixed with poisonous methanol. The four were employed as diamond workers in the units located in  , where they lived. 
 
 Policemen are visiting the diamond units at Katargam and Varachha to collect details about diamond workers who haven’t reported to duty for the past four days. Policemen on Thursday visited a few factories in Katargam’s   Ni Wadi. Most of the small units are open, but the presence of the workers is less due to the impact of demonetization and shortage of new currency.
 
 “We are gathering details about diamond workers. After four deaths of diamond workers in hooch tragedy, we want to be sure that nobody is left out without treatment. If we get details about the workers who have not reported to duty, we can visit them and check their status. Till now, we have found nothing,” said a police officer.
 
 For the last many years, big diamond houses at Katargam and Varachha have dissuaded their workers from consuming liquor or chewing tobacco. In most of these companies, the workers are made to pay fine for keeping tobacco in their pockets. 
 
 “It is surprising that some diamond workers have taken to alcoholism. Most of the diamond workers chew ‘mava’ made of supari and tobacco, but we never thought they could take to alcoholism. It is time diamond association and industry leaders came together to create awareness about health risks among the workers should they consume liquor and tobacco,” said former president of   Pravin Nanavaty.
