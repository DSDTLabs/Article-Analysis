NEW DELHI: There is a   for every   person in Delhi now, with the vehicular count going beyond the one-crore mark in the capital. In 2016-17, the city saw a growth of nearly 7% in vehicles compared to 2015-16, states Economic Survey of Delhi.

 The survey reveals that Delhiites’ dependence on private transport increased in 2016-17 while the number of people using public transport buses declined during the same period. 
 
 Following the survey data, it may be inferred that a sizeable number of population has moved from public transport to two-wheelers. Hovering around 66 lakhs, two-wheelers now constitute 63.6% of all vehicles in the city. The category saw an 8.2% growth in 2016-17 in comparison to 2015-16. The number of cars, at 31.5 lakhs, recorded a growth rate of 5.6%.
 
 Though the overall growth rate of vehicles in Delhi slowed down in 2016-17, the number of vehicles per 1,000 population has still gone up. The number of vehicles grew by nearly 7%, less than the growth rate of nearly 10% witnessed in 2015-16. The number of vehicles per 1,000 population, however, grew from 530 in 2015-16 to 556 in 2016-17.
 
 Para-transit too witnessed a significant growth in 2016-17. The number of taxis has grown by 29.9% with nearly 1.2 lakh registered cabs in 2016-17 over 91,073 in 2015-16. The count of autos, however, remained static, hovering around one lakh, due to a cap on their number. 
 
 While the metro, despite a dip following the fare hike, has emerged as the backbone of public transport in Delhi, the survey reveals that vehicles meant for last-mile connectivity has seen an increase. The number of other passenger vehicles, including   and maxi cabs, has grown by 838.4%, as their numbers have risen from just 6,368 in 2015-16 to 59,759 in 2016-17. A major reason behind this jump is that e-rickshaws are now being registered with the transport department.
 
 Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), on the other hand, has seen a dip not only in the ridership but also in the number of buses in its fleet. From 46.8 lakh passengers in 2012-13, the number has come down to 31.5 lakhs in 2016-17. The number of DTC buses on road has also come down to 3,547 in 2016-17 from 3,817 in 2015-16. 
 
 In terms of fleet utilisation, 1,757 cluster buses are doing much better at 98.1% compared to Delhi Transport Corporation ’s 85.1%.
