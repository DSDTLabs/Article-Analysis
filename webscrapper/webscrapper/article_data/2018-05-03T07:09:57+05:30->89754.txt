KARWAR: The Indian   Station (ICGS) here rescued nine   in the   off the   on Tuesday night.

 The ICGS control room received information from the fisheries department in Kochi regarding fishing boat, St Mary’s, in distress off Karwar due to engine failure. 
 
 ICGS Karwar contacted the boat owner to ascertain its position and tried to confirm it with the crew and Master of the vessel. On confirmation of distress, C-420, an ICGS rescue boat in the area, was directed to render assistance.
 
 The rescue ship reached the spot where nine crew members of St. Mary’s had been stranded for two days and were running out of food and water. The rescue team and technical crew boarded the boat and found that the engine crank shaft bearing was damaged. The technical staff found that the boat could not be repaired mid-sea due to non-availability of spares.
 
 When the search for another fishing boat in the area for assistance was futile, the rescue team decided to bring it to shore. The boat was towed to Karwar port despite adverse weather conditions and high swell due to strong winds.
 
 The boat was anchored off Karwar port anchorage area. The port officer was requested to allow the boat to come inside for repairs and other logistical support and this was done the same night.
