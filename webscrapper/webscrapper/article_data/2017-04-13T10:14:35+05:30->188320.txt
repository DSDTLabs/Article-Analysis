PUNE: Drivers jumping  , beware. You now risk losing your licence too. 

 The traffic police has launched a special all-out campaign against those who are caught driving through a junction when the signal is red. 
 
 Driving licences of all offenders are being immediately confiscated by the police on the spot. Police would then send the licences to the   (RTO), recommending an immediate three-month suspension.
 
 The campaign, which was started on Tuesday, is likely to continue over the next few days and follows close on the heels of an operation against those using cellphones while driving. Driving through a traffic signal when it is red is among the most dangerous but most common offences in the city. The driver not only risks losing his own life but also endangers other law-abiding motorists or pedestrians on the road.
 
 While most offenders tend to 'speed through' to avoid collision with other road users, this pattern increases the risk of serious injuries for all involved, traffic experts say. 
 
 In Pune, particularly, the tendency to jump a traffic signal is more among two-wheeler users. While many offenders say they were tempted to break the rule because they didn't see a police personnel, other explain that they were simply towing the line of the vehicle ahead. 
 
 Sending a stern message to such violators is among the main objectives of the campaign, deputy commissioner of police (traffic)   said. 
 
 "Breaking the traffic signal rule even once is enough ground for the licence to be revoked, and we hope this will be enough deterrence for those who think they can get away with it. We want everyone to be warned that there are serious consequences for violating traffic laws," he said.
 
 Random placement of traffic police personnel at different hours of the day can actually reduce the tendency, traffic expert   said.
