SURAT: Over 175 city bus drivers and conductors went on a flash strike on Tuesday morning to   against deduction of provident fund from their salaries.   officials and the contractor told them it was mandatory under the law, subsequent to which they withdrew their agitation. The protest lasted for over an hour. 

 The drivers and conductors draw a monthly salary of Rs9,000 from   which has a contract with the civic body to operate the city bus service. SMC deducts PF from each personâ€™s salary as stipulated by the law but the staff failed to understand this. The staff said they want their full monthly salaries without deductions. However, SMC officials were able to convince them.
