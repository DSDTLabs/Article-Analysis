GUWAHATI: The Congress has described the recent arrest of three persons in Jorhat for 'hurting  ' by   as condemnable and accused the   of trying create   through such acts. 

 Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Debabrata Saikia said before BJP came to power, there was no such arrest in the state for carrying beef. "Jorhat is the last capital of Ahom kingdom and is known for  . The arrests for carrying beef have not only interfered with the constitutional rights of the persons, but has also exposed a conspiracy to create disharmony among the Hindus and the Muslims. Sonowal came to power with the promise of improving the standard of living of people in the state. But such acts of arresting persons for carrying beef speaks otherwise," said Saikia. 
 
 He added that it is the fundamental right of a person to choose what to eat and nobody should interfere in it. Saikia said it is unfortunate that Hindutva forces in Assam are trying to create communal tension centering around beef. "This is a land of Srimanta Sankardev and Azan Fakir. Our demand is that the government should ensure that there is no repeat of the Jorhat incident," added Saikia. 
 
 Three persons belonging to the minority community, including a minor, were arrested on Wednesday on charges of 'hurting the religious sentiments' by carrying beef. This is possibly the first time in Assam that someone has been arrested on such a charge. 
 
 The two adults - Shah Jamal Haque and   - are labourers from Dhubri. They have been remanded in judicial custody. The minor was sent to a juvenile rehabilitation centre.
