LUDHIANA: Once again, the new academic session started in government primary schools without books. While some schools arranged old syllabus books, others made students study the basic concepts.

 The 2018-19 academic session started on Tuesday. The students were excited to attend new classes, but were left disappointed on finding they will not get their books. In the previous session, books were given to students three or two months before final examination. The students managed by borrowing old books. The practice cannot be followed this year as the syllabus has changed.
 
 Anu Rani, a Class IV student of Government Primary School, Sukhdev Nagar, said, “I was looking forward to come to school on the first day and get new books. But our teachers made us study the syllabus of the previous class.” 
 
 At Government Primary School, Indrapuri, teachers borrowed books from old students. 
 
 In charge of Government Primary School, Sukhdev Nagar, Sukhdhir Sekhon said, “The department should provide books at least a week before the start of the new session. This year, many books changed, so we cannot use the old ones.” 
 
 At Government Primary School, Sekhewal, students were seen studying from the old, torn books. A student said, “I was eager to see my new books. But we were given old books with frayed pages. Last year too, we studied from borrowed books.”
 
 The   has sent only one book of Class IV so far to the local officials. Block primary education officer (BPEO Mangat-II) Asha Rani said, “For primary classes, we have received only one book of Hindi for Class IV so far. Only nine books of upper primary classes have come. The books will be provided to schools when board sends of all subjects.”
