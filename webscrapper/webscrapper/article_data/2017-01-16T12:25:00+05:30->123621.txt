PANAJI: With the announcement of   and  , Congress appears to have slammed the doors on a pre-poll alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).   (AICC) on Sunday announced seven more candidates for the February 4 state  , in addition to the 27 candidates announced earlier.

 Congress continued to maintain that a decision on an alliance with Goa Forward Party (GFP) and United Goans Party (UGP) is yet to be taken and that a clear picture would emerge on January 17, after the visit of AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh.
 
 NCP had demanded four seats, but after the exit of two of its main candidates, the party had hoped to bag Vasco and Benaulim for party president Jose Philip D’Souza and Churchill Alemao respectively. With Congress announcing Saifulla Khan from Vasco constituency and Edwin Barretto from Benaulim constituency as their candidates for next month’s polls, sources said a strong message appears to have been sent to the NCP.
 
 “The door is shut now for NCP,” said AICC secretary Girish Chodankar, while confirming the seven candidates. The other candidates finalized by AICC include Vijay Bhike for Mapusa, Joseph Sequeira for Calangute, Tony Fernandes for Santa Cruz, Xavier Fialho for Cumbharjua and Santosh Sawant for Mayem.
 
 Congress is unlikely to field a candidate in Panaji constituency and is expected to support former Congressman Atanasio Monserrate alias Babush who has floated his own party - UGP. Sources also stated that the party will support independent candidate Govind Gawde in Priol.
 
 This leaves four more constituencies where Congress is yet to take a call. Candidates from Saligao, Siolim, Fatorda and Porvorim constituencies are yet to be announced, and incidentally, these are seats where Goa Forward Party (GFP) is keen to contest from, albeit with Congress backing.
