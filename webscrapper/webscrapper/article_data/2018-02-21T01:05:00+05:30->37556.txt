Tuticorin: Terming the AIADMK a puppet in the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Tuesday exhorted the party cadre to pool in the maximum number of anti-BJP votes to save Tamil Nadu and India.

 Addressing a public meeting at the valedictory function of the party’s 22nd state conference, Yechury recalled deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam’s admission that it was the PM who pressed for the unification of the two AIADMK factions and also asked him to accept a cabinet position. Stating that the CPI(M) would decide on its tactics to defeat the BJP at the 22nd party congress at Hyderabad in April, he said that defeat of BJP and its allies like AIADMK was necessary to save the state and the country. “This (BJP) government will go down as the most corrupt government in the history of India,” he said.
 
 Yechury wondered how the BJP government did not have funds for waiving loans obtained by farmers across India for Rs 80,000 crore, but had the money and the heart to waive loans obtained by the corporate friends of Modi to the tune of Rs 2 lakh crore over the last four years. “This is the criminal nature of this government,” he stated.
 
 Ridiculing some of the key election assurances made by Modi in 2014, he said that the BJP government had created joblessness instead of new jobs. It was the primary reason behind the suicide of over 36,000 farmers due to stress. The poor were becoming poorer while the rich were turning richer, he said.
