   The latest plan in the limelight is a proposal to install a telescope – quite like the one at Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco. It involves constructing a small structure, at the cross road that heads to Nandi Bull Temple, atop Chamundi Hills, where visitors who spend time soaking in all they can see of Mysuru can get a better view.  While the authorities wait for a nod from the forest department for clearance, they are sceptical about getting the required permission. As this is hardly the first time a proposal has come up to add to the tourist attraction of this hill.          In 2015, it was decided to have cable facilities at Chamundi Hills – quite on the lines Hong Kong cable car. But this invited a strong opposition from environmentalists as the project could destroy the rich flora and fauna of the hills. Online campaigns, protests and even a candle-light march was taken out by city NGOs and like-minded parties to save Chamundi Hills. The project was shelved.     In 2014, it was decided to construct a steel canopy over 1,000 footsteps and toilets at the foothills of Chamundi Hills. But it did not materialize following public outcry against the construction due to environmental concerns and the project was dropped.     There was a stiff opposition against the construction of a multi-level parking lot and a multi-storey shopping complex recently. However, work on this has begun. Whether the project will be completed is something we will need to wait and see.     : The proposal to make a four-lane approach road on Chamundi Hills is yet to get a green signal from the concerned authorities.
