LUDHIANA: Two rape cases were reported in the city on Tuesday. 

 A 27-year-old woman told the police, “I met  , 30, a resident of Mayapuri, in 2017, when my marriage was going through a rough patch. As our friendship grew, he promised to marry me and take care of my two children. He would visit my house in the absence of my husband. In December 2017, he came to my house and asked for a cold drink. After serving him a beverage, I went to complete my household chores.”
 
 A few minutes later, Abhishek asked her to share the beverage. “As soon as I had the soft drink, which he had spiked, I lost consciousness. He then raped me and clicked my pictures. Threatening to show the pictures to my family, he violated me again. Scared, I did not speak a word about it. But days later, I told my husband about it. When my husband confronted Abhishek, he sent the pictures to my family,” she added. 
 
 Investigating officer assistant sub-inspector Des Raj said a case under sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC has been registered against Abhishek. 
 
 In the other case, police booked a 22-year-old youth for raping a Class X girl.
 
 The 14-year-old said in her complaint, “Rahul Kumar would stalk me on my way to school. Somehow, he got my mobile phone number and started calling me. In August 2017, when I was going to school, he kidnapped me and raped me at his relative’s place. Threatening to kill my father, he asked me not to breathe a word about the incident. After he sexually assaulted me again, I told my parents about it.” 
 
 Investigating officer ASI   said a case has been registered against the   resident, who worked as a driver.
