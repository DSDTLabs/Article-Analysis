CHANDIGARH: The Dappar-Chandigarh double lane track would be open for rail traffic from Thursday, enabling trains to ply at a speed of 110kmph and cut travel time from 5 minutes to 7 minutes. 

 Chief commissioner of railway safety (CCRS) S K   on Wednesday gave the clearance certificate to the 23-km track after conducting a daylong inspection. 
 
 At present, Shatabdi is running at a speed of 105kmph between   and Chandigarh, while other trains ply at 100kmph. 
 
 Officials said the major benefit to passengers will be that there will be no need to halt trains at   or   to get signals, as there are two lanes for the movement of traffic. Officials said there will be no traffic congestion on this line. Pathak told TOI he has given the fitness certificate to the division for running the trains at a speed of 110kmp, which will be implemented for all trains plying from the Chandigarh railway station from Thursday. He said he conducted the trial run at a speed of 120kmph between Chandigarh and Dappar in a special coach that had oscillation monitoring system for detection of track defects. He said he found teething problems in some areas, which the division will get repaired in the next 20 to 25 hours for the smooth movement of trains. He also said there is requirement of modifications in the yard.
