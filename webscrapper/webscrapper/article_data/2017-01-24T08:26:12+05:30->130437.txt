HYDERABAD: The   has given the   (LoP) to start  , besides increasing seats in some medical colleges for the year 2017-18.

 These new PG medical courses have been allotted to city-based autonomous   (three seats in MD microbiology), Kamineni Academy of Medical Sciences and Research Center (three seats each in MD Physiology, MD Biochemistry, MS Anatomy and MD Pharmacology).
 
 An increase in intake has been allowed for Bhaskar Medical College (from one to two in MS Opthalmology) and Prathima College of Medical Sciences (PIMS), Karimnagar, (from two to six seats in MD Anaesthesia) from 2017-18.
 
 While the new PG medical seats are set to benefit scores of medicos who cleared the NEET PG medical entrance test last month, Telangana Junior Doctors' Association (TJU DA) has been cautious in its reaction.This is because the LoP to start a new PG medical course or increase in seats intake in a medical college often does not automatically guarantee recognition from Medical Council of India. “There are several PG medical colleges from where medicos have passed out, but are unable to practice as their courses are yet to be recognised by the Medical Council of India.Initially, the Union health ministry had given its nod to these courses by according LoP,“ said Dr G Srinivas, state president, TJUDA.
 
 He pointed out that medicos passing out from their PG medical colle ges cannot practice their speciality without registering their degrees with State Medical Council. “The state medical council always insists on recognition of that particular course by the MCI before they can register the degrees of the medicos as per rule,“ he said. For instance, PIMS was granted LoP to start a two-year diploma in child health (DCH) PG course in 2009, but it is yet to get MCI's recognition. As reported in these columns earlier, six batches of PG medicos, who have passed out of the DCH course from this college, are not able to practice as paediatricians as their certificates are not recognised.
