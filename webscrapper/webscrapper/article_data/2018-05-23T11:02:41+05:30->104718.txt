The wardens walk out with Pihu and tell Raman and Ishita that Pihu will soon forget the time she has spent in the juvenile home. 

 Ishita is happy to see Pihu and gives her favourite ladoos. But Raman takes the ladoos and throws them away and says that Ishita must have mixed poison in it. Pihu cries as Raman fights with Ishita and later Raman drags Pihu away. 
 
 Raman then tells Pihu that Ishita killed her brother   and Ishita tries stopping Raman. She says that Pihu is a young girl but Raman still tells her everything. At the temple, the pandit asks for Pihu's mother but Madhu and Santoshi both say that she is dead for them. Later, Bala confronts Madhu but she loses her calm and tells him that Ishita did not have to kill Adi as there were other ways to stop him. 
 
 Ishita goes into the flashback as she remembers when she arrived near Adi's funeral pyre, Raman scolded her and told her to stay away from his son. 
 
 Raman then accused Ishita of killing his son and said that she has proved that she is not Adi and  's mother. He then blamed her that she went to jail for Pihu as she is her own child but killed Adi. Even Shagun blames Ishita for killing Adi and says that she made a huge mistake as she trusted Ishita with her children.
 
 Ishita tells Raman that Pihu is her child and he cannot take her away from her. But Raman tells her that Pihu will stay with him and his family. Ishita convinces Pihu to go with Raman as she will always be with her.
