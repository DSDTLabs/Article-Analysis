BENGALURU: Polling for the high-stakes   assembly elections got underway this morning under a thick security blanket.

 In what is projected as a tight race, voting is being held in 222 out of 224 seats in a three-cornered contest among the ruling Congress, the   and former prime minister H D  's JD(S).
 
  
  
 The   yesterday deferred the polls for the   constituency to May 28 after a massive row erupted over a large number of voter ID cards being found in an apartment.
 
  
  
  
 Election for the   seat in Bengaluru was countermanded following the death of BJP candidate and sitting MLA B N Vijaykumar.
 
 
  
  
 
  Over 2,600 candidates are in the fray-- more than 2400 men and and over 200 women.
 
  
  
  The total voters including service electors according to the 2018 final rolls are 5,06,90,538, of whom 2,56,75,579 male voters, 2,50,09,904 female and 5,055 transgender voters.
  
 Officials said 58,008 polling stations have been set up across the state, of which 12002 have been designated as "critical", with over 3,50,000 polling personnel on duty.
 
  
  
  Police have made elaborate security arrangements for the smooth conduct of polls that will go on till 6 pm. Counting of votes will take place on May 15.
 
 
 "82,157 people have been deployed for poll duty that include DSPs, home guards and civil defence, and forest guards and watchers," Karnataka DGP Neelamani N Raju said.
 
  
  
 This also includes about 7,500 personnel from states like Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtram Chattisgarh, Kerala and Goa, she said, adding, central forces have been deployed.
 
 The current polls are seen as one of the most complex the state had ever witnessed with many imponderables that have left most analysts to bet on a fractured mandate in a cliffhanger.
 
 One among the interesting aspects of this election is four candidates who have served as chief minister of Karnataka.
