NEW DELHI:   is likely to be the central theme at the two-day national executive of  , beginning on Friday, as the party will once again showcase its concerted efforts to weed out corruption, a promise it had made in the run-up to the 2014 general elections.

 Top BJP leaders, including PM   and party chief  , will be present during the national meet to work on a roadmap to sustain their anti-graft agenda involving the party organisation.
 
 “The political resolution will have a comprehensive plan about containing corruption with a message to office-bearers seeking their active participation,” said a senior functionary.
 
 The meet is taking place ahead of the assembly polls in five states, including UP, for which the party has already resolved to make demonetisation and surgical strikes on Pakistan-sponsored terror pads across the LoC as major poll issues highlighting zero tolerance of the government towards corruption and its commitment to national security.
