CHENNAI: A 60-year-old   died on Thursday, 17 days after he consumed poison outside a court hall, despondent at a ruling against him in a  .

 Madurantakam police inspector   said A Ganapathy, of   near Madurantakam, 88 km from Chennai, ingested poison on March 7, shortly after the court passed an order in favour of his neighbour who staked claim to land the farmer lived on.
 
 Doctors at  , who put Ganapathy in critical care, said he failed to respond to treatment.
 
 Ganapathy’s son Parvatha Kumar on Thursday lodged a complaint with the Madurantakam police, demanding that they register a case of abetment to suicide against the neighbour, V Durairaj, 55.
 
 Police had registered a case of attempted suicide under IPC Section 309 but changed it to an unnatural death under CrPC Section 174 and started an investigation.
 
 “We will press further charges if our probe shows there was abetment to suicide in Ganapathy’s case,” an investigating officer said.
 
 He said Ganapathy lived in a house on a little less than 4,000sqft of land outside Puliyaranagkottai village.
 
 “Durairaj claimed the land and as his,” the officer said. “He produced documents pertaining to the property in court, which in 2014 asked Ganapathy to move out.”
 
 Ganapathy refused to vacate and officials evicted him on March 4. “He returned to the court and, disappointed when it upheld the judgment, he committed suicide,” the officer said.
