GAYA: Buddhism is gaining popularity in China and a number of Chinese are adopting Buddhist ways of life, said Buddhist spiritual leader the Dalai Lama on Monday. 

 Making a brief reference to the Chinese religious/spiritual scenario, the Dalai Lama said propagation of religion continues to be difficult and religiously inclined people, including nuns, from mainland China were not being allowed to visit  . The all important reference to China was made by him on the second day of his special sermon delivery programme at   in  .
 
 The Dalai Lama is believed to have considerably softened his stand vis-à-vis China and favours a permanent solution to the age-old Tibetan problem in the form of autonomy for Tibetans. Unlike him, some Tibetan groups demand total freedom for Tibet and end of any kind of Chinese interference in their affairs.
 
 Besides making a brief but meaningful reference to the situation in China, the Buddhist icon explained the virtues of peace, non-violence and compassion, the core values of Buddhist philosophy. His special sermon would end on Wednesday.
