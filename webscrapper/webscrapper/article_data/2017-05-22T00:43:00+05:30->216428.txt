Mumbai: Cutting of trees for the Metro-III project has begun in earnest. Less than two days after the Supreme Court granted liberty to citizens to approach a committee to be nominated by the Bombay high court with their grievances,   for nearly all Metro   began cutting down trees.

  Metro-III is a 33.5km underground line running between Colaba-Bandra-Seepz (Andheri), with 27 stations.
 
 Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Ltd said there is no stay on the cutting of trees.
 
 On Sunday, activists visited nearly all Metro station spots to check the status of the trees and were shocked to see that workers had begun chopping them down.
 
 “At  , hardly a handful of trees are left. They have cleared the entire garden,” said Zoru Bathena, a citizen activist. “At Cuffe Parade, 120 trees had been cut in February. Now, we find that more trees have been cut.”
 
 Citizens said they have no objection to work being carried out at 10 of the 27 proposed Metro station sites as there are no trees there now. These include Cuffe Parade, CST, Kalbadevi, Girgaum, area near Siddhivinayak temple, Dharavi, Santacruz, airport, Marol and MIDC.
 
 At Dharavi, though 50 trees in the area have been marked for the Metro station, they are not for cutting them down. “This is really heartening. We want to tell the committee that this is how it must be done at other stations too. We hope we will be able to save some trees,” said Bathena.
