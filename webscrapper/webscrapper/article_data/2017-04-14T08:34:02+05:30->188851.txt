PATIALA: Vice-president of the Punjab unit of AAP Paramjit Singh Kainth has written to party supremo  , urging him to celebrate the 126th birth anniversary of Bhim Rao Ambedkar in Delhi and Punjab on a big scale on Friday. 

 He claimed that nine of AAP’s 20 MLAs in Punjab belonged to the SC community but neither those legislators nor the party had any fair intentions to celebrate the event.
 
 The ruling   is all set to celebrate the birth anniversary of Ambedkar by organizing a state-level function in  . However, AAP MLA and leader of opposition H S Phoolka claimed that the party had left the decision to its local legislators and district coordinators to observe the event in their own areas.
 
 In his letter to Kejriwal, Kainth mentioned, “I am of the opinion that our party should appreciate and voice our gratitude for Ambedkar as April 14 marks the 126th birth anniversary of this great man. Our party, which has majority of MLAs and MPs belonging to the SC community in Punjab, has been unable to express its gratitude and appreciation for Ambedkar.”
 
 Speaking to TOI over phone, Kainth said, “Our MLAs, MPs and leaders, especially those belonging to the SC community, have let down our community and have been unable to make the masses aware about their empowerment. Leaders have completely ignored celebrating the birth anniversary of such a visionary. Many AAP leaders in Punjab who had won elections now don’t even bother to take phone calls.”
