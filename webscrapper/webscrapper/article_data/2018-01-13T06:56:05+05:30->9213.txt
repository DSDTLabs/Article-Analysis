BENGALURU: While the   is earnestly making efforts to strengthen its cadre ahead of the assembly polls, the Congress, which was on a mission to turn the mass-based party to a cadre-based organization, is struggling to find its footing in some key parts of the state.

 While the Congress managed to build its cadre in CM Siddaramaiah’s home district Mysuru and some districts of North Karnataka, it is grappling in others, including Bengaluru. “We activated our cadre six months ago, formed booth committees in most constituencies and covered about 70% of the assembly seats with our ‘Mane mane ge Congress’ programme to build our cadre,’’ said KPCC vice-president B L Shankar.
 
 The party has decided to distribute identity cards to boothlevel workers and district officebearers to infuse “pride” in them and motivate them to work for the grand old party.
 
 AICC in-charge secretary  , who is part of the   that has a strong cadre system, gets the credit for building the team in Karnataka in a short time, until he was mired in the solar scam in his mother state.
 
 On the other hand, the BJP under   and   is a well-oiled machine working at two levels. At the recently concluded special meet of leaders with BJP national president Amit Shah, a 19-point agenda was handed out to each of them to be implemented on or before March 10, when the election code of conduct is expected to be in place. “Shah has instructed the BJP state unit to set up an election committee for each of the 224 constituencies, including an office secretary and a social media in-charge for that segment,” party sources said.
 
 Instructions were also given to form WhatsApp groups with a minimum of 100 members for every five booths, that will take the total WhatsApp groups to 10,800 in the state. “The 19-point agenda, if implemented effectively, should provide us a cadre base for the next 30 years,” said a BJP worker.
