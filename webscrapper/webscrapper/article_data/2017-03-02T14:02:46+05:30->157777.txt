The sons of late actress  , locked in a dispute over her sprawling apartment at  , are now fighting to take over her bedroom. Both  , 45, and  , 57, sons of  's most famous mother, have laid claims to the bedroom, saying their 'sentiments' were attached to that particular room.

  
  
 The fight to take over the 3,000 sq ft ground floor house at Embassy Apartments, which comes with an 8,000 sq ft garden, began soon after Nirupa Roy's death in 2004.The dispute landed in court after the death of Nirupa's husband   in November 2015. The property is estimated worth around Rs 100 crore. As per a temporary truce, both brothers occupy two bedrooms each, and have equal rights to common areas such as the hall, kitchen, and the garden. One of the bedrooms occupied by Kiran and his family was used by Nirupa and Kamal Roy, and the brothers now want exclusive access to that part of the house. Kiran moved the high court last year, accusing his elder brother of 'threatening and intimidating' him to gain 'complete control' of the house. The petition, filed through advocate   of MZM Legal, said Nirupa had bequeathed all her properties to Kiran and Kamal Roy in his last will had also named Kiran as the sole owner of the apartment.
 
 Kiran suffered a blow three months ago when the City Civil Court dismissed his application seeking to restrain Yogesh from entering the bedroom. "I stayed with my parents during their last days, when they were tortured by Yogesh and his wife. In my father's Will, which was executed in December 2004, he made me the sole owner of the Nepean Sea Road flat, but allowed my brother and his family to reside there on the condition that they never enter my parents' bedroom," Kiran said.
 
 While Yogesh was not available for comment, his application submitted to the court said the bedroom was bequeathed to him and Kiran had no share in it. He has also mentioned that the keys of the bedroom are with him to ensure his brother didn't 'misuse' it.
