Navi Mumbai: MLA Manda Mhatre on Wednesday said that the state government has decided to hand over to   a 34-acre plot next to Hanuman Nagar slums in   node. 

 This comes amidst demands from locals to close the Turbhe landfill site and Mhatre said the new plot could also be used for dumping. “The state’s approval to transfer the 34-acre plot from the forest department should bring relief to the residents,” said Mhatre.
 
 Civic officials said they were awaiting an official order in this regard but has ruled out the possibility of the existing landfill site being closed. “The acquisition of the land doesn’t mean the Turbhe landfill site will be closed. Instead the site could be used for future projects like developing a disposal plant for construction and demolition waste plant,” said an official.
 
 Meanwhile, if   functionaries are to be believed the developement is nothing but to gain political mileage. 
 
 “In a bid to garner political mileage, the information about the land being transferred does not hold any weight. The said plot is situated close to the the existing landfill site and so how is it going to redress grievances of the residents,” a corporator said, questioning the move.
