KANNUR: Police have named former chairman of   child welfare committee Thomas Joseph Therakam and ex-member   as accused in the Wayanad rape case. Both of them have moved anticipatory bail pleas. A minor girl was allegedly raped by Robin Vadakkancheril (alias  ), former parish vicar of St Sebastian Church, Neendunoki, at Kottiyoor in Kannur.

 According to police, the two were named accused on Wednesday, after the social justice department expelled them, following allegations that they had helped to hush-up the case. With this, the number of accused in the case has increased to 10, which include seven women, of which six are nuns.
 
 Meanwhile, two more nuns, Liz Maria and Anitta, who were named accused in the case, also moved anticipatory bail pleas in Thalassery additional district sessions court. 
 
 The court, which considered a police plea seeking custody of Robin for further interrogation, is likely to issue an order in this regard on Thursday. The court also deferred the order on the anticipatory bail plea of three people from   – gynaecologist Tessy Jose, administrator Ancy Mathew and paediatrician Hyderali – to March 14.
