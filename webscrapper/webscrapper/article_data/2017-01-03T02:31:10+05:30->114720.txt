NEW DELHI:The sports centre at   Hospital, India’s first   facility, has been allotted 0.75 hectares of land for further expansion. The decision was approved by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), following repeated demands by the   authorities.

 “In the past six years, the OPD attendance at our centre has gone up from Rs 2,194 per month in 2010 to Rs 8,260 in 2016. The number of surgeries has also gone up from 51 to 228 every month,” said Dr Deepak Chaudhry, who heads the sports injury centre.
 
 He said additional land will help expand infrastructure to handle increasing patient burden. According to him, the land owning agency, DDA has given in-principle approval for acquiring a vacant plot adjacent to the AIIMS trauma facility.
 
 The sports ministry last year recognised   as a referral centre for the treatment of athletes. On Monday, additional secretary (health) Sanjeeva Kumar inaugurated a bio-feedback digital rehab hip and knee analysis system which can be used to objectively assess the fitness of an athlete post-surgery.
 
 Doctors said they had successfully treated several international sportspersons, mostly prominent wrestlers. “Before this centre came up, many sportspersons, who could not afford to go abroad for specialised treatment, had no other option. Some of them could not get back to sports at all. But the government’s initiative to build this dedicated facility for sportspersons has helped them a lot,” said a senior doctor.
