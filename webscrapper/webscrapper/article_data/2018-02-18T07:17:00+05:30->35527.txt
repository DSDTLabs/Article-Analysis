GURUGRAM: The management of GD Goenka World School, Sohna Road, felicitated Pravesh Kumar, the driver who acted swiftly on January 24 when a mob started pelting stones at a bus, ferrying students of the school, in Bhondsi to protest against the controversial film, ‘Padmaavat’.

 On Saturday, the school celebrated its Sports Day. Principal   said, “The school acknowledged the efforts of the bus driver on Sports Day as many parents turned up for the event and I thought this was the best time to award him. Had it not been for his alertness, there would have been more tragedy on the road that day. More school buses were coming up behind this particular bus on the same route. Pravesh Kumar was given a certificate of recognition, including a cash prize for his efforts.”
 
 Kumar said, “I’m really grateful for this award. I can never forget January 24. I was scared but I wanted to make sure that students on the bus were safe. One of the three teachers ( ) on the bus shouted for everyone to get on the floor. That’s when I knew, I had to act fast. So, I kept driving and drove past the rioters,” said Pravesh Kumar. He had also called up the school authorities to alert them and other school buses.
 
 Chief Minister   had earlier met with the students, bus driver, conductor and attendants who faced the rioters.
