HYDERABAD: With TRS and   training their guns at each other, the new entrant in state politics   is silently wooing leaders and cadre of political parties like Praja Rajyam, YSRCP and   into its fold.

 According to TJS sources, leaders and cadre of   are also in touch with TJS leadership. In the public meeting on Sunday, TJS will spell out the aims and objectives of the political party and it has already formed village committees, comprising of leaders who were/are associated with these political parties in 500 villages.
 
 The TJAC members claimed that leaders from Congress, TRS and   are in touch with TJS leadership. “The formation of village level committees was not done overnight. We have been meeting the farmers, intellectuals, people from all sections of the society, political leaders who have a relatively clean background and family members of   martyrs from last six months. A large number of people said the TRS has failed to fulfil the aspirations and dreams of Telangana people and there was a need for an alternative party to fulfil their dreams,” TJS leader   told TOI.
 
 Though Praja Rajyam party floated by cine actor Chiranjeevi in August 2008 later merged with Congress in August 2011, many of its leaders and cadre could not get deserving posts in Congress, TRS, BJP or other parties.
 
 Lok Satta and YSRCP are almost inactive in Telangana. “The leaders of Praja Rajyam are rearing to work and bring TJS to power. Even leaders from Lok Satta and YSRCP are waiting for an alternate to TRS and Congress. The TJS has come as a god-send opportunity for them to serve the people,” a senior TJAC leader said.
