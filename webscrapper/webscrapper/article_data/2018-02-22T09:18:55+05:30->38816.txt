MARGAO:   failed to keep a clean sheet for the 15th successive game and shared the spoils with   1-1 at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Wednesday.

 
 A 53rd minute strike from Moroccan midfielder Hugo Boumous was a lucky one but good enough to cheer up the hosts. But instead of getting bolder, Goa got complacent, tired legs showed up and familiar mistakes were inevitable.
 
 They played amongst themselves, took risk at the back and, not surprisingly, provided an opening for their opponents after losing the ball. Manuel Arana, formerly with FC Goa, intercepted one such move, made a killer pass and captain Kalu Uche left central defenders gasping for breath in the 82nd minute to grab the equaliser.
 
 It was a killer blow and one that silenced the crowd.
 
 Delhi, instead, had something to cheer. They have now moved up from the bottom with 12 points and vindicated popular belief that they are not as bad as the points table suggests.
