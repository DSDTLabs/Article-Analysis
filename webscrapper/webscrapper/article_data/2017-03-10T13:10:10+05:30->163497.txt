We often hear “Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.” It is probably one of the earliest proverbs we learn and forget equally fast. What makes our memory so short with respect to this is THE NIGHTLIFE. Pubs, bars, parties, theatre, cinema are all very alluring and enchanting. Going early to bed? Oh, so boring!

 Sleep is vital to our good health and well-being throughout life. It has been found that people who sleep late are more likely to eat unhealthy, leaving themselves vulnerable to a host of diseases and chronic conditions like  , obesity,  ,  , stroke and mental health problems. Research indicates that people who sleep late have a higher Body Mass Index (BMI), an indicator of obesity. They tend to make poorer dietary decisions and are also likely to exercise less. Some studies have also shown that people who lack sleep are more likely to be hungry and end up eating more than necessary. Sleeping late is linked to increased intake of fast and junk food. That in turn may lead to obesity. 
 
 As much as going to bed late erodes health, getting a good night’s sleep builds it. Results of a study showed that those who slept for a shorter period of time and went to bed late experienced more repetitive negative thoughts as compared to those who went to bed early and slept for longer periods. Consequential to such negative thoughts are anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder and such other stress disorders and mental ill-health. Poor sleep also increases the risk of dementia as a result of changes occurring in the brain. It therefore follows that not only is going to bed early important, but so is getting a good night’s sleep. 
 
 Let us make Benjamin Franklin proud. Let’s go to bed early, rise early. Let’s all be healthy, wealthy and wise.
