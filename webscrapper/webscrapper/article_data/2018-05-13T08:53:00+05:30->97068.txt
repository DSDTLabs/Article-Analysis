MUMBAI: Special public prosecutor in   case   said on Saturday that PML-N leader  's admission about Pakistan's involvement in the terror plot proved that he was aware of the conspiracy behind the assault but made no efforts for completion of 26/11-related cases in Pakistan during his tenure as PM.

 
 Questioning Sharif for not making efforts for completion of the trial in Pakistan, Nikam said, "The only logical answer is that he was helpless because his government was influenced and was working only under the wishes of Pakistan army and ISI. This disclosure of Sharif would definitely embarrass Pakistan army and ISI on the international platform."
 
 Nikam said Sharif should consider about his personal security as the public prosecutor working in the trial in   was shot dead by terrorists "because he had admitted during our meeting in Pakistan certain facts which were not liked by Pakistani authorities".
