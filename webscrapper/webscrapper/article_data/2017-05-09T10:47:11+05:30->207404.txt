CHENNAI: The I-T raids on sand mining baron   has taken the lid off an organised loot that cuts across party lines ­ including both ruling and opposition parties in Tamil Nadu, information accessed by TOI shows. As per a letter written by the I-T department to state chief secretary   han about 10 days ago suggesting that a vigilance inquiry be initiated against   and his associates, the list of people who regularly received bribe from Reddy include some senior ministers, ruling party MLAs, senior bureaucrats, private secretaries to many mini sters and sitting and former legislators of many opposition parties. The Reddy diaries give graphic details of the money he donated to various political parties, their leaders and ruling party candidates in the 2016 assembly polls. 

 “Shekar Reddy was truly a large-hearted man,“ quipped a senior official in the state bureaucracy. Reddy, a man who meticu lously maintains records of transactions, had jotted down every tranche of money he paid to each beneficiary. In most cases, he also took the signatures of either the beneficiaries or their representatives who received the money on his diary whenever payment was made. The diary has now become a treasure trove of information for the I-T officials. The I-T department, in its letter to  , has mentioned names of more than 40 beneficiaries, who collectively received about Rs 300 crore from Reddy over the past five years, said sources.
 
 “The diary, which contains a mine of information on his money dealings, was well maintained,“ said an I-T official.
 
 I-T officials said it was normal on their part to recommend inquiry by state vigilance agencies whenever public servants belonging to states came under their scanner. “We do such recommendations in almost all cases under section 138 of the   Act. It is for the state government to act or ignore,“ said the official.
