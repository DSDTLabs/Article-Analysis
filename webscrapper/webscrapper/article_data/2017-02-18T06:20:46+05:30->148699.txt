NEW DELHI: Amid reports of a section of farmers not getting the minimum support price for pulses, the government said on Friday it had set up more than 300 procurement centres for arhar dal. Records show that government procurement agencies are buying more than 80% of the pulses sold across mandis in Maharashtra where cash is directly transferred to the farmers' account, and thereby, ending any scope of farmers being exploited by middlemen.In Maharashtra alone,   has set up 122 procurement centres at mandis where arrival is substantial. Some of the private players told TOI that they are not buying much since there is a stock limit. “If you keep more, you will face action. So why will any trader take such risk? How much the government agencies can buy from farmers?“ asked Kamlesh  , managing director of Sainath Enterprises. Even officials admitted that government agencies cannot procure more than 20% of the entire production. The total production of kharif pulses is pegged at 40 lakh tonnes.
“The government should increase the stock limit and en sure that it will give enough time to traders to dispose of the stock when they revise norms.It should also set the maximum price of pulses to protect consumers,“ Patel said.
 
    secretary   held a review meeting on Thursday on government procurement entities, primarily NAFED. “Farmers are getting better price this time than what they were getting last year from private players. Even private players are buying at a comparatively higher price,“ said a government official.
