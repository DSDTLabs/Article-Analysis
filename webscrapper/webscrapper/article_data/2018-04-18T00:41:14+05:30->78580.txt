NEW DELHI: Four days after chief minister   demanded his suspension in the wake of the alleged pilferage of  ,   was on Tuesday transferred to the land and buildings department.

 IAS officer Meena told TOI that he has received the transfer order and made principal secretary in the land and buildings department. A rift had developed between the official and the elected government over the doorstep delivery of ration, which AAP has been pushing forward in recent months.
 
 The AAP government claims that some bureaucrats are opposed to the doorstep delivery of ration scheme. This even led the government to attack Meena on several occasions with Kejriwal demanding his removal as food commissioner in the recently-concluded budget session of Delhi assembly.
 
 On Friday, Kejriwal forwarded a letter from food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal urging him to suspend Meena. In the letter, Hussain mentioned that the food commissioner and a few other bureaucrats were “opposed” to the idea of doorstep delivery of ration.
 
 On March 21, Hussain had asked the department to provide data related to the distribution of ration to beneficiaries using one-time passwords.
 
 The data revealed that one phone number was used to distribute ration among many people, indicating “open theft” of ration. The government also claimed that the OTP system implemented in March was stopped by the food and civil supplies department the day the minister sought the data. This further hinted at the possibility of wrongdoing.
 
 Baijal on Monday ordered a probe into the alleged theft of ration using OTPs.
