PATNA: The state government on Thursday filed a counter affidavit before the Patna high court, stating that it will release Rs 1,100 crore by June 30 this year for disbursal of retiral dues among retired employees of all the state universities. The state has 14 general and four technical as well as agricultural universities.

 The state government also informed the court that it had earlier released Rs 500 crore for payment of retiral dues to university employees. “The universities will have to disburse all dues to the retired employees by July 31 this year,” the government told the court.
 
 The matter came up for hearing before the division bench of chief justice Rajendra Menon and justice Rajeev Ranjan Prasad following a public interest litigation filed by one Krishna Kant Sinha, a retired professor of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar Bihar University (BRABU).
 
 Advocate general Lalit Kishore appeared for the state government before the bench while Sinha was represented by Kishore Kumar Thakur and D K Sinha. Education department principal secretary R K Mahajan was also present in the court during the hearing.
 
 On April 2, the high court had asked the state government to file a counter affidavit detailing steps taken to pay retiral benefits to university employees.
 
 Several litigations are pending in the high court regarding non-payment of retiral dues to university employees in the state.
