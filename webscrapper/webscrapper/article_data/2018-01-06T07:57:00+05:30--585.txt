AHMEDABAD: From his ever expanding sanctum inside the  ,   speaks to his followers even when his utterances for the stage have ended.   — while   as well as teaching — has the pointed seriousness of   contained in the reassuring, lavish light of a May afternoon.

 “I presented Raga Jaijaivanti at   on Thursday,” Panditji told TOI. “This raga has two variants. One has the characteristics of Raga Bageshree and the other has Des qualities. I rendered the former version, which is specialty of Gwalior and Agra Gharanas.” He said he began with slow tempo in Tilwada, which is a musical meter. “In my taans, I gave a taste of the Jaipur Gharana flavour,” Panditji said.
 
 Panditji’s comprehensive outline of his programme shows the intellectual foundation of his performance. But what are the effects of his rendition? To answer that question, we turn to an expert — Manju Mehta, the keeper of the Saptak legacy and a celebrated sitarist. 
 
 “Pandit Kashalkar’s interpretation of Jaijaivanti reflected the grandest hallmarks of the associated gharanas,” Mehta said. “As always, he sang with feeling and was able to connect with the audience — purists as well as those who recognize beauty more easily than raga features.” 
 
 Pandit Kashalkar’s emotional sincerity makes him sound like an artist who is thanking his muse for being unfailingly kind to him. Audiences love that tone of triumph softened by the note of humility. Panditji’s humility was on evidence on Thursday too. “I added Hindol Bahar to the programme because someone had requested me to sing it,” he said. Panditji’s muse, by all accounts, gave him accompaniment for that raga as well.
 
 “Anyone who wants to understand Hindustani music must listen to it for three or four years,” Panditji said. Listening to him for just an hour reveals the scope of rewards of such a study.
