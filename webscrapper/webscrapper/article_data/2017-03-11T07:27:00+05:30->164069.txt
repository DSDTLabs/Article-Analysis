NEW DELHI: Union minister   inaugurated the much-delayed   at   on Friday. Touted as the country’s biggest such plant, it can process 2,000MT of waste and generate up to 24MW energy. “A total of 88MW of energy is being produced in the entire country through waste management mode,” Naidu said. 

 The minister said solid waste management was one of the biggest challenges in the country and the idea of Swachh Bharat Mission couldn’t be achieved until the municipalities go for scientific way of disposal for municipal solid waste. 
 
 Union minister Harsh Vardhan, who was also present at the occasion, said the country produces around 55 million tonnes of solid waste and 38 billion tonnes of sewage and their disposal was a challenge. “The capacity of Narela-Bawana plant would be expanded to process about 4,000MT waste in future,” said Sanjeev Nayyar, mayor of north corporation. North corporation would get a 3% cut from the profits made from the plant. 
 
 The three municipal corporations, NDMC and Delhi Cantonment Board together generate around 9,500MT of waste that’s dumped at the three landfill sites of Ghazipur, Okhla and Narela-Bawana. The existing waste-to-energy plants at Ghazipur and Okhla process 1,500MT and 2,000MT of solid waste and produce 12MW and 16MW of electricity, respectively. 
 
 Once this plant becomes operational, Delhi would have the capacity to use almost 50% of waste to produce electricity daily. The project has been delayed by four years, and National Green Tribunal (NGT) had to intervene and direct the civic body to speed up the process. 
 
 “A dispute over sharing of revenues led to the delay, resulting in the piling up of over four lakh tonnes of garbage that would take at least three years to process,” said a senior corporation official.
