Surat: Tens of thousands of commuters crisscrossing either sides of river Tapi from Sardar Bridge connecting Adajan to Athwalines heaved a sigh of relief with Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) deciding to dedicate the widened portion of the bridge to the city on Sunday.  The widening of Sardar Bridge was taken up at the fag end of 2015 in order to facilitate the vehicular traffic between Adajan and Athwalines. However, the widening of the bridge from Athwalines to Adajan is likely to be completed in June 2018 due to delay in reclaiming private and government lands for the construction.  The foundation stone for widening of Sardar Bridge from the existing four lanes to eight lanes was laid on September 6, 2015. At present Sardar Bridge, which was built in 1991 at a cost of Rs 14.31 crore across Tapi, has a capacity of carrying 11,000 passenger car units (PCU) per hour during the peak time. Once it becomes eight lane, its carrying capacity is expected to cross over 20,000 PCUs per hour. In a day, more than 4.35 lakh people commute from Sardar Bridge on either sides for work. Official sources said the widening work will cost Rs 80.75 crore to the municipal corporation’s exchequer. Presently, the main bridge is 650 metre in length and has flanks of 250 metres at its both sides. The new design will increase the main bridge portion to 700 metre, but reduce the flank portion to 120 metre on both sides. City engineer Bharat Dalal said, “The widened portion of Sardar Bridge from Adajan to Athwalines will be dedicated to the citizens on Sunday. The widening of the bridge’s portion from Athwalines to Adajan will be completed by June 2018.” Asked about the progress in the work of cable-stayed bridge connecting Pal and Athwalines, Dalal said, “The cable-stayed bridge is likely to be completed by June 2018. With this, the vehicular traffic on Sardar Bridge will ease as commuters travelling toward Majuragate and Bhatar will be using the cable-stayed bridge from Adajan.”
