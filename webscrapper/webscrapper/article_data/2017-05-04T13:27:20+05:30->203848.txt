NAGPUR: A 15-year-old minor has taken the daring step of exposing her uncle, who molested her recently and had been raping her 17-year-old sister for two years. The survivor sisters were staying at their maternal grandparents’ place, where the incidents happened. The rape survivor told the cops she kept quiet for so long since the accused threatened to kill her grandparents if she spoke up.

 An offence of rape has been registered by   under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, against 43-year-old Arunsingh Baghel, who was also booked for outraging the modesty on Tuesday. The accused was arrested as soon as the survivor reported the matter at the police station.
 
 Sisters   (names changed) were residing at their grandparents’ place since birth since their parents stayed in the village. Sources said their father died due to some ailment in 2016.
 
 Gita, who recently appeared for her standard X exam, was reportedly being raped since 2015. Baghel, a private employee, had first sexually assaulted Gita when her grandfather suffered a paralytic attack in February 2015. Later, Baghel, father of two children, kept on threatening her and   her whenever he found her alone at home. Baghel used to stay nearby in  , and had recently shifted to Tehsil in Umred, said cops.
 
 “The teenager never shared her grievance with anybody. However, when the accused approached Rani, a student of standard VIII, and held her hand, she resisted and escaped from his grip. Rani immediately narrated the incident to Gita, who eventually told her that she was being sexually exploited with threats of killing their grandparents,” WPSI Suchita Mandwale told TOI. Rani then immediately informed her mother and other relatives about the incidents, said Mandwale.
 
 Gita was taken for   to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) on Wednesday.
