AHMEDABAD: In an important order, Gujarat high court denied certain documents to  , trustee of  , in connection with the rape charges levelled against him by a student last year.

 Patel had sought documents pertaining to medical and scientific evidence that the probe agency had gathered against him. These documents have been cited in the chargesheet, but were not provided to the accused. A trial court in Vadodara turned down his application for a copy of these documents and he approached the high court. Justice J B Pardiwala opined that such a demand on part of the accused was nothing, but a roving inquiry at the charge-framing stage. “I believe that this is something unprecedented,” the judge observed.
 
 The   said Patel raised questions of the type that can be put across during the cross-examination of a witness. This is a mini-trial and not permissible in law. “The applicant wants the court to conduct a mini-trial to ascertain whether he is potent or capable of having sexual intercourse,” the court said. Patel has been claiming that tests revealed that he is impotent.
 
 The HC further said that the prosecution cannot be compelled to furnish any document not forming part of chargesheet forwarded to the court under section 173(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code.
 
 Patel was demanding the documents on the ground that he can seek an expert opinion to confront the state’s expert on their opinion on various reports. 
 
 It would be difficult for him at the last minute to undertake such an exercise. 
 
 Justice Pardiwala said the anxiety is justifiable on the part of the accused, but there is no reason why the trial court would not grant enough time to him for such an exercise during the trial.
