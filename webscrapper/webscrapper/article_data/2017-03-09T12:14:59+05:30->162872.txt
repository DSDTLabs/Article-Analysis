HYDERABAD: With summer round the corner, power sleuths are planning a   on power thieves after witnessing a shocking 537 thefts so far this year.

 Power theft not only cuts into supply but causes frequent voltage fluctuations and shortage. Over Rs 2 crore worth of power had been pilfered in 2016.
 
 Power pilferage and theft contributes to tariff hike as the loss due to theft is passed on to the consumers which means that 10 to 15 per cent of power bills that citizens pay , are for compensating for losses due to theft. As per figures from the officials, a total of 1825 power theft cases were booked in 2016.
 
 In addition to genuine consumers compensating for the loss caused by thieves, transformer failure rate in areas where pilferage is rampant is as high as 15 percent. “Since feeders and transformers are designed for a certain capacity, the extra load added due to pilferage surpasses its capacity resulting in failures. Also, consumers at the tail-end of a particular feeder or power line where pilferage is rampant, often face voltage fluctuations,“ said a senior official working with the TSSPDCL.Out of the approximate 1.75 lakh transformers, about 30,000 transformer failures are recorded each year.
 
 The number of theft cases are meanwhile on the rise, a worrying trend for sleuths is that in addition to the   (from Sultan Bazar to  ), peripheral areas in the city, especially   (from   to  ) are seeing many habitual offenders. “While 14 second-time offenders were nabbed by power sleuths and sent to jail in 2016, this year three have already been booked and sent to jail, the most recent one being a week back,“ said P Nagabhushanam, inspector, Vigilance, Central Circle, Telangana State Southern Power Distribution Company Limited.
