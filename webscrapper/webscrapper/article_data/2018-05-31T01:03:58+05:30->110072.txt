 recently vented out his hatred for   on social media. Coincidentally, his wife,   served him a broccoli salad the same day. Abhishek couldn’t help but post this update on his social media with the picture of the salad and captioned it as, “Talk about #MurphysLaw. Guess the Mrs. read my last post.”

 
 Cashing on Abhishek’s hatred for the veggie, Twitteratis went on to give their opinions on it. The very fact that it was Aishwarya, who made that salad, had some netizens inviting themselves for lunch. There were some who went on to give lessons on the benefits of having broccoli. 
 
 
 Continuing his hate campaign against the green veggie, Abhishek posted a fact about Broccoli about how it was man-made over 2000 years ago with farmers selectively breeding different types of cabbage. He shared the picture and captioned it as, “Why?? Why would anybody do such a thing? WHY??... I mean…. Who even likes broccoli?!?!”
 
 
 To this,   replied by saying, “Mmeeeee!!!” clearly establishing the fact that the leggy lassed actress is fond of the vegetable. 
 Wonder what Abhishek has to say to that.
