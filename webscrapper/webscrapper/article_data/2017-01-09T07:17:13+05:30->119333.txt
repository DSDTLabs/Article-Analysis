NEW DELHI: “A tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye“ cannot be the criteria for handing down punishment to convicts in a civilised society, the high   has said while setting free a former DU student who has already undergone a jail term of over 16 years in two murder cases.

 Jitender, a former   student, who was awarded 30 years jail term by a trial court in a murder case, was directed by the court to remain in prison for the rest of his life in another murder case.
 
 It was clarified by the lower court that the jail term till death would commence on conclusion of the 30-yearterm awarded to the convict, now aged 42.
 
 Referring to the “doctrine of proportionality“, a bench of Justices G S   and   said that it has a “valuable application to the sentencing policy under the Indian criminal jurisprudence“.
 
 “We believe that being a civilised society -a tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye ought not to be the criterion and as such the question of there being acting under any haste in regard to the life imprisonment would not arise; Rather our jurisprudence speaks of the factum of the law courts being slow in that direction and it is in that perspective a reasonable proportion has to be maintained between the heinousness of the crime and the punishment,“ the bench, in its 38-page judgment, said.
