Jaipur: The Rajasthan High Court asked the state and Union governments about the steps taken to stop the practice of ostentatious  . In a humanitarian gesture, Rajasthan High Court asked the department of social justice and empowerment department to provide all facilities to a widow to marry off her daughter instead she exhausting her deposits she received as compensation for the death of her husband, who was the only bread-winner of the family.

 Phooli Devi who is a widow approached the court seeking premature release of Rs 2.75 lakhs of FDR after a tribunal refused the same.
 
 The court noted that a sum of Rs.4.75 lakh had already been released earlier to the petitioner. The amount deposited in the FDRs is for the purpose of social security of the widow, the court noted. “This court is of the firm view that unnecessary expenses which are incurred in marriages should be curtailed and this court does not encourage citizens to incur unnecessary expenses in marriages.”
 
 The court noted that “it is high time that the state and union government took measures to stop ostentatious marriages. The trend of spending huge amount in conducting marriages has become a fashion and people have started competing with each other.”
 
 Status of families is being recognized in relation to the manner in which expenditure has been incurred in the marriages. Such actions result in the people losing money or getting desperate. The state government and the Union government ought to take up matters on the legislative side for taking steps to put certain restraint on such expenditure.
 
 “A family, living in penury and the only surviving source available is the compensation amount received on account of death of the earning member, cannot be allowed to be wasted in marriage functions,” the court observed.
