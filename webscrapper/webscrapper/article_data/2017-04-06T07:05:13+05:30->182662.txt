CHENNAI: In spite of stiff resistance, Chennai division of   has continued the drive to evict unauthorised offices of unions from railway buildings and plans to use these reclaimed buildings for improving  .

 At  , it has converted an unauthorised office of a union into a   for the   (RPF).
 
 Last week, two such drives were conducted behind Egmore station and in Perambur. In both places, Southern Railway Mazdoor Union (SRMU) had set up ‘offices’ on railway premises. In Perambur, the eviction could not be completed due to lack of coordination among railway departments, while in Egmore, two buildings were reclaimed, sources in the RPF said. A drive was conducted in Arakkonam on Tuesday and a similar exercise planned in Tiruninravur.
 
 Apart from taking up space, members of unions and associations also deface station walls with posters.
 
 SRMU is the sole recognised union in the zone. “We continue persuading them to vacate these buildings,” a senior official said to a query on the opposition from unions.
 
 The objective of such drives is not only reclamation of railway property. Railway Board rules allow the recognised unions only one branch per 1,000 votes secured in the election. “However, all unions, recognised or unrecognised, have opened many branches across all locations. They consume water and electricity, charges of which have to be borne by the railways. This is unnecessary expenditure,” a senior official said.
 
 In a representation to the general manager, the Southern Railway Officers Association (SROA) said SRMU was operating 180 branches with official accommodation despite winning only 43,000 votes in the last election which allows them to operate only 43 branches. “This has amounted to loss of manpower directly affecting the productivity of railways,” it said in the letter.
 
 The official said SRMU could not be singled out as other unions and associations were also operating illegal branch offices in railway buildings.
