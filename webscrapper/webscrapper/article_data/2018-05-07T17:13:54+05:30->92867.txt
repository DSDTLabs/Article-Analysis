NEW DELHI: The   ( ) today quashed a   law that granted permanent accommodation to former chief ministers (CMs), saying that they aren't eligible for government bungalows.

 The SC said   can't be granted such a facility as they aren't holding office. Although the SC verdict is confined to the UP law it will have implication on residential accommodations given to former Presidents, Prime Ministers and CMs of other states too, as the top court said that a person can't be given such facility on the basis of post held by them earlier.
 
 "Public office becomes history after a person demits the office and it can not be the basis for giving government residential accommodation for rest of his life," said the SC.
 
 The 2016 legislation in Uttar Pradesh was challenged by an NGO called Lok Prahari. In late August of 2016, three weeks after the 
  ordered all former chief ministers to vacate their government-allotted bungalows in Lucknow, the UP government brought in a 
  in the house to legalise their possession. 
 
 At the time, those affected by the SC order were 
  home minister and 
  leader 
 , Rajasthan governor 
 , 
  chief 
 , BSP supremo 
  and 
  leaders N D 
  and Ram Naresh Yadav. Also at the time, a three-member SC bench headed by Justice 
  and including Justices N V 
  and 
 , had also rejected the state's contention that it had to allot bungalows as most of the ex-CMs get Z-plus security. Since the security was being provided by the Centre, giving accommodation was its responsibility too, the apex court said.
