BENGALURU:   India Holdings will become the majority owner and controller of the   (BIAL) with the firm buying an additional 6% stake from Siemens Project Ventures for about $67 million. After the deal, Fairfax will own 54% of BIAL, while Siemens’ stake will drop to 20%. The rest is equally owned by the state government through the Karnataka State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corp (KSIIDC) and the Centre through Airports Authority of India (AAI).

 Fairfax, run by India-born Canadian investor Prem Watsa, has been steadily raising its presence in BIAL, which runs the   (KIA), over the last two years. “Siemens is one of the original shareholders of BIAL and has contributed immensely to the development of KIA into a world-class airport that is a gateway to and from India,” said Watsa, chairman of Fairfax India and chairman & CEO of Fairfax Financial Holdings.
 
 BIAL declined to comment. The airport has been Fairfax’s biggest investment in the country.
 
 KIA, the third busiest airport in India in terms of passenger traffic, recorded a footfall of 25 million in 2017, a nearly 13% increase compared to the year before. The airport is already way beyond its technical capacity of 20 million.
 
 Fairfax first set foot in BIAL when it bought a 33% stake for $321 million from GVK Power and Infrastructure two years ago. It subsequently bought an additional 5% from Zurich Airport. GVK exited the airport completely last year by selling its residual 10% to reduce debt.
