Shimla: It’s a   between the BJP and the Congress. BJP president Amit Shah’s visit to Kangra and his swipes at Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh have incurred barbs from the Congres leaders who are in no mood to take things lying down. With Shah wasting no opportunity to attack the CM, the latter has retorted raking up the Godhra riots and BJP’s role in it. 

 The CM has support from his cabinet members including Vidya Stokes, Thakur Singh Bharmauri and Sudhir Sharma who have taken strong exception to Shah’s comments. According to them the income tax related case is sub-juduice and Shah’s comments not only tantamount to contempt of Court but are an affront on the country’s judiciary. Supporting their boss, they advised Shah to set his own house in order instead of taking jibes at a six time CM who has been in active politics for 55 years. 
 
 They also advised Shah to look into the graft cases that Chief Ministers of BJP ruled states are embroiled in. Exuding confidence of a landslide victory in the assembly elctions, the ministers reposed full faith in the leadership of Virbhadra. They added that the BJP is a divided house and its dream of coming to power will never see the light of the day.
 
 Shah found himself at the receiving end when the ministers criticised him for blaming the state government in its failure to prepare detailed project reports (DPRs) for national highways. They informed that the state government started issuing notification on September 14 last year but it was the Centre which issued new directions on tenders that forced the government to restart the process. The state government, according to them has already started the technical and financial process for 28 national highways while tenders have been called thrice for the remaining 31 roads.
