KOLKATA: A group of   used to ferry them to and from school met with an accident on VIP Road on Monday, which left at least six injured and the rest in trauma.

 The accident happened around 5pm when the bus rammed into a state bus a little ahead of   crossing. The bus does not belong to the school in   but to a private operator who runs multiple buses that ferry school students.
 
 The children, with cuts, bruises and bloodied school uniforms, screamed in pain and panic as the bus came to an abrupt halt. Many of them had slammed face-first against the backrests of the seats in front. The bus even had an illegally installed seat in the aisle and those sitting on it fell off since they had no support. One of the seats came unhinged as well.
 
 Covered in shards of glass from the shattered rear windshield and bleeding from deep gashes, six of the kids were taken to a private hospital opposite to the accident spot.
 
 Doctors said all the children were out of danger, but that would hardly lessen the psychological impact of the accident on them and hundreds of parents.
 
 Police said the accident occurred when an auto suddenly veered left from the right lane in a bid to pick up a passenger, which forced a state bus behind it to apply brakes. Though it was able to avert a collision, the school bus couldn’t stop in time.
 
 “We have arrested driver Biman Rout, 45, for rash and negligent driving. The bus has been seized. The bus owner is equally responsible as there are some illegal modifications in the bus which are against traffic norms,” said an officer.
 
 After the accident, cops stopped a minibus and put the other students on it along with the school bus’ helper and attendant to drop the children to their respective homes.
 
 Car pool rules state that a guardian must always accompany the students in the vehicle. However, during Monday’s accident, no guardian was in the bus.
