 J&K governor N N Vohra, who is also the chairman of the Board, convened an emergency meeting to review the yatra security in the morning. “It was decided that the pilgrimage shall continue without any diminution whatsoever and this decision was conveyed to all camp directors and to the Yatri Niwas, Jammu, from where pilgrims leave for the valley in a convoy every morning,“ a spokesperson said.
 
 The pilgrims lodged at the Yatri Niwas said Monday's terror attack will not deter them from visiting the cave shrine. “Such attacks will only strengthen our faith. The terrorists cannot discourage us,“ said Lokesh Verma from Gwalior.
