NEW DELHI: An angry   on Wednesday demanded that Prime Minister   apologise for his "ugly remark" against former premier   or else it would not let the   function. 

  After walking out of the House in protest, deputy leader of opposition  ,   and Kapil Sibal condemned Modi's attack on Singh as "most unacceptable". "It is in extremely poor taste. It is unbecoming of a PM to use such language for a former PM and certainly unbecoming for anybody to make such a harsh, ugly statement about Manmohan Singh," Chidambaram said. 
 
  The former finance minister said Congress was "very very angry" over the remark and could have shouted down the PM during his reply to the President's address. 
 
  "But that would have, in the circumstances of today, brought us down to the level of the debate which the PM wanted. We do not want such a debate to take place," he said. 
 
  The Congress threat of blockade threatens to revert Parliament back to the chaos of the winter session. But for the moment, it may hurt business only on Thursday after which the two Houses go into a month-long break. Calling the PM unprecedentedly arrogant, Sibal said Modi had conveyed that he would not come to the House for his reply till deputy leader of opposition Anand Sharma had finished his speech.
 
 "He should know he is everybody's PM, including ours. The post he occupies has dignity," he said.
