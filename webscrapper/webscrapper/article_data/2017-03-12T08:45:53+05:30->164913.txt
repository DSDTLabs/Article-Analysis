NEW DELHI: The   is fighting for relevance. The one-day tournament now finds itself at the fag end of the Indian domestic season, attention divided between the ongoing Test series and the following IPL season, the   having slotted the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament before the IPL auctions were held. 

 The auctions are done. The Indian team isn't playing any white-ball cricket before June. Thus, one has to hunt for incentives to play in the tournament even as the knockouts commence here in the capital on Sunday, a day before Holi. The buzz, understandably, is missing.
 
 But on Saturday, one saw  , in charge of the Baroda team, actively involved in the nets with his young side ahead of their quarterfinal against a potent Karnataka team. An intent-looking   went through his wicketkeeping drills before he squares off against Parthiv Patel's Gujarat. Pathan is looking to revive his career after the snub at the IPL auctions.
 
 “I believe and that's why I am here,” said the once revered left-arm swing bowling allrounder. “My batting has, in fact, improved,” he asserted.
 
 This year's IPL auction was not very kind to the performers in Ranji Trophy cricket, let alone a few Test regulars like Ishant Sharma and Cheteshwar Pujara. But Pathan wants to look ahead. 
 
 “There's always something to look forward to. It's not all about the IPL. Indian selectors have a job to do and with India playing a lot of ODI cricket this year, the domestic performers will have to be at their best,” Pathan told TOI. “You can't blame the scheduling of the tournament. The Mushtaq Ali tournament has thrown up good players and given recognition to them through heavy IPL contracts,” he added.
