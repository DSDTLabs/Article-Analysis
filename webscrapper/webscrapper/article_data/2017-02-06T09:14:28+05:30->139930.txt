BELAGAVI: Making ends meet was a tough task for the women of   taluk. With drought and   affecting  , the going hasn’t been easy. Working in the fields fetched them Rs 150 a day. Money was always short.

 Around 10 women, in their 20s and 30s, recently came together and founded ‘ShivParvati’   by registering it with Shri Kshetra Dharmasthala Rural Development Program (SKRDP). The idea was to supplement their income and cut down on the mounting debts.  , a resource person from SKRDP, encouraged the women to form a group and start small savings. But the women had to pinch and scrape to save even Rs 50 from their daily wages.
 
 Naik saw that Khanapur had large swathes growing sweet potato. But the farmers growing sweet potato were not doing well as the government has not fixed even a minimum support price for this vegetable. “My job is to empower women by creating jobs for them and improve their livelihood. I thought of a part-time job for these women so that they can earn some extra money and improve their livelihood,” says Naik.
 
 Naik advised this group to try making snacks from sweet potato and sell them. 
 
 Says Ashwini Rajput, a member of this group, “We gave it a shot and started making snacks from sweet potato. We started selling a 100 gm packet for Rs 20. Well, it clicked surprising us too. We have been getting a good response and now we have also started taking bulk orders.”
 
 The women even recently bought a small potato cutting machine for Rs 5,000 from the money they managed to save. Every evening after a hard day in the fields, the group gathers at one of the members’ houses to prepare the snacks. Tulsa Chougule, another member, says that while eight of the women are involved in preparing the snacks, two of them market it. The profit earned is distributed equally among all, she adds.
