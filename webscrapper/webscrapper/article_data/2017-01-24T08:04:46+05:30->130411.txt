LUCKNOW: Denying any terror angle in the   rail accident, DGP Javeed Ahmad on Monday said that no evidence could be detected so far to corroborate the sabotage theory. 

 Anti-terrorist squad of UP Police had been working on the theory which came out in the open after arrest of three persons in Motihari district of Bihar.
 
  had said that they were responsible for orchestrating multiple railway accidents, including the Pukhrayan incident. On November 20, over 150 people had died after   derailed in Kanpur Dehat district.
 
 It was believed that a fracture in railway tracks had caused the incident but the case took a sudden turn on January 17 with the arrest of three in Motihari. Believed to be members of an ISI module, the three worked for a Nepalese man called Brij Kishore Giri.
 
 “Bihar Police shared inputs with us but we have not been able to detect anything to link them with the Pukhrayan case. Investigation is on,” said Ahmad.
