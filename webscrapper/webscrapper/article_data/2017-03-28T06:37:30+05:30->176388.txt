CHENNAI: Residents of   in   are forced to spend 5,000 a month on canned water as drinking water supplied by   has been contaminated with sewage. Metrowater engineers who have been trying to set right the problem for over a month have not discovered the point of contamination despite digging up the road at a dozen places to inspect underground pipelines. 

 Homemaker and resident S Shanthi said, "We have not been able to use water supplied by Metrowater for any purpose. It has turned black, and reeks of sewage." At least a hundred families have been suffering water shortage due to contamination. 
 
 A Metrowater official said, "We are tracing the point of contamination on 8th Main Road. We hope to discover it in a day or two." The engineers who rectified the issue on two nearby streets said that contamination most likely occurs where the drinking water pipeline and sewer line run close to each other underground. Kasturba Nagar   member   said, "We are forced to buy canned water at 30- 80. We are a family of two, and need at least one 20-litre can a day for drinking and cooking. Other families on the street spend a lot more."
