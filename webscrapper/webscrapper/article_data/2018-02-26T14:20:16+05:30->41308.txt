We asked them to look for an alternate route to ease the traffic in this area,” said Manoj  , city police commissioner. 
 
 “We were in process of issuing notification of alternate route for the heavy vehicles. The school student’s death is very unfortunate. We want to ensure that such incidents don’t happen again. But the other stakeholders like schools and parents too should take some responsibility for safety of their children. The school shouldn’t have gathered so many children on cycle near its premises. They had permission to do marathon only in  ,” Sashidhar told TOI. 
 
 He added that the cops have detained several vehicles that flout traffic rules near Amitnagar circle over last few days.
