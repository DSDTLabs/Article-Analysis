Vadodara: A bootlegger from Rajasthan, arrested in October last year, was booked for forgery after police came to know that the registration number of the car in which he was ferrying Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL) was fake.

 Accused Manoj Dayma, who hails from Chittorgarh, was arrested on October 11, 2017 near Sokhda by cops from Vadodara taluka police station with an SUV car. When the police searched the car, they found IMFL worth Rs1.1 lakh. Dayma was nabbed with the receiver of the stock Vishnu Mali. Police said Dayma was later released on bail.
 
 However, during the course of investigation when the police verified the car’s number and   with Vadodara RTO, they turned out to be fake. The police then checked with Toyota, the manufacturer of the car, with details of engine and chassis number. The cops learnt the car’s original registration was done in Ajmer and that it belonged to Mustaq Kaji.
 
 A police official said they will arrest Dayma soon so that they can probe whether the car was stolen or bought from Kaji.
