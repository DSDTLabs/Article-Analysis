 actor Aniruddha Jhatkar’s next,  , is a commercial flick that has him in a never-before-seen avatar – a macho action hero. And keeping him company are two ladies — Nikita Thukral and  . 
“Raja Simha is the last film that I worked on before I got married and I am very excited that it is releasing now. Aniruddha has worked really hard for this film, which is also why I want it to work well for him. I play his love interest in the film, who is a pucca city girl. It is a very nice and bubbly character,” says Nikita.
 Sanjjanaa, on the other hand, provides the glam element to the film. “My character is that of a foreign returnee, who is ultra-glamorous. She is also responsible in helping Aniruddha’s character reach his goal, and in that sense, her presence in the narrative is pivotal. Having said that, this is no doubt Aniruddha’s vehicle,” says the actress.
