Panaji: The adverse impact of tourism activities conducted by a yacht club in an eco-sensitive area of River Mandovi generated much heat and debate at the   gram sabha held on Sunday.

 The meeting chaired by young sarpanch Snehal Harmalkar drew a large crowd at the Fr Jacome Gonsalves hall, as the islanders opposed the activities of the yacht club, alleging that it would bring in drugs and prostitution and also pave way for the entry of casinos to the island area.
 
 The local residents alleged that drugs are being sold on the island, and this spelt danger to the future of the youth and others residents. 
 
 Some fishermen alleged that water sport activities, especially jet skis, were creating waves and damaging the bunds that protected the island. They also said that spawning of fish will be affected due to pollution caused by dumping of waste and plastic.
 
 The members alleged that toilets in the lounge erected on a bund are draining into the river. The panchayat had conducted an inspection on Friday and found numerous illegalities, including cutting of mangroves and burning of garbage on the river banks.
 
 The islanders demanded a halt on these activities as it will damage the riverine ecology and adversely affect the livelihood of fishermen.
 
 Panchayat leaders supported the locals pointing out that approvals to the project wer granted by their predecessors. 
 
 The villagers also opposed nationalization of rivers.
