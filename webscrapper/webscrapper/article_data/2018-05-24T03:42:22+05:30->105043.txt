MUMBAI: After the Bombay high court on Wednesday summoned   over the varsity's dispute with Hindi Vidya Bhavan over its renovation, both parties said they had resolved most of the issues. 

 The school at Marine Lines had moved a vacation bench of Justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and  . Its advocate   said the school wanted to paint the building but the varsity was not allowing workers to put up scaffolding in the common area. Cama told the court plastering had to be done too. He said the school promised to avoid harm to staff and students' access to the ground.
 
 The varsity and school had finished one round of litigation in the HC. In June 2016, the varsity agreed to the school building a compound wall which should not block access to its ground.
 
 The judges were miffed. "Ask your vice-chancellor to come at 3pm," said Justice Kathawalla. University registrar Dinesh Kamble came in place of Pednekar. University advocate   and Cama said they had resolved most issues for now and signed consent terms. 
 
 In another case, the bench directed the police chief to be present in court on Friday after the investigation officer in a case did not turn up.
