BHATINDA: BSP chief   accused the NDA government at the Centre and the   in Punjab of discriminating against Dalits and using them only as a vote bank. 

 Mayawati on Monday said this while addressing a rally at   assembly constituency in Barnala district in support of her party candidates from the Malwa region. She said, “Injustice is being meted out to Dalits and poor in Punjab. The rights given by the maker of Constitution B R Ambedkar are being snatched from them under a conspiracy.” 
 
 She said that the   in its report had made it clear that the condition of minorities was very bad in India. Owing to wrong policies of various governments at the Centre, poverty, unemployment and inflation had increased manifold in the country. Various political parties use the name of Ambedkar only to get votes from Dalits and poor but do nothing to raise their standard of living. This was worst in Punjab, where one third of the population was of Dalits, she claimed.
 
 She said that, “Apart from poverty, rising unemployment, increasing drug addiction and menace of gangsters is a big problem in Punjab and if the BSP gets majority in Punjab, we will eliminate these evils. We will put drug peddlers and gangsters behind bars and provide a clean governance like we did in UP in the past.”
 
 Mayawati further said that the BSP if voted to power would make provision for employment to Dalits and make efforts to improve their living conditions.
