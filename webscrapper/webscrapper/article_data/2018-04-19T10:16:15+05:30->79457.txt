PANAJI: The church in Goa appealed to Prime Minister   on Wednesday to “eliminate the growing ideology of hate and subjugation of women” within the country. The church missive to   came after the recent cases of crimes against women, including the “horrendous rapes” in Kathua and   and also across the country over the past few days.

 “There is an urgent need to restore a sense of confidence and security by ensuring speedy justice and protection to women, children, minorities, Dalits and others oppressed in the country,” the council for social justice and peace ( ), the social arm of the Archdiocese of Goa and  , said.
 
 CSJP executive secretary   said certain ideological groups humiliate and terrorise sections of society including minorities, Dalits, women, children and the oppressed “by taking advantage of their sympathisers in power. This is in no way reflective of the rich ancient culture of peace, tolerance and inclusiveness which Indian society is always proud of.”
 
 The church said it is deeply agonised over the horrendous rapes which appear to have the tacit corroboration of the respective governments in protecting the rapists and denying justice to the victims and their families. There is a growing trend in the country to justify crimes committed against certain sections of society under the garb of nationalism, it said.
 
 “The shameless and audacious attempts from officers of the court to prevent the filing of the chargesheet and disrupt the functioning of courts in order to protect the accused rapists poses a grave threat to the sanctity of democratic institutions in this country. The failure of law enforcing agencies in the timely registration of the rape cases is worrisome for any peace-loving citizen of this country.”
