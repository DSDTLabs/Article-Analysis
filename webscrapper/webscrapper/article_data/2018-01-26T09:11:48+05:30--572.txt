BENGALURU: A woman, due to deliver in the next couple of days, was in dire need of the rare AB-negative blood on Thursday. With a bandh on, the woman, admitted to a government hospital near  , was at her wits end. Then,   drove — literally — to her rescue.

 The bandh didn’t stop Murali from driving from Doddanekkundi,   to the hospital, a 20km journey. “It’s a rare blood group and the patient is a pregnant woman,” Murali said. “I have been donating blood for many years and I didn’t think much of doing it on Thursday too.”
 
 Murali wasn’t the only one who reached out to needy patients by donating blood on Thursday. A 60-year-old woman, who has been suffering from stomach cancer for the last 10 years and admitted to a private hospital in Whitefield, required two units of O-positive blood. The patient’s family got in touch with Lions Bloodline and the donor, Srirajani CM, 36, who stayed 5km away, responded immediately.
 
 “I rode my bike to the hospital,” said Sriranjini who works for a startup. The other unit was donated by a 32-yearold man who wished to remain anonymous. “It’s my first donation. I learnt about the request and I got here,” the man told TOI.
 
 In another case, a threeday-old girl baby battling for life in Vanivilas hospital, required blood. The patient’s family reached out to Lion’s Bloodline and Girija T, a regular blood donor and resident of Hennur, came forward. “I set off for the hospital as soon as I learnt about the case and donated blood,” said Girija.
 
 Alphonse Kurian, who coordinated the donations at Lions Bloodline,  , was all praise for the donors. “These donors are the super humans of Bengaluru,” he said. “They all responded within minutes of Whatsapp messages and went ahead and donated blood despite it being a bandh day.”
