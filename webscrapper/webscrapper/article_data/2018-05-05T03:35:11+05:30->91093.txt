GREATER NOIDA: A   was allegedly raped by a robber after she resisted a   bid in her house in Dankaur on Friday afternoon. A case of rape and loot under Sections 376 and 392 of IPC has been registered.

 Local residents said two armed men visited Mandi Shyamnagar village on a TVS Apache bike in the afternoon, and found four women sitting outside their homes. The robbers asked the woman to hand over the earrings and anklets, threatening to shoot them if they resisted the robbery. The women got scared and handed over their jewellery to the duo.
 
 The criminals then are believed to have moved on to another village named Badla Khera, which is around one kilometre from Mandi Shyamnagar.
 
 Piyush Kumar Singh, circle officer of Greater Noida II, said the robbers found an elderly woman and her daughter-in-law outside their home. “The accused demanded that the women hand over the jewellery and valuables. The women said they had no jewellery, and ran back fled inside their house. The accused then barged into their home,” he said.
 
 The elderly survivor told police that one of the two criminals took her inside a room and raped her. The criminals then fled on their bike. The elderly woman’s son returned home in the evening and filed a police complaint with Dankaur police station.
 
 The woman was sent for medical examination and reports are awaited. Singh said the modus operandi in both the cases is similar and it appears the same criminals have committed the crime. “We have registered a case and launched a search to arrest the accused,” Singh said.
