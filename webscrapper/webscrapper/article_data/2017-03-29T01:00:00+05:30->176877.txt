Final year commerce students Rajat Bhoir and Nidhi Pal will have a fascinating experience to share when they meet their classmates next. The youngsters from Konkan Gyanpeeth College in Karjat experienced the first joyride in a helicopter at the helipad in University of Mumbai’s (MU) Kalina campus on Tuesday morning. “We saw the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, Mahalaxmi Race Course, the black and green sea water merging, the skyscrapers here among other places. We want to come back and experience it with our friends again,” they said in unison. They were accompanied by 12 other underprivileged students. Not only will this joyride be available for students of the university from affiliated colleges, they will be able to avail of it at 10 per cent discount. 

 Speaking on the occasion,   (Vice-chancellor, MU) said, “The idea is to inspire students to take up aviation as a career. Currently, pilots have to go to Europe or US for a mid-term upgradation. I won’t hesitate to establish the facility of building a simulator on our campus. We’re also developing software with the help of which one will be able to enrol online and students will be taken in batches of eight to 10. While some sorties will take place from the campus, the rest will be from the Pawan Hans heliport. We will be giving additional 15 per cent discount to students from the underprivileged section.”
 
  
  
 The collaboration also seeks to do away with the paranoia around helicopters. Says Sanjay Kumar (General Manager, Pawan Hans, West), “Right now, there are only 280 helicopters in India, out of which, most are private. We’ve taken enough security measures — the approach area is clear, the fire equipment is in place and we’ve ensured that it’s not too dusty. There’s an ambulance service as well.”
 
 Last week, an MoU was signed between the varsity’s   and Pawan Hans to start a dual degree course of BSc (Aeronautics) and aircraft maintenance engineering. This looks like a logical extension of the same.
