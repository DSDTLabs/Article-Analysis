CHENNAI: Opposition parties in the state will hold protest meetings across all districts on February 13 against the bus fare hike. A decision to this effect was taken at an all-party meeting held at   headquarters   on Tuesday. For the first time after 2006, MDMK chief Vaiko visited the DMK headquarters to attend the meeting, which was chaired by DMK working president M K  .

 Apart from Vaiko, TNCC chief S Thirunavukkarasar, VCK leader  , CPM state secretary G Ramakrishnan, CPI state secretary R Mutharasan, IUML MLA Abu Backer and leaders of other smaller parties attended the meeting.
 
 The meeting also called upon the government to withdraw all cases filed against students and general public for protesting against the bus fare increase.
 
 Asked whether the attendance at the meeting was an indication of the alliance in store for the coming election, Stalin said, “You will get to know when elections happen”.
 
 Vaiko, later speaking to reporters, said DMK cadres were supporting him in his agitation against setting up of Neutrino observatory in Tamil Nadu. “The observatory is very dangerous for the state as well as to two dams in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Whenever there is a protest against the observatory, I have received good support from the DMK,” said Vaiko.
