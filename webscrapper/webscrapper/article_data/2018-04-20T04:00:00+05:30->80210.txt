Surat: Surtis living in Bengaluru sounded excited when TOI talked to a few of them over phone. 

 Akash Upadhyay, son of a well-known city doctor Dr Bakul Upadhyay, who works with Adobe System and lives in White Field in Bengaluru, said, “I am very much excited that Surat is getting direct connectivity to Bengaluru in May. For all these years when I came to see my parents in Surat, it took me around 13 hours from Bengaluru to reach home. One had to travel from Bengaluru to Mumbai in flight, then catch a train from Mumbai to Surat. I plan to visit Surat every weekend from May.”
 
 A housewife Darshita Desai and her husband Tushar Desai are from Surat, but settled in Bengaluru. Darshita’s husband works with Goldman Sachs. Every year this couple visits Surat during winter season to meet their relatives. 
 
 “I was waiting to hear about direct air connectivity from Bengaluru to Surat for many years. If the flight service starts from May, then we will be visiting Surat thrice a year. We have plans to buy a property in Surat or Navsari, but due to lack of connectivity had to put it on hold. Now, we can certainly buying property and will keep coming to Surat,” Darshita said. 
 
 Shehnaz Jungalwala and her group of friends have been visiting Bengaluru for treatment at Jindal Naturecure Institute. In the absence of direct connectivity, Shehnaz and her group members needed to travel to Mumbai in train then catch a flight to Bengaluru. 
 
 “We are so relieved that AirAsia is connecting Surat to Bengaluru. Now, we can easily travel to Bengaluru and get treatment at Jindal Naturecure. I am so excited to fly to Bengaluru in May,” Shehnaz said.
