CHENNAI: Tamil superstar   on Sunday said Chennai Super Kings players must wear black badges during the IPL matches to express their opposition to the Centre which has failed to constitute a   management board. 

 
 The actor made the statement before leaving from his Poes Garden residence for   where the Tamil film fraternity turned out in large numbers to protest against the Centre. 
 
 
 
 
 Rajinikanth said, "The Centre will be subject to the anger of the Tamil people if it does not form the Cauvery management board. If the IPL games in the city cannot be banned, CSK players must at least wear black badges during the matches as a form of protest." 
 
 The superstar said the decision to appoint M K Surappa from   as Anna University vice-chancellor was unacceptable. "It is not right to play politics with education. Appointing a vice-chancellor from Karnataka at this juncture is wrong."

 Nadigar Sangam president Nasser, who led the protest Valluvar Kottam, said the film industry also wanted the Sterlite Copper plant in Tuticorin to be shut down.
