Lucknow: Urging principals of government and aided schools to perform well, the district inspector of schools (DIOS), Lucknow, on Saturday said he expected the UP board class X and XII toppers next year to be from Lucknow and not any other district. In a meeting of the principals, Mukesh Kumar Singh said teachers must regularly go to school and give classes. 

 He said attendance of teachers would be monitored in three ways. First, biometric system will be used to register the time at which teachers reached and left the school. Depsite government’s order to install biometric system, hardly 10% schools in Lucknow had it. Then, teachers would mark their presence in the attendance register. Lastly, in case any teacher needed to leave the campus during the school hours, he/she would make an entry in the movement register that would then be approved by the principal. 
 
 Singh said principals would be held responsible for teachers found in DIOS office during school hours. “School principals have been asked to present a monthly report on teachers’ attendance. They will also have to inform the action taken against teachers with lackadaisical attitude,” Singh said. 
 
 He also instructed principals to install CCTV cameras in their schools. There are 48 government schools and 109 government-aided schools in Lucknow.
