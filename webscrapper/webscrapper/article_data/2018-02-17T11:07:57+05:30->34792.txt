KOLKATA: Bengal cops on Wednesday arrested a North Korean passport holder without any valid visa from inside the Indian  , near Swarupnagar in North 24-Parganas. Jhung Ho, officials said, was in his mid-30s and claimed to be working with a North Korean state-owned mining equipment-making company,  , in  .

 Ho is now in judicial custody as cops search for an interpreter who can translate his smattering of English and Bengali into something they can understand.
 
  “From what we have managed to gather, he has a valid visa for staying in Bangladesh. But he has not been able to explain to our satisfaction why he decided to enter India on foot and without a valid visa,” a senior West Bengal Police officer said. “He seems to be working at a managerial level and it is unfathomable why he should enter India like this,” he added.
 
 The initial probe, however, has indicated that some of his statements may be true. There is a North Korean state-owned company called NamNam that has its office within the North Korean embassy precinct in Dhaka.
 
 The Border Security Force spotted him inside the Indian border on Wednesday and handed him to Swarupnagar cops. “We assume that he has been staying in Bangladesh for a couple of years and so has picked up a few Bengali words. He told us that he entered India after paying a tout, who escorted him up to the border. He has tried to explain that he was eager to travel to India but found it difficult to get a visa,” an official said. “The Bengal government is informing the ministry of external affairs,” he added.
