NEW DELHI: A 36-year-old man, on the run since 2004 after throwing acid on a relative’s face, was arrested by the Delhi Police on Saturday.

 Cops received information that the accused, Suresh, would be meeting his friend near   and laid a trap accordingly. “A police team identified the man and arrested him. A country made pistol was recovered from his possession,” said DCP (Rohini) Rishi Pal.
 
 During interrogation, Suresh told cops that he had come to Delhi 17 years ago and started working at a plywood factory. One of his relatives Manoj lived near his house. In mid-2004, he came to know that Manoj had been harassing his wife, because of which he started to feel embarrassed and humiliated.
 
 Angered by Manoj’s actions, Suresh threw acid on his face and fled from the spot. He, however, returned back after a few years when he felt that no one was after him. “A case was registered and further investigations are ongoing,” said a senior police officer. TNN
