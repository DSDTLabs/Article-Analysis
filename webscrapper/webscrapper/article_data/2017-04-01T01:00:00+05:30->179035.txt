Patna: The Bihar Chemists and Druggists Association on Friday threatened to go on a statewide strike on April 12 if the health department failed to withdraw its order in which it asked drug stores to appoint at least one pharmacist from April 1. The association members will also wear black badges from April 6 in protest against the decision.

 “We will have no other option but to keep the stores closed on April 12 if the order is not withdrawn,” said Parsan Kumar Singh, president, of the association. “Drug stores needed pharmacists in old times as they used to make medicinal mixtures prescribed by doctors for patients. We now receive pre-packaged medicines. Secondly, there is a crisis of registered pharmacists in the state. There are nearly 40,000 drug stores in the state and the number of registered pharmacists in the state is just 7,500. Majority of them opt for government jobs. Pharmaceutical departments in different medical colleges in the state lack proper facilities and are short of students.”
 
 Singh said the government should have addressed the issue of shortage of pharmacists before issuing the order. “The order will result in closure of many stores. A short term pharmacy course should be introduced by the government to address this issue,” Singh said.
 
 Head of pharmacy department of IGIMS Harihar Dixit said while presence of pharmacists in drug stores is essential, it is also necessary to set up better pharmacy colleges in the state.
 
 Mamta Agarwal, owner of a drug store, said while she has appointed a pharmacist at her store, it is impossible for all drug stores to do so as there is a huge shortage of pharmacists in the state.
