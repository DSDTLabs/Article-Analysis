LUCKNOW: The special   court on Monday extended remand by three days of two police personnel of   police station arrested for falsely implicating the Unnao rape survivor’s father for possessing illegal arms. The duo — SO Makhi Ashok Singh Bhadauria and a subinspector   — were arrested on Wednesday.

 
 On April 5, these two had arrested the survivor’s father on charges of possessing illegal firearms and sent him to prison on a complaint filed by one  . Later, the survivor’s father died in hospital due to alleged torture in jail.
 
 The CBI had also taken   MLA Kuldeep   in custody on Saturday for enquiring about his role in pressuring the police personnel of the police station for registering a case against the survivor’s father.
 
 During the CBI probe, call detail records revealed the MLA was in Delhi at the time of the arrest of the survivor’s father but was in retouch with cops and also the complainant of the case. In order to get more clarity on this, the CBI team on Sundayproduced the two police officials and MLA face-to-face.
 
 CBI sources said the MLA was questioned why he called the two cops over 12 times on April 3 shortly before registering a case against the survivor’s father. Sengar, however, kept mum. He also remained silent when asked why he called Tinku Singh, the complainant, just before the registration of the case.
