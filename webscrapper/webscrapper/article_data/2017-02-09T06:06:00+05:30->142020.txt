GREATER NOIDA: National badminton coach and Dronacharya award winner   is set to start coaching at the   stadium’s badminton academy from March. While the academy will train 70 players in the first phase, Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) will sponsor 25 players from economically weaker sections of society.

 Gopichand had signed a MoU with GNIDA in July last year to put into place a world-class badminton academy at Shaheed Vijay Singh Pathik Sports Complex in Greater Noida, at a cost of Rs 130 crores. 
 
 “The academy will be housed in an area of about 30,000 square feet and will have 8 badminton courts,” said GNIDA CEO Deepak Agarwal. 
 
 “While the academy will train 70 players in the first phase,   will back the training of 25 talented players from the economically weaker sections of society, totally free,” the CEO said. “Students in the age group of 8-15 years will be trained after they are selected on the basis of their talent. Preference will be given to the students from surrounding areas and other parts of UP,” he explained.
 
 Gopichand has trained the likes of PV Sindhu, who gave a stupendous performance at the 2016 Rio Olympics, and another Olympian, Saina Nehwal.
