MYSURU: Seven students who were writing the   in the SSLC examination in   on March 28 received a jolt when they were asked to surrender their   two hours into the exam, and handed a fresh set of questions.

 The students from different schools coming under Mysuru South academic block were allotted three more hours to answer the fresh question paper. At the end of it, the harried kids wrote answers for a marathon five hours. All this, thanks to a mix-up committed by those overseeing the examination at Mysuru’s Sadvidya School centre.
 
 Deputy director of public instruction, Mamata, has submitted a report to the   ( ) in this regard.
 
 According to a complaint received by the department of public instruction, the seven students were handed the regular repeater question paper, instead of the regular fresher one. The incident came to light two hours after the examination began. Though stumpedby thequestions, students didn’t realize the folly.
 
 Mysuru South block education officer Shivakumar confirmed the mix-up to TOI and added that the mistake was noticed early and rectified immediately.
 
 DDPI Mamata said: “This mistake occurred despite extensive conversations and meetings with examination centre superintendents and teachers. The teachers should have been careful.”
