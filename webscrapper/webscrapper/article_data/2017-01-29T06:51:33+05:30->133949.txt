NEW DELHI: Within hours of   banning  , the ripple effect of the decision could be felt in India and among US-based Indians. 

 Director of Haji Public School in J&K’s Doda district Sabbah Haji Baji tweeted, “Sister cancels trip home from US because she may not be allowed back in.’’ She later clarified that though her sister had an Indian passport, she had been advised by her company to restrict travel outside the US because she was Muslim. 
 
 India is not among the seven countries on the travel ban.
 
 Observers warn that this could just be the beginning of a fear psychosis among Muslims working or travelling to and from the US. There are already a far higher number of checks placed on people with Muslim or even Muslim sounding names entering US. With the ban on travellers from countries like Syria, Iran, Iraq among others, experts fear that this move could lead to widespread backlash — increasing questioning, arbitrary refusals and ban on travel due to security reasons, despite valid travel documents. This could even affect those working in the software industry.
