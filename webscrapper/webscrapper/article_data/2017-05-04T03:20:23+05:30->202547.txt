NEW DELHI: A number of roadside plantation drives have been carried out in the city by various agencies in the past. However, they have had little effect in controlling dust or PM 10 pollution according to experts.

 To change this scenario, the environment department has come up with a plan to carry out plantations in central verges and roadside berms which will use water from sewage   plants (STP) in the city.
 
 The department had observed that in the past,   were unable to survive the heat due to inadequate supply of water. The new method is likely to make use of close to 30 STPs which will provide water to these roadside verges and ensure that the plants have a higher survival rate.
 
  “A number of such drives have been carried out in the past but the plants did not survive because there is not enough water. There was no permanent watering solution and at times, water tankers had to be used. We have now decided to use water from STPs which will ensure that these plants survive,” Keshav Chandra, Environment secretary and CEO of Delhi Jal Board told TOI.
 
 “Initially, stretches close to STPs will be chosen and depending on how successful the project is, we can advance it even further. Delhi has 34 STPs currently and not all of them are near roads, but we will make use of all those which are,” added Chandra.
 
 Anumita Roy Chowdhury, Executive Director at Centre for Science and Environment said that the move may prove to be beneficial in the long run with the plants acting both as dust absorbers and also helping in improving the ground water levels.
 
 “A committee with experts from various agencies will be formed. We will then decide on the infrastructure required to carry out drip irrigation through these STPs,” added Chandra.
