RAJKOT: A   approached the police after her husband from Dhoraji gave her triple   on  . She gave a complaint to the police seeking registration of an FIR against her husband for giving her triple talaq which is illegal. 

 Rais Rafiq Hunani had married Sarabano Ismail Lakhani three years ago. Both were in their 30s. According to Sarabano’s complaint, their married life was not smooth. She further stated that Rais abandoned her one-and-half-years ago. After trying everything to bring back her husband, Sarabano filed a complaint with Dhoraji chief judicial magistrate’s seeking direction for him to pay maintenance. Dhoraji court ordered Rais to pay maintenance to his wife, but he defaulted. 
 
 The wife again approached the court which issued a non-billable warrant against Rais. Police arrested Rais and presented him before court. Rais was reluctant in paying the amount but the court asked him to adhere to the order and pay. Sarabano’s lawyer Kartikey Parekh told TOI, “Rais was aggrieved by his wife’s action. When court did not send him to jail, instead of paying the maintenance money, he used Facebook to give his wife triple talaq on February 25.”
 
 Following this, Sarabano approached police to take action against Rais over triple talaq on Facebook but police did not lodge FIR. She approached the court again that sent Rais to jail for 25 days. “We will go to superintendent of police if FIR is not lodged based on Sarabano’s complaint on instant triple talaq,” Parikh added.
