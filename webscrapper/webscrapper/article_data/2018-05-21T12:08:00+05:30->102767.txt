PATNA: Wanted Maoist   Ram (65) was arrested near Dobarhawa under the Jandaha police station area in   district on Saturday evening when he was going to hold a meeting with his associates in the area. He was arrested in a joint operation by the 32nd battalion of Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) and Vaishali police. The SSB battalion is stationed at Mahua in the district for anti-Maoist operations.

 Vaishali SP Manavjeet Singh Dhillon said five detonators, a cellphone, Maoist literature and levy collection pamphlet were seized from his possession. Ramdev had been active in Maoist activities from late 1970s and was accused in more than nine cases.
 
 Jandaha SHO Om Prakash said the area from where he was arrested has several hutments where Ramdev had planned to hold a meeting on Saturday night. “He was declared an absconder by a Vaishali court in a murder case of one Bindeshwar Ram. Bindeshwar, who was also a Maoist earlier, was murdered on April 17 last year. He was shot and his throat was also slit,” Prakash said, adding Ramdev was among the prime accused in case. “His property was also attached on the court’s order in the case as he had evaded arrest,” he said.
 
 Prakash said Ramdev also involved in Maoist attack on Jandaha police station and a bank loot also under the same police station area. “He had managed to seek bail from court in both cases. Ramdev’s son   is a also a Maoist and wanted in several cases,” the SHO added.
