VADODARA: A police complaint was lodged against unidentified persons on Friday for threatening   (GPCC) general secretary,   with his life in November last year. 

 Rawat approached the   and filed a complaint after the police completed its investigations in the application he had submitted last year. “I got a call from the police on Thursday and I was asked to file FIR,” Rawat said. He added that another Congress leader Chandrakant Srivastava too had got a similar phone call from an unidentified person last year. 
 
 Rawat had submitted the application after he got two phone calls from abroad asking tell him to stop protesting against PM Narendra Modi and the BJP on November 25 last year. “We had staged protests against demonetisation in the city on that day and had planned roadblock. But the police detained me and my wife Ami who is a Congress councilor. The police released us by evening,” Rawat said. 
 
 “When I was at home that evening, I got a phone call from an international number and the person started abusing me in Gujarati language. The person asked me to stop all the protests against demonetisation. He said that if I don’t stop speaking against Modi and BJP, he would kill me,” Rawat added. 
 
 Rawat claimed that the caller even told him not to venture out of his house the next day or else he will be killed. “He also said that I should surrender to Modi else I will be cut to pieces. I disconnected the call but he called up again within few minutes from another number and issued threats. So I decided to inform the police commissioner about it,” Rawat told TOI. The caller rang up Rawat for the third time but this time he didn’t receive the call so the unidentified person sent him an abusive SMS. 
 
 “Investigations revealed that Rawat had received threat calls and SMS so FIR was filed in the case. We will now try to track down the accused,” said Leena Patil, deputy commissioner of police.
