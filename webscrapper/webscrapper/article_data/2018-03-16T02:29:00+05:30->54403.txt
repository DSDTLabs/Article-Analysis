Vijayawada: In a scathing attack on the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu   said the Bharatiya Janata Party is trying to play ‘Tamil Nadu-type drama’ to sabotage Telugu Desam Party.

 Speaking at a public meeting here on Thursday, Naidu said: “Some people are trying to enact a drama with the help of YSR Congress leader Jaganmohan Reddy. After that ploy failed, they are now trying out new tricks and indulging in Tamil Nadu-type politics.” He further threatened that he will expose the people conniving against the TDP and the state in a few days.
 
 He hit back against Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan’s corruption allegations against the TDP, saying: “Didn’t he see the corruption all these years? Why is it visible only now? Why is he attacking us now when we are trying to fight against the Centre?” He also sought to know “what benefit Kalyan will gain out of criticising me when I am trying to fight for the interests of the state”.
 
 Naidu exhorted Prime Minister Narendra Modi to do justice to the state. “Modi had compared AP to a still-born child after the bifurcation during his election campaign. It’s his duty to save and protect this child,” he said. Naidu said there was no truth in the allegations against his son and IT minister Nara Lokesh. “He has no connection with former TTD board member Sekhar Reddy who was suspended after he was caught exchanging demonetised currency.
