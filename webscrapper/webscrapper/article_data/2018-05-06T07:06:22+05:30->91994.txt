KOLKATA: Investigations into the two incidents of moral policing last week - one inside a Metro train compartment that led to a couple being assaulted at Dum Dum Station and another outside the same station when a group molested women protesting against the previous incident - have not made any headway yet with the suspects still at large. 

 The two assaulted on Monday are yet to be traced, but the girls who had been molested on Thursday filed a case at Sinthee police station the very night. Sinthee police started two separate cases, one on its own for Monday's incident and the second based on the complaint by the molested women.
 
 Five days into the first incident, police are yet to interrogate anyone, let alone make arrests. The absence of adequate CCTV coverage at   station have proved to be a deterrent in identifying the culprits. Even those seen in a photograph taken by a commuter that evening have not been questioned by the police.
 
 The incident sparked off a wave of protests by youths, mostly college students, who decried moral policing on the Metro. Protests were staged outside Dum Dum and other Metro stations with the youths hugging each other in a protest christened "Hok! Alingan".
 
 On Saturday, too, youths assembled in front of Metro stations to voice the need for freedom from moral policing. 
 
 A motley group from the opposite camp also assembled at   station to make youths realize the folly of 'misbehaving' in public places. However, the demonstration termed 'Hok! Chaitanya' did not evoke much response from commuters.
