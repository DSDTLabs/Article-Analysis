KOLKATA: The nationwide strike on May 30 and 31 called by the   (UFBU) may affect ATM services along with normal banking operations. With month-end salary credits expected on Thursday, ATM closures could impact cash withdrawals.

 
  president and   (BPBEA) general secretary   said ATM security guards will also participate in the strike. ATMs are part of the banking network. So, it cannot operate during a bank strike, he reasoned.
 
 
  
 
 Bank officials said they will replenish ATMs before the strike, but are apprehensive whether the ATMs — which run dry due to the heavy month-end withdrawals — can be fed again with cash by private service providers. “Online bank operations will remain fully functional. If bank branches and ATMs are forcibly closed, cash transactions could be impacted,” a regional manager of a private sector bank said.
 
  had earlier issued a circular, which stated, “Branches responsible for maintenance of ATMs should ensure that sufficient cash is loaded in advance so that the ATM cardholders are able to meet their emergent requirements of cash and should also ensure that the ATMs are in proper working condition prior to the strike.” It said, “The filling of cash in ATMs may be arranged through outsourced agencies, wherever such arrangements exist or through available officers. The currency chest branches may be manned by senior functionaries. It should also be ensured that the ATMs do not get dry.”
 
 The strike has been called to press for higher wages.   convenor of UFBU (the umbrella unit of seven banking trade unions)   said in the last wage revision in 2012, employees had received a raise of 15%.
 
 There are nearly 10,000 branches and 21,000 ATMs with 70,000 employees of public sector banks in the state.
