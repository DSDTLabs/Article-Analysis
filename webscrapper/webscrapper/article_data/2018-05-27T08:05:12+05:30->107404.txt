 KOCHI: In a harbinger of what could be in store once the monsoon sets in, the city streets were completely   within an hour of rain on Saturday evening. 

 
 Ernakulam South,  ,   and   areas and many byroads were flooded causing untold difficulties to pedestrians and motorists.
 
 The roads were flooded within 10 minutes of the rains, which started around 6pm. The corporation is yet to undertake the cleaning of arterial canals like Thevara-Perandoor and Rameswaram-Kalvathy.
 
 "As the local body failed to clear silt from canals and drains, almost all the roads in the city would be waterlogged. Even in areas where drains were cleared, they didn't remove the silt stored on the shoulders of road. The rains will carry the silt back into the drains," said P Rangadasa Prabhu, president, Ernakulam District Residents Associations Apex Council (EDRAAC).
 
 "Poor planning of the local body is causing hardships to residents," he said.
 
 "The flow of water through Mullassery canal is smooth now after the silt was removed. But, canals like Thevara-Perandoor are clogged. Flooding will cause spread of communicable diseases as well," he said.
 
 Though the local body authorities tried to get the approval of the corporation council for tendering a Rs 16-crore project for cleaning, fencing and evicting encroachment on Thevara-Perandoor canal, the opposition councillors objected citing that the project was included in the supplementary agenda.
