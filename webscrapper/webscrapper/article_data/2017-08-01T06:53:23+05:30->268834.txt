KOLKATA: The   ( ) has set September 15 as the deadline for repairing all roads — major thoroughfares, lanes or bylanes — across the city. 

 The   department has already started patchwork repairs on the worst-affected roads. “A thorough repair will be undertaken from August 15 and will be completed in a month. We will take care of every thoroughfare or even the lanes. All roads will be repaired before the pujas,” said Ratan Dey, MMiC overseeing the department.
 
 Unable to withstand heavy waterlogging, several roads have started to show signs of wear and tear. Though a list of affected stretches has been drawn up, KMC is particularly worried over the wretched condition of Diamond Harbour Road. “We need a couple of dry days to begin extensive repair work. So far as E M Bypass is concerned, we will cooperate with KMDA,” a KMC roads department official said.
 
 According to civic sources, funds won’t be a problem as the state municipal affairs department has sanctioned Rs 27 crore (of Rs 58 crore) as the second instalment to KMC for the improvement of roads, including repairing, strengthening and laying mastic asphalt. The amount has been allotted as grant-in-aid, but the fund release is subjected to timely completion of work. The KMC authorities need to produce an utilisation certificate. 
 
 As many as 89 stretches have been identified for thorough repair, renovation and strengthening under the state government scheme. Some major stretches to be repaired include AJC Bose Road, CR Avenue, Landsdown Place Road, Park Circus Connector, Mukundapur Road and Dover Road.
