 is all set for his much anticipated release, ' ' that is slated to hit cinemas on January 25. The latest teaser of 'Kaabil' is out and it's too cute to handle. 

  
  
 We can see Hrithik surprising   by mimicking   on the phone. He plays a dubbing artist in the film, and he fools his wife by talking in celebrity voices and making her believe that a lot of stars visit him at work.
 
 Hrithik who plays a visually impaired dubbing artist in the film, has imitated the legendary actor beautifully and the fans are going to love this sequence. Yami's innocence and cuteness while she talks to Hrithik over the phone, will steal your heart. They say imitation is the best form of flattery, now we know why.
