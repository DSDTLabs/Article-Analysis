AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Thursday adjourned the hearing on   challenging Congress leader Ahmed Patel’s victory in the   till October 6.

 The court deferred the proceedings after Patel’s counsel requested for more time to reply to the HC notice.
 
 The rebel Congress MLA who joined BJP ahead of RS polls, Rajput, approached the high court after he was defeated by Patel, who got 44 votes against 38 votes secured by Rajput. He has urged the court to declare himself as a winner in place of Patel and presented his reasons.
 
 Rajput has questioned ECI’s decision to hold two votes by rebel Congress MLAs – Raghavji Patel and Bholabhai Gohel – invalid for showing their votes to people other than Congress party’s representative. He stated that the returning officer had declared these two votes as valid, and hence ECI has got no jurisdiction to declare them invalid. Thus ECI’s intervention in the issue and its order is illegal and should be set aside.
