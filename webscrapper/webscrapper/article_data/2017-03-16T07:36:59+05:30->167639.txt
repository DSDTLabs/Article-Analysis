MUMBAI:   chief  's unscheduled meeting with his party's ministers at Matoshree on Wednesday has sparked speculation of a deepening crisis in the   on the issue of writing off farmers' loans.

 The Sena has teamed up with the opposition   to stall business in the legislature on the issue. The   regime is in a dilemma as precious hours of the budget session are lost in mayhem.
 
 However, NCP chief Sharad Pawar stole a march over the Sena by calling on Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi earlier in the day to urge him to offer loan amnesty to Maharashtra farmers without further delay. In his 20minute talks with the Modi, Pawar demanded that the Centre should resuscitate the cash-starved sugar industry in the state, it is learnt.
 
 Uddhav's loan waiver demand is a strategy to keep the BJP on a tight leash and to project the Sena as the “guar dian angel“ of the agriculture community , said party watchers. The Sena held demonstrations in Jalna, in  , to demand loan amnesty to farmers following crop failure and unseasonal rain.
 
 That the Sena legislators should join hands with the opposition to halt the business of the two houses of the state legislature--that too during the crucial budget session--has left the BJP fuming. The state budget is scheduled for Satur day . “Although an ally in the Fadnavis regime, the Sena joins the opposition members to stall the house proceedings. The Sena ministers should realize that they are bound by oath of office,“ said a senior BJP legislator.
 
 While the Fadnavis government is amenable to the loan waiver, Fadnavis does not want to act in haste. “The CM will make sure that relief reaches straight into the affected farmers' accounts and that the official-neta-contractor nexus doesn't fleece them,“ said a BJP MLA. The CM is said to be examining details of the 2008 loan waiver scheme, sources said.
