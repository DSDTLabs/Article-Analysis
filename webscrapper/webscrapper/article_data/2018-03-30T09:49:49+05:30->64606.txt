JAISALMER: Eight Egyptian vultures died after hitting a high tension wire in Dholia area of Jaisalmer district on Thursday. In the last three months, around 100 vultures have died in different incidents in the district.

 The carcases of these endangered birds were noticed by the locals who informed the forest officials.
 
  
  
 
  said, birds were buried after post-mortem. “In recent times, there have been a few cases of endangered birds dying after hitting the high tension wires which is a concern. A letter has been written to the power department requesting them to install bird diverters so that such incidents can be avoided,’’ she said.
 
  
  
 
 However, the request for bird diverters is not new. Repeated attempts have been made to get them installed.
 
  
  
 
 DNP deputy conservator of forests   said that bird diverters were placed at   area after death of a godawan. On an experimental basis, three more bird diverters were put up in Basisat Khetolai, Mokla and   areas. However, there are several private windmill companies in the area who have not done so and high tension wires pose a threat to endangered species,’’ he said.
