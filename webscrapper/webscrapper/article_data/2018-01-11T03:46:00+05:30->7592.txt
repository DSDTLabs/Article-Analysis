Porvorim: As long as all documents are in order, traders cannot be stopped from importing  , and those interfering with the legal trade will be punished, chief minister Manohar Parrikar said on Wednesday. Police have been directed to go by the law, he said.

 “Police will check documents on the border. If everything is proper then there is no problem. I have told police that they will have to go by the law. The legal provisions says that if documents are in order, there is proper billing, you cannot stop anyone from importing beef,” Parrikar told reporters.
 
 The state witnessed a four-day strike by beef traders over alleged harassment of beef importers by cow vigilantes. 
 
 The strike was called off on Tuesday following government assurance of police protection to the beef being legally imported from Belagavi. This was after some members of the ruling coalition spoke to the chief minister and asked him to end the impasse over the shortage of beef in the state, sources said.
 
 Recently, there have been two cases in which beef consignments were seized by the police allegedly as the meat was being illegally imported.
