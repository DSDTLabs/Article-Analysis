LUCKNOW: BJP on Saturday promised to shut slaughterhouses in UP if elected to power. The promise is a part of the party's manifesto released here on Saturday by national president Amit Shah. BJP's critics slammed the move saying it was an attempt at religious polarisation.

 Most large slaughterhouses in the state are located in western UP, and are among the highest revenue generators for the state and the country. Western UP faces a tinder box situation and remains SP's chief spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said the Centre should first ban beef export and then talk about closing slaughterhouses.“Beef export has increased sharply since the BJP-led coalition has come to power in India," he said.
 
 Congress's UP media cell communally charged since the riots in Muzaffarnagar in September 2013. chairman Satyadev Tripathi criticised the “lame“ promise, saying: “Meat exports have seen the sharpest increase under Modi government. Thereis a clear division between what they say and do. This is also nothing but a deliberate and vile at tempt by the BJP to divide people on religious lines."
 
 Commenting on BJP's other poll promises, Chaudhary said it was ironic that the BJP was talking about triple talaq and the rights of Muslim women when it had not fielded a single Muslim candidate across UP.
 
 “Both Triple Talaq and the Ram temple issue are before the  . Still, the BJP is blatantly raking these up to polarise elections.People have understood their tricks though, and won't fall into their trap, again,“ Chaudhary said.
