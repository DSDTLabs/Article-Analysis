Television actress   is celebrating her fifth wedding anniversary with husband   Aorora today (January 20). The actress took to Twitter to share the celebratory news with her fans.
 
  The couple, who were estranged for some time last year, were in limelight when they re-united in November, 2016.
  
    wrote on Twitter, "Happy wedding anniversary to us. Last year was full rollercoaster ride But still we r together thank god for your mercy and blessings @toitv."
  
  She also shared a couple of pictures of them posing together.
  
  
 
  
  After a public spat followed by an ugly divorce in February last year, actress Deepshikha Nagpal and husband   gave their marriage a second chance.
  
  They had decided to put their past behind as they felt that they are 'karmically connected'.
  
  The duo have moved in together for quite some time now.
  
  We wish them a very happy wedding anniversary.
