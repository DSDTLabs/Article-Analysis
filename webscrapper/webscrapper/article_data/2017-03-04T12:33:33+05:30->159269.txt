Piyush brings Vaidehi to the Bharadwaj house. He announces that she would live with them henceforth. Everyone in the family protests against this move including Maataji. However, Roshni tells Piyush that she is his lawfully wedded wife and that keeping Vaidehi in the house could lead to a police case, wherein Vaidehi would have to even go to the jail. While Vaidehi tries to convince Piyush that Roshni is merely threatening them, Piyush feels that she is not to be trusted. He gives Vaidehi the keys of the car and asks her to go.
 
  Roshni goes outside and just before Vaidehi is about to leave, she warns her to stay away from Piyush and her family. Roshni tells her that Piyush is her best friend and despite her attempt, Piyush didn't let her drink the poisonous juice. Vaidehi laughs at Roshni when she calls herself married and tells her that she will not live in peace until she ruins their relationship.
