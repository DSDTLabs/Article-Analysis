MUMBAI: Veermata Jijabai Bhosale Udyaan and Zoo in Byculla is expected to get a sprawling 4-acre landscaped garden in around two years at a cost of around Rs7crore. The open space will depict various climatic conditions through its design and installations. A principal nod has been sought from   commissioner  , who unveiled the plan for it in his 2018-19 budget speech. 

 While the total area of the gardens is around 53 acres, the new garden will come up in place of the old offices of the director, zoo & superintendent of gardens. The zoo & garden department has been operating from there for many decades. The offices have been shifted to the interpretation centre, which houses the Humboldt penguins. 
 
 A senior civic official said, “A presentation on the landscape designing of the garden was made before the BMC chief by a team from Rachana Sansad Academy of Architecture. The plan is to showcase climatic conditions in deserts, aquatic conditions, those in tundra regions and also in forests. Plants and flowers, which will be placed in the garden, will depict that. Elevated walkways and installations will be part of the garden.”
 
 The city’s only heritage botanical gardens and zoo was in in the news last year when it decided to hike its entry fees, which till July last year used to be Rs5 (Rs2 for children). The fees were hiked from August 2017 to Rs50 per person and a family of four is charged Rs100. This led to an almost 300% increase in monthly revenue for the zoo.
 
 Zoo director Dr Sanjay Tripathi said the new garden will take about two years to be set up. The total cost is estimated at Rs7crore as the existing office spaces will have to be demolished and the area will be flattened to house the new garden. “We want to create the garden so that students from various schools can come on educational trips,” he said.
