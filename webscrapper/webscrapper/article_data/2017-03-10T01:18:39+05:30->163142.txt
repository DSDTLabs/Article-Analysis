NAVI MUMBAI: Prices of ginger have fallen to a record low in the last 15 years in both wholesale and retail markets with abundant supplies arriving from Karnataka, besides the glut from Satara and Nashik. At the APMC, the price of ginger dropped to Rs 20-25/kg from Rs 40-50 a fortnight ago, while in retail, the price dipped to Rs 40-45/kg from Rs 60-80.

 According to market experts, the Mumbai market needs 15-18 truckloads of ginger a day. At present, 20-25 truckloads are arriving in the city daily.
 
 “Ginger, an expensive kitchen staple, was sold at Rs 100/kg a month back. Now, it has become cheaper and is priced almost as 1 kg of cauliflower, brinjal or cucumber. We are happy with the price drop,” said Mitesh Singh, a Mulund resident .
 
 While consumers are happy, farmers aren’t. “We are forced to sell our harvest below the production cost while incurring heavy losses,” said a farmer Suraj Yeole from Wai in Satara. 
 
 “Over 70% of the supply is from Bengaluru, which is pushing down the price. Farmers from Satara are no longer interested in sending the bulk to the Mumbai market due to slash in prices. I have not seen such low prices in the last 15 years,” said Balasaheb Badade, a wholesale trader. 
 
 Mukand Khaire, a retailer, said, “My clients are happy with the price slump, but their demand has remained the same.”
