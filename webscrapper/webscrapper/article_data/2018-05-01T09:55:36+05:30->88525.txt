CHANDIGARH: Former Union minister and Chandigarh MP   extended good wishes to the working class on the eve of Labour Day and said they were the wealth of the nation. 

 Bansal said these hard working men and women send a great message to the world. Sweating in scorching sun and searing heat waves, they do not waver and continue to perform their duty.
 
 "The BJP government is anti-worker. It proposed to withdraw the seven-decade old system of DC rates. Engrossed in his work, a labourer lays the foundation of a building with blood and sweat. The nation's progress is dependent on him"
