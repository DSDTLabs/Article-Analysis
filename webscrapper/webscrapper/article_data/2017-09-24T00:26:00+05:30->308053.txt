Krishnagiri: Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Saturday came down heavily on DMK and its working president M K Stalin for allegedly attempting to wreck the image of the state government and in a befitting reply listed its schemes for the people of Tamil Nadu.

 Attending the MGR centenary function in Krishnagiri, he also took a dig at the DMK for not taking up the issue of Cauvery Management Board with the Centre when it ruled the state. “They had shown interest only to get good ministerial post to their kin in the central government. They did not show any interest for Tamil Nadu schemes and people,” Palaniswami said. 
 
 The chief minister also announced 16 new schemes for Krishnagiri district. Palaniswami said he had inaugurated 33,589 schemes worth Rs.8312.99 crore across the state since he assumed charges as the CM. “Opposition party leaders are trying to damage the government’s image with an intention to capture the power. Their dream will not materialise,” he added.
 
 Palaniswami also said the law and order situation in the state was completely under control and not deteriorated as propagated by the opposition parties. “We are vigilant all the time and the people of Tamil Nadu will support us to maintain law and order in the state,” he added.
 
 Assembly speaker P Dhanpal, deputy CM O Panneerselvam and government principal secretary R Venkatesan, among others, participated in the event.
