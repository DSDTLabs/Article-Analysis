MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Thursday ordered the government to set up special wards for H1N1 patients in district headquarters hospitals in the state in four months. 

 The division bench of justices   and G R Swaminathan gave this direction on a public interest litigation filed by   from Madurai. The petitioner had sought directions to the health secretaries of the central and state governments to set up ‘biosafety laboratories’ to test ebola, flake, anthrax and swine flu (H1N1) and other dangerous viral diseases, in all government   in the state. He also sought for the setting up of isolated special wards prescribed by the  , for suspected H1N1 patients. 
 
 He told the court that the health department supplies tamiflu tablets to government hospitals, but there was no adequate infrastructure to treat those patients. Besides, the health department failed to provide special kits to find the initial stage of H1N1, it said. 
 
 The petitioner also substantiated its claim by saying that in 2014, more than 16,000 people suffered due to H1N1 across the country, of which 850 people died. In   alone, more than 30 people lost their lives. To diagnose H1N1, biosafety labs are a must in all government medical college hospitals in the state. But, such labs are existing only in Chennai and Madurai. Due to non-availability of such labs, patients who go to government hospitals in other districts are directed to go to Chennai and Madurai, the counsel said.
