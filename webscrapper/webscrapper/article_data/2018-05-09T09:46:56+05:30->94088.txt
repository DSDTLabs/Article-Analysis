PANAJI:   additional collector Vikas Gaunekar has directed the deputy collector, Tiswadi, to submit a detailed factual report on the complaint filed by Aires Rodrigues against the allegedly illegal bungalow built by power minister Pandurang   in Old Goa. 

 Last month, Rodrigues had served a legal notice to the chief secretary, North Goa collector, and the director of panchayats over the allegedly illegal construction, next to the Basilica of Bom Jesus. Rodrigues, in a letter to the Archaeological Survey of India, Goa Circle, drew their attention to the alleged violation in survey nos 144/1 and 144/2, within the prohibited 300m zone from the Basilica, which is a centrally-protected monument. He said the compound wall of the bungalow is within 50m of the Basilica. 
 
 The ASI, in its response, said that it doesnâ€™t have magisterial powers to either remove encroachments or demolish illegal structures. The ASI asked Rodrigues to approach local authorities for further action.
