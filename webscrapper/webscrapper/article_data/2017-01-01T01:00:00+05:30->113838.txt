 (Cine And TV Artists’ Association), which recently severed ties with its parent body   (Federation of Western Indian Cine Employees), is now affiliated to the International Federation of Actors ( ), headquartered at Brussels (Belgium). 
Amit Behl, Honorary Jt. Secretary and Chairman Dispute Settlement Committee, says, “FIA delegates visited our office in May, and that’s when the dialogue began. FIA, which has representatives from 83 countries, links artistes’ unions across categories. Its objective is to protect and promote artistic, economic, social and legal interests of actors, singers, dancers, circus artistes, choreographers, directors, broadcast professionals, etc.” 
 CINTAA officials have also decided to present the concerns of Indian artistes, primarily related to cinema, television, advertisement and digital, to FIA and their various affiliates across the world. 
 Amit elaborates, “India churns out a lot of content through various entertainment media, but the contract between actors and producers are one-sided here, unlike abroad. This affiliation will enable us to have a dialogue with unions across the country and even abroad. We want to draft new MoUs for the well-being of actors and producers.”
 Actor  , who has worked in a foreign TV series and is currently seen in 'POW – Bandi Yuddh Ke', says, “I think this is great news for actors like us, who are not big like the Khans or Kumars. When you have a strong union supporting your rights, you do not fear losing your job even if you don’t agree to certain terms. Earlier, I used to feel powerless whenever I signed a contract — if I didn’t agree to the producers’ terms, they’d rope in someone who would. This move will strengthen our position.”
