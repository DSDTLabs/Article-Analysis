KOLKATA: In yet another brazen display of road rage, an auto driver allegedly stopped an AC bus and smashed the driver-seat window on Wednesday. 

 The incident was reported around 2.10pm on VIP Road near Baguati Joramandir. The auto driver, identified as   (35), operates on the Baguiati-Ultadanga route. He was angry as the bus driver did not give him space to overtake. The driver of the bus —   (45) — received injuries on his hand from the shards of the smashed window.   police have lodged a non-bailable case against Mondal and arrested him under the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act. 
 
  
  
 According to police, the   b us was headed to the airport from Howrah station. As it crossed Lake Town, Mondal tried to overtake it. He had even threatened   with dire consequences at Dum Dum Park. Mondal blocked the path of the bus as the vehicles reached Joramandir. The suspect then brought out a stick and smashed the windscreen of the bus. The Baguiati police and traffic guards were immediately informed by onlookers and Mondal was nabbed. In February, an auto driver had collided with a car in food minister Jyotipriya Mullick’s convoy on the same stretch. 
 
 Even after Wednesday’s incident, autos continued to change lanes haphazardly along VIP Road, make abrupt halts and overtake buses from the left. “We have been able to tame rogue drivers to a large extent, but some of them continue to flout traffic norms,” an officer from   police said. 
 
 “There is an urgent need to control rogue auto drivers. Police need to conduct regular campaigns and keep tabs on those who violate rules. There are cases when autos go off route and take more passengers than allowed. We will also ask the unions to check backgrounds of drivers before they get permit to ply,”   had said earlier. Auto union leaders though termed the incident as an isolated one and that it was a “heat- of-the-moment” act.
