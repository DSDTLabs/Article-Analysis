Writer and producer   (Sunny Side Up) who is currently producing ' ' along with Hum Tum Telefilms shares her take on  's Day importance in a daily soap. She says,"Television is about celebrating relationships, one of the biggest relationship is love, that is the biggest emotion in this universe. So obviously we need to celebrate love. I feel youth related shows and Valentine's story always work."

 On being asked how much you relate to the concept of valentine as a producer in terms of TV soaps? she says, "If It organically fits in to your story, If you think you can do it, great, I don't like forcefully written tracks. Valentine concept perfectly fits in Badho, it will be interesting to watch this odd jodi's Valentine with a twist of comedy." Personally Dipti has no views on Valentine's Day as she adds,"I think it is a great marketing gimmick,personally it is nothing big for me." She believes romantic content is evergreen be it films or TV shows. Love has been a great seller over the years." 
 
 Intimacy depiction in television soaps has also changed over the years what is your take on that? "We also show most men topless. And intimacy depiction keeps fluctuating. Sometimes we show a big consummation say like   consummation of  , sometimes we show a conservative environment. It actually depends on the show and network as to how much you want to show the audience. For me, I would not show a lot of intimacy in Badho Bahu because it is a family drama, and the families might get uncomfortable watching it. So it depends on the target audience and channel." She further adds,"Romance is the goodness of heart. Ours is an unusual love story, two people who are not physically the same will find love for each other, it is a great love story. Audience will find love in a true sense."
