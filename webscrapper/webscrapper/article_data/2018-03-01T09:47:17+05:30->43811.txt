 HYDERABAD: While experts have been stressing on the alarming issue of childhood obesity, the latest study revealed that it was most common in kids over five years.
 
 “According to BMI (Body Mass Index), nearly 50% of the children in this pilot study between five and 18 years were overweight (31%) or obese (18.6%). The reasons were minimal physical activity, excessive usage of gadgets, sedentary lifestyle and excessive intake of high-calorie junk food and aerated drinks,” stated the report. But when it came to kids below five years, only 2.3% were overweight.
 
 So, the problem increased exponentially after the kids turned five. By the time they reached 16, they were found to be morbidly obese, said experts. The study also stressed on raising awareness.
 
 “Children are exposed to disruptions, temptations, peer pressure, and have become couch potatoes due to smart TVs, smart phones, computer applications etc. Apart from diagnosing illnesses, there is also a need to be aware that obesity can impact the progress or achievement of a child. There is a need to engage parents, children and school managements by counselling them to ensure that children adopt a healthy lifestyle,” stated the report.
