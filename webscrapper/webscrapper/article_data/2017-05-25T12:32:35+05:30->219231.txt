CUTTACK: Mountaineer   on Wednesday alleged negligence from   medical college and hospital authorities. Kalpana, the first Odia to scale  , has been undergoing treatment at the hospital since Monday after she complained of severe stomach pain. 

 She alleged that doctors neglected her and even forced her to undergo ultrasound test at a private diagnostic centre. "My ultrasound was done at SCB and the reports were clear. Still, the doctors asked me to get the same test done at a private set up again. 
 
 Later, the doctor came and asked me to get ready for surgery. I refused," Kalpana said. SCB authorities refuted the allegations. Hospital superintendent   said a special cabin has been allotted to Kalpana and all tests and medicines are being provided free of cost to her. "There is some misunderstanding," Kanungo said.
