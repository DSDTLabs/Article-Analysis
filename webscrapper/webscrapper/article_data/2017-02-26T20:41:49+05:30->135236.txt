The US travel ban on seven Muslim majority countries has led to   changing flight attendants and pilot rosters for their services to the US. Fashion designer  , who returned from the US last week, pointed at the same "as an implication that was not thought of" in his Instagram post. He wrote, "Oops...the US travel restrictions affected flight crews and made Emirates reschedule crew. An implication I did not think of." Wendell told us that his brother, who is working with Emirates, told him about the same. "There are so many air hostesses from Syria, who are part of Emirates crew flying to the US. Flights from or via Middle East to the US are long duration flights, so the crew has to make a stopover, they are jet-lagged and just can't fly immediately out of the country."

 He added, "I can't comment too much on the US policies, as I think this its something that   said throughout his electoral campaign, and by putting this travel restriction, he is fulfilling what he said to people who voted for him, but any change in law should be well thought of. Be it in India or  , when there is a change in law which is going to impact a large number of people, its implications and impact should be analyzed. You can't make a change overnight. In case of flight crews, their schedules are decided months in advance, now a sudden change is making things difficult for them."
