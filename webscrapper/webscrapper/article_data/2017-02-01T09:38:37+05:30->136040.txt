PATNA: Union secretary (security)   on Tuesday expressed concern over Bihar Police’s failure to implement Crime and   and System (CCTNS) despite the Centre bearing the entire cost of the project. The Centre has already provided Rs 25 crore out of the total Rs 68 crore earmarked to the state for implementing the project. 

 Speaking as the chief guest on the concluding day of the All India Police Championships (wrestling cluster) at   here, Kini asked ADG (headquarters) Sunil Kumar, who was present there, to take necessary steps for proper implementation of the project. “The CCTNS data base has one million fingerprint records from across the country. A study has found that it takes only 89 seconds on an average to locate a criminal’s status across the country through its website,” Kini, a 1981 batch IPS officer of Bihar cadre, said.
 
 The central government’s project aims at preparing a central database with records of all FIRs, arrested persons and their fingerprints, chargesheets, forensic reports, gang and goonda registers, station diaries and several other information of the police stations which could be accessed from anywhere in the country.
 
 The   (CCEA) of UPA-II government had approved the project on June 19, 2009, especially after the terror attack in Mumbai on November 26, 2008. “Other than Bihar, which has 1,056 police stations, Rajasthan is the only state in the country which has not implemented the project. Other states have implemented the project, even if it is at initial stage,” said an IPS officer preferring anonymity.
 
 However, Bihar police has adopted its own method to implement the Supreme Court’s order to make every FIR and details of arrested persons available in public domain. Rather than registering online, the state police are uploading FIRs and other documents after scanning them to the   (SCRB) website.
