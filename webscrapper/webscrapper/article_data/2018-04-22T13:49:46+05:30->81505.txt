ARA: Finishing touches are being given to the preparations at   and elsewhere in Bhojpur district for the three-day   celebrations beginning Monday to mark the 160th anniversary of Sepoy Mutiny that was led by Veer  .

 The main function, to be attended by CM Nitish Kuar, will also feature a drama ‘Dusadhi Badhar’ which will showcase the bonhomie between dalit farm workers and Kunwar Singh, who was a zamindar of the erstwhile estate of Jagdishpur.
 
 Explaining the significance of the drama and its social message, Ara-based theatre activist Ashok   said on Saturday people hitherto knew Kunwar only as a valiant freedom fighter who took on the British troops even at the age of 80 years and made them bite the dust. ‘Dusadhi Badhar’ will highlight a new aspect of his personality.
 
 Manav, who is playing Kunwar Singh in the drama, further said there was a local tradition, called ‘Harpouri’, as per which poor farm workers, mostly dalits, used to throw mud on the landlord when he would visit his agricultural fields at the time of ‘ropani’, or seed-sowing work, and sing “Tahar khet, hamar mehnat, hum letaim ta tu na letaiba (The field is yours, but labour is ours. If we get dirty while farming your fields, you should also get dirty”.
 
 During one such visit, Kunwar Singh noticed a young dalit girl not throwing mud at him. Asked why, she told him she considered self as his sister as he was her co-villager. Touched, Kunwar gifted her the agricultural land she was working on. The plot was as big as a village, and this village is today known as   village, Manav said.
 
 The drama has been written by  . According to drama director Anil Tiwari alias Deepu Jee, the cast includes 42 actors. While Manav will play elderly Kunwar, Birendra Ojha Bum will play young Kunwar.
