CHENNAI: Employees who were working in   that were shut in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling that had ordered the closure of   operating within the vicinity of 500m from highways, have got a ray of hope for getting transferred to other government departments. 

 The state owned marketing corporation is likely to issue applications to the employees soon, who are willing to be transferred to existing vacancies in the cooperative department, official sources said. “The government has not taken any policy decision on their transfers. But, we have been asked to give applications to employees seeking transfer to the cooperative department,” the official said.
 
 Dhanasekaran, general secretary of the Tamil Nadu   Union affiliated, to AITUC, said the number of wine shops has decreased to 3,500 from around 6,800 due to the directive of the apex court and the state government’s decision to close 1,000 liquor outlets. “With people strongly objecting to reopening wine shops, the state should decide on the number of liquor shops it can operate. Thereafter, it should retain the number of employees required for the respective shops and transfer the remaining to the cooperative department,” he said.
