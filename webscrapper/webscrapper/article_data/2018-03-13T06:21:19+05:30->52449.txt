BATHINDA: The criminal investigation department (CID) wing of Haryana police is investigating how 258 passports, issued from various regional passport offices over the years, reached Chakeria village near Kalanwali in Sirsa district.

 It is also investigating whether it was a ploy to throw the passports at a small village or employees of the now-closed immigration firm of Ludhiana, where the passports were deposited for visas six months ago, had thrown these at Chakeria. Police have also written to the regional passport offices (RPOs) at Chandigarh, Jalandhar and Amritsar to verify the authenticity of these passports. Residents of Chakeria on March 10 had spotted 258 passports in the village and reported the matter to police after which the Kalanwali police had taken the passports into their custody.
 
 Out of 258 passports, 17 were issued from foreign countries and one each from Patna, Dehradun and Ahmedabad. A maximum of 109 passports were issued from Jalandhar, followed by 98 from Chandigarh office and 31 from Amritsar.
 
 Hisar DSP (CID) Virender Singh said during initial investigations it had come to their notice that many persons had deposited their passports with a Ludhiana-based immigration firm, SSO Private Limited. He said after a protest by some passport holders of getting them wrong visas, the firm had locked its office on September 19, 2017.
 
 The DSP added when owners had demanded their passports back, they were told that those had been stolen. “After a few months, the immigration firm reached a compromise with the passport holders and complaints were filed at suvidha kendras at some places after which some of them got new passports. It could not be known how many new passports were issued,” he said, adding that out of the seized passports, 17 were issued by foreign countries where the document holders might have got permanent residency status.
