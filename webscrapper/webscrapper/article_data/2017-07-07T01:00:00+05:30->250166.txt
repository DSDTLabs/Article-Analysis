He may have played a guy in a live-in relationship on screen, but  , who will be seen in ' ' is quite averse to the idea in real life. By his own admission, he has never been in a live-in relationship. He says, “Call me old-school, but personally, I would never want to be in a live-in relationship. I don’t think I am cut out for that. I would like to straightaway get married when I find that special someone.”

Ask him to share some tips and he replies, “It’s all about knowing each other. Going in for a live-in is a huge step as it means allowing someone in your ultimate private space.
