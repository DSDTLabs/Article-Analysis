HYDERABAD: While district health officials insist that there have been only five   deaths in Telangana since January 1, the toll, sources say, could be much higher. Reason: the lack of a mechanism to monitor deaths in private hospitals.

 Sample this: On January 10, a four-year-old boy was detected as   positive while undergoing treatment at a corporate hospital in  . While the boy, a resident of Nizamabad and son of a chicken seller, succumbed to the swine flu virus on January 24 — after more than 10 days on ventilator support — his death is yet to be officially recorded.
 
 “I had to sell my house to raise money for his treatment that cost somewhere around Rs 8 lakh, including Rs 50,000 per day ICU charges. He was my only son,” said the father (name withheld on request). He added that he could not utilise his Aarogyasri card to avail free treatment for his son.
 
 In fact, the corporate hospital referred the ailing boy to   at the last stage when it became clear that he had slim chances of surviving. “He died within 15 minutes of being shifted to Niloufer,” the father said.
 
 Medical experts in the city said that corporate hospitals fleece patients undergoing swine flu treatment every year, thanks to the lack of government guidelines on management of H1N1 patients.
 
 “Private hospitals charge exorbitantly and do not even counsel the patients’ families on the likely outcome. When cases go out of control, they ask them to go to government hospitals,” said  , founder, NGO Helping Hand Foundation, while appealing to the government to urgently arrest the trend.
 
 Speaking to TOI, a health official said, “They do not even inform us if patients die during the course of treatment.”
 
 Meanwhile, 10 more patients tested positive for swine flu on Saturday, taking the total number of confirmed positive cases since January 1 to more than 110.
