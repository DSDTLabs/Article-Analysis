The major protection giant is set to continue to add value to the individual   (APE) in the fourth quarter of one of the most sought-after private life insurance company  . As per the report by Spark Capital, the company is expecting a full year APE growth, which is 35 per cent year-on-year for the Financial Year 2017-18.

 HDFC Life will announce its Q4 and annual results for FY18 today on April 18, 2017.
 
 As per the report, while the growth could be average in Q4 for the company, it would remain pretty strong for the entire year on a low base. It added that the value of new business (VNB) margins and the operating return of embedded value (ROEV) will all-in-all remain stable.
 
 But, it said that the increase in margin because of the rise in higher protection business will not be taken into consideration by an increase in costs. Increase in protection business is directly related to an increase in margins. The company expects the VNV margins to rise to 22.2 per cent.
