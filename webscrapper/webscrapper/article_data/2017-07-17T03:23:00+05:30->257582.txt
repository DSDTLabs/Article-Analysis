Narkhed: Salim Shah, 32, was remanded to police custody for a day by Judicial magistrate first class NS Puri after Jalalkheda police produced him before the Narkhed court on Sunday. A day ago, Shah was picked up from his residence at Hattikhana in Katol after the Regional forensic science laboratory (RFSL) Nagpur confirmed the meat in possession of the accused was beef in an unprecedented prompt exercise.  The extent to which the chemical analysis report was hastened in the case of Shah can be realized by the fact that the confirmation in the 10 tonnes meat seized by Pachpaoli police of city on April 20 earlier this year is yet to come. In Shah’s case, the meat was seized on July 12. The report was sent to SP’s office on July 15. RFSL, which has managed to compile the report in less than three days for rural police in Shah’s case, did not send report in Pachpaoli police case for it’s action around three months ago.  It has come to fore now that Jalalkheda police had sought two days’ custody from court for nabbing the butcher at Amner village in Warud tehsil of Amravati from whom the beat was purchased. Sources said the butcher had fled from the place after learning about the police action. Rural police is now coordinating with their Amravati counterparts for helping them nab the butcher who is a native of Qureshi community.
