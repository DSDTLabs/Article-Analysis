Ajmer: The   Dalit Hatyakand Sangarsh Samiti on Wednesday issued an ultimatum to the state government that they would contest the upcoming bypolls to Lok Sabha seats in Ajmer and Alwar independently if all the accused in the Dangawas incident were not arrested in the next five days.

 Speaking on the issue, state coordinator Dharmpal Kataria said the CBI has identified and chargesheeted 40 accused in the case, but only 17 of them have been arrested so far. The rest are roaming freely, giving the message that the BJP government is not with the Dalit community.
 
 Members of the Samiti said that BJP has failed to protect the weaker sections of the society and even chief minister Vasundhra Raje, who met leaders of many castes ahead of the elections, failed to meet Dalit leaders when she came to Ajmer. “The Congress too is against Dalits and no senior leader of the party has come forward to condemn the Dangawas atrocity,” said Kanaram Kantiwal, assistant coordinator of the organization.
 
 The committee member said that to show that they would not support any party and put up their own candidates in the bypolls. “The victims of Dangawas atrocities have still not received relief from the state government as promised,” added Kataria.
 
 They also condemned the violence in Maharashtra and said that people who were against celebrations by Dalits were those who do not believe in the Constitution of India. “The saffron groups are giving BJP a bad name. It will result in Dalits moving away from this party,” claimed Kantiwal.
 
 Meanwhile, sources said the Samiti was trying put pressure on both political parties by announcing their intention to contest the bypolls.
