NEW DELHI:   will spend the maximum of Rs 207 crore — Rs 51,728 crore per capita — to improve basic urban infrastructure relating to water supply, sewerage and drainage networks, non-motorised transport and open spaces by 2020 under the Amrut scheme. Over 120 other big cities will spend more than Rs 150 crore each during this period. 

 These works will be taken under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut), one of the key initiatives for improving civic infrastructure in small and big cities.
 
 So far, the urban development ministry has approved Rs 37,000 crore for 298 mission cities in 21 states for the entire scheme period up to 2019-20. According to ministry officials, Itanagar will see the second highest per capita spending at Rs 23,701while Shimla and Kullu will see spending of a little more than Rs 20,000 per person. In most other states, per capita investment is in the range of Rs 4,000 to Rs 5,000.
 
 Under Amrut scheme, investments in water supply to ensure water taps in all urban households along with ensuring supply of 135 litres per capita per day is the first priority. Laying sewerage and drainage lines is the second thrust area and developing at least one park every year in each of the 500 mission cities is mandatory under Amrut guidelines. The Modi government had rolled out this mission after UPA’s urban rejuvenation programme JNNURM ended.
 
 To make Amrut effective, the Centre has given freedom to states to plan their expenditure provided under the scheme.
