Trichy: Once BJP comes to power in Karnataka, it would take all the necessary steps to ensure Cauvery water is released for Tamil Nadu, stated BJP state president Dr S Tamilisai Soundararajan here on Friday. Tamilisai, who met the reporters at Trichy airport, also said that the central government had so far been taking only a clear and right approach regarding the Cauvery issue. Stating that she was very confident about BJP coming into power in Karnataka, Tamilisai said that the central government had sought more time for bringing a solution to Cauvery issue only for the right reasons. “Centre has taken sometime only to ensure that no issues arise and a permanent solution is attained,” she said. Only after considering all this, even the Supreme Court has directed the Centre to submit a draft scheme on May 14, she added. Mentioning that the central government has not shied away from responsibility, she also said that it was maintaining transparency over its moves regarding the Cauvery issue. Tamilisai said that once BJP comes into power in Karnataka, the party would take all the necessary steps to release 4 tmc water and provide the monthly share to TN. She said that when it comes to the Cauvery issue, BJP was only being targeted. “Even after Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah refused to release 4 tmc water, no one questioned or criticised him. Only BJP is being targeted unduly,” she claimed. Meanwhile, she said that the discussion regarding a possible BJP-Rajinikanth alliance would be considered only if and post the actor launches his party.
