 The HC also asked state DGP LM Khaute and senior Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) officials to submit a detailed report on the supply of fuel to the commodities-starved state. 
 
 The HC's order came a day after the UNC decided to continue the blockade while the   (ECI) began the poll process in the state. The ECI on Tuesday issued a notification for the first phase of polls in 38 constituencies of the state.
 
 Union home ministry joint secretary (northeast in charge) Satyendra Garg, who visited Imphal, tried to facilitate communication between the Okram Ibobi Singh-led Congress government and the UNC. Sources said Garg spoke to UNC leaders in a bid to end the impasse.
 
 Additional chief secretary (home) Suresh Babu told TOI on Wednesday that there is no update on the situation. 
 
 The Manipur government appealed to the UNC to reconsider its decision and withdraw the economic blockade, keeping in view the sufferings of the people living both in the valley and the hills. The government also urged the UNC to honour the understanding arrived at during the tripartite meeting in New Delhi on February 3. 
 
 State chief secretary   in a statement said, during the tripartite talks, an agreement was signed by representatives of the MHA, the Manipur government and the UNC, wherein it was agreed that issues related to the creation of new districts would be discussed at the next tripartite meeting.
