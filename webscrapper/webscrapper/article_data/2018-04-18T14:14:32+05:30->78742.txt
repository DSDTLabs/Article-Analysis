Even before tourism could make this   famous, the majestic   beach in Salcete was South Goa’s answer to North Goa’s Calangute.

 Along with its white sands and shells, Colva had gained fame not just for its seashore, but also the ‘Fama’ of Menino Jesus (Infant Jesus) that annually draws thousands of devotees from across Goa.
 
 Says Nandkumar Kamat, professor,  , “The Kols and closely-related Mundaris were the first settlers here. Today, the Kols in Goa are represented by Hindu Gavda and   tribals. The etymology of Colva can be explained as Col + vhal (‘vhal’ means stream) meaning a settlement of Kol people near or close to a stream. Topographically and hydrographically, this fits Colva which has a large, wide and distinct creek draining on the beach and discharging into the Arabian Sea.”
 
 Colva has a nine-ward village panchayat. It has four ‘vadde’ (vaddo: singular, meaning traditional village ward) including Primeiro Bairo, Segundo Bairo, Terceiro Bairo and Quarto Bairo.
 
 The nearby villages of Sernabatim, Vanelim and Gandaulim are part of the Colva village panchayat.
 
 Historically, Colva, Sernabatim, Vanelim and Gandaulim are separate comunidade villages, but were brought under one panchayat for administration after 1963.
 
 Villagers share several stories. Over six decades ago, a resident, Dr José da  , was shattered by the demise of his young wife. He had her body embalmed and her tomb has a prominent place in the cemetery opposite the Colva church.
 
 “During my childhood, Colva was sparsely populated and was a pleasant village to live in. The 1990s brought an uncontrolled growth in tourism, with a number of migrants coming in and the village getting crowded. The clean Colva creek has now been turned into a gutter,” says Carmo Rodrigues of Quarto Bairo.
