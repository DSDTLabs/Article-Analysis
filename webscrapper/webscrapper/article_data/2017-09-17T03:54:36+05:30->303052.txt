ALLAHABAD: With barely a week left for Dussehra procession, scheduled to commence from September 20, several roads on which these processions would pass are in bad shape. From past several decades, Ram Dal is being taken out in various localities of   area including Muttiganj, Kydganj, Batasa Mandi, Loknath, Zero road, Ram Bhawan crossing, Kotapracha, Hatia crossing, Bharti Bhawan Road.
 
 Conditions of the main roads of these localities is in such a bad shape that the locals as well as the organisers of these procession and the ramlila committee have complaints to the authorities of   (AMC) but to no avail.
  
 After failing to get any positive response from the local authorities, the office bearer of the Pajawa Ramlila committee have written to the chief minister, seeking his intervention on the issue. The organisers have mentioned that since the procession, which would start on the night of September 20 (with the procession of  ), would have large chariots and howdah tied over elephants, it is very risky for the actors enacting the role of Ram, Sita, Laxman and other character of Ramayana.
  
 The organisers have also complaint that these roads are damaged at several places and after the rains, the potholes have become more dangerous. Commenting on the issue, GP Mani, general manager, Ganga Pollution Control Unit, said, “the hot mixing plant was not functioning for past many days and the same has started since two days and we have already repaired two major roads at   and Ram Bhawan crossing and will repair all the roads well before start of Dushhera processions”.
