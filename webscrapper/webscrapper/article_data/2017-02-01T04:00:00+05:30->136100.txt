Vadodara: An elderly woman, suffering from mental disorder, was cheated by three persons between 2008 and 2014. A complaint was registered against the trio at Manjalpur police station on Monday night. The woman Maiyat Pushpakumari was staying alone at her residence in Manjalpur and hence a caretaker was hired to look after her. 

 “The caretaker Saudagar Yadav, a resident of Gorwa, joined hands with Shailendrasinh Thakor and Dhiraj Sharma and prepared fake documents of her property. They also took her signatures and finger prints on it. She was not able to understand which documents she had signed on,” said Manjalpur police sub-inspector, N I Rathod. The complaint was lodged by one Chirantan Tripathi, the lady’s neighbour.
 
 The accused took advantage of the victim’s condition as her son Buddhivardhan Oza stays in the US. They prepared a fake will with the help of backdated stamp papers and transferred the property owned by Pushpakumari in their names.
