PUNE: A pervert harassed a homeopath in   by exposing his genitalia to her. The incident happened late on Tuesday evening.

 She lodged a police complaint on Thursday following which the unidentified man was booked under   section 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty). The Warje Malwadi police are going through   footage from the area to track him down. 
 
 At 8pm on Tuesday, she was alone in her clinic when the suspect came in under the pretext of seeking treatment. He lay down on a bench there. “He suddenly pulled down his pants and exposed himself to her,” a police officer said.
 
 The suspect asked her to treat him. “Shocked, the homeopath asked him to leave. He fled the area,” the officer said, adding that the man was unknown to the homeopath, and that it was the first time he came to the clinic. 
 
 After discussing this with her family, she approached the police. “We are checking CCTV footage from the area to ascertain his identity,” the officer said.
