PANAJI: The   ( ) on Thursday said   (GFP) was never in favour of an alliance with the Congress because it had a pre-poll alliance with the  , which ultimately caused a breakdown in post-election negotiations.

 Speaking to reporters at the party’s headquarters for the first time after having failed to prove a majority on the floor of the house, Congress state president Luizinho Faleiro said although the party had the support of 21 legislators on the night of March 11, it had still tried to reach out to Fatorda MLA, Vijai Sardessai.
 
 “If MGP and GFP could give conditional letters of support to the BJP, they could have also given us a letter of support stating that Luizinho Faleiro should not be the chief minister,” Faleiro said.
 
 He also refuted suggestions that talks with GFP broke down because Congress refused to consent to Sardessai’s demand that   MLA Digambar Kamat be nominated as the Congress Legislature Party (CLP)leader.
 
 “To be chief minister is not my reward. Some GFP mentors met me and I told them I am ready to make whatever sacrifice is needed because the biggest enemy is the BJP,” Faleiro said.
 
 Challenging GFP’s charge that the Congress had failed to ensure a coalition of like-minded parties, Congress said the fledgling regional party’s decision to contest the poll in Velim and Saligao, along with Fatorda MLA elect Vijai Sardessai’s open support to BJP, thwarted the pre-poll alliance.
 
 “I was informed not to issue B-Forms (proof that a particular candidate is put up by a political party) in Panaji, Porvorim, Fatorda and Siolim but later on, when the AICC leaders came to know that there were   candidates in Velim and Saligao, there were instructions to issue the B-Forms. So it was never a decision at the state level, it was always a decision at the AICC level,” Faleiro said.
