 The rape survivor’s mother also alleged that the accused lured her elder daughter on the pretext of marriage.

She also alleged that Vipin raped her younger daughter twice in last six months.
 
 “The accused lived in their neighborhood with his sister and brother-in-law. Last Friday, he eloped with my 19-year-old daughter. The accused sent photographs of marriage with my daughter to their friends on Whatsapp. They got married in an Arya Samaj Mandir. On Tuesday, my younger daughter told me that she was raped by Vipin. Following this, I decided to approach police and file a complaint against him,” said the girl’s mother. 
 
 “My daughter kept quiet since she feared that he would attack her. He, however, taking advantage of this, raped her again a month ago. He then lured my elder daughter and eloped,” she said.
