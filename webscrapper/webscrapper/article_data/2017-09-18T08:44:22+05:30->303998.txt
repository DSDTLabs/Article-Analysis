HYDERABAD: Hyderabad may have emerged as one of the safest metro for   to live in, but they also shell out more from their pockets for rent, a new survey by an online rental company said.
According to the survey, conducted across major cities in the country, Pune emerged as the second safest city for women, closely followed by Bengaluru.
 
 A majority of the respondents surveyed were from Madhapur, Gachibowli and   areas. While rents in Hyderabad were found to be lower than other metros, women in Hyderabad were found to be shelling out more for their accommodations, the survey said.
 
 "It revealed how women were willing to pay more than 50% of their monthly salaries towards rent. While affordability and proximity to the workplace emerged as key factors for men, while hunting for rental accommodation for women, the top reason was safety. In Hyderabad, women were found to be willing to live more than five or 10 kilometres away from their workplace, taking the safety aspect into consideration," pointed out Amarendra Sahu, co-founder and CEO of  , which began operations in Hyderabad more than one year ago.
 
 According to the survey, while the average rent per month for male respondents from Hyderabad was pegged at Rs 6,900, for female respondents, it stood at Rs 7,250.
 
 It is only in Hyderabad where such a disparity was observed between monthly rents coughed up by male and female tenants.
 
 There are thousands of rental homes across Hyderabad with Madhapur, Gachibowli and Kondapur, leading the prime locations.
 
 "Many a times, feeling safe in a new city is the number one priority for young working professionals. A majority of our customers from Hyderabad work in the IT, ITeS and financial sectors. Living in such an accommodation, without a lock-in period, allows a lot of flexibility to professionals who may have to relocate as part of their work," said Sahu.
