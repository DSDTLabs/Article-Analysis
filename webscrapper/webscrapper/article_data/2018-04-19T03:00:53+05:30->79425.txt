MUMBAI: Trees affected due to   or road-widening work or other infrastructure projects can now find a resting place on   premises. CR general manager DK Sharma said, "We have transplanted several trees affected by the underground project." The survival rate of these transplanted trees is around 50%, he said. 

 In all, 45 trees affected by Metro underground project have been transplanted at   (CSMT). Sharma said that the railways will allow open spaces near platform 18 of CSMT, LTT and other stations.
 
 CR will write to the state government about its plan to allot these places for transplantation. The law requires three trees to be planted before a tree is cut.
