KOLKATA: The HC order of a   into the Narada sting cast its shadow on the   session on Saturday. Even as mayor Sovan Chatterjee-apparently seen on the Narada tape accepting cash-made to present the budget, Left councillors raised a protest, drowning his voice out, demanding his resignation. 

 Four BJP and two Congress councillors joined their Left Front counterparts, trooped into the well and tried to disrupt the proceedings. This, in turn, apparently angered   councillors, who formed a ring around the mayor. Though initially taken aback, Chatterjee quickly regained his composure and continued to read out the budget speech, but hardly any councillor seemed to listen. 
 
 Even as CPM's Mritunjay Chakraborty was taken out by a few Trinamool councillors, two opposition councillors fell to the ground, injuring themselves. Chatterjee rushed through his budget speech and returned to his chamber amid tight security. 
 
 "The budget sessions used to be attended by Chittaranjan Das and Subhas Bose. Now we have a mayor, whose name figures in a scam," said CPM's Ratna Kar Majumdar.
 
 Stating nothing was proved in   yet, Chatterjee later held the Opposition responsible for creating a ruckus.
