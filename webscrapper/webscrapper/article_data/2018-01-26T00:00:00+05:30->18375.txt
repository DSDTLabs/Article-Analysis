The masquerade party hosted by   to mark the New Year, turned out to be a fun filled affair. The cold weather did not deter the guests who came in large numbers, prepared to chill out till late night. The entire venue was in sync with the theme of the bash. Eye masks were not only seen perched on the pretty noses of the ladies but large cut out were part of the d√©cor as well. With   playing numbers like Tenu Suit Suit Karda, Tujhe Jo Dekha Yar and Despacito, soon the entire dance floor swelled with people.
