PANAJI: A speeding vehicle on the   bypass ran into three cows on Thursday just after 6am, killing them on the spot. The number of cattle deaths on this stretch are on the rise.

 The car was damaged in the accident and fire and emergency services personnel removed the carcasses lying on the four-lane highway.
 
 A week ago, three cattle were killed at the   junction near Our Lady of Conception chapel at Chinchwada, Chimbel.
 
 Three cattle were injured and one killed in an accident a fortnight ago near Sai Baba temple. “Cattle are being killed regularly on this bypass road and it is high time the Chimbel panchayat set up a cattle pound behind the panchayat premises,” Tukaram Kunkolkar, a local resident said.
