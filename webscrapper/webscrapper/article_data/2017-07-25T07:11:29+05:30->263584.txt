JAIPUR: The   has reversed the history of India by officially endorsing the “alternative view“ about the fate of the famous  .

 Maharana Pratap defeated Mughal emperor Akbar in the battle of Haldighati in 1576, says the revised Class X social science textbook introduced in the current session.
 
 “Neither was the battle of Haldighati inconclusive, nor was it won by Akbar. In fact, Pratap who was defending his motherland, succeeded in his ambition while Mughal Emperor Abkar's forces, having imperialistic ambition, failed in taking over Mewar,“ the book reads.
 
 Further,   University's history department has also replaced the term Medieval History (1200 AD-1700 AD) with 'Struggling India' and Ancient History (600 BC-1200 AD) with 'Golden Era of India'.
 
 These additions are intended to redefine historical accounts which the department claims have been written by Leftist historians to “create an inferiority complex in the minds of Indians“.
 
 The second chapter of the textbook `Struggling India' begins with the rule of the Delhi Sultanate and conclu des with the end of Mughal ruler Aurangzeb's era in 1707 AD. The chapter highlights the `jaziya tax' levied on nonMuslims by Aurangzeb and elaborately mentions about Emperor Akbar's Din-e-Ilahi.
 
 A panel of academicians was given the task of rewriting the Class X social science textbook to demolish a false narrative that Indians surrendered to foreign aggression-socially, culturally and politically, creating an impression that the invaders were of a superior race.
 
 “I have demolished the centuries-old British and Leftist-sponsored premise by highlighting facets that even after Bharat Mahadveep lost political ground to invaders he never lost religious and cultural leadership,“ says noted historian CS Sharma, who had written both the chapters.
