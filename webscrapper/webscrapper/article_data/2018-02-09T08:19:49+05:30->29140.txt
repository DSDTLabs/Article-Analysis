LUCKNOW: The   who were accused of   of a   during a surgery in 2015 have been absolved of all charges.

  dismissed the petition filed by patient   (39) on February 3.
 
 Sanjeev was operated upon by Dr Aneesh Srivastava and seven more doctors for kidney stone removal. After the surgery, he underwent ultrasound to find a kidney missing. He approached government authorities claiming his kidney was fraudulently removed.
 
 However, SGPGI produced a consent letter that Sanjeev and his kin had signed saying his kidney could be removed if needed for treatment. The case was closed but Sanjeev moved Barabanki court.
 
 Advocate Pranshu Agarwal, who represented SGPGI, said he received the order on Wednesday.
 
 “Additional district and sessions judge rejected Sanjeev’s plea and absolved the group,” said Agarwal.
 
 Chief medical superintendent of SGPGI Dr Amit Agarwal said, “If Sanjeev has levelled false allegations, he should be held accountable under IPC sections 181and 182.”
