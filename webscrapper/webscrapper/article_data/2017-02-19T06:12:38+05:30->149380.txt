CHENNAI: Former   O Panneerselvam on Saturday said people will decide whether passage of the Edappadi K Palaniswami government's   in the assembly was valid or not, and said, “Dharma will win.“

 Panneerselvam told reporters: “We had two demands: One, send the AIADMK legislators, who had been staying at resort in Koovathur, home for a week. Let them meet people and then vote. But that didn't happen.Will people now welcome MLAs? We also wanted a secret ballot. But speaker didn't agree,“ he said.
 
 Panneerselvam said DMK legislators were evicted before voting. He said, “People whom Amma didn't want are back in politics.“ OPS said he and his supporters will meet governor if there was need for it. Former school education minister K Pandiarajan, who is in the OPS camp, said: “If there had been a secret ballot, MLAs would have voted against Palaniswami. We may have lost the battle but the war has just begun.“
