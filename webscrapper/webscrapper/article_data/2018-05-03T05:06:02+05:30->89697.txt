AHMEDABAD:   on Wednesday said that it is time to put a brake on builders who dupe common people by not giving possession of houses after taking their hard-earned money.

 With this observation, Justice J B Pardiwala denied   to an owner of Vishwanath Procon Pvt Ltd, Sunny Sharma, who accepted Rs 6 lakh from a customer, but did not give possession of the flat for five years.
 
 Taking a serious note of the issue of builders duping people, Justice J B Pardiwala said the court has noticed at least one such case coming up daily before the high court. It was high time that such practice was stopped. Builders should not be permitted to get away with people’s hard-earned money, and the victims must not feel that they are alone, but that the court is with them, said the court.
 
 According to case details, a retired bank employee, Dashrath Tiwari, had paid Rs 6 lakh to Sharma’s firm in 2012 towards agreement of sale for a flat in Geratpur area with condition that the   would give possession of the flat the next year. The customer had to pay Rs 2 lakh more, which he did not pay because the scheme remained under construction for years.
 
 Fed up with the builder’s approach, Tiwari issued a legal notice to Sharma demanding either possession of the flat or refund of the money. Sharma refused to budge, and Tiwari lodged an FIR with Navrangpura police accusing the builder and his firm of  .
 
 The high court asked Sharma to return the money, but he submitted that it was unacceptable to hime and rather he would give possession to Tiwari once he paid him the remaining Rs 2 lakh. This led the court to say that he was not entitled to pre-arrest bail, said Tiwari’s advocate Nishith Thakkar.
