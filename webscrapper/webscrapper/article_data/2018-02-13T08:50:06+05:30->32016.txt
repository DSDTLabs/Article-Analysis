CHANDIGARH: Shiromani Akali Dal ex-servicemen wing president General J J   (retired) on Monday asked the   government to fill all the vacancies reserved for ex-servicemen on priority. He even made a demand for protection of their rank upon their re-appointment in police jobs.

 After addressing first meeting of the ex-servicemen wing at the SAD headquarters, he said the   government should not make excuses for not filling the 13% ex-servicemen quota in the government jobs. He also asked the state government to provide skill development to ex-servicemen wherever needed so that posts under ex-servicemen quota do not remain unfilled.
 
 General Singh said he had received feedback from ex-servicemen that they were not getting rank equivalence when they joined the state police. He assured them that he would take up the issue forcefully with the government.
 
 The ex-servicemen wing president added there was a general feeling among ex-servicemen was that they were not getting due respect in government offices. “Veterans are not being treated with the respect they deserve. The government should take corrective measures and give appropriate directions to resolve this issue immediately,” he added.
 
 Demanding an increase in compensation to all servicemen who were martyred in the call of duty, he said the present compensation being given to their families was very little.
 
 The SAD is going to expand its ex-servicemen wing, starting from the village level, he said.
