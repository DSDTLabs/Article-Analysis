COIMBATORE: Members of micro industry associations on Tuesday said they would approach the government to reduce the GST rate to 5% from 18% for micro firms involved in job work as raw material prices have shot up post the implementation of the new tax regime. At a meeting held here,  , president of Kovai Power Driven Pumps and Spares Manufacturers Association ( ),  , the price of raw materials such as stainless steel rods and copper stamping have gone up by 15% to 20%.

 “The government had said there would be tax exemption for firms with a turnover below Rs 20 lakh. But that seems to be an eyewash. We are paying 18% to 28% GST to buy spares and materials for making pump sets. As a result, our working capital has shot up,” he said.
