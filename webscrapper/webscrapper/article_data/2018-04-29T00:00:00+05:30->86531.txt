Rupinder Pal Singh,  , spills the bean of his de-stress mantra...

 
  Balance of mind is extremely important. It helps you maintain focus. I meditate and make sure I take a good vacation. 
 
  I try not to complain about things. It is very important to believe in yourself and stay motivated. Always surround yourself with positive people. 
 
 I want to make my country proud. 
 
 Happiness in little things.
 
  Winning motivates you to perform better; while losing is a lesson. 
 
  It’s no rocket science – keep it simple just by addressing the problem. 
 
  Exercise regularly, stay hydrated and rest well.
 
 I live by my father’s motto: No matter how successful you become, stay humble, stay grounded! I want to give my best, stand tall as a defender and score like a champion.
 
  I never play for records! 
 
 Winning.
 
 Eat, train and rest.
