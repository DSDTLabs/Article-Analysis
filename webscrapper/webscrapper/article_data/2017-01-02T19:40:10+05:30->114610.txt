LUCKNOW: Taking strong exception of Prime Minister  's veiled attack on   as a party which was only bothered about saving money, BSP chief   on Monday said that the PM should instead disclose where and how his party got the money adjusted and invested ever since the demonetisation scheme came into effect on November 8, last year.

 Mayawati further sharpened her attack on   saying that BJP National President   was not able to convince the people that Modi was a 'UP wallah'. Insisting that  's speech was unable to evoke the requisite response among the people, Mayawati said that the rally was a 'flop show' and the crowd which BJP leaders talked about essentially comprised more of security staff and few 'hired' people.
 
 The BSP boss also criticized hike in prices of LPG, petrol and diesel at a time when people were still grappling with the aftereffects of demonetisation, adding that even after a period of 50 days, there was no relief for the people.
