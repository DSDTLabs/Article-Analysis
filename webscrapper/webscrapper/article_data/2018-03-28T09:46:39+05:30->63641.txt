PUNE: A new   hold   was thrown open to   this week on the first floor of the   airport’s terminal building, giving them some “breathing” space.

 “The new area, measuring 475sqm, was added after shifting the offices of the airlines and the Airports Authority of India (AAI) from there. This is the second security hold area for passengers and all required facilities have been provided there. With this, the capacity of the security hold area in the   has increased,” Pune airport director Ajay Kumar said.
 
 The new security hold area has different facilities, including proper seating arrangements. “The old security hold area of the airport has a seating capacity of around 2,100 people. The new area has a seating capacity of around 300 people. Two new toilets — one for ladies and one for gents — have been provided besides special fans having LED lights and folding blades,” another official said.
 
 Jatin Kher, an entrepreneur, told TOI, “Space constraint is a big issue at the airport. Two weeks ago, I had to board a late evening flight to Delhi. The entire airport was packed and there was no place to sit. As I chose to stand, I could see many passengers seated on the ground. More space is the need of the hour for an airport which is growing,”
 
 Flyers wait at the security hold area of an airport after the security check. “It is a sterile area, where passengers wait for boarding the aircraft. By sterile area, one means that after passing through the area, the passengers are not allowed to mix with anyone outside the area,” aviation expert and analyst Dhairyashil Vandekar, told TOI.
