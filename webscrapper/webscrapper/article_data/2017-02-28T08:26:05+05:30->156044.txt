New Delhi: Feeling slighted by the family of his  , a man decided to   the woman’s nephew in   area on Sunday. 

 Mohd Kapil demanded a ransom of Rs 5 lakh just to teach the family a lesson. But a four-year-old girl had seen him kidnap the child, and she helped the police nab him. 
 
 A woman filed a police complaint with the Netaji Subhash Place police station about her son being kidnapped. “Preliminary probe suggested someone close to the family to be involved in it,” said additional DCP (northwest) Vijayanta Arya. 
 
 The family told the police that two men on a scooter had been captured on   camera taking the child towards Trinagar. The girl witness had also told them that the men had lured the child away. 
 
 Around 7am the next day, the woman received a ransom call of Rs 5 lakh. 
 
 Police traced the ransom call to a public booth in Trinagar. By then, they had also prepared sketches of the two suspects. They also got to know that the woman’s sister had an affair with Kapil, much to the chagrin of the family. 
 
 Police confronted Kapil with the evidence at his   house. Kapil told cops that he hatched the plot with his friend   and a juvenile.
 
 Police said they planned to keep the child there for a while before killing him.
