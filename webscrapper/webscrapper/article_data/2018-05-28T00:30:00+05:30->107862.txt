Guntur: A man impregnated a 16-year-old girl at Muttamshettipalem near Tenali in Guntur district. Shockingly, he was in a live-in relationship with the girl’s mother from the last few months. He raped the girl multiple times when her mother was not at home and the issue only came to light after she became pregnant. Jallimilli Venkateswara Rao (55), a native of Ponnur, works as a mason. The girl’s mother on Sunday lodged a complaint against him. The accused is on the run and the girl has been admitted to government hospital for medical examination. tnn
