LUCKNOW: Isabella Thoburn College’s 32 students are in trouble as Lucknow University declared their   with Computer Applications invalid and refused to conduct their examination stating that the subject opted was no more offered in arts stream. Last year, the university had reduced some subject combinations and had directed colleges not to enroll students in them.

 “Last year, university had reduced number of subject combinations in BA and had directed colleges not to enrol students in them.   was also informed but still the college enrolled students in subjects no more offered,” said LU registrar Raj Kumar Singh.
 
 
 The aggrieved students have been making rounds to university   for more than a week to save their year.
 
 “It’s not our fault, then why are we being made to suffer? It’s strange that LU is not aware that its affiliated colleges are enrolling students in subjects not offered any more. They should have asked for a list of subjects from the college,” said Ayesha Srivastava (name changed). “The university should give solution to a problem instead of shirking responsibility and blaming the college,” said Priya.
 
 IT College principal   said that   was being offered in BA subject combinations since 1995 and university’s admission committee can’t cancel a subject that was approved by the executive council.
 
 “Sudden cancellation of a vocational subject in LU’s admission committee meeting cannot be accepted as it had been approved by executive council, the apex body for approving academic changes,” she said.
 
 She said the college had informed university last year that it’s a   approved subject hence it should not be removed. “The college has been writing to the university since last year to know about the status,” she said.
