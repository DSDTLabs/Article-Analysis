Ahmedabad: The next breakthrough in solar cells that can harness the sunâ€™s energy will come with the application of nano-technology that can help manufacture thin film solar cells. These will reduce the cost of energy production and store more solar power.

 On the second day of the three-day conference at PDPU on nanomaterials for energy conversion and storage applications, leading experts in the complex science of nanomaterials presented their progress in the search for the most energy-efficient nanomaterials.
 
 One of the research presentations during the seminar showed how a thin-film crystalline silicon solar cell that had a 2-dimensional nanostructure (a semiconductor material, that has dimensions of only a few nanometres), can generate twice and even thrice the photo current than generated by equally thick solar unstructured cell. 
 
 Prof Jeffery Mativetsky of Binghamton university presented his paper on organic semiconductors which are findings their way into curved televisions and smartphones. These are the next generation of organic electronics which are low-cost, mechanically flexible, printable and have broader functionality. 
 
 Organic semiconductors or electronics are largely polymers made of naturally occurring carbon and hydrogen and, at times, nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen. Mativetsky showed ways of nanoscale mapping of organic and hybrid solar cell.
 
 Dr Stephane Bastide from Institut de Chimie et des Materiaux revealed how a technique called Metal Assisted Chemical Etching (MACE) of silicon has attracted considerable attention as an efficient and low-cost method to produce silicon nanostructures. Dr Asit Patra of National Physical Laboratory (NPL) explained the material challenges he faced while working with organic photovoltaic technologies.
 
 Pof Indrajit Mukhopadhyay of Solar Research and Development Center at PDPU said nanomaterials are the future of renewables.
