Lucknow: The new agency appointed by Lucknow Municipal Corporation ( ) to manage garbage disposal system in the city started the first phase of door-to-door garbage collection from Friday. As part of it, Ecogreen, the agency, is clearing all garbage dumping spots and emptying trash cans. Till now, it was running the Shivri solid waste management plant and processing the garbage piled up at the storage stations. 

 On the first day, it cleaned all the collection spots of Zone 5 that include Alambagh, Krishnanagar, Manasnagar, Sindhunagar and other areas in vicinity of the airport. As per the plan, the agency will add one zone each day and cover all the areas under secondary cleaning before starting with door-to-door collection. “The idea is to first clean the piled up garbage on the streets. Once the system to clean all dumping spots is in place, door-to-door collection will be started,” said Nitesh, manager of Ecogreen.
 
 Door-to-door collection is expected to start from April 1, beginning with Zone 5 and the same system of expansion will be followed; once all the areas of zone 5 are covered, door-to-door collection will start in other zones.
 
 Pankaj Bhushan, environment officer of LMC, said for door-to-door collection, the sanitation workers will not go to each house. Instead, a whistle will be blown once the vehicle reaches a locality and residents will have to come out and put their domestic waste in the vehicle. “Even those who do not bother to avail the door-to-door collection service will have to pay the user charges. Once the system is in place, those who throw garbage in the open will be fined,” he said.
