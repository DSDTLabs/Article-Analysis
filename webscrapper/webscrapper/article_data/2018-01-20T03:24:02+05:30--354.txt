MUMBAI: The Bombay   on Friday rejected a petition filed by former media baron  , an accused in the Sheena Bora murder case, for production of a   from the Khar police station for information on an earlier case registered against Shyamwar Rai.

 Not accepting submissions of Peter’s counsel Shrikant Shivade, Justice Anuja Prabhudessai held that there was no law which gave the accused the right to access the police case diary on mere suspicion that it might contain contradictory material. The CBI through additional advocate general Anil Singh opposed the plea saying it would lead to an impermissible roving inquiry by the accused.
 
 The CBI submitted replies to oppose before the trial court pleas made by Indrani and Peter Mukerjea. Last month Peter’s defence sought accused-turned-approver Shymavar Rai’s unedited call data records while alleging that the ones produced by the nodal officer were either tampered or manipulated. The defence also sought Rai’s mobile handset saying the IMEI number in the CDR was fictitious.
 
 Peter’s defence also sought the CDRs of numbers belonging to Dinesh Kadam of the Khar police station, who first probed the murder, and officer Ganesh Dalvi, who was part of the team that arrested Rai in the arms case.
