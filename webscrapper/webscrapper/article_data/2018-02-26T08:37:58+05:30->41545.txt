MULAWAD (BAGALKOT): Hitting out at PM   for his 10% commission sarkar jibe,   president   on Sunday asked why Narendra Modi was silent on the Punjab National Bank fraud, and the alleged sudden increase in the turnover of a company owned by BJP president Amit Shah’s son  .

 “Nirav Modi has indulged in a theft of Rs 11,000crore, and runs away from the country, but the chowkidar of this country doesn’t even utter a word. A company owned by Shah’s son converts Rs 50,000 to Rs 80crore in three months, but the chowkidar is yet to get an inquiry into it,’’ Gandhi said, addressing a rally here.
 
 He also said the chowkidar has been making corruption allegations against the Siddaramaiah government, sitting alongside a former chief minister and four former ministers of the BJP government who had gone to jail.
 
 While the Congress follows Basavanna’s principle of inclusiveness, he said the BJP is divisive. “BJP activists are attacking Dalits and Muslims and should know it is against the ideology of Basavanna and Akka Mahadevi,” he added. He said Yeddyurappa had also done nothing for Dalits.
