Vadodara: Staffers of the SSC board office of the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) on Wednesday protested against the board’s decision to shift office from Vadodara to Gandhinagar. 

 The staffers said that Vadodara is the birth place of GSHSEB ever since the board got separated from Maharashtra education board.
 
  It is since 57 years that the SSC office is functioning in Vadodara and the decision to shift the office to Gandhinagar will not only cause inconvenience to staffers but also to students, especially those from Central and South Gujarat for whom submitting applications for duplicate mark sheets, migration certificates and correction in mark sheets is easy in Vadodara. 
 
 “Many class 3 and class 4 employees who were hired after 1985 have already retired while many others are on the verge of retirement. There are 56 staff members in the office now of which 43 are on verge of retirement. All we are asking is that the board should postpone its decision for the time being as shifting the office to Gandhinagar will cause lot of inconvenience,” said an agitating employee. 
 
 “By 2020, most employees will retire while many of them have decided to opt for voluntarily retirement. Forcing them to travel for long distance at this age will demoralise their spirits,” a representation signed by 74 staffers stated, adding that the decision will cause inconvenience to nearly 17 female employees who are working since 30 years. Since 1960, the Gujarat board office used to operate from M S University’s university press premises. 
 
 GSHSEB has already taken the decision of shifting the office to Gandhinagar for which it has begun renovation of a building which is expected to get ready in next six months.
