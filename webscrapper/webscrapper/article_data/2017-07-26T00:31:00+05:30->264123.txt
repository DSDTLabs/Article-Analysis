Madurai: Madurai is witnessing one of its hottest Julys this year with the mercury hovering between 39 and 42 degrees Celsius. With no forecast of cooler times in the next one month and the people facing climate-related health problems, doctors have advised people to take necessary summer precautions.

 If Tuesday recorded 40 degrees Celsius, the temperature was 37.2 degree Celsius on July 25 last year. On July 23, the evening temperature went up to 42 degree Celsius, the highest recorded in Madurai in the last 20 years. On July 19, 1997 the day had been scorching hot at 41.6 degree Celsius.
 
 Usually the summer   peaks in May and June in Madurai but the windy season that begins in July usually brings down the temperature. However, this year there is no wind and the hot day time weather is keeping people indoors. ``The month of Aadi begins in mid-July and it is a month known for winds. It helps to tide over the hot conditions that prevailed. The winds are so strong that dust fills the air, but this year it is strange that we have not experienced any wind,’’ said S Ramanathan, a retired professor.
 
 Environmental scientist A Nedunchezhian said that the present heat was due to lack of moisture in the air. ``Usually, when the southwest monsoon sets in, it brings moist air across the Western Ghats to the inner regions. With good rains in the Western Ghats, the humidity in the air during this period is about 60 per cent at this time of the year. But now it is almost nil, the reason why the people are feeling the heat,’’ he said. The wind velocity in the month of July is also between 8 and 10 km/h which cools the afternoons. Nedunchezhian says that the condition may reverse in the next few days. However the readings of the Indian Metrological Department tell a different story of hotter days.
