According to Mohali Industry Association president Gagan Chabbra, the Industrial Area land where gargabe is being dumped is meant for industrial units. “But the MC has started using it for another purpose,” he said. 
 
 Chabbra added their association had written to the department of local bodies to take action and get the dumping ground vacated for setting up industrial units. “If the MC is taking pains to remove the garbage from the site, it will revive hopes for industry in Mohali,” he said.
