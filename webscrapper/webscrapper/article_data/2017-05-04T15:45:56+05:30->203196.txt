INDORE: The Indore Municipal Corporation’s garbage transfer station being built near Lal Bagh palace grounds is in violation of the notification declaring the palace as a heritage monument, the Indore bench of   high court was told on Wednesday.

 The reply by the archaeological department was submitted before the court on Wednesday, in which the department supported the petitioner’s averment that the transfer station should not be made so close to the palace grounds.
 
 The petition was heard on Wednesday by a division bench comprising of Justice PK Jaiswal and Justice   in which the state government sought time to file its reply on behalf of the district collector. One week time was granted for the reply, with the instructions to list the matter thereafter.
 
 “In the reply filed by the archaeological department, it has also been stated that the department had earlier written a letter to the IMC informing them about the construction which should be built outside the 100 metre perimeter from the protected limits of the heritage monuments,” advocate Manish Yadav, petitioner’s counsel said.
 
 The archaeology department had issued a notification in 2006 under the provisions of   and Archaeological Sites and Remains Rules (1976) banning any kind of construction or mining activity at a distance of 200 metres of the monument.
 
 The petition filed by local resident Chandresh Khandelwal through advocate Manish Yadav claims the IMC has illegally occupied land which belongs to the archaeological survey for India and is converting this land near Lal Bagh palace into a trenching ground.
 
 IMC in its reply denied allegations of illegally encroaching on the land, claiming the land belongs to them and that it is only being used as a transfer station for the garbage collected from each household.
