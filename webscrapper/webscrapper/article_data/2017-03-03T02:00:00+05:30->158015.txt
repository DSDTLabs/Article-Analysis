PATNA: With an increase in the number of express and AC special trains originating from the  , the Rajendra Nagar Terminal, the   and the Danapur station, the railways has decided to increase the capacity of the mechanized laundry plant at Khagaul from one tonne to two tonnes per day. This decision has been taken to meet the requirement of washing around 7,000 bed rolls per day.

 The plant, which was set up at a cost of Rs 75,000, functions in two shifts of eight hours each and ensures supply of neatly washed bed rolls, pillow covers, blankets and hand towels to passengers travelling in air-conditioned coaches. “We had been receiving several complaints about dirty linen supplied to the passengers on premier trains like the Rajdhani Express. The proposed plan to increase the capacity of the fully-automatic laundry system, which also irons and packs linen sets itself, will be no less than a boon for us,” Danapur DRM R K Jha said on Thursday, adding the plant had a capacity to wash around 1,000 bed rolls per shift.
 
 According to senior divisional mechanical engineer (SDME) Shravan Kumar, the railways uses biodegradable and eco-friendly washing materials and eight tumble dryers for better results.
 
 Ticketless travel: ECR’s   division launched a massive ticket checking drive and punished around 31,736 people travelling without proper tickets in February. The railways earned about Rs 1.05 crore as penalty from passengers, said senior divisional commercial manager Dilip Kumar on Thursday, adding at least 160 ticket checking staff were engaged in the drive under the direct supervision of Sonepur DRM Manoj Kumar Agrawal.
 
 The railways also detected 5,202 unbooked luggage cases and realized a fine of Rs 3.12 lakh from the violators.
