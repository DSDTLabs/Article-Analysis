Pimpri Chinchwad: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) will focus on ward-level development in Pimpri Chinchwad, even in wards where it doesn’t have corporators.

 Datta Sane, the newly-appointed leader of opposition in Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, also said his party will hold the BJP to account. 
 
 “The focus will also be on unearthing irregularities committed during BJP’s one-year rule,” Sane said. 
 
 He said the BJP approved Rs425 crore for road and water pipeline development projects. “It was found that the tender process was completed, but the land is not in the civic body’s possession. The same is the case with the plan to build 50,000 low-cost homes under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) scheme,” he said.
