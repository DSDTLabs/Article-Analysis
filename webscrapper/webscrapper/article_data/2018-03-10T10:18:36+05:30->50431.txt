HYDERABAD: With the country betting big on regional connectivity, which is paving way for more aircraft, big and small, to vroom around in Indian skies, suppliers of   interiors furnishing material such as upholstery and flooring, are witnessing an uptick in business. 

 A representative of Mumbai-based   pointed out that the company is looking at making in India by setting up its manufacturing unit here. "Till now, we have been importing goods from other countries but now we are looking at setting up our unit in Mumbai soon to manufacture seat covers. This will certainly bring down costs," he added.
 
 He also pointed out that the increase in the aircraft MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) activity in India too has augured well for the fledgling sector of aircraft interior furnishings as many a times the  's interiors too are being refurbished here.
 
 A senior official of Delhi-based   pointed out that due to a surge in demand a lot of new players have entered the sector and there is cut throat competition. "While new companies have cropped up, only six to eight of the players are   approved. Quality is the biggest concern. The airport grade material used in aircraft is imported and is costly. There are stringent rules governing it," he added.
