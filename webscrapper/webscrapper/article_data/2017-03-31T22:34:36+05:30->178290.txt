Thane: The   wave has not only taken a toll on residents, but also on animals and birds in the forest as 15 out of 35 natural   in   forest have dried up.

 The scorching heat has dried up 43% of the watering holes in March itself. Due to this, environmentalists fear that the situation may worsen in the days to come. The 400 -plus species of birds and animals in the forest depend on these watering holes. With them drying them they will have no option but to venture out into the human territory. With 15 of the watering holes drying up, the animals have to depend on just 20 of the watering holes. If the situation does not improve then it could lead to man animal conflict. 
 
 ‘‘The situation can lead to animals suffering from dehydration and dizziness. So the animals could travel far and wide in search of water,’’ said an environmentalist.
 
 However, forest officials assert that the natural streams and rivers that run through the forest will not be affected as they had carried out desilting and cleared garbage that was collected near the watering holes. Also, they had lined the watering holes with pebbles and rocks. This will ensure that the fauna does not get affected.
 
 “We have not come across any animal dehydration case so far. We hope that we don’t get any such cases in the months to come as well. While 15 of the 35 watering holes have dried up, the water from the 20 watering holes and Chena creek are enough to cater to their needs. The animals can go up to Tulsi lake, too, to quench their thirst,’’ said range forest officer of Yeoor Sanjay Waghmode. 
 
 “We have also desilted and strengthened the remaining watering holes, to ensure that the remaining water in these live water bodies do not seep into the soil. This will ensure that the animals get enough water,’’ Waghmode added.
