Vadodara: A group of parents on Tuesday created ruckus at the district education officer (DEO) alleging goof-ups in admissions allotted to their wards under the Right to Education (RTE) Act 2009.  The agitated parents alleged that instead of giving admission to their children in their vicinity or neighbourhood, something that is mandatory as per RTE Act 2009, they have been allotted schools located several kilometers away from their houses. Some parents who had sought admission in school located at Danteshwar were given admission in a Waghodiya-based school while others who had sought admission in Makarpura area were allotted admission in Kalali.  The parents said that under no circumstances their wards can travel so many kilometres to study in the schools allotted to them. The parents were later counselled by an official of DEO office who informed them it was only a temporary arrangement. The parents have been told that they can submit their objections to the allotment before May 15 after which re-allocation will be processed.
