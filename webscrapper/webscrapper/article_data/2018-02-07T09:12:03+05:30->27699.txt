HYDERABAD: A string of fire breakouts in government offices over the past few years has sparked off conspiracy theories about fires being used to erase official data either on computers or on paper.

 As many as 17 fires have been reported in government offices in Hyderabad and   district since 2016, including the D Block of the Secretariat. There were three minor fires in the Secretariat in 2017, including two in D Block and one in the CMO.
 
 Tuesday’s fire at GHMC’s central zone office at   too has raised doubts as it broke out in the audit wing where files are vetted before payments of bills to contractors.
 
 In fact, a police probe into desilting works scam in the central zone office is underway. Vigilance department too is investigating allegations of corruption in the   circle of central zone located in the same building, said sources.
 
 A recently fire at the   at Khairatabad burnt down nearly 40 years of records but   officials blamed it on a short circuit.
 
 Though in most cases officials dismiss the likelihood of a conspiracy without conducting even a basic investigation, in many cases there have been suspicions that these fires were the work of staffers wanting to wipe out documentary evidence pertaining to works or bills, like in 2013 HMDA Shankarpally zonal office blaze where 490 files of BRS and LRS were reduced to ashes by two staffers.
