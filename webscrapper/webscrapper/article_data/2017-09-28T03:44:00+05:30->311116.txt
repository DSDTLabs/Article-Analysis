Margao: Over five years after it was planned and designed, and after crossing several hurdles, the Quepem Municipal Council (QMC)â€™s market complex project has finally reached the stage of execution.  Speaking to TOI, chairperson of the QMC, Raul Pereira, said that the Rs 11 crore project will be executed by the Goa State Urban Development Agency (GSUDA). The complex will come up on the land where the old municipal building, which previously housed the fish market, presently stands. The existing building will be demolished to pave way for the new project, Pereira said, adding that GSUDA is likely to invite tenders for construction of the project within a month.  Arrangements have been made by the QMC to temporarily rehabilitate the 22 traders and shop or office owners occupying the old municipal building, Pereira said. The fish vendors will also be rehabilitated to an alternative place, and so will be the Sunday bazaar. The four-storey market complex with stilt parking will be completed in two phases. The first phase, comprising the ground floor will house the fish market as well as meat, fruit and vegetable stalls. The first and second floors will house shops and offices, while a hall with a 1,000 seating capacity has been planned on the top floor. The project cost, initially Rs 6 crore in 2012, is now Rs 11 crore. Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation refused to take up the work citing technical issues.
