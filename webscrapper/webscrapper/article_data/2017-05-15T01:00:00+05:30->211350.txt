Filmmaker   shares a special bond with his uncles,   and Mukesh Bhatt. In a recent interview with BT, the filmmaker revealed how they stood by him through his growing up years, as he lost his mother early on. The 'Aashiqui 2' director, who turned producer with his upcoming directorial 'Half Girlfriend', told us, “I wasn’t completely on my own. My uncles Mahesh and   were my mentors.   is like a father and Mukesh Bhatt, a mother to me. You can cry and fight with Mukesh Bhatt but can’t smoke a cigarette in front of him. On the contrary, you can smoke in front of Mahesh Bhatt but can’t cry, shout and fight with him. They’ve played pivotal roles in my career and life. What also makes Mahesh Bhatt so special is his knack of telling you to be yourself. He tells you to stand out, and not fit in. Alia Bhatt’s career choices and personality are a testament to that.”
