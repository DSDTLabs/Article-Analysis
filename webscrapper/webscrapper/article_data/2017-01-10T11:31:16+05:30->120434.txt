THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   member  , on Monday, termed the   that killed two Maoist leaders as 'unfortunate'. He said that the judicial inquiry would bring out the truth behind the encounter. 

 Baby, however, said armed rebellions will weaken the Left organizations' position in a democratic setup. "Left wing organizations are now working together and the CPM is already collaborating with parties like CPI (ML) and SUCI (Communist). There's a need to choose the right mode of protest, while armed attacks like the one being adopted by Maoists can only yield negative results," he said while speaking at the face-to-face programme organized by the Kesari Memorial Journalists' Trust here.
 
 The CPM leader also called for a scientific approach towards the proposed Athirappally hydel power project. He said a decision should be taken based on an environmental impact assessment study. "Both the parties, who are in support of the project and those against it shouldn't take an emotional approach towards the project," he added.
 
 Referring to the remark by M P Parameswaran, founding leader of Kerala Sasthra Sahitya Parishat, that Athirappally power project could be implemented as a small-scale project, Baby said such a possibility should not be ruled out. 
 
 Baby also said that a report was presented at the party central committee meeting on the LDF government's performance, which pointed at a "good start by the government, raising people's hope with various initial measures and big projects in sectors including housing, health, education and environment".
 
 Referring to the quick verification against ministers, he said that the LDF government was willing to rectify mistakes. "Through E P Jayarajan's resignation, Pinarayi Vijayan and his cabinet members have proved that they will not cling on to positions, if there's a situation that demanded their exit from the government," Baby said
