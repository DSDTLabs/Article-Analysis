Nagpur: Crime branch unit recovered a country-made pistol, five live rounds and some gold from hardened criminal Shashank Darkonde after arresting him from Guru Nanak colony on September 9 during an anti-crime patrolling. After his interrogation, the crime branch later procured custody of Roshan Vishwakarma, who was already lodged in Central jail for a murder in Airoli in Nagpur district.  Police said Darkonde, having offences of chain-snatching, robbery and thefts, was trying to flee but the cops managed to nab him. The firearms and live rounds were found in his possession. Vishwakarma was re-arrested in the case from jail after Darkonde claimed to have purchased the firearm and cartridges from him. Police said, Vishwakarma was later sent back to jail after completing the formalities.  Darkonde also has several offences registered at Imambada, Kalmeshwar and Jaripatka police stations. The cops from Pachpaoli, Ajni and Wadi police stations, too, are likely to take Darkonde in custody for his involvement in the cases registered with them.
