Nagpur: A surprising bit of information in the city crime statistics is that there was no murder case registered in 2017 at Imambada police station (PS), one of the most sensitive regions.

 Across the city’s 30 police stations, there was one murder every four days, for a total of 85 in 2017. But, it has been 469 days since a murder in Imambada PS, the last one being on October 3, 2016. The benchmark seems far bigger if one considers that 16 history-sheeters, 32 known criminals, and at least four major gangs, with a few more smaller ones, have their base here. One reason for the success could be the action against 436 criminals in 2016 and 2017.
 
 Imambada PS was formed in 1993 by including areas from Ajni and Ganeshpeth. It always had a high crime rate. There were 39 murders between 2007 and 2016. In 2016, there were four murders, but 333 preventive actions taken in that year seem to have paved the way for the magical ‘zero’ murder rate last year.
 
 Even in 2017, Imambada PS externed 16 history-sheeters and invoked Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities (MPDA) Act against three hardened goons. Imambada cops also kept track of a sizeable chunk of visitors to bootlegging and gambling dens in localities like Jat Tarodi, Barasignal, TB Ward, Untkhana and so on. In 2017, Imambada PS registered 102 cases against bootleggers and another 58 under Gambling Act, compared to 65 and 53 respectively in 2016.
 
 Senior PI of Imambada police station Ramakant Durge says the achievement was neither a fluke nor misleading, and they kept anti-social elements constantly under pressure. “We had stressed on patrolling and preventive action. Promptness in dealing with even trivial issues ensure they did not snowball,” he said.
 
 The gangwars were stopped by keeping all four major gangs under tight watch. The gang members of hardened goon Tarachand Khillare were charged with MPDA and sent behind bars. The Felix gang was externed. Cops are now tightening screws around Malik gang of Siraspeth, and Bhikku Raja gang.
