Jaipur: Revenue minister Amraram Chaudhary on Wednesday told the assembly that Pak-displaced families residing on pasture or other government lands in Barmer district for past several decades were not being dislodged.

 Forest minister Gajendra Singh Khinvsar said such families settled before 1980 would not be disturbed but those settled afterwards would have to be treated as encroachers as per the forest conservation Act, 1980.
 
 The matter was raised in house during zero hour by BJP MLA from Chohtan (Barmer), Tarun Rai Kaga and Congress MLA from Kolayat (Bikaner), Bhanwar Singh Bhati. The Chohtan MLA claimed that some of these families in his constituency area were displaced during the 1971 war with Pakistan. Kaga alleged that in the name of removing encroachments, the state government was now dislodging the families from the lands they have been residing on for past 46 years.
 
 Forest minister Khinvsar said the department would examine documents of families that settled before October 24, 1980 to allow relief to them. The forest minister said there were 37 families in Binjrad block and around 52 families in Sevda tehsil of Chohtan that settled by encroaching upon the forest land.
 
 “ACF (assistant conservator forest) court at Barmer has issued notices to encroachers. We cannot challenge the Act (of 1980). Encroachment is encroachment, we will have to follow the Act,” the forest minister said, suggesting that families settled after October 24, 1980 would be treated as encroachers.
 
 Kolayat MLA Bhati sought allotment of canal irrigated lands or free residential plots for these families. The revenue minister informed the house about government circulars issued to Barmer collector in 1994 and 2017 under the Land Revenue Act, 1956, to grant relief to the Pak-displaced families.
