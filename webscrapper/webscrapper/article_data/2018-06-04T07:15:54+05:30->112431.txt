AHMEDABAD: At a time when the civic body is claiming to be working to legalize hawkers and stalls in Bhadra Plaza area, a woman, 38, was knifed and her two daughters beaten up by three goons on Saturday night, for denying monthly protection money of Rs 15,000, to run a stall on the footpath there. 

 
 The woman and her two daughters were later rushed to VS hospital for treatment.
 
 The woman, Ritaben Bangabhai, who lives in Gareeb Avas Yojana at  , sells tobacco items and water pouches on the footpath in Bhadra Plaza area. Karanj police have booked the three accused, Shakil, Sadab, and Akram, for assault and criminal intimidation, but they are still on the run.
 
 In her FIR, Bangabhai has alleged that one Shakil, resident of Patvasheri in Karanj, demanded Rs 15,000 from her as monthly protection money to allow her to run her stall on the footpath.
 
 “On Saturday evening, Shakil along with another man from Patvasheri – Sadab, and their friend Akram from Vatva came to me and demanded Rs 15,000 per month and Rs 1 lakh as a deposit to them if I wanted to run a business. When I refused to pay any money, they started abusing me in front of my two daughters, Pinky (20) and Rinky (19),” Bangabhai wrote in her complaint.
 
 She stated, “Later, as I warned them not to abuse me, they started beating me, and when my daughters tried to protect me, they also beat them. Suddenly, Shakil pulled out a knife and inflicted injuries on my forehead.”
