Surat: Two workers suffered serious burns when a fire broke out in a chemical unit located in phase-2 of Vapi GIDC on Saturday.  Vapi GIDC’s fire department sources said the fire broke out at about 12 noon at Anand Enterprise located in phase-2. Three fire tenders were pressed into service to control the fire in the chemical unit.  The fire, according to fire officials, broke out following an explosion in the solvent barrel in the unit due to a short-circuit. The fire spread rapidly in the entire unit, forcing the workers to rush out. However, two workers were trapped inside the unit and later rescued by firefighters.  Assistant fire officer of Vapi GIDC phase-2 D N Waghela told TOI, “The fire was in the chemical unit and it may be due to a short-circuit and explosion in the solvent barrel. It took more than two hours to cool off the entire unit.”  Waghela said the two workers who sustained serious injuries were shifted to Haria Hospital in Vapi town. The condition of two workers is reported to be critical.
