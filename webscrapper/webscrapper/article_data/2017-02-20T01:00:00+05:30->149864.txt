Though they are yet to finalise the date, the couple, it is learnt, are planning to have a winter wedding in India. Confirming the news, Aashka informs us, “We wanted to get married in India and the winters in our country are lovely. Brent’s entire family will be flying down from the US to solemnise the marriage.
