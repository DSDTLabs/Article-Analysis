LUDHIANA: Auto-rickshaw drivers vented their spleen after the municipal corporation authorities extended the Dugri route of buses by a kilometre till Manakwal. They confronted the city bus drivers as the latter picked up passengers from   bus stop on Monday.

 An   said, “The route of city buses is till Dhandhran Road, but they have started picking up commuters from Manakwal as well. This is affecting our business.” 
 
 City bus service manager   Singh said the MC had extended the route last year. “Laying of sewerage pipelines on the road had delayed the plying on buses on the route. The auto drivers cannot stop buses from operating on the route. We have lodged a complaint with the police.” 
 
 As police reached the spot, the auto drivers demanded that buses should not be allowed to pick up commuters from Manakwal and be restricted till Dhandhran road. 
 
 MC commissioner Jaskiran Singh said they would take up the matter with the police commissioner. “Auto-rickshaw drivers cannot obstruct the movement of city bus service. They will be dealt with strictly,” he added. 
 
 With auto drivers blocking the path of buses, traffic came to a halt on Dugri-Manakwal road. 
 
 Balbir Singh, a resident of Manakwal, said, “My bus was stuck in a traffic jam for half an hour. As a result, I could not reach Dugri on time for an important work.” 
 
 Another commuter Kamal Ram said, “There was total chaos on Dugri-Manakwal road. Auto-rickshaw drivers were not letting buses move. After sometime, I alighted from my bus and hired an auto from the main road.” 
 
 During a meeting with Ludhiana City Bus Services Limited board of directors last week, the service operator had pointed out that auto drivers were obstructing the plying of buses on several routes. The MC had then decided to conduct drives along with traffic police to check illegal autos.
