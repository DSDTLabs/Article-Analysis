New Delhi: South Delhi Municipal Corporation has floated   for installing a   in  . 

 Following the death of two people in the Ghazipur landfill cave-in, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal has directed the civic bodies to stop dumping at the existing landfill sites and turn them into green belts.
 
 The south corporation has already identified a plot in Dwarka. The Okhla waste-to-energy plant, the only one in the south corporation, processes about 1,300 MT of garbage every day and the new plant will have the capacity. The areas under the south corporation generates about 2,800 MT of garbage daily.
 
 The three landfill sites at Ghazipur, Bhalswa and Okhla were declared exhausted long ago after they crossed the permissible height of 30 metres. The permissible height as per environment norms is around 20 metres. The corporation will stop dumping at the Okhla landfill site in November. 
 
 “Once the new plant is functional, almost 90% of the garbage daily,” said a senior corporation official.
 
 South Delhi Municipal Corporation has deployed fixed compactors in its central and west zones and tender has been floated for the south zone to make them dhalao-free. The fixed compactors have separate compartments for collection of bio-degradable and non bio-degredable waste. However, due to non-segregation of waste at source, all garbage are getting mixed up, resulting in poor efficiency of the waste-to-energy plant.
 
 “We are moving towards segregation and by installing more processing plants we will be able to do away with landfill sites,” said the official.
