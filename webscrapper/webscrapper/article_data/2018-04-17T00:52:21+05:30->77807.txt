Cuddalore: Tension prevailed at Cuddalore   on Monday morning when a   worker and 17 of his family members including eight children attempted to commit suicide by dousing petrol on them and setting them on fire. However, alert policemen on duty foiled their suicide bid by snatching the matchbox on time and pouring water on them.

 The worker identified as V Thangapandian alleged that an influential person had managed to get a patta on a porumboku land near his   at Notchikaadu village in the district and blocked the only way to the main road. He claimed that porumboku land is the only way to reach the main   from his house, which is surrounded by lands owned by several individuals. He said the person had erected an iron fencing on the porumboku land recently and alleged that his several petitions to the chief minister’s cell and district administration failed to evoke any favourable response so far.
 
 “We sold a major portion of our ancestral property and built two houses in a small portion of our land in the village. My elder brother is residing at one house with his family while I live with my family, parents and brother at the other house. We have been residing at this place for the last 35 years. The adjacent porumboku land is the only means to reach the main road. But the family of Sengalrao occupied the porumboku land and got a patta in his name. He erected an iron fence blocking our only way to reach the main road,” Thangapandian said in a petition.
 
 He urged the district collector and officials concerned to initiate immediate steps to ensure a proper pathway to   the main road from his house.
 
 It might be recalled that a family of four committed suicide by dousing kerosene and setting themselves on fire in front of Tirunelveli collectorate in October last year following harassment by a loan shark for the immediate settlement of the loan with interest.
