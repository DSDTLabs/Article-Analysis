KOLKATA: A heart transplant patient may even get insurance cover for transporting the organ, apart from other expenses, said top executives of non-life insurance companies, provided s/he has enough insurance cover.

 
 Heart transplant operations usually cost anything between Rs 15 lakh and Rs 20 lakh, and   in such procedures, as the extracted organ needs to be transplanted within a four-hour window, according to international protocol. It, therefore, nearly always requires to be transported by air and involves booking last-minute tickets in commercial flights or, in some cases, chartering a flight. In case it’s the former, it’s the price of a regular ticket. Chartered flights are much more expensive, and can cost anything upwards of Rs 1lakh, said sources.
 
 Anurag Rastogi, member of the executive management of HDFC Ergo General Insurance, said if the recipient had adequate cover, they had no problem paying the transportation cost. “Even if it costs Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3 lakh, the insurance companies generally pay up. This kind of treatment costs Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh, so the cover should be adequate,” he added. According to him, in India the average ticket size of health insurance is Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh, which is not adequate for such medical treatment.   added that he has so far not had to deal with any heart transplant cases yet.
 
 S  , the head of health insurance of Future Generali, said the company covered  , but did not pay for transportation. But all health policies pay the expenses for extracting the organ from the donor, he added.
