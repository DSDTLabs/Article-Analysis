TRICHY:   Trichy (NCT) has finally agreed to admit students to the first year UG course in History which it has been refusing to do for want of sufficient teachers in the department. The college management has been saying it had “temporarily suspended admissions” for some years now.

 This year too it refused to accept applications from five students willing to join the course despite regional joint director of collegiate education (RJDCE), Trichy and director of higher education insisting on admitting students. The students had petitioned the collector a few weeks ago after being denied application by the college. The petition was forwarded by district collector K Rajamani to RJDCE M Senthamilselvi for relief. Following her vain attempts to convince the college management to admit the students, she wrote to the director of collegiate education on the issue.
 
 On Saturday, the NCT management issued a statement agreeing to start admissions to the government-aided undergraduate I year B.A. History programme for the academic year 2017-18. It said that the issue has been resolved much to the relief of aspiring students of history. The decision to restart admission has come after a discussion between the principal secretary in the higher education department   and president of the college V Krishnamurthy. The college management said both sides had agreed to work together to resolve all pending issues related to this subject. 
 
 “The education secretary has acted in a welcome way to resolve issues at the highest level,” said former president,   (AUT) K Pandian who was earlier heading the history department at NCT. At the same time, the government and   officials should not give room for emergence of such problems in any college. He felt that the issue could have been resolved much before but expressed satisfaction at better sense prevailing now.
