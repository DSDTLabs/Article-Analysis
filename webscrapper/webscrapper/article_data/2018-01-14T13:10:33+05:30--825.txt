BENGALURU: Citing shortage of water in the state’s four reservoirs, the Karnataka government on Saturday rejected Tamil Nadu CM Edappadi K Palaniswami’s appeal to immediately release 7 tmcft of   water.

 
 “How can we release water when storage levels in our reservoirs in the Cauvery river basin are low? There is no question of releasing water now,” chief minister   told reporters in New Delhi on Saturday. He also referred to the impending   verdict on the Cauvery water-sharing row and said the state government will wait it.
 
 Earlier in the day,   had dashed off a letter to Siddaramaiah seeking release of Cauvery water. He said TN had received only 111.64 tmcft of water as on January 9, 2018 against its entitlement of 179.87 tmcft.
 
 TN farmers were in distress as Karnataka had not released the remaining 68.22 tmcft. Palaniswami said the storage level in Tamil Nadu’s Mettur dam was 21.27 tmcft as on January 12 and this was inadequate to meet the irrigation needs of standing crops and drinking water needs during summer. In the letter, Palaniswami added: “The crop season in Karnataka is already over and there is a gross storage of 49.82 tmcft in the state’s four reservoirs in the Cauvery river basin. After reserving the minimum needs of drinking water supply and perennial crops, Karnataka can release at least 15 tmcft of water that is crucial for standing crops in the Cauvery delta.”
