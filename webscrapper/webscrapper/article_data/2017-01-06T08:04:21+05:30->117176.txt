 B R Mani, director general, National Museum said, "It is known that while significant efforts have been made on sites, in Bihar and  , despite it's rich history, it has largely been ignored. The seminar is focused on changing this scenario in favour of the state and to showcase the state to the world".

 "Jharkhand is a region with an elaborate history. However, much of it is still mythology because it is largely based on folk tales and literature. The state's history will remain a myth until there is archaeological verification in order to substantiate what we know," said K.N. Dikshit, president of Indian Archaeological Society. 
 
 Some sites which have been listed as flash points of activities are Navratan Garg Killa, Birsa Munda Jail, tribal stone sculptures and scriptures. 
 
 A budget of Rs 5 crore has been planned for the site in Maluti.
