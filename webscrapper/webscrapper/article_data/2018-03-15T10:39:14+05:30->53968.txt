NEW DELHI: Small- and medium-sized exporters in certain sectors, such as gold, could see a jump in costs after the RBI decided to ban letters of undertaking ( ) in the wake of the $2-billion fraud at the PNB. 

 
 Bankers said the cost of capital may rise by one-two percentage points for small exporters, who may now be forced to use other options such as letters of credit (LCs) or tap working capital from banks and then buy dollars in the spot market.
 
 While industry lobby group   said the RBI action will have "disruptive impact", exporters were more guarded in their responses. "There will be no impact on the diamond trade. In case of gold, there are a few SMEs which used LoUs... They may see cost rise by 0.5-1 percentage point. But things will be clear in a few months," said Colin Shah, vice-chairman of the Gems & Jewellery Export Promotion Council.
 
  LoUs were like guarantees issued by a bank to raise money from other lenders for overseas payments. The funds were then parked in overseas accounts of the banks that issued LoUs before the payment was made. "The traders who have been conducting business through these two instruments will now have to necessarily shift their transactions to LCs and bank guarantees," CII president   said in a statement. 
 
  Fieo president   said LoUs and letters of comfort were being used by only around 5% of the importers, particularly large industries in gems & jewellery, metal and petroleum sectors. 
 
  "Since most of the exporters are using LCs and bank guarantees, which are relatively safe, the move will not have much adverse bearing on exports. However, this may slightly increase the cost as such instruments are costlier by about 0.5% to 1%." At the same time, he demanded that the pros and cons of the ban should be evaluated since no instrument is "100% safe".
