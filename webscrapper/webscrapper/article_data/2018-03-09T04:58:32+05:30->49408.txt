MUMBAI: Municipal commissioner   said   will break into its Rs 69,000 crore ‘piggy bank’ for the first time, to use the money for infrastructure projects in the city. The money is BMC’s bank fixed deposits.

 At an event on BMC’s 2018-19 budget, organized by the think tank   (ORF) on Thursday, he said, “This year, we have been very clear that we cannot have a ‘dream budget’ but one that can be implemented. Even while BMC has reserves to the tune of Rs 69,000 crore, out of it Rs 21,000 crore is in the form of employees’ provident funds, gratuity and bank guarantees from contractors which we cannot touch as we are only trustees of these funds.
 
 The remaining Rs 48,000 crore is from where we plan to pull out for major infrastructural projects like Mumbai’s coastal road,   and sewerage treatment plants. For instance for the Rs 15,000 crore coastal road, which we are aiming to start work by May-June, Rs 1,500 crore is what we plan to use in the first year of construction. The piggy bank had to be broken into to get infrastructure going, therefore the move to pull out from our reserve funds.”
