Says Barnesh, “We were shooting a fight scene inside a college in Salem between   and an upcoming actor called Sujan.

The director reveals that he has finished shooting 80% of the film, which has Sri Divya as the female lead. “She plays a college girl who is a Christian, and is Atharvaa’s romantic interest in the film,” he says and adds that Saivam actress Vidya Pradeep will also be seen in a crucial role.
