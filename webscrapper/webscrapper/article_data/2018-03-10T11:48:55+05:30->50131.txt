VADODARA: Towns and villages in the   district observed a bandh on Friday to protest against notices issued to three persons from their   community selected for government jobs. The notices stated that they were issued wrong caste certificates.

 The issue arose after some candidates selected for government posts were issued notices stating that records mentioned that they were   and this implied that they were not from a scheduled tribe (ST). Sources, however, said that those issued notices were Kohliyas who were a part of the Moti Nat of the Rathwa community.
 
 A government official from the community said that the notices were issued to members of the community challenging their ST status in the past too. “This time it was said that the revenue records mentioned them as some other tribe, earlier notices were issued because some persons’ records mentioned them as Hindu  ,” he said. The issue has been raised repeatedly since 2004.
 
 A Jain monk   has also lent support to the movement and is holding protests at Kawant. On Friday, effigies of officials who were responsible for the situation were also charred by protestors. Markets remained closed in Chhota Udepur, Kawant, Bodeli, Naswadi, Pavijetpur and other places.
