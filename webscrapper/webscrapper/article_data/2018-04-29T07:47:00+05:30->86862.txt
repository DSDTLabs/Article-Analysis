Chandigarh: The Haryana higher education department has decided to establish entrepreneurship development clubs (EDCs) in all colleges and universities in the state to inculcate “entrepreneurial culture” among youth and equip them with skills to create jobs, instead of becoming job-seekers.

 A department official said on Saturday that EDCs would be set up within existing placement centres in all higher educational institutions. “This would be a part of the deApartment’s drive to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship. These clubs would also facilitate campus-industry linkage,” he said.
 
 He said the vision to set up EDCs would be to develop in-house institutional mechanisms in higher education institutes of Haryana to create entrepreneurial culture among stakeholders and foster innovation and entrepreneurship among students and society at large. “These clubs will inculcate an entrepreneurial culture, sensitise innovation-driven entrepreneurship scenario in the state, nurture latent entrepreneurial talent, promote innovation and entrepreneurship on campus, and develop awareness among members,” he added.
