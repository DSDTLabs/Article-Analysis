NEW DELHI: Continuing its attack on the BJP over corruption,   on Thursday accused the Modi government of letting another Palanpur jeweller flee the country after defrauding banks of millions like Nirav Modi, and asked if the absconder benefited from his relationship with the “industrialist closest to the Prime Minister”. 

 Raising the issue of Jatin  , who is reported to have fled the country after defaulting on loans of Rs 6,712 crore, Congress spokespersons Randeep   and Shaktisinh Gohil asked, “Who is protecting Jatin Mehta? Does the protection emanate on account of his close relationship with an industrial house closest to PM   through marriage of his son?” Asked if he was referring to Gautam Adani, Surjewala said everyone knew which industrialist was close to the PM and accompanied him on all his overseas trips. 
 
 Mehta reportedly left India with his wife to settle down in St Kitts and gave up Indian citizenship on June 2, 2016. Congress mocked that PM Modi’s motto was “khaunga khane doonga, pack karke le jaane dunga (I will let you eat and also take it away)”. 
 
 Congress alleged that complaints against Mehta’s malfeasance came to the CBI and the Mumbai Police in February 2014 but no action was taken. 
 
 Saying the Centre was aware of default by Mehta’s companies, Surjewala said the annual financial statements of   for 2014-2016 filed with the ministry of corporate affairs also recorded the complaints filed by banks and that the companies accounts had been declared NPA.
