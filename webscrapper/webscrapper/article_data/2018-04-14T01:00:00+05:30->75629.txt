 Actors working in a Majidi film can expect to have their boundaries pushed and that’s exactly what happened with Malavika, who got completely involved with her character, Tara. For a crucial and heart-wrenching jail sequence, she lost eight kilos in just 15 days. She endured the tough task with determination, an intense workout and a strict diet. Moreover, during the shoot, she decided not to wash her hair for 10 days for an authentic look. 
 
 Talking about her prep for the role, Malavika says, “Majidi sir has a very clear vision for his characters. It started with me losing weight before I began filming to physically look like an inmate. With the help of a nutritionist and my gym trainer, I achieved this goal in just 15 days. I also went to the extent of not washing my hair for 10 days, so that they looked genuinely dirty and messy.”
