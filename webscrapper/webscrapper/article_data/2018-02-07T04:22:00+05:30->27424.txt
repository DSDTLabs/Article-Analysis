Vadodara: The city unit of the Congress has demanded that the district collectorate should register an offence regarding the land scam in the Danteshwar area of the city. It has alleged that around 7 lakh square feet was encroached by making houses, godowns and apartments on it.

 Congress which is in the opposition in the VMC had first raised the issue in the general board meeting. It had alleged that six revenue survey numbers measuring 60,808 sqm had been encroached and sold off by land mafia. Congress had alleged that the government had allotted plots of 25 sqm each to beneficiaries on one of the survey numbers. It claimed that only a few came to know about this and the land of remaining beneficiaries were transferred by forging signatures.
