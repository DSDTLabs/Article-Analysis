 was robbed off his belongings the day he landed in Mumbai, but not his dreams. The actor, who was seen in a passing shot in ' ', is all set for the release of his first film, ' '. He says, “I always wanted to debut with a film that has an ensemble cast, as the entire responsibility for its success is not on my shoulders. Besides, I have a track focusing on me in the film; it will prove that I can play intense characters.”

 Recalling his days of struggle, Ankit says, “I was robbed off all my belongings on my way to Mumbai, including important documents and money. When I called my parents back home in Raipur, my mother asked me to find a job to survive. I know that she must have said it with a heavy heart, but it made me a survivor. I stayed with a friend initially and then moved in with my cousin and his friends. To sustain myself, I started working in a call centre at night and attend auditions during the day. There was a time when I would sleep for barely an hour, as I had to juggle the job and auditions.” 
 
 Ankit even had to sell off some of his belongings to make ends meet. “I sold my laptop to survive for a couple of months, but I always wanted to become an actor and knew that the road to success would not be easy. Thankfully, my family has always been supportive,” he says.
 
 As he awaits the response to his film, Ankit has taken up work as an assistant to his casting director friend. “I started assisting my friend after the film wrapped up. I have not taken up any new project as I want to make an impact with this film,” he sums up.
