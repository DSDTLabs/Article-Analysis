ITANAGAR: Citing the environmental and noise pollution caused by bombing practice, a student body has urged defence minister   to   at Dollongmukh in   district. 

 "The environmental and sound pollution being caused due to heavy and regular bombing practice is not only causing serious health hazards but also posing great danger to life and property of the people living in the area," a memorandum submitted to Sitharaman by the All Dollongmukh Area Students' Union on Tuesday said, urging her to look for an alternative site where the firing range can be set up instead.
 
 The student body also told the defence minister of an incident in 1992, when a person was killed during bombing practice at the firing range. 
 
 "However, no compensation has been given to the victim's family," the memorandum stated. 
 
 During the recent Gagan Shakti exercise, the memorandum added, the "heavy bombing crossed all limits".
