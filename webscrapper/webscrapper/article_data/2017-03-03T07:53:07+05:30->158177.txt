She followed it up with a tarana in raag Bhimpalasi. Komkali then played a special bandish in raag Bhopali, dedicated to Holi — ‘abeer gulaal le aayi,’ also composed by Pt Gandharva.
 
 It evoked warm response and applause from the audience. She brought alive her father’s legacy, known to be innovative with his singing,.
 
 Komkali ended the programme by singing a few bhajans by Surdas and Kabir, as requested by Thergaonkar and others. “Our family has had a 50-year-old association with Kumar gandharva,” said Rahul Mande, Thergaonkar’s son-in-law, adding that his father Madhukar Mande was a close friend of Gandharva and had helped him organize his music programmes in Chandigarh.
 
 “Kumar gandharva was a singer of singers and I admired him for his innovative rendition of songs. Komkali is equally honest to the diction of the raag, which is her inborn quality,” Thergaonkar said.
