MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Thursday barred the CBCID police from probing the case pertaining to an alleged manipulation in casting of an idol to replace ‘Navabhasana’ idol of Lord   at Arulmigu Dhandayuthabani Swamy temple ( ) in Dindigul district. 

 It entrusted the task to Inspector General, Idol wing, CID, Pon Manickavel who had investigated the case initially. The DGP had on April 2 transferred the case to CB-CID. 
 
 Justice   also granted bail to sculptor M   and former executive officer (EO) of the temple, K K Raja, with conditions. 
 
 Accordingly, the accused people should be under the surveillance of the investigation agency, should not use telephone, mobile or internet and cooperate with the police investigation. 
 
 During arguments, the government side opposed their release on bail saying that if granted, they would abscond, influence the witnesses and tamper with the evidence. 
 
 The sculptor and the former executive officer have been in jail since March 26 in connection with the case. Seeking bail, they filed pleas before the additional chief judicial magistrate court in Kumbakonam which dismissed them on April 4. 
 
 Subsequently, they moved the principal district and sessions court in Thanjavur which also dismissed their pleas on April 20. This prompted them to file pleas before the high court bench. 
 
 The counsel for the petitioners told the court that there was hardly any case against them. 
 
 The FIR registered by the idol wing, CID, Chennai had suppressed some important facts on the issue, they claimed. 
 
 The FIR was based on conjectures and surmises. The counsel further said that the petitioners would not abscond and that they would fully co-operate with the investigation.
