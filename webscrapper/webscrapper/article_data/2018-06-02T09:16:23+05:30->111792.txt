SHIMLA:   MLA   has accused chief minister   Thakur-led   government of failing to take required steps to deal with the water crisis in Shimla despite knowing in advance about it. He said people were not getting even a drop of drinking water for weeks together.

 The situation in   area is equally bad, he added.
 
 In a letter written to the CM, the CPI (M) leader said during the planning meeting held for the preparation of the budget for the financial year 2018-2019, he had suggested the government to take appropriate steps to deal with the potential water crisis.
 
 He said as all his efforts to reduce the problems of the people had failed, he has no other option but to observe fast from June 4 to June 6 outside the state secretariat, which may be extended on the attitude and response of the government.
 
 “I feel the government has not done enough to help reduce the problems of the people. You will be shocked to know there are just two tankers supplying portable water to the residents of 36 panchayats in the Theog area. 60% of the water sources have dried up or their water discharge has been reduced considerably,” he said in the letter.
 
 He said water guards had not been paid wages for the last eight months. There is just one SDO for Kumarsain Kotgarh and   subdivisions handling more than 200 water supply schemes, he said.
