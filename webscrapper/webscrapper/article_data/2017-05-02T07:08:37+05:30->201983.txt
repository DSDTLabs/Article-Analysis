GHAZIABAD: A realtor, 29-year-old   was the   of his family. His mother, Jasbir Kaur (62), a heart patient, had not received information about her son's death till Monday evening. "His mother kept asking us what went wrong, but we told her that Aman met with an accident. She will not be able to take the shock," Raghubir Singh Dhillon, Aman's father, told TOI. 

 In the past few weeks, Aman was trying to strike a deal for a mall parking in Ghaziabad. He was constantly in touch with his friends - Prashant Singh, Amit Bainsla and Amandeep Singh - who were his consultants and were also helping him expand his business in the National Capital Region. To crack the deal, Aman was travelling frequently between Ghaziabad and Dhilwan, his hometown in Kapurthala.
 
 He was staying at Prashant's home in Vasundhara. "I knew Aman through my family friend, Amandeep. He was staying at my place for the past 25 days. In fact, whenever I visited Punjab, I always preferred to stay at his place," Prashant recalled.
 
 However, Aman's family now regrets his decision to expand the business to Ghaziabad. 
 
 "We always knew that crime rate was high in Ghaziabad but we did not expect this, even in the worst of dreams," said Zorawar Singh Dhillon (35), Amandeep's cousin. 
 
 "Aman had a sharp mind and great sense of business. He was managing the family business for several years. He would juggle between the property deals and take care of his parents' health at the same time. He was more than my real brother but now everything is gone. He will never come back. He has left behind a life-time of sorrow for his parents, sister and us," he added.
