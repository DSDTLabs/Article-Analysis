BHOPAL: Mayor   was upset by a picture of himself in a   frame at an event on Wednesday and insisted that the flex be taken down.

 The 4-foot-tall flex welcomed people to the foundation laying ceremony of the first of 160 new gantries. The new project is expected to improve signages in the city. However, the way the mayor’s photo was framed appeared to give an impression of a remembrance get-together, said witnesses. 
 
 Sharma arrived at   RoB intersection around 10am on Wednesday. Almost immediately, whispers started about the style of the mayor’s image. Sensing the issue, Sharma refused to participate in the bhoomi poojan. With cameras rolling, Sharma instructed BJP worker   to cut off the portion of the flex with his picture. “It’s a case of over enthusiasm,” said Sharma. 
 
 Sources said senior  , including additional commissioner MPS Arora, were on site. Under protocol, the poster should have been approved by BMC officials. However, the digitally imposed golden frame and Sharma’s picture were not approved, sources said.
