The results in   and   cannot be explained by arithmetic alone because the   had polled way more than the SP and   put together in both these seats in 2014. In Phulpur, it had polled just over 5 lakh votes, while the SP and BSP between them had got a little under 3.6 lakh votes. In Gorakhpur, the BJP's tally was almost 5.4 lakh votes, while the combined SP-BSP tally was just over 4 lakh. 

 Thus, if it was just arithmetic at work, the BJP should still have won comfortable in both seats, by about 1.4 lakh vote margins in each case. Instead, it lost by almost 59,500 votes in Phulpur and nearly 22,000 votes in Gorakhpur. Clearly there was more than arithmetic at work here.
 
  
 Another explanation that has been given is that the low turnouts in both seats in the bypolls, particularly in urban areas, were primarily because BJP supporters didn't come out in large numbers to vote, whether because of bad candidate selection or for other reasons. This explanation too cannot fully account for what happened. Low turnout might explain why the BJP's votes came down to 4.3 lakh in Gorakhpur and 2.8 lakh in Phulpur, but it cannot explain how the combined SP-BSP votes went up by almost 54,000 in Gorakhpur at a time when the total votes polled actually fell by over a lakh.
 
 
 
 
 Clearly, therefore, both arithmetic and chemistry were at work. In any case, even party supporters staying home in such large numbers instead of voting would be an indication of some resentment against the party and has the same effect as a swing against it.
 
 In Bihar too, the data suggests arithmetic didn’t decide the polls. In 2014, the BJP had polled 2.6 lakh votes in Araria and the JD(U) 2.2 lakh. Their combined tally was thus 4.8 lakh, which should have been enough to beat the RJD’s tally of 4.1 lakh by about 75,000 votes. Yet, the RJD retained the seat with a comfortable margin of nearly 62,000 votes. Again, this suggests a swing away from the NDA towards the RJD-Congress combine.
 
 In Jahanabad assembly constituency too, the RJD defied the arithmetic to in comfortably. Comparing with the 2015 assembly elections is not possible, since the alliances have completely changed since. A comparison with 2014, however, shows that BJP ally RLSP got over 62,000 and JD(U) nearly 17,000, which should have been enough to give NDA a margin of almost 23,000 since RJD had got only about 56,000 votes. Instead, RJD has won by 35,000.
 
 In Bhabua, the arithmetic based on 2014 would have suggested a win for BJP by 39,500 votes. This is the only case where outcome matches what the arithmetic would predict even if the margin is somewhat different.
