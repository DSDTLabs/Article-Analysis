A dreaded Maoist insurgent — Kundan Pahan, secretary of the   regional committee of CPI (Maoist) — has surrendered before the   and Jharkhand police in Ranchi, ending a decade-long chase. 

 His surrender, weeks after the attack in   in which 25 CRPF personnel were killed, comes as a major breakthrough for the security forces’ campaign against  .
 
 Pahan, sources said, surrendered earlier this week, but the formalities involved were completed on Sunday. He has 128 cases against him, with a bounty of Rs 15 lakh on his head. 
 
 He first appeared on the radar of security agencies in 2008, when he looted an ICICI Bank cash van of Rs 5 crore. 
 
 In 2009, he killed Jharkhand special branch inspector   in a Taliban-style beheading for alleged spying.
 
 The murder put Pahan on the security agencies’ “most wanted” list. He was also involved in the March 2007 killing of   MP Sunil Mahto, and the July 2008 murder of Jharkhand minister Ramesh Singh Munda.
 
 According to sources, Pahan had developed differences with the Maoist leadership. His brother Dimba had surrendered last year against a similar backdrop, sources said.
 
 Security officials said a lot of pressure was being built on Naxalites, and high-value targets were being focused on, due to which many were scared that they would be killed in operations.
 
 “True repentance is to accept one’s mistakes,” additional director general of police R K Malik said in Ranchi as the formalities for Pahan’s surrender were completed. 
 
 Pahan said he realised that he had wasted 20 years and would now help in development work in the state.
 
 Meanwhile, a joint team of state police and CRPF security forces seized on Saturday over 1,000 bullets, 5,000 detonators and 200kg of explosives from an ammunition dump of Naxalites in Jharkhand.
