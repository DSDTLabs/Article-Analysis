MADURAI: The   has registered its objection to the city corporation’s insistence on commercial establishments paying   management user   along with D&O licence (dangerous and offensive) fee. 

 “There is no link between the D&O licence and user fee under the solid waste management rules. Hence, refusal by the   to accept the D&O licence fee alone without solid waste user fee is irreconcilable,” the forum observed.
 
 The Madurai Corporation had accepted online remittance of D&O licence fee last year but the facility now has been withdrawn. The fee has to be directly remitted at the corporation office. The forum has requested the corporation to extend the last date for paying D&O licence fee till March 31 and reinstate on-line payment facility immediately.
 
 “Madurai Municipal Corporation did not interact with the trade and industry (bodies) and arbitrarily fixed the same. The corporation had not followed any acceptable scientific formula while determining the user fee payable by commercial entities in the city,” the forum stated.
 
 “We appeal the Madurai Corporation to immediately withdraw the user fee, consult trade and industry and re-fix the same according to the quantity of waste generated by each commercial entity,” the chamber observed in its statement.
