UDUPI: Prime Minister   lashed out at   chief Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday for “insulting” former PM H D Deve  , indicating that BJP has kept a door open for rapprochement with Deve Gowda’s JD(S), which is expected to emerge as the kingmaker in case the elections throw up a hung assembly. Recently, Rahul spoke disparagingly of JD(S) being the “B team of BJP”. 

 
 Noting that there might be differences between parties,   said civility and respect should be maintained. “Whenever former PM H D Deve Gowda visits me in Delhi, I welcome him with respect and always give him time. The way Rahul Gandhi spoke about him recently is shameful,” said Modi, adding that he not only receives Gowda at his doorstep but even opens the door of his car. “I have also accompanied him up to the car when he’s left after many meetings with me,” the PM said.
 
 Prime Minister Modi reminded Rahul Gandhi that he was just starting his political career and should imbibe civility as a virtue. “If such is their mindset (towards Deve Gowda), how can they think good of the people of  ?” the Prime Minister said. “Rahul is insulting a person of the stature of Deve Gowda because of his haughtiness,” Modi said, adding that such people and parties are a threat to democracy. 
 
 Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah was quick to react to Modi’s praise for Deve Gowda saying this only proved the tacit alliance between BJP and JD(S). The CM tweeted from his official Twitter handle, saying: “Prime Minister has suddenly discovered love & respect for Shri H D Deve Gowda. Shri Modi had not long ago said he will send Shri Deve Gowda to a retirement home. Is this new love a sign of the not-so-secret understanding between BJP & JDS?” Incidentally, Deve Gowda has maintained that his party will have no truck with BJP.
