JAIPUR: In the  , the state government has accepted that it has failed to prevent illegal sand (bajri)   going on in the state even as it failed to get any relief from the apex court.

 The state government repeated in its pela that not only the bajri mining ban has created a new mafia, but many important projects have been hit badly by the ban.
 
 The government said that this has adversely affected the livelihood of lakhs of people employed in the construction sector.
 
 The NGO Dastak argued that rampant illegal mining is going on and sand is being digged out from about 20 to 30 metre down. It also alleged connivance of the government machinery in this thriving sand mining mafia.
 
 It said, the rampant mining has done irreparable damage to the environment and river course have been change because of this illegal mining. It demanded the appointment of a court commissioner to ascertain the truth.
 
 However, the court gave no relief to government or acceded to the demand of the petitioner and posted the matter for further hearing in July.
 
 In November last year, the apex court had refrained all 82-mining lease/quarry holders from mining sand and 'bajri' and asked them to submit a scientific replenishment study.
 
 It had also said that the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change would fully and dispassionately consider the matter and grant or reject environmental clearance to sand mine lease holders.
