PATIALA: The district court has turned down the pre-arrest bail plea moved by an accused in an abetment to suicide case after the victim’s father dug out incriminating evidence by extracting phone call records and chat history from the girl’s phone.

 Gurleen Kaur, a local resident, who was in a relationship with one Sanpreet   of  , had gone missing from her house on December 18, 2015. Her body was recovered from the   head on   on December 24 that year. The girl’s family, which discovered she was in a relationship with the boy, filed a police complaint, on the basis of which an FIR was registered.
 
 During the initial probe, the police did not find any evidence that could be used to prove the boy’s guilt in court, and submitted that no case could be made out against him. However, Gurleen’s father   sought help from a cyber expert to extract phone call recordings and chat history from her daughter’s phone, which had got deleted. He produced them in court, which ordered a re-investigation. The police, then, established that a case was made out against Sanpreet, and again submitted its report to the court. Following this, the accused moved a pre-arrest bail plea, which the court recently dismissed.
 
 While pronouncing orders, the court observed that the new evidence put on record had to be examined. The court said it had transpired that Gurleen had often asked the boy to marry her, and as allegations against the accused were grave in nature, there was a likelihood that he might attempt to hamper investigations. Thus his pre-arrest bail plea was dismissed.
