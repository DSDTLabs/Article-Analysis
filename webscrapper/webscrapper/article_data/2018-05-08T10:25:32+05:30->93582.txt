Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) chief   will intensify his efforts to launch a   by cobbling together various regional parties after the election results in  , top party officials said on Monday.

 KCR, who is busy with the launch of Rythu Bandhu scheme on May 10 to provide input subsidy for farmers, believes that the election results will give a clear idea about formation of the front. The results would help many national and regional parties plan their strategies for the general elections in 2019, political analysts say.
 
 
 Sources said KCR believes JD(S) will play a key role in Karnataka as both the   and the BJP may not get absolute majority and would have depend on JD(S) to form the government.
 
 
 KCR, according to senior TRS leaders, is of the opinion that many regional parties would prefer joining hands with the Federal Front to keep both the Congress and BJP away from power in their respective states and at the Centre. Even if they support national parties such as the Congress, the regional parties can set the agenda for the government. Both the Congress and BJP will also recognize the importance of regional parties after the Karnataka election results.
 
 
 Though the chief minister said he would operationalize the Federal Front from Hyderabad, he is also considering opening an office in Delhi in the near future to hold discussions with various leaders and groups on taking forward the idea.
