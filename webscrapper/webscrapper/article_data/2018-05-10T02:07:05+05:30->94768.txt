GHAZIABAD: Three persons were arrested on Wednesday for procuring and supplying illegal weapons and cartridges to a Vijay Nagar-based property dealer, Naresh Yadav, whose bullet-ridden body was found inside his office in Behrampur-Akbarpur on May 6. 

 According to police, Naresh (55), committed suicide by shooting himself in his chest as he was unable to repay loans, even though initial investigations had pointed towards murder.
 
 Police claimed to have arrived at the conclusion of suicide on the basis of a detailed investigation. Naresh’s brother, Sunil, told TOI on May 6 that he had been stressed for the last three-four days over financial issues.
 
 The three arrested have been identified as Jogendra alias Jugnu, Aditya Mishra and Vijendra Yadav. Jogendra, in his mid-50s, was a close friend of Naresh. Aditya Mishra, who is also in his 50s, works as a security guard in Noida while Vijendra (35), is a relative of Jogendra. They have been booked under the Arms Act. 
 
 Police said Naresh had procured a .315 bore country-made revolver from Vijendra through Jogendra on May 5. “Jogendra drove Naresh Yadav in his Hyundai i20 car to Vijendra’s house in Iteda village in Greater Noida from where he procured the weapon six months ago. Naresh had kept the weapon in Vijendra’s custody. Jogendra also helped Naresh buy two cartridges for Rs 200 from Aditya Mishra. Naresh Yadav had meticulously planned his suicide because he was under stress because of his inability to repay loans,” said   SSP Vaibhav Krishna.
 
 “We arrived at the conclusion of suicide on the basis of the autopsy report, forensic report and circumstantial evidence. There are no eyewitnesses to the murder. We have examined CCTV footage and questioned several people,” said Krishna.
