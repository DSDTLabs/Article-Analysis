KOCHI:   in most of the high-rises in the city are ill-equipped to tap  . While eco-friendly structures advertise having a rain water harvesting facility as one of the  , local bodies are not very keen on implementing stringent measures to tap rain water.

 The   has made it mandatory for   to undertake rain water harvesting. “Even if such systems are installed, they are not effectively utilised,“ said  , president, Apartment Owners Apex Association. He said many apartments store rain water in underground tanks, and this would last only for a short period of time.
 
 “Generally, the available land in apartment complexes are covered with tiles or concrete. There is no way water can enter the ground. This is true for independent houses also. When it rains, the city gets flooded and the rain water flows into backwaters or seas through drains and canals,“ he added.
 
 During summer, ground water depletes. There is acute shortage in water supply when sources deplete, and tanker trucks are unable to bring in water from the suburbs to the city.
 
 Despite all these there has been no effort to address the issue by putting in place systems to recharge ground water. Most apartment complexes in the city are dependent on ground water. The Kerala Water Authority (KWA) provides just one connection for the entire complex, and each individual unit gets a connection in the kitchen.This means that the residents are depended on ground water for the rest of their needs.
 
 “In fact both the local body and KWA should make it mandatory for individual houses or even commercial buildings to harvest rain water. This will help in recharging of ground water,“ said Ernakulam District Residents' Association Apex Council (EDRAC) president P Rangadasa Prabhu.
