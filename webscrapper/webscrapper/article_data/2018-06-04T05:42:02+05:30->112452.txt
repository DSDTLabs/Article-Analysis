DIGHA: A tourist to Digha was injured on a beach when a   carrying joyriders sailed through a group of bathers on Sunday morning.   (21), a resident of   town was bathing with a group of friends when the boat came through.

 The propeller blade of the vessel hit his leg. Singh suffered cuts on his knee and heels and was rushed to Digha State General Hospital. He was released after treatment. On March 22, a tourist had suffered injuries on a Digha beach in a similar accident.
 
 The organization that ran the speedboat suspended services immediately after the accident. But two other organizations continued to operate speedboats on Sunday. “We were bathing on the beach when the boat came towards us at a great speed. It came from behind so none of us could spot it in time. One of the blades hit my leg and I started bleeding,” Singh said.
 
 He was rescued by a civil defence personnel who moved Singh to hospital. Witnesses said Singh could have drowned had he not been pulled out of the water quickly. His injuries, however, were not serious.
 
 After the accident last March, the operators had been asked to ensure that only authorised personnel drive the boats. But tourists and locals alleged that they have not taken any precautionary measures and continue to flout rules.
