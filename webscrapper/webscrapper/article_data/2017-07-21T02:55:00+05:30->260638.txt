Visakhapatnam: District authorities, stung by the massive land   in Visakhapatnam district that extended over 400 acres, have finally woke n up to the realisation that the revenue records room and the archives section are in urgent need of cataloguing and digitalisation.

 Visakhapatnam district collector Pravin Kumar said the process will be time-consuming. 
 
 “The process of digitalising revenue records including all the records at the district collectorate will take a few months,” Pravin Kumar said.
 
 District revenue officer C Chandra Sekhar Reddy, when asked about the state of the   room at the district collectorate, said the records are being catalogued now after many years and only after the cataloguing is over can the digitalisation process can be completed.
 
 “It is not easy to search for information in the record room as the records have not been catalogued for a long time. We should catalogue them now at least, before it is too late,” the DRO said.Officials at the Collectorate said only a select group of officials are being allowed to enter the record room, especially after the   scam made headlines. A senior official in the survey department said the SIT is revealing more and more land scams in Visakhapatnam and due to this, nobody is being allowed access to the record room. Earlier, a lot of records used to fall into the wrong hands, resulting in the scam, said officials. Sources informed that records dating back to 1930 are in the collectorate’s record room. Records pertaining to the old Visakhapatnam district, prior to the formation of Orissa state, and much of the documentation and revenue resettlement records post Estate abolition in 1951, are kept in the record room. The DRO added that with digitalisation, people can easily source documents and records from the record room. He noted that as of today, the record room was more like a maze, where searching for specific documents is a monumental task.
