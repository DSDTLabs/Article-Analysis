NAVI MUMBAI: Three trees, which were planted in the mini   next to the footpath in sector 17,  , have been badly  , complained local activists. “We noticed that these trees have been uprooted by force. I have lodged a complaint with the NMMC grievance cell,” said activist  .

 A civic gardener who waters the plants there said that he does not know as to who had damaged the trees. “It is likely that someone wants to encroach on the garden,” added Chauhan. Civic officials have promised to take action. 
 
 At least 45 to 50 trees were either hacked or badly trimmed in Vashi alone during the last five years, activists have complained.
