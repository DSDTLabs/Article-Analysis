Noida: Four new police stations will be established in the city within the next one month while a total of eight stations will come up in Gautam Budh Nagar, DGP Javeed Ahmad said on Sunday.

 The DGP was speaking at a function held at the   Welfare Associations office in Sector 52.
 
 Issues like parking troubles, encroachments and digital upgradation to deal with increasing hi-tech crimes were discussed at the meeting.
 
 The need for dedicated fingerprint experts for   to avoid delay during crime investigation and last mile connectivity of Metro users were also discussed.
 
 A PCR van will be positioned near important Metro stations during late nights for last mile commuters, the DGP said. The chowki in-charges have been instructed to keep a check on all senior citizens under their area on every 15 days, he said.
 
 “Crimes in Noida city are continuously on the rise and hence there is an urgent need to ensure effective law and order. The existing force and equipment are not enough for the large population of the district,” said N P Singh, president,  .
 
 The DGP, however, maintained that since an Allahabad high court order restricts further increase in the number of personnel, they will be able to deal with the issue only after the court order is lifted. He, however, assured sweeping changes in coming days with regard to the number of police stations and increased patrolling in the city.
 
 The DGP said that a digital control room is in operation in Noida but citizens are not using it because they haven’t become familiar with it. “The digital control room in Noida is one of the best systems in world. Public are advised to make use of it fully,” said the DGP Ahmad. 
 
 He also conveyed that the department has started the women helpline 1090 which is fully functional but they are not getting any calls as the people are not aware of the same.
