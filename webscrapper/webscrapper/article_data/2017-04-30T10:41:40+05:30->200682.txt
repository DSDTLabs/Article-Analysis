BILGA (JALANDHAR): Exactly how many young people have died of   in Punjab in the last five years, ever since   claimed that 70% of the state’s youth are addicts? Given that   is the most sensitive political issue in the state today, one would have expected some government agency or NGO to document this crucial question. 

 The fact is no one has the answer. There is no government or private record of overdose deaths in the one state where the issue of drug abuse is the centerpiece of politics. There’s also the suspicion that some suicides and road accidents are related to drug abuse, but the matter of documenting these is not even on the horizon. 
 
 There is a growing list of young people dying of unexplainedreasons, like heart attack. But no one is asking why so many people in the 20-35 age group are suddenly suffering heart attacks. Are drug overdose deaths being camouflaged as   cases or death by natural causes? To get a clear picture, TOI visited villages where drug abuse has been prevalent for some time as well doctors to know what’s happening in the cities. In the death register at Bilga village in Jalandhar, ‘heart attack' or ‘sudden death’ was mentioned as the reason of death of 21 people in the 20-40 age group between 2012 and 2016.
