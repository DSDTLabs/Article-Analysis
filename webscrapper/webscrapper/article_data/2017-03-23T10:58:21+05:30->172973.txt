RANCHI: Shops selling   and   in the city are now   saying minors will not be sold tobacco products. The move comes close on the heels of raids conducted to ensure proper implementation of the   (Prohibition of Advertisement and  ,  , Supply and Distribution) Act (COTPA). 

 The director of the National Tobacco Control Programme (NTCP), LR Pathak, said the raids were conducted about a week ago to identify and impose fine on people caught smoking in public places and shopkeepers selling tobacco products to minors.
 
 The raids were conducted in six of the 14 districts were the NTCP is in operation, including, Ranchi, Ramgarh, Hazaribag, Bokaro, Dhanbad and East Singbhum. "In Ranchi alone we fined around two dozen people for violating the provisions of COTPA while in other districts at least 10 to 12 people were fined," Pathak said.
 
 Section 4 of the Act prohibits smoking in public places and section 6 prohibits selling of tobacco products within a radius of 100 metres of educational institutions and also prohibits selling of tobacco products to minors.
 
 "We started the procedure on the occasion of no-smoking day on March 11. For one week, the NTCP distributed pamphlets and posters and created awareness through public announcements. After that, we conducted the raids," Pathak said.
 
 Raids are now being conducted occasionally but in the coming days, the frequency would increase. Those who are found violating norms will be fined Rs 200 and if the person is a regular offender, an FIR will be lodged.
 
 "In case of smoking in public places, the offender as well as the person in charge of the place would be fined," said Pathak.
