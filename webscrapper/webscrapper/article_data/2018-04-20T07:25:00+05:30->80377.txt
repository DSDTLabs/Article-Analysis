Patiala: A panel of doctors conducted the postmortem examination on the body of Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) chief Harminder Singh Mintoo at the Government Rajindra Hospital here on Thursday. Mintoo had reportedly collapsed inside the Patiala Central Jail on Wednesday and was declared brought dead at the hospital. The examination was conducted in the presence of a judicial magistrate.

 Mintoo’s remains were later handed over to his family members, including his mother and two brothers who had flown in from Goa. Mintoo’s mother Gurdev Kaur and brothers Satwinder Singh and Lakhwinder Singh reached here in the afternoon to claim his body, which was then taken to his ancestral village Dalli in Jalandhar district in a car decked with flowers. His body would be consigned flame on Friday.
 
 Meanwhile, some radicals held a protest on the premises of the hospital demanded a thorough probe into the circumstances under which Mintoo died inside the jail. Even as their entry to the mortuary was restricted, they gathered around the building and raised anti-establishment and pro-Khalistan slogans in presence of the cops.
 
 According to the jail officials, Mintoo had collapsed in the barracks after he appeared before a Jalandhar court through video conferencing. He reportedly complained of uneasiness in the chest and soon fell to the ground. He was given first aid and rushed to the Government Rajindra Hospital.
 
 According to his lawyer, Mintoo had heart problem for the past one year and had repeatedly been admitted to the hospital after he complained of chest pain. In May 2017, he had even been shifted to the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh.
 
 Meanwhile, the district police had made elaborate arrangements outside the mortuary to prevent any untoward incident and maintain law and order in view of the assembly of radicals. Later, a police team accompanied Mintoo’s family to his native village.
