GURUGRAM: The   has prepared an ‘offence report’ (suggesting offence was committed) following an inspection in Anhkeer area near Badkal in the  , where around 150 trees were felled last week in violation of the Aravali Notification and other green norms.

 “We found 45 trees were uprooted while about 150 more were axed (in the area). We have issued an offence  . Now, we are looking for the land records of the plots. Strict action will be taken against all those who have violated the laws. We will also take the matter to the green court,” said R.S. Dhull, district forest officer, Faridabad.
 
 On Saturday, TOI carried a report — ‘100 trees axed in 2 days, ‘malba’ used to build road in Aravalis’ — highlighting how around three acres had been cleared in Anhkeer apparently to build a 400metre-long road to connect the forest area with Surajkund-Badkal road.
 
 The trees were allegedly felled on Friday, a day after the Punjab and Haryana high court slapped notice on the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change and the Haryana government, following a petition seeking directions to ban construction in the Aravalis.
 
 Local residents have demanded an FIR in this case of environmental violation. “The problem is in most cases of environmental violation, offenders go scot-free as authorities fail to file any FIR. In this matter too, the forest   has only issued an offence report and that too after the media reports. This is high time environmental violations were taken seriously,” said Sunil Hasrana, a resident of Mangar.
