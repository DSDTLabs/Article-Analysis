BENGALURU: Battling for life at Victoria Hospital, Mamatha, 35, wanted only thing: to meet her estranged husband Suresh.

 The gates to the bur ns ward opened several times on Tuesday. Among her visitors were transport minister   and KSRTC managing director Rajendra Kumar Kataria but she only called for Suresh.
 
 Mamatha's rela tives tried to get in touch Suresh even as doctors said time was running out because she had sustained 70% burns in the fire that had engulfed the bus she was travelling in early on Tuesday morning.Her son, Yashwant, 5, who was also on the bus, suffered minor burns.
 
 Mother and son were returning from Veerapura in Hassan district, where they had gone to visit Mamatha's mother. Mamatha, a garment factory worker in Bengaluru, married Suresh, a daily wage labourer, around seven years ago, her relatives said. As Suresh had a drinking problem and caused problems at home, Mamatha left him about six months ago.
 
 Mamatha's brother Krishna Gowda said he had called his sister around 5pm and she said she had boarded a bus to Bengaluru from Hassan. He called her again around 7pm to check on her. “I got a call from her late at night, which I missed.
 
 When I saw it, I knew something was wrong. When I called back, the person who answered said Mamatha and Yashwant had been admitted to Nelamangala hospital,“ he said.
 
 Gowda said he had been trying to get in touch with Mamatha's husband but had got no response. “When the problems started at her house, I brought her to Bengaluru.For six months, we have had no contact with her husband,“ he said. “We hope he will come and meet her because that's all she's asking for now.“ Bengaluru:
