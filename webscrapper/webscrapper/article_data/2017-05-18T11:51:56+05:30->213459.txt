PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The residents of   and surrounding areas will be able to get  ,   produce directly from farmers as the weekly bazaar will now be held every Thursday from May 18. 

 BJP’s corporator Tushar Kamthe said, “Local residents from Pimple Nilakh had made a demand that weekly bazaar should be held so that they can get good quality vegetables and fruits from farmers at prices less than the market rates.”
 
 He claimed to have visited many weekly bazaars in and around the city to meet the participating farmers, who would be provided free space along with power and water supply. Nearly 150 farmers from Bhor, Velhe, Daund and Narayangaon have agreed to sell their produce at the bazaar. Furthermore, 25 women self-help groups from these areas have also agreed to sell their products. Kamthe further added that precautions have been taken to bar local vegetable traders from selling their goods at the weekly market.
 
 The bazaar will be held near the municipal corporation’s elevated storage reservoir near the main bus stop of Pimple Nilakh. Ample parking space is available near the location. The market will remain open from 3pm to 8pm. However, the permission to organise it has to be taken from the   of Haveli taluka.
