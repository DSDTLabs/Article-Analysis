BHOPAL: The fast   are going to get a midi-bus fleet, ending commuting woes of lakhs of people.

  are slightly bigger than mini-buses — 35-38 seats against 25-30 — and play a  . Some 80 of them are likely to hit the roads in the next two weeks and will ply on routes that have been overlooked by the BRTS corridor or cannot accommodate large buses.
 
 “New buses will ply in 10 new clusters,” said Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) corporator and MiC transport-in-charge Keval Mishra.
 
 Passengers from Sanskar Upvan on Kolar Road can now get direct connectivity to Nadra near Bhopal railway station, some 20 km away. Among the other key routes are Bhauri to Halalpur (15km), Halalpur to AIIMS-Bhopal (19km), Islamnagar to Bhopal station (16km) and far-flung Barrai to Bhopal railway station (20km).
 
 “In all, 102 midi-buses will be bought and 80 of them will roll on 10 routes right from Day One. We expect more revenue with the introduction of these smaller buses,” Mishra added. The minimum fare will be Rs 5.
 
 The   and Halalpur-AIIMS routes will have more than 15 buses each every day. Bhopal City Link Limited (BCLL) has procured the buses.
 
 BCLL, a parent company of BMC, has been criticised for rolling out larger buses on BRTS routes, which have been incurring losses. Private bus and magic van operators hog 80% of transport proceeds. Given the changing dynamics of city traffic, experts have long been calling for a switch to smaller capacity buses.
 
 BCLL operates 210 large BRTS buses that run on a 26-km-long stretch.
