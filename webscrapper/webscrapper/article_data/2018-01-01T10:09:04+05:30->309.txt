LUDHIANA: A woman was allegedly raped by a man posing as a police official on Friday. The accused, who took the survivor to a secluded place on the pretext of investigation, was booked on Saturday. 

 In her police complaint, the 27-year-old survivor said on Friday, she was having tea in a park with a male co-worker when the accused, aged between 30 and 32 years, came over and introduced himself as a policeman.
 
 She said he told them he had been asked to conduct checking in plain clothes and accused them of behaving indecently in public. He told her to come to the police station with him but took her to a secluded place on his motorcycle, where he beat her up before raping her. She said he also threatened to kill her. After committing the crime, the accused fled from the spot. Later, she said, she approached the police.
 
 A police team reached the spot and started investigations. The unidentified accused has been booked under sections 376 (punishment for  ), 365 (kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
 
 Investigation officer (IO)   said they are scanning   footage of the area. He said the complainant told them the incident took place at around 9.30pm on Friday evening and that she had not seen the accused before. The complainant, who is unmarried, was medically examined at civil hospital.
 
 Meanwhile, the rise in the number of rape cases in 2017 has put cops under more pressure. After falling in 2016, the number of such cases rose by 14.7% in this year.
