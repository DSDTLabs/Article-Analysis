PATNA: Reacting over Union Budget, RJD boss   on Wednesday described PM   as India’s “Trump” and said the two leaders would wreak havoc in their respective countries.

 “As like America has   engaged in taking errant decisions, Modi is the Trump of India. Both will wreak havoc in their countries,” Lalu said.
 
 Terming the Budget as ‘chun-chun ka murabba’ (bereft of any result-yielding idea or decision), Lalu said finance minister   should have given the details of the impact of demonetisation on the economy and how much black money was recovered. He said Budget speech did not mention how the Centre was going to provide jobs to unemployed youths in the backdrop of the PM’s promise of providing employment to at least 2 crore youths per annum.
 
 Lalu, who was railway minister in the UPA-1 government, also questioned the rationale behind keeping a railway minister after merging rail budget with the general Budget.
 
 “There was a tradition of presenting separate rail budget in the country even before Independence. When the railway minister used to give details about the development plans for railways and the facilities for passengers. Modi has demolished this old tradition. When there is no separate rail budget, what is the need of a railway minister?” Lalu asked. 
 
 He further said Modi had promised special package to Bihar. “But, in the Budget, there is no mention of any fund allocation for the special package. It is ‘very disappointing’ as far as the demands of Bihar are concerned. Jaitley has promised AIIMS in the BJP-ruled Jharkhand and Gujarat, but there is no mention of any big scheme for Bihar,” he pointed out.
 
 Lalu also criticised the Modi government for presenting the Budget on Wednesday despite the demise of former union minister and sitting Lok Sabha member E Ahmad. “Modi government has set a wrong precedent by not adjourning the House proceedings. Ahmad was a senior member of the House and the proceedings should have been adjourned,” he said.
