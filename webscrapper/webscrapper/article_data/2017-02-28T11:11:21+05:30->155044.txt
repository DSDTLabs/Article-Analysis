The four assembly constituencies under   which went to poll on Monday saw decline in   from 58.60% in 2012 to 56.25% this time. Districts with substantial Muslim population, however, saw an increase in the turnout. In Balrampur, polling went up to 54.25% in comparison to 49.88% in 2012.

 Gonda saw 56.73% turnout, a slight increase from 56.69% in 2012. Around 60.14% of the electorate came out to vote in Faizabad in comparison to 59.61% in 2012. Ambedkarnagar also witnessed increase in polling percentage from 62.12% in 2012 to 64.88% this time. In Bahraich and Shrawasti, voter turnout was 59.50% and 61.50% respectively, almost same as 2012 - 59.55% and 61.40%.
 
 Despite extensive campaign from administration of different districts, polling percentage declined in places like Basti from 58.13% in 2012 to 57.61% . Siddharth Nagar, Sant Kabir Nagar and Sultapur also saw a substantial drop. 
 
 While the awareness drives worked well in previous phases as districts like Sitapur, which saw highest 69% polling in the third phase, registered a substantial jump, the same has not apparently worked in this phase. “We started out campaigns like Vote Ki Mehndi and ‘pledge during schools prayers four months in advance and it worked wonders,” says Sitapur DM Amit Tripathi.
 
 Besides Muslims, Brahmins and Thakurs, substantial number of non-Yadav backward classes and non-Jatav are present in these backward, but agriculturally rich districts. The gradual decline witnessed in the polling so far can be because of fatigue among voters, said pollsters. In this round, they added, it indicated absence of communal polarization in some parts.
