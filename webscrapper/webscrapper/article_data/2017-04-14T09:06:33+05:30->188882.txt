CHANDIGARH: Parents associations have asked authiorities of two schools —   school and   school — to come out with a revised fee structure. They sent a letter to the schools two days after the district court stayed their fee hikes. 

 Both letters were written on the same lines. They read: “Many parents have not yet deposited the fees for the current session, and our esteemed school would be in need of funds to meet its expenditure. We want to deposit our due fees immediately. Kindly let us know the revised amount to be paid, after calculations according to the court’s order.”
 
 Taking notice of the court ruling that asked both the schools to consult parents before hiking fees, parents’ associations asked the schools to provide documents including balance sheets and expenditure statements.
 
 The letter added, “We appreciate that our esteemed school may need to increase the fees... We also appreciate that our school may need to upgrade certain facilities, for the betterment of the education of our own children; hence we are happy to talk about an increase in fees if required. To be able to offer useful consultation to ensure the financial stability of our esteemed school, we need to first understand the current situation... We humbly request you to provide the documents to us and, thereafter, allow us to meet with you to discuss our consolidated suggestions and feedback.”
 
 “We appreciate that you are the best judge when it comes to managing the school and taking any financial decisions also. We will be happy if you could only allow us to offer our consultation,” it read further.
