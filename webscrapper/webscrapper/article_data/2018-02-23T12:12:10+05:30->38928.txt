PORVORIM: Panchayat minister   told the House on Thursday that till the two proposed solid waste management plants are built and commissioned, village panchayats will have to make arrangements to treat the biodegradable waste generated in their respective jurisdictions. 

 Godinho was replying to a question tabled by   MLA   during ‘Question Hour’, pointing out that panchayats are unable to manage garbage due to paucity of funds.
 
 Of the two proposed plants, one is coming up at Cacora and the other at Verna, Godinho said. “Of the Rs 27 crore earmarked under the 14th finance commission, only Rs 4.5 crore was spent,” Godinho said, adding that panchayats have to utilise funds given to them.
 
 “It will take about two years to get the two plants ready. Panchayats have to identify sites for treating waste generated by them,” he said when asked why panchayats needed to have their own garbage disposals sites when two solid waste management plants were being planned and one was already functional in Saligao.
 
 “Until then, where will they dump their garbage, along highways?” Godinho asked.
 
 He said panchayats needed to take the responsibility for segregating waste at source before forwarding it to any waste treatment plant.
 
 “The situation has to be changed,” Godinho said, and asked MLAs to speak to civic members of their respective jurisdictions and convince them to take garbage treatment seriously. 
 
 The panchayat minister said that after the new central legislation for land acquisition came into force in 2014, acquiring land has become difficult.
 
 Velim MLA Filip Neri Rodrigues had told the House that panchayats are facing problems in acquiring land for setting up waste management facilities.
