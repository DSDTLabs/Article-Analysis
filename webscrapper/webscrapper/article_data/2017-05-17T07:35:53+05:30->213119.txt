The FBI is investigating the hate crime aspect while the local Kansas police is investigating the crime angle.
 
 Kuchibhotla had gone to the bar along with another Hyderabad man  . Both were engineers with Garmin in Olathe. Purinton had shot Madasani too, but he survived. An American, Ian Grillot came to the victims’ rescue when Purinton opened fire.
 
 Purinton is a navy veteran and had worked in the air traffic control. He had stepped into the bar and demanded to know if Srinivas and Alok were ‘legal’ in USA. As he created a ruckus in the bar, the staff led him out of it but he soon came back with a weapon and fired at Kuchibhotla, Alok and Ian.
