With Ram Charan’s much-awaited film   just around the corner, the film’s pre-release event was organised amidst much fanfare in Visakhapatnam on Ugadi. A huge, well-lit stage with a village theme shone against the setting sun as the crowd, which had turned up well in advance waited patiently for the event to begin. 
Apart from the film’s lead star cast   and Samantha Akkineni, the star attraction for the fans was Megastar   himself, who attended the glitzy event as its chief guest. Also in attendance were Anasuya Bharadwaj, Aadi Pinisetty and  , along with members of the Mega family. 
 Given the rural setting of the film, the mood was set with Tappeta Gullu, Burra Katha and other traditional folk music, while launch of the Rangamma Mangamma promo by  , Pooja Hegde grooving to Jigel Rani and the launch of the Rangasthalam trailer by Chiranjeevi, whipped the crowd into a frenzy. 
 “This is a rustic, raw film and Sukumar has designed it wonderfully. It will give you the real feeling of living in a village. It brings out the real and raw emotions of village folk, and it's a film that's extremely close to my heart,” said an emotional Ram Charan.
 The team of Rangasthalam even paid tribute to   by playing a visual collage of her pictures to the song Yentha Sakkagunnave, apart from placing a cut-out of her from the film Jagadeka Veerudu Atiloka Sundari, in which she had acted alongside Chiranjeevi.
