KRISHNAGIRI: A three-month old elephant calf, which fell into an open well near   reserve forest near   here in the early hours of Tuesday, was rescued by forest officials after a six-hour long operation.

 The 30ft-deep well had no water in it and as such it was in an abandoned condition with bushes around it.
 
 “There was no way the elephant calf could have noticed the well,” said  , district forest officer (DFO),  . According to him, the calf was part of a herd of 30 elephants that strayed into the plains in search of water around 4.30am on Tuesday.
 
 When alerted, a team of forest officials, comprising the district forest officer, assistant conservator of forest  , foresters Babu (Rayakottai), Seetharaman (Hosur) and anti-poaching watchers, along with fire and rescue services personnel from Rayakottai, rushed to the spot with an earthmover to rescue the elephant calf. But they couldn’t dig a pit parallel to the well to rescue the animal.
 
 “It was a challenging task,” the fire and rescue services personnel said.
 
 Finally, the foresters and the fire fighters decided to drop a net to lift the elephant calf. Meanwhile, they dropped sugarcane, bananas and fruits into the well to feed the calf as it seemed to be very weak.
 
 The moment the team dropped the net, the calf jumped into it. The officials, who entered the well, then helped the animal completely into the net. The team outside slowly lifted it up. 
 
 The calf was safe and there wasn’t any injury, veterinary doctors who examined the animal said. The officials later helped the elephant calf reunite with its mother.
