Ludhiana: Taking advantage of the dense fog, burglars targeted a house in Basant Avenue on Thursday night, when the family was out of town. Late on Thursday night, when the family reached back home, they were shocked to see a ransacked house, and found jewellery, cash, iPad, and silver cutlery missing.

 In his complaint to police, Ramesh Malhotra — a retired banker from Basant Avenue — said he had gone to Kolkata on January 3, and his wife had gone to a relative’s place after locking the house. The next day (Thursday), when they returned home, they were shocked to see the lobby door open and some goods missing. He said burglars had jumped in through the boundary and broke open the lobby door using an iron rod. Then, they broke open the almirah and decamped with Rs16,000 in cash, a gold chain, two diamond rings, a laptop, an iPad, and silver cutlery.
 
 On information, cops from Basant Avenue police post reached the spot. ASI Ravinder Kumar, in-charge of the police post, said cops had been scanning CCTV cameras installed in the area, and there was one in a neighbouring house, but due to fog, nothing could be captured in it.
