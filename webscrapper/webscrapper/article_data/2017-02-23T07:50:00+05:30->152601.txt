Ludhiana: Four teachers, including school head of Government Primary School, Phambran, and mid-day meal in-charge, played truant on Wednesday to attend a colleague’s marriage. On a tip-off, a team of the education department, led by deputy district education officer (elementary) Kuldeep Singh, reached the school for an inquiry and found the teachers missing.

 The district education department will take departmental action against the erring teachers.
 
 There are nine permanent teachers, out of total 17, at the Phambran school for 430 students. On Wednesday, when the inquiry team reached the school, it found the gate locked from inside and it was not opened despite several knocks. “When nobody opened the gate, one of the officials accompanying me scaled it and asked the staff to unlock it,” said the deputy DEO.
 
 Thereafter, the team went straight inside the staffroom and checked the attendance and movement registers. The movement register is marked when the staff goes out on official work. All the four teachers were reported to be on duty and as per the movement register, one teacher had gone to a bank, one to purchase paint and one teacher accompanied the school head to buy material for the under-construction building.
 
 “A few minutes later, all the four teachers returned, as somebody had informed them about the inspection. When I asked them to produce bills and documents for which they had gone, they failed to do so. Two teachers agreed that they had gone to attend a marriage,” said the inquiry officer.
 
 Besides, according to officials, all the teachers were dressed for the function. Deputy DEO Kuldeep Singh said, “We have caught two more irregularities in the school. First, attendance of students for the past four days was not marked and the mid-day meal was not cooked according to the menu scheduled for Wednesday.”
 
 On Wednesdays, students get chana and chapatti, but since the teacher was out of school, students were given rice with a vegetable.
