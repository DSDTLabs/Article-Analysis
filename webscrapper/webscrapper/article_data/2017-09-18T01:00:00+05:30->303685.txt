Sajid Nadiadwala’s '  2' will be the third collaboration between the filmmaker and actor   after 'Heropanti' and 'Baaghi'. Tiger, whose first and second outings worked well for him, says, “I’m excited to work with Sajid sir again. I missed working with him. He’s family to me, not because I made my debut with his production, but he has been my mentor throughout my journey. 'Baaghi 2' is like returning to the home turf.”

 The actor-filmmaker jodi’s previous action-entertainers have impressed the audience, which they aim to repeat with their third film. “Sajid sir has great sensibilities as a filmmaker. I’ve always learnt while working with him and I missed that. Our bond is only becoming stronger with time,” says Tiger. 'Baaghi 2', directed by Ahmed Khan, will also be an action-entertainer revolving around Tiger’s character and his rebellion for love. The actor sums up, “Maybe when you have worked together over a period of time, you sense each other’s requirements. The bond only helps you understand each other better.”
