AGRA: Owner of seven gas stations who also holds franchisee of GD Goenka Public School in Firozabad, Manoj Goyal, was arrested by UPSTF late on Saturday from Agra on charges of masterminding an oil pilfering racket for the past few years

 He was running a nexus to steal oil from pipelines laid around Mathura refinery for almost two years before the fraud was detected. 
 
  The refinery was set up in 1982 and low sulphur oil is processed and supplied to outlets of Indian Oil Corporation. A native of Nehru Nagar, Agra, Manoj, started acquiring land around the refinery for this purpose. According to SSP STF Amit Pathak, Goyal's connection with some Indian Oil staffers who remained posted at refinery is also under scanner.
 
  As stealing oil from high pressure pipeline is extremely difficult, law enforcement agencies believe that some engineers who are aware of the distribution network architecture, helped Goyal. 
 
  An inquiry has been ordered once the fraud was detected. The UP police has also written to the oil major to conduct an internal probe as the losses amounted to over Rs 100 crore, as per estimates.
