BERHAMPUR: The   in   (BU) will soon get   on the campus. 

 The coaching centre will be set up on the campus to encourage the students compete in the national-level competitive examination conducted by the UPSC.
 
 In the recent vice-chancellors' conference a proposal in this regard was mooted. The state government has formally agreed to establish the IAS coaching centre, said Rajendra Prasad Das, vice-chancellor,   University. 
 
 The details would be decided only after establishment of the centre, official sources said. 
 
 Establishment of the IAS coaching centre assumed significance as not single student of the Berhampur University got IAS directly while the university completed 50 years of its establishment. Moreover, performance of Odia students in the IAS examination is not satisfactory compared to other states.
 
 Except Ravenshaw University, Cuttack, no state-run university has IAS coaching centre at present.
