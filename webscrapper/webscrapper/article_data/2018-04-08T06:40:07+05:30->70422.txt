PUNE: The immigration department on Friday afternoon arrested two labourers from   for possessing a   at the Pune Airport.

 The fraud came to light after a verification of the travel documents possessed by Komanpalli Durga Pawar (27) and Sunkara Laxmi Narayan (23) revealed their names did not figure in the official list of tourist visas.
 
 Pawar and Narayan walked into the airpot at around 2.40pm and submitted their documents to the immigration authorities before boarding the Jet Airways flight to Abu Dabhi. 
 
 Airport police’s assistant inspector D B Jaisinghkar said, “The suspects were in possession of original passports and employment visas. Scrutiny of the documents revealed that the serial numbers of the employment visa and tourist visa were the same and this created suspicion.” 
 
 He said, “The immigration officials then used an App to authenticate the tourist visa produced by the suspects and it was revealed that no such visa had been issued to them. They were taken into custody after they failed to explain how they came to be in possession of the forged visa. They were handed over to the police.” 
 
 An immigration officer has lodged an FIR under sections 420 (cheating) and 511 (attempt to commit offence) of the Indian Penal Code.
 
 “During the interrogation, the labourers revealed the name of a travel agent from Hyderabad responsible for allegedly forging the tourist visa. A team will be sent to arrest the agent and conduct investigations to trace the source of the forged document,” he added.
 
 Meanwhile, a magisterial court on Friday sent Pawar and Narayan to police custody till April 11.
