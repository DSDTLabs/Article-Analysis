It was time for Kanpurites to rejoice and get themselves entertained at the   organized by a club in the city recently. Going by the theme --  , the ladies came dressed as angels in white dresses while the menfolk wore black attires. "We thought of doing something different to make our party entertaining," said  , who played an important role in organising the party. 
The venue was decorated according to the theme with red and black balloons and also had props like demon masks and LED horns for the guests. Soon the party gained speed and was at its peak when every guest was on the dance floor. Kashvi, Sanchit, Rajpreet, Harpreet, Param, Jasreen and   grooved on peppy tracks like 'Tenu Suit Suit Karda' and 'Tu Cheez Badi Hai Mast.' 
 We also spotted Kapil, Yasser, Amna, Sanchit, Puneet, Sonya and   having a good time at the party.
