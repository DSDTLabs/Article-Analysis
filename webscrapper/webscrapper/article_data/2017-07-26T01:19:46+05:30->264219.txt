GHAZIABAD: The GDA has received the go-ahead from the   to construct the proposed   at the busy   in the city. The GDA had sought permission from the   three months ago to construct two flyovers along a stretch of the road that was earlier a part of NH-58.

 The green light for the construction of the Raj Nagar Extension flyover was accorded last week. Permission to construct another flyover at the Vasundhara traffic signal, whose foundation stone had been laid by the GDA in October 2016, is still awaited.
 
 On Tuesday, the GDA directed the UP State Bridge Corporation, the agency designated to prepare the project report, to submit the final design at the earliest. The flyover will have a ‘bifurcated structure’ along both sides of the road since the alignment of the rapid rail transit system will be along the central verge of the road.
 
 “We have spoken to the public works department officials about the need to put in place the flyovers as soon as possible given the massive traffic jams that are being witnessed at both spots. We have been assured that a no-objection certificate for the Vasundhara flyover will also be issued very soon,” GDA chief engineer, S C Dwivedi, told TOI.
 
 No-objection certificates had earlier been sought by the GDA from the NHAI for the two projects. However, in 2016, the stretch of NH-58 from UP Gate till Partapur Bypass near Meerut was de-notified. Following this, the ownership of the stretch was passed into the hands of the public works department of UP. It then required the GDA to obtain NOCs from the public works department.
 
 A sum of Rs   has been earmarked for the Raj Nagar Extension flyover by the GDA while Rs 45 crore has been allocated for the Vasundhara flyover. The amounts will be allocated from the Infrastructure Development Fund of Ghaziabad.
