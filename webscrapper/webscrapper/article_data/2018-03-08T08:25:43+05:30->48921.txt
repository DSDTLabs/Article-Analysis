CHANDIGARH: The Chandigarh bench of   (CAT) has issued a notice to the ministry of home affairs , UPSC, Punjab DGP and Government of Punjab on a petition filed by two IGPs of Punjab police seeking promotion. The two have moved CAT, seeking convening of the departmental promotion committee ( ) and inducting them in the new seniority list from retrospective dates of 1999. The respondents have to file a reply by April 24. 

 Arpit Shukla, IGP (zone-II),  , and Paramraj Singh, IGP, rule and policy, Chandigarh, have moved the tribunal. According to the petition, all applicants were initially appointed as DSPs on different dates and further promoted from the state police service cadre to the IPS cadre against the selection lists from 2001 to 2010. They sought quashing of an order dated January 4, 2016, as the claim of the applicants to review the selection list with respect to the promotions made to the IPS w.e.f. 1999 onwards has been wrongly rejected.
 
 The order states that there is no provision to review the selection list approved earlier despite the fact that the applicants have became senior to those who were promoted in pursuance of the list of 1999 onwards as per the final seniority list dated December 19, 2011.
