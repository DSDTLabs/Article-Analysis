RAJKOT: Wildlife activists in   were left shocked on Friday when an Asiatic lion and 10 nilgais (blue bulls) were found dead inside a 50-feet-deep well near   town.

 Preliminary investigation suggested that the animals and died in the nearby revenue areas and their bodies were dumped inside the farm well in Likhala village. Forest department team reached the village and the carcasses were sent for postmortem. The well was filled with water up to 30 feet.
 
 Forest officials suspect that the lion must have been electrocuted in the fencing put up around five farms spread over 125 bighas. Farm owner   and his son Manu are also under the lens and action will be taken once the postmortem report arrives.
 
 Forest department team along dog squad and forensic science laboratory (FSL) officials have launched an investigation into the incident. Official sources said the carcasses were dumped into the well to conceal their deaths. 
 
 Chief conservator of forest (CCF), wildlife circle, D T Vasavada told TOI, “It’s unbelievable that 10 nilgais can fall into the well together. As per our primary investigation, the blue bulls died after drinking water mixed with urea. Somebody had mixed urea in the water tank kept in the farm for bullocks. The bodies were thrown in the well to hide the deaths.”
 
 “The exact cause of lion’s death is still being probed. Once the veterinary doctors perform the postmortem, we can know the exact cause of the death,” he said.
 
 This is a revenue area of Gir (west) and farmers mostly put up fencing around their fields to protect their crops from nilgai and wild boards. However, electric fencing is not permitted and many a times lions have become victims of electrocution. At present, there is no standing crop, but the farmers are preparing for sowing as monsoon is round the corner.
