Actor Srinath, who passed away in 2010 at the age of 53, is an artiste who has essayed many memorable roles in Malayalam.

 For the past few days, there are reports stating that unlike publicised, he didn't die of a slashed wrist, but was murdered. Recently, the actor's brother Sathyanath mentioned to the media that he is planning to file a complaint to the Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, for a re-probe in the case. It is while shooting for director Padmakumar's 'Shikar' that he was found dead in a hotel room. Sathyanath alleges that none from the crew had taken part in his funeral and that there were a few dis-pleasured lot on the set who was against casting him in the movie.
 
 Actor Thilakan had revealed a few years ago that some of the actors had hinted to him that Srinath was killed, and feared talking about it openly fearing that it will affect their career. "I doubted whether Srinath's life was only worth so much. Nobody even from AMMA took part in the funeral."
