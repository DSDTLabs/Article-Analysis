NEW DELHI:   colleges that interviewed teachers for   two years ago have been accused of neither giving the job nor returning the   to the aspirants.

 Many DU teachers claim that there is anger among the candidates as fresh advertisements have been made for the same positions and they have been asked to pay the application fees again.
 
 In 2015, 40   affiliated to DU had advertised for the permanent appointments and promised that appointment process would start soon, but to no avail.
 
  member Hansraj Suman said: “Around 40 colleges have put out advertisements for the posts of assistant professors. The colleges have asked a fee of Rs 500 from general and OBC candidates and Rs 250 from SC/ST and handicapped aspirants as application fee.”
 
 Suman had raised the issue with the vice-chancellor in the AC meeting as well. “The VC had directed the registrar to send notices to colleges that had not made permanent appointments and asked them to return the application fee to the aspirants,” he said. However, the colleges are yet to refund the application money.
