Panaji: Concerned over procedural norms being flouted at the ongoing hill-cutting in Carrem, Socorro, the United Porvorim Citizens Forum (UPCF) on Friday appealed to chief secretary Dharmendra Sharma and sought his intervention to halt environmental violations.  UPCF has also warned the government that if the hill-cutting and tree-felling continue, they will file a writ petition in court. Activist Avertino Miranda said, “Politicians are acting like the mafia. They are using government machinery to threaten those who object.”  The activists said they fear that the road-widening and hill-cutting was just a means to benefit land sharks who had purchased land in the vicinity. “There is, what we see, a well-planned scam to grab comunidade land,” Miranda said. tnn
