JODHPUR: At a time when the issue of   is being debated in and outside the  , a Muslim woman from the city has appealed to prime minister   to abolish this system with immediate effect. The woman was given divorce in April through a piece of paper with talaq written on it thrice.

 In her letter to the PM, she has termed the system of triple talaq as inhumane and disastrous for Muslim women.
 
 “My husband Rizvan used to beat me and demand dowry frequently. When I and my parents protested, he evicted me from the house and sent this talaqnama by post,” said victim Shagufta who has bore the brunt of this draconian Sharia Law.
 
 Shagufta’s counsel Amit Maheshwari said that she had married Rizvan in December 2014 who himself was unemployed. He frequently demanded money from her parents for his business. A few months back, he evicted her from home and divorced her through a piece of paper exercising triple talaq.
 
 On the paper, Rizvan wrote that according to Sharia Law, he was divorcing her in the presence of two witnesses and that both of them were now free to remarry as per their choice.
 
 “Shagufta is hostile and argumentative. She visits her parents at will. There have been many attempts to make her mend her ways, but she has not changed. So talaq is the only solution,” the letter reads. After this, talaq is written thrice in the letter.
 
 “Now we have moved the family court to prohibit Rizvan from remarrying until the apex court gives its verdict on the triple talaq issue,” Maheshwari said.
 
 “This (triple talaq) system has devastated many families and so it must be abolished for the good of the Muslim society,” said Shagufta.
