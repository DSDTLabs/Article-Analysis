Nagpur: City policeâ€™s Jt CP Shivaji Bodkhe conducted a reshuffle of the   station in-charges on various administrative grounds on Monday. Among the senior PIs being transferred out of the police station were Sunil Jhaware of   police station who had been caught in the web of several controversies including allegation of thrashing a minor survivor challenged by the activists.

 Jhaware, also facing an inquiry by ACP ranking officer, has been sent to a non-executive wing of community policing under economic offence wing of the crime branch. The former professor of Botany and English had come under scanner after three constables from his police station were caught by the State Anti-corruption bureau (ACB) last year.   Mahesh Chate was removed from Kalamna police station too before being shunted to special branch. 
 
 PI Mahesh Chavan, who was removed from Ganeshpeth after BJP leader and corporator Dayashankar Tiwari, levelled allegations against him. Now, he has been posted to Mankapur police station. PI PM Bhatkar who was at Mankapur has been shifted to Juni Kamptee police station in place of PI SB Mane. Hudkeshwar police station would be now headed by Mane in the place of Jhaware.
 
 PI Khushal Tijare would be replacing PI Chate at Kalamna police station. PI Gulab Patil, earlier second PI at Ajni police station, would replace Tijare at Kotwali police station.
