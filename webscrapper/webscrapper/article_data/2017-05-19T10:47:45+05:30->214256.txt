 ﻿ R K Suresh played the bad guy in Thaarai Thappattai, which had Varalaxmi Sarathkumar as the female lead. Now, the two will be pairing up for a film titled Vargam, which will be directed by Indrajith, who has worked as an assistant with SS Rajamouli and has been a co-director for the Bãhubali filmmaker's father, Vijayendra Prasad.    Interestingly , the team is planning to shoot the entire film in just one day! Says Varalaxmi, “It is a rural subject and I play a village dame. We are currently taking part in rehearsals as we want to finish it in a day . If that doesn't happen, we might take one or two days and finish the shoot.“    “The film is an adaptation of a play , which has won five awards and has also won appreciation from K Balachander. We are rehearsing for 15 days and will go to shoot later this month, probably after the 25th. We are planning to shoot on the outskirts of the city,“ reveals Suresh.
