 "There was a possibility of the fire spreading on the tracks, which is why services from platforms 7 and 8 were halted temporarily from 6.13pm to 7pm. The power supply to the overhead wires was also switched off," said a CR official.

 Train services were delayed by 20-25 minutes and passengers returning home during the evening rush hour were inconvenienced. Sixteen services had to be cancelled. Chief fire officer P S Rahangdale said that they received a call around 6pm informing them about the fire. "Twelve fire engines and six water tankers were rushed to the spot. Since the area is congested, the railway line was affected. By 6.22pm the fire spread, however, we managed to confine it to only 15-20 hutments," said Rahangdale.
