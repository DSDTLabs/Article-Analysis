INDORE: From aam-panna to lime, cucumber and mint infused water, the residents of Indore are beating the   with healthy and natural summer drinks instead of going for flavoured and unhealthy options.

 The traditional cool drinks have always been healthy, said homemaker Jasbir Kaur, who every summer prefers making aam-panna for all the family members. There are several packaged drinks available in the market, however, those aren’t as healthy as the ones handed over to the families by their grandmothers, added the 48-year-old.
 
 “If my children get tired of drinking aam-panna, I make   shikanji for them as both these drinks have several health benefits and should be consumed regularly,” she added.
 
 While the traditional summer drinks have always been there, Indoreans have also started drinking different kind of detox water during summer to stay hydrated and healthy at the same time.
 
 Speaking about the reason for drinking only lemon and mint detox water during summer, fitness enthusiast and 26-year-old homemaker Bhawna Mali said, “Throughout the summer I don’t drink plain water. My water has to have mint and lemon in it. This water not only tastes good but keeps me healthy as well.” She ensures that all her family members drink at least one glass of her homemade lemon-mint detox water.
 
 With increasing heat, health conscious people have started shunning the packaged sweetened drinks and carbonated drinks, moreover, they are picking khus sherbet, kokum sharbet, wood apple and hibiscus juice, buttermilk and chia seeds drinks.
 
 Underscoring the benefits of naturally sweetened and healthy drinks, a 25-year-old fitness enthusiast Akanksha Singh said, “These drinks are natural coolers and help to keep us energetic. Plus the packaged ones are loaded with colours, additives and preservatives, which not only gives more calories, but leads to other health issues including obesity.” She has been suggesting the same to all her friends and family as well.
