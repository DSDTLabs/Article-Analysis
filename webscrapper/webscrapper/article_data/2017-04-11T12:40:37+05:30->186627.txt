NAGPUR: A classical music concert was organized by   on Monday at   to pay tributes to one of the most venerated music teachers of this region Pt Prabhakar  . April 10 also happened to be his death anniversary.

 A vocal and instrumental presentation in his memory by two of his students — vocalist Anjali Date and   artist Shankar Bhattacharya — were a befitting obeisance to a teacher who is remembered for the care and effort that he showered on his students. Starting her recital with raga Yaman, Date gave a pitch perfect recital with a bandish in madhya lay ‘Suno aaj gunijan’. She moved to another composition in the raga ‘Aye ri aali piya bin’ and finished it with élan with ‘Jiya main bas gaye Shyam’. She chose two compositions in raga Bhagyashree, ‘Aali sajan ghangar’ and ‘Daro rang mou pe lal’ for her next presentation and ended with a chaiti, ‘Chait maas bole re koyaliya’.
 
 A disciple of Aarti Ankalikar Tikekar, Date who learnt music from Pt Deshkar in her childhood, was pitch perfect in her renditions which were like balm for frayed nerves, and mesmerized in terms of tonal quality, alaap and laykari.
 
 Next to take the stage was sarod player Shankar Bhattacharya of city who works with a bank. Remembering Pt Deshkar, the musician was happy to be playing at an event organized for his guru. “Pt Deshkar’s contribution to music in this region is limitless. Though a much revered guru and musician he was humble to the core. I cherish the day when he accompanied me on the taanpura during one of my recitals,” he said.
 
 Bhattacharya paid his respects to his teacher by playing raga Rageshree and finished the recital with raga Kerwani. “This raga elevates the mood and I want to share this joy with my audience,” he said.
 
 Earlier another disciple of Pt Deshkar, Anuradha Padhye described Deshkar as a fatherly figure. “He was a very persuasive and insistent teacher and would not move ahead till he could get the right notes and tone from us.”
