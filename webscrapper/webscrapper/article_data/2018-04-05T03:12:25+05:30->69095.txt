GURUGRAM: A rap on the door followed by   woke up a 52-year-old woman in her house early on Wednesday. It was 5am, still pitch dark, and the neighbourhood completely silent, amplifying the noise. 

 When she opened the door to check, she found a man and woman having sex in a car parked right outside the main gate. The woman in the car was her 26-year-old neighbour, but she didn't immediately recognise her and, to get their attention, asked loudly what their names were. But the two in the car just ignored the 52-year-old's remonstrations. 
 
 When she raised her voice a second time, the younger woman allegedly threw a volley of abuses at the 52-year-old and, when she approached the car, even quipped, 'Why don't you join us, why don't you have some fun too?' The man, she alleged, grabbed her hand and tugged at her dupatta. 
 
 The woman then woke up other neighbours, who called the police. The man and the woman in the car were   and   in a public place and, later in the morning, produced before a local court, which sent the man to judicial custody and granted bail to the woman. The man, who police said was a 20-year-old Najafgarh (Delhi) resident and is at present a Class XII student, was also   under Section 354 of the IPC.
 
 Police said both were found to be  , and it appeared the woman had knocked on the older woman's door, believing it was her house (the younger woman lives in the same area, in a house just behind the 52-year-old's, according to local residents). After that, the two had moved to the car, but the knock had woken the older woman up, who had come out to check, a police officer said.
 
 "The two were arrested from the spot. The probe is on," said sub-inspector Madan Singh, additional SHO of Civil Lines police station.
