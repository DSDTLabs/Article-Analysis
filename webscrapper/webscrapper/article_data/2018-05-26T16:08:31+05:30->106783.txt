BENGALURU: When the discovery of Gravitational Waves was done for the first time in 2015 by the   team, it didn’t just prove Albert Einstein, who had spoken of the waves a Century ago right, but also an important concept predicted by Bengaluru-based scientist CV Vishveshwara (CVV), a black holes expert, who passed away in January 2017. 

 And, the team publicly acknowledged his contributions, although CVV was never directly part of LIGO. It was Vishveshwara’s work, carried out between 1968 and 1970, that provided fundamental insights into the nature of black holes, which became instruments in LIGO’s finding of the same. 
 
 He had used the equations of Einstein’s theory of general relativity to carry out meticulous calculations and analyse the structure of black holes. He went on to prove the stability of black holes that assured their continued existence in nature, once they were formed. 
 
 Forty-eight years after his published his theory and a year after his death, Prof Nils Andersson of the   has dedicated a book, ‘A Gentle Wizard’ to Vishveshwara. 
 
 The book, which discusses Albert Einstein's views of the universe, starting with 1905 and ending with the recent discovery of gravitational waves from colliding black holes, was launched in India on Thursday.
 
 The   (ICTS), which organised the launch, is planning to also distribute copies for free to interested school students and researchers. While Andersson’s dedication to Vishveshwara is lauded by the local scientific community, the Bengaluru scientists himself had spent most his living years without any limelight.
