AHMEDABAD:   on Wednesday issued a fresh notice to social activist   in response to an application filed by the state government in 2011 demanding   granted to her in connection with an alleged offence of preparation of false affidavits on behalf of the 2002 riots victims and filing them before the Supreme Court.

 Justice J B Pardiwala has sought Setalvad’s reply by April 4, when further hearing on the issue is posted.
 
 The state government had also sought directions from the HC to Setalvad to surrender herself to judicial custody. The government moved against the relief granted to her by a sessions court after the HC confirmed a magisterial court’s order to file an FIR on preparation of false affidavits.
 
 In 2011, the HC had to stop hearing on the state government’s application after the SC stayed the order for registration of an FIR in the case. Setalvad’s NGO, Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP) had challenged the HC’s confirmation of green signal to probe. However, in December 2017, the CJP withdrew the appeal from the apex court. This paved the way for the state government to start prosecuting the application before the HC.
 
 Setalvad had obtained anticipatory bail fearing arrest after police was to investigate the role of Setalvad’s former aide, Rais Khan and his associates. After he quit the CJP, Khan has been keen on testifying against her former employer.
