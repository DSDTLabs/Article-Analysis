AHMEDABAD: The   appears to have been a good one for   jewellers and bullion traders in Gujarat. At least the   in the state reflect the same. The import of the yellow metal in   in 2017 stood at 85.54 metric tonnes, according to data by Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex. This was an increase of 74.23% against the 49.1 metric tonne of gold imports in 2016.

 Speaking of reasons, jewellers and bullion traders claim that the market in 2017, despite a major tax reform, fared far better than what it was in 2016. Explaining more, Manoj Soni, a city-based jeweller, said, “In 2016, there were major setbacks for the market – the biggest blow being the 42-day strike observed by jewellers after the government imposed 1% excise duty on gold. This was a terribly lean season for jewellers and it took a long while for the market to recover.”
 
  
  “Post demonetization, the industry suffered in December 2016, when import of gold dipped abysmally low, especially amid a wedding season,” said Soni.
 
 On the other hand, jewellery demand remained buoyant during February and March 2017 when the market recovered from demonetization woes and jewellery demand also picked up due to wedding season, claim experts.
 
 “The demand for the yellow metal picked up significantly January 2017 onwards and remained buoyant more or less. Even the pre-GST period coupled with summer wedding season spelled good news for the market as jewellery purchases were good. We also had pre-bookings over speculation of a price rise,” said a city-based jeweller.
 
 November 2017 saw the highest import of gold with 14.40 metric tonne gold imported in 2017. Going forward, jewellers estimate that the demand will continue to soar in the wake of the ongoing wedding season, as there are number of good muhurats.
