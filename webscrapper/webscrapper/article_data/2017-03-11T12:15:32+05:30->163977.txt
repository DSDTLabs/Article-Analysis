VISAKHAPATNAM: Since the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has warned of a warm summer this year, state power utilities including city-based   (APEPDCL) are expecting a sharp raise in power consumption in the state.

 At present, the average power consumption per day is 165 million units (MU) and officials expect that this will touch 180 to 185 MUs by the beginning of April in the 20,575 villages across the state. Of this, 10,932 villages are under APEPDCL limits covering Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, East Godavari, West Godavari and Visakhapatnam. The state has two discoms that serve nearly 1.6 crore consumers. 
 
 K  , chairman and managing director of AP Genco and  , told TOI that the state would be able to overcome the demand of the power in the peak summer season as it has surplus in its kitty. 
 
 “We are not worried about the sharp increasing of power consumption in the state as we have sufficient and surplus power. The generation of power is also sufficient for us in the state,” Vijayanand said.
 
 The power generation companies in the state also has a stock of 10,64,666 metric tonnes of coal as on March 9, according to a report from APGenco.
 
 APEPDCL chairman and managing director MM Nayak said the discom has already reached last year’s highest power consumption mark. “For example, the discom registered the highest power consumption of 2670 MW in June 2016. It has already reached close to last year’s highest level in March. Three days ago, the discom registered highest power consumption of 2620 MW. This clearly indicates that consumption has shot up. However, the discom will be able to meet the power demand at any cost without any power interruption,” MM Nayak told TOI.
 
 Officials said in view of the surplus pwoer, even if the comsunption increases, every consumer is in a position to access high power consuming appliances like air-conditioners and air coolers.
