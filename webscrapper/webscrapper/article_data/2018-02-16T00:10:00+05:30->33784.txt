Actor   was in Bengaluru for a quick trip which was part work, part leisure. We managed to get him to meet us for a conversation at the Bangalore Times office, where he spoke about his Bengaluru connection, his upcoming   and even hinted that he’s dating someone.

 
 
 I love Bengaluru. I’ve been here a few times and in fact I have even dated a girl from Bengaluru. I love the vibe of this city. The people here are very charming. I’ve a few favourite spots that I like visiting. Of course, MG Road and Brigade Road figure in it.
 
 
 
 I’ve always enjoyed working at my own pace and doing what I like. I’ve never been in a hurry to do anything. This is one of the reasons why I think I have seamlessly moved across different mediums, be it television, film or now the digital platform.
 
 
 
 I might have a house in Bandra, Mumbai, but I never stay there when I’m not working. I like to take off on biking trips and go exploring spaces. I have a friend in Bristol, so I end up visiting him often and we travel together. In fact, I plan on moving there shortly. I’m also considering to take this biking and travel hobby of mine and convert into a show soon.
 
 
 
 I had a great time shooting for Sultan. Salman Khan is the most amazing human being and he welcomes everyone so affectionately. There are great memories from the time we shot for Sultan and I am grateful for all the love and appreciation that I’ve received for that film. 
 
 
 
 My next film is Gold, which is a very special film as it is a tribute to all the Indian hockey players. This film traces how India won the hockey gold medal in 1948. It is a wonderful film and I am sure everyone will feel immense pride watching it. I’ve played hockey when I was younger. My father used to play too and he was very good at it. I’m into sports, but I play football more than anything else.
 
 
 
 I will admit that there is someone in the horizon. But it is too early to talk about her or anything.
