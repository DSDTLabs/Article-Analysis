PUNE: In a day, two   from the city will set off on a quest to ascend the world’s tallest peak,  .Tax consultant   and owner of an adventure gear shop Vishal Kaduskar (32) will leave for Kathmandu on Sunday. 

 Zirpe, a senior mountaineer with Giripremi, has been to various stages of the climb over the years but he is yet to scale the peak. Hence, the 60-day expedition holds a special significance for him. “In 2012, we had taken a team of 12 members. Since it was such a large team, someone had to stay back and manage them so I stayed at Camp-2, located at 21,000 feet,” Zirpe recalled. A year later, Zirpe opted to return from Camp-4 to a lower camp so other participants could use his spare oxygen supply and continue forward.
 
 This time around, the 52-year-old has decided to scale the peak. Talking about planning for the feat, Zirpe said, “The climb requires physical and mental training. We will stay at high altitudes for the next 60 days. To prepare ourselves, we have been doing a lot of cardio exercises.”
 
 The mountaineer pointed out that after the first few days of staying at high altitudes, the rest of the expedition is entirely a mind game. “To prepare for this, we have been meditating and practicing various breathing exercises.”
 
 Another major concern during the climb will be food. Although, at those heights, food intake is low the body’s energy requirement is quite high. “On our previous climbs, ready-to-cook packets have not helped. We have found local alternatives to the food (champa) that the Sherpas consumed. It is a mixture similar to daliya,” Zirpe said.
 
 Zirpe and Kaduskar have also closely studied the weather in the area. Reports of the past few years show that between May 15 and 24, the wind speeds have been under 50km, per hour. This is more suitable for climbing, Zirpe explained.
