PATNA:   Sanjay Kumar Agarwal on Wednesday warned the   (PMC) staff deputed at electric crematoriums in the city against   with   and asked them to operate the facility properly and place signage with rate charts at the funeral ghats. 

 There is a general complaint that the timber merchants, in connivance with the PMC employees, allegedly fleece the bereaved families as they keep electric crematoriums shut to favour those supplying wood for pyres at the funeral ghats, the DM said and added that he has instructed the officials concerned to install CCTV cameras on the crematorium premises and launch a complaint number on which people could register their grievances. 
 
 Agarwal said one has to pay Rs300 at the   to perform the last rites of the deceased, but s/he will have to spend around Rs15,000 for arranging a funeral pyre of woods. Not only that, people have to wait for hours together to perform the last rites. “I visited the two city crematoriums recently and witnessed the loopholes. Many people were not aware of an electric crematorium at Gulbi Ghat because the timber merchants had blocked its entrance. Even at Bans Ghat, there are two furnaces, but only one was being used. At Khajekalan, too, the electric crematorium was not being operated,” he said.
 
 The DM also said he has asked the SDO and PMC officials to call a meeting and fix the rate of timber to be used to make pyres. “Use of electric crematorium will also bring down the pollution level. However, we do not force people to use them,” Agarwal said. 
 
 It is for the PMC to maintain the crematorium and, in case of any technical fault, Bihar Rajya Jal Parishad (BRJP) has to repair it.
