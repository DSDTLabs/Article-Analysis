CHANDIGARH: After   (MC) received poor response during the second auction of the 107 built-up booths at Mauli Jagran shopping centre, municipal commissioner   along with the concerned senior officers of the   visited the built-up booths on Friday morning. Yadav visited the sites following constant requests of area municipal councillor and former deputy mayor  . 

 Yadav with his team visited the site of the built-up booths and their surrounding areas to find out the factors responsible for the poor response of the auction. After seeing the deplorable condition of the toilets of the shopping centre, commissioner instructed the concerned officials to renovate the toilets, situated at the shopping centre and also clean the surrounding areas.
 
 Former deputy mayor Anil Kumar Dubey raised the issue to hold the auction of the booths at the Mauli Jagran itself instead of holding it in the committee room of the MC. "If the auction will be held here in Mauli Jagran, among the locals, rather than the office in the MC building, it would surely be of more benefit for the auction. I have requested the municipal commissioner in this regard and he has agreed upon it and assured us that from now onwards, auction of the booths will be held at the site only instead of the office," said Dubey.
 
 The estate office of the civic body authority on Thursday could auction only 2 built-booths out of a total of 107 booths. The first auction held a few days back was also a failure with only five auctioned. The poor response at the auction has been quite disappointing for the civic body, which is undergoing an acute financial crunch. The civic body had been looking for the means to generate revenue and thus had taken the decision to auction the booths, but could not succeed.
 
 Two booths, which were auctioned on Thursday fetched Rs 18.52 lakh and Rs 18.53 lakh respectively.
