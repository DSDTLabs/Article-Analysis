On a daily basis, nearly 5,000   are generated for offences at various city crossroads.
 
 Sudhir Desai, DCP (traffic), said that the traffic branch collects an average of Rs 3 lakh to Rs 4 lakh daily towards traffic offences. “Now those who have received the e-challans can make payment online through the secure website that provides different payment options to the users. If someone has multiple e-challans pending, they can pay all at one go by selecting the boxes,” he said.
 
 The users will have to provide the challan number, vehicle registration number and driving license number to make the payment. They can also take a printout of the payment receipt.
