LUCKNOW: The engineering students of   on Wednesday protested against the university decision to shut BTech courses. They said the decision will leave hudreds of engineering students in the lurch. The students protested outside   vice-chancellor's residence. 

 Protesters alleged that the university disseminated the information through media instead of informing them directly. "The university has cited poor enrollment for closure of BTech courses. But in reality, these courses lack in infrastructure and faculty," a student said.
 
 Students shouted anti-university slogans and demanded continuation of the course. "The university authorities kept us in the dark that its BTech course were not recognised by the AICTE. How can they play with our future," asked a student.
 
  "The temporary arrangement has been going on for the past five years. Students are agitated that after paying fees, how can the university discontinue the courses mid-way," said a teacher. BBAU proctor   in a circular uploaded on the university's website stated: "Open interaction between students of UIET ( )) and VC was held on Wednesday, and most of the demands of students were considered and resolved. Any other issues, if exist, will be sorted out within a month for the growth of UIET and in the interest of students."
