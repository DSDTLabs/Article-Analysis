CHENNAI: Even as the Public Works Department has identified nearly 600 commercial establishments lining the   river, it has been unable to evict the structures. The department says the owners file numerous litigations just ahead of the demolition drives, resulting in a stay order on the process. 

 
 On Monday, a demolition drive targeting an eatery in   had to be postponed as there was not enough police protection. "We had planned to demolish the eatery but did not get police protection for the same. We are expecting to pull the structure down by next week," an official told TOI.
 
 The public works department had identified 581 such commercial establishments lining the Cooum river that need to be removed as they encroach the river boundary. It is a part of the Integrated Cooum Eco-restoration Project that is being undertaken by seven government departments. Of the 581 establishments, 458 are those which have been identified for allotment of commercial space at Auto Nagar Singaperumal Kovil in Kancheepuram district.
 
 The remaining structures identified along the river from Padi Kuppam all the way until Napier Bridge is mired in litigations. Residents in Thideer Nagar were evicted last year but the mechanic shops and a hotel still remain. 
 
 But according to sources from the Eco-Restoration Project, the   had exhausted all its means to evict the hotel and the mechanic shops."Only six to seven encroachments have been removed this year," said a source from PWD.
