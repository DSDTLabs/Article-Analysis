THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Even though the previous   government had mooted the much-hyped  , it lapsed in May 2015 as it was not presented on the floor of the assembly. There was severe opposition and several organizations, including the Indian Medical Association (IMA) had opposed certain guidelines in the Bill. There were reports that the Bill was not tabled in the assembly due to the influence of private hospitals.

 However, former health minister   said that he did not get time to present the Bill in the assembly. “The Bill can be reintroduced by the LDF government and there is no point in claiming that it lapsed. The Bill is already listed and this can be done,“ he said.
 
 However, the state branch of the Indian Medical Association is of the opinion that it opposed the previous bill since small and medium hospitals cannot possibly implement many of the clauses in it.“The clauses were supporting corporate hospitals. A single-doctor hospital or clinic is already facing closure. Over the past 10 years, 500 such hospitals were shut down in the state,“ said former IMA state president Dr Sreejith N Kumar.
 
 The bill envisaged a bevy of licensing or registration system for hospitals and demanded several facilities like 24-hour service, emergency care and classification of hospitals. IMA is of the opinion that many such clauses will lead to an increase in treatment costs.
 
 “Such conditions will lead to the closure of small hospitals and will also increase the treatment cost at corporate hospitals. It will also wind up the single-man clinics which is the backbone of the health model of the state,“ said IMA state secretary elect Dr N Sulphi.
 
 Even though Sivakumar claimed that the bill was drafted after having discussion with all organizations and experts, IMA leaders said that it was not kept for an open discussion.
