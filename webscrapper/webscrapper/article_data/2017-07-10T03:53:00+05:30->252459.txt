Panaji: An east-west shear zone (which creates an atmospheric imbalance) has triggered heavy rainfall in some parts of Goa on Sunday. The shear zone helped bring down the temperature, as the sun was seen more often over the last couple of weeks. Due to the weak monsoon activity, the deficit in rainfall had increased to 18%, but this may change slightly with heavy rainfall reported in some parts. During the last 24 hours, till Sunday morning, moderate rainfall was recorded in most places, a slight change from the previous week. Sanguem, in the hinterlands recorded the highest - 43mm and Pernem the lowest at 18.8mm. 13 other measuring centres are likely to record higher rainfall during 24 hours, till Monday morning. The met centre at Altinho has forecast heavy rainfall at isolated places over Goa, on Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday. “The rainfall may be light to moderate on Monday and Tuesday,” D Sanap, scientist, at met centre at Altinho said. Heavy rainfall is likely in isolated places on Wednesday and Thursday.
