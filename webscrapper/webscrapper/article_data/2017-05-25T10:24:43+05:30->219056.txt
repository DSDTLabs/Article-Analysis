KOLHAPUR: The district forest department will review the mining activities in the district in the next few days.

 “If we find any illegal mining in the forest area, strict action will be taken against the private owners,” said deputy forest conservator Prabhunath Shuka.
 
 Bauxite mining is most common in the district and mostly found in Radhanagari, Shuwadi, Chandgad, Budargad, Aajara talukas.
 
 As per the official information from the forest department, there are six Bauxite mining activities taking place under the private ownership.
 
  said, “We have approached various district mining officers in the district. Our department will be conducting a survey in different mining areas in the next few days. We have the land records with us and if we find any illegal activity on the forest land, strict action will be taken against them.”
 
 “The culprits would be held under forest conservation act 1980. In the recent past, we have not found a single illegal mining case on the forest lands in the district,” he added.
 
 Wildlife researcher and activist   said, “Mining is prohibited in 10 km aerial distance from the forest areas. Since it is done using heavy machinery, it poses threat to wildlife and ecosystem in the forest areas.”
 
 “Another major concern is noise pollution that disturbs the animals in their habitat. Mining also attributes to heavy air pollution. Dust gets accumulated on the leaves of the tree that affects the photosynthesis thereby afftecting the growth of the tree,” he said.
 
 Talking about corruption in mining, he added, “Mining is a source of income for local politicians. The government should not permit mining and protect the forest and nearby areas to save the local ecosystem.”
