KOLHAPUR: The sale of petrol and diesel from over   in the district — located along the border of the state — has dropped by 70% owing to disparity between prices in Maharashtra and Karnataka.

 Petrol in Karnataka is cheaper by Rs 9 per litre, while diesel is cheaper by Rs 3.50 per litre as against the prices in Maharashtra. The petrol and diesel operators claim the disparity is due to Maharashtra government's decision to impose surcharge of Rs 3 and abolition of entry tax in Karnataka on petroleum products after Goods and Services Tax ( ) came into effect from July 1.
 
 The GST has included all indirect taxes, but petrol and diesel has been kept out of the GST ambit which means the states can levy additional taxes on fuel.
 
 Gajkumar Mangave, district president of petrol pump operators association, said, “Petrol pumps located in areas like Chandgad, Sangli, Miraj have been adversely affected due to disparity in fuel prices. The government has increased the surcharge by Rs 3 and recently Rs 2 to compensate the revenue loss caused due to the closing of the liquor shops from the state.”
 
 He added, “Also, after GST, the entry tax imposed by the   got abolished and prices in that state reduced by further Rs 3 to Rs 4 per litre.”
 
 Petrol prices in the state currently stand out as the costliest in the country. The average hike in prices of petrol starting from January is around four to five times. Operators claim that prices of petrol and diesel should have been cheaper by at least Rs 3 per litre after implementation of the GST.
 
 “After GST, the prices should have come down. However, the benefit is not passed on to the consumers. All petrol pump operators are going to meet in Mumbai on Saturday to discuss the issue and demand roll back of the surcharge,” said Mangave.
