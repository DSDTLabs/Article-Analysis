Considering she has been dominating the globe with all her feats, it came as a surprise when Quantico actress   revealed on  's chat show 
  that she was subject to racist treatment on an international flight.
 
 When Karan asked Priyanka if she had faced racism which is a global phenomenon, Priyanka told him how on a flight from Europe to New York, the air host stopped her from going to the loo upfront and directed her to the one at the back assuming she was flying economy. This reaction from him was due to Priyanka's brown colour. 
 
 
 
 Priyanka called it a first world problem and one of those small episodes that keep happening. Also, she told Karan how in the west they think Indians cannot speak English and are almost surprised with her language skills. This always prompts her to clarify that English and Hindi are her first languages. 
  
 Well, as long as our global girl is confident enough to counter these difficult situations, it is all fine.
