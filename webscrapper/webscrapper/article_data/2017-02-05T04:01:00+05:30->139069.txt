Ahmedabad: Birders in the state are overjoyed because multiple reports have confirmed the presence of spotted sandgrouse in Banni region of Kutch. According to experts, the last sighting of the bird in the region was recorded in 1997. “We recently took pictures of the species in Banni grassland where there is a flock of around 100-125 birds,” said Aditya Roy, of an adventure tours firm. “It is a migratory bird which comes from countries like Israel. The flocks spend winters in western India.”

 
 Online records show that avid birdwatchers had spotted the bird as early as November last year in the same region. The records mention that the birds are shy. Renowned ornithologist Salim Ali had characterized the spotted sandgrouse as a winter visitor to Kutch. tnn
