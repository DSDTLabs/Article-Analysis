TRICHY: Mere appeals to the Centre without applying any political pressure alone will not help in getting the   (CMB) constituted, VCK leader   has said. He said that despite the decision taken at the all-party meeting to meet the Prime Minister in Delhi with their demand, the Tamil Nadu government did nothing, he told reporters at the   airport here on Monday.

 With only a few days left for the Centre to fulfil the Supreme Court’s order to constitute CMB, the Tamil Nadu government should arrange for a meeting with the President or at least the concerned minister if there was no chance in meeting the Prime Minister, he added.
 
 “The ruling BJP government is purposely delaying and trying to avoid the issue. Because the Centre is eyeing the ensuing assembly elections in our neighbouring state Karnataka, there is no opportunity for the CMB to be constituted. So there is no doubt that the Centre is clearly betraying the Tamil community,” he said.
 
 Despite stiff resistance from the farming community against the hydrocarbon project, the Union government has commenced the process of establishing 28 more oil wells across the delta districts, Thirumavalavan said.
 
 “Farmers have decided to stage a protest opposing the proposed oil and gas exploration project at Ammapettai in Thanjavur. Viduthalai   (VCK) would extend its support to the farmers”, Thirumavalavan added.
 
 “The Union government’s decision to set up a nine-member panel to fulfil the order of the   in the   water dispute was an eye-wash. So, the Tamil Nadu government should not fall prey to the Union government,” he added.
