Coimbatore: P Shruthi of Nava India, who was arrested for cheating a Germany-based software engineer of Rs 69.04 lakh by promising to marry him, was detained under the Goondas Act on Friday. Police have also detained her mother Chitra and stepfather Prasanna Venkatesh under the Act.

 Shruthi, a failed actress, had cheated several men and is facing six cheating cases in Coimbatore, Thirumangalam, Nagapattinam and Chennai to the tune of Rs 2.05 crore, police sources said.

 Police had arrested Shruthi, her mother, stepfather and her younger brother P Subash in January. All of them were remanded in judicial custody. They have been spending their days behind the bars at the Coimbatore Central Prison.
 
 The order copies were served to Shruthi and Prasanna Venkatesh by a team of police officers at the jail. When they tried to serve the order to Chitra, she complained of dizziness. Subsequently, the officers had to wait for more than one hour to serve the order to her. TNN
