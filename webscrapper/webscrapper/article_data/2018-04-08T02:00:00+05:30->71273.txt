 The Union government, Col (retd) Singh pointed out, has also appointed retired Army officers as state governors. “It is a myth that Armymen are fit to fight on borders only,” he said and added a person does not need to know rocket science to be a successful  .
 
 Referring to the opposition by a section of academics to these appointments, Col (retd) Singh said, “We have already waited for long to see the varsities change for the better, but in vain. University examinations are delayed; results are replete with errors; teachers are not paid their arrears... There is hardly any work culture in the offices of universities,” he said.
