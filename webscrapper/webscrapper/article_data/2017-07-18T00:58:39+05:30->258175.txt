ULHASNAGAR: Taking lesson from last year’s incident in which two Ganesh devotees died due to   while carrying a 15-ft idol on a trolley here, the administration has decided not to give permission for   above 10 feet to mandals here. 

 The decision was taken at a meeting on Monday, called by Kalani over the issue, which was attended by police, civic officials, MSEDCL officials and local representatives. 
 
 Last August, Hitesh Kukreja (20) and Hitesh Sachdev (20) from Jai Mata Di Mandal from   were carrying an idol from a Ganpati workshop in Parel to Ulhasnagar. The idol, covered in plastic, touched an overhead wire and Talreja and Sachdev got electrocuted, while another person were thrown aside.
 
 Kalani told TOI, “After the incident, many citizens demanded a ban on big Ganesh idols. Along with idol size, we have also planned to create awareness on an eco-friendly festival this year.”
 
 Mandals and citizens welcomed the decision. Lal Tanwani, a professor, said, “It is a really good move which has been taken by the administration and all mandals should follow it as it will send out a good message to mandals in neighbouring cities.”
