KOLKATA: Disbelief is palpable in the Bardhan household 24 hours after the death of matriarch  . Her three daughters and only son are busy putting in place arrangements for the funeral scheduled on Sunday, but a mere mention of their mother is enough to make tears well up.

 “I still feel there will be a knock on the door and my mother will walk in and say she went to a neighbour’s place — something she often did,” says daughter  , who is struggling to put together a guest list for the ceremony.
 
 The south Kolkata neighbourhood of   was witness to the macabre sight of Kalpana, 72, burning herself to death in the community playground early on Friday. 
 
 A day after her shocking death, family, friends and the entire neighbourhood are struggling to come to terms with her demise.
 
 “A few months ago, a person committed suicide in the neighbourhood. It kept haunting my mother for weeks. It is unbelievable that a person like her would take such a step,” says son  .
 
 Nobody in the family has been able to figure out what may have led their mother to take such a step. Kalpana stayed alone on the ground floor, but she would visit Bhaumik everyday.
 
 “Till Thursday night she was planning and instructing. This shows that she had not made up her mind to end her life, or at least that is what we felt. We still don’t know what triggered it,” adds daughter-in-law Rupali.
 
 “I met her everyday, but I could not figure out any change in her behaviour which may have made her take this step,” says Santa.
 
 In the neighbourhood, there is a mix of sadness and fear. “I don’t think anybody in the neighbourhood slept last night,”   (63), Kalpana’s friend who stays a few buildings down, chips in.
