MEERUT: In a sensational twist to the horrific murder of an 18-year-old bride on NH-58 near Meerut, a few hours after her wedding on Friday, police now say it could be the act of a spurned lover. 

 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 "As of now, it comes across as revenge of a jilted lover or a case of robbery. Several teams have been pressed into action to crack the case," Prashant Kumar, additional director general (Meerut zone), said. 
 
  
  
 
 
 According to sources, police have detained two youths from the bride's village, Nahal in  , though top officials are tight-lipped about the development. 
 
  Over half-a-dozen assailants had waylaid the newlywed's car on NH-58 in Meerut's Mataur village late on Friday evening and shot the 18-year-old bride, Mehvish Parveen (known as Farhana to her family). She died on the spot. Farhana and the groom, Mohammed Shazeb, 22, along with three other relatives, were going in the car to Shazeb's house in Muzaffarnagar after their wedding. Another angle that police are looking at is a robbery bid that went wrong. 
 
 "The car looted in the incident has been recovered. Both families are poor and the marriage was solemnised at a community wedding in Noida's Dadri. The bride wore artificial jewellery and the family wasn't carrying much cash though they have claimed that they were robbed of Rs 2.5 lakh in cash and ornaments," SP (crime)   said.
