BHOPAL: Poor returns and lack of cash post demonetization have forced farmers in the state to destroy their tomato and other vegetable crops. Rate of tomatoes crashed in mandis to Re 1 to 50 paisa a kg in various parts of Sagar and   districts. 

 Adding insult to injury, farmers are being offered Rs 100 cheque for 100 kg of produce citing cash crunch due to demonetisation.
 
 Hundreds of farmers in Bina in Sagar have been forced to throw away their farm produce before cattle. Cattle were also being fed with cauliflower, coriander leaves and brinjal among others on Saturday. A bumper production has led to the situation where the rates of vegetables especially tomato have nosedived. The perishable commodity in abundance was sold at Rs 10 a crate containing 10 kg in Bina, said   a farmer.
 
 "The middlemen or adhatiya in local language has been exploiting the farmers who has not been able to pay the transport charges to ferry the produce from farmlands to mandi," he said. He said the middlemen were also making small payments of Rs 100 by cheque. Patel said, it is better to feed the cattle with the fresh vegetables rather than sell it at throw away polices. In return, they may give more milk.
 
 Farmers would load tractor trollies and unload the produce before the cattle at home. Some villagers take them away for their cattle as well, said another farmer Babloo Kushwah, resident of Khimlasa village, 18 kms away from Bina. He said, "I had spent Rs 25,000 on seeds, manures and maintenance of the crop to ensure a good crop. I did not expect such a low price, which does not even meet the cost of cultivation, let alone transportation expenses"
 
 In Ashoknagar, situation is even worse. Tomato crates weighing 25 kg are being sold at Rs 13 in mandis.  , a farmer of Igalkhedi in Ashoknagar district said, "I had spent Rs 50,000 on 3 bighas of land for cultivating tomatoes. Now I have decided to destroy them by running over the standing crops with tractor." TNN
