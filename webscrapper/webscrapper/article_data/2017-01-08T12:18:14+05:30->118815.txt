BENGALURU: Indian students studying in   across the world have sought the intervention of the Centre to facilitate a minimum two-year work permit in countries where they are studying. 

  Speaking on the sidelines of a   on Saturday, joint secretary in Union ministry of external affairs Vani S Rao said the government has been receiving complaints from Indian students studying abroad that they are unable to get work experience after finishing education. 
 
  Speaking about the concerns of students studying in the UK, Rao said their issues were placed before the   May when she had recently come to India. "The issue is still under process and we are yet to reach a conclusion," Rao said. 
 
  The MEA officials present at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, however, said the response from the UK has not been so positive. 
 
  Officials said similar concerns have been pouring in from Indian students studying in several foreign countries - from Scandanavia to America - where   is being followed. Over 6.5 lakh Indian students are studying in foreign universities worldwide. 
 
  Besides,   have also shared their concern about the abnormal fee structure in Indian universities. "Their demand is to consider them as Indians, and not foreign nationals, when it comes to fee charged from them," Rao said.
