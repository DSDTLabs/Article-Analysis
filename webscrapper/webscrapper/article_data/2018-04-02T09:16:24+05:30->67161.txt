ITANAGAR:   power minister   said on Sunday the complete restoration of power supply in the eastern part of the state will take a few more days. This is because of the extent of the damages caused by the cyclonic storm on Thursday, which led to electric poles being uprooted and conductors having been snapped by falling trees, he added. 

 
 The state cabinet has issued orders to engage all the available machinery to restore power supply as quickly as possible. "The power department, with the help of local people and other government bodies, has been doing their best to restore supply. The services rendered by the department during the hour of crisis is indeed praiseworthy," Taga said in a statement on Sunday. The storm that hit   on the evening of March 29 caused heavy damage to power lines, plunging districts of West Kameng, East Kameng, Papum Pare, Lower Sunbansiri, Upper Subansiri, Kra-Daadi, Kurung Kumey, Kamle, Lower Siang, Upper Siang, Siang, East Siang, and the entire eastern part of the state into complete darkness.
