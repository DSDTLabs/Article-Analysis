CHENNAI: The   may be grumbling about the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) banning Euro III vehicles from April 1, 2017, but some companies are taking the opportunity to highlight their environment-friendly stand by announcing that they no longer produce   vehicles. 

  Motor has released a statement saying that it stopped manufacturing BS III vehicles "more than a year ago as we believe in providing state of the art technology through our vehicles in our countryâ€™s fight against pollution. All our vehicles currently being sold in India are BS IV compliant. Further in line with Government of India planning, we are readying to introduce BS VI fuel complaint vehicles as soon as such fuel is available across the country."
 
 The EPCA order has created a furore in the auto industry with companies saying that there would be a stockpile of nine lakh vehicles in April when BS III is phased out. 
 
 Industry body SIAM has apparently informed the pollution control board the 20,000 passenger vehicles, 75,000 commercial vehicles, 47,000 three-wheelers and about 7,50,000 two-wheelers (all of BS III stage) would remain yet to be sold as of April 1. 
 
 Already there has been a spurt in commercial vehicle demand as customers pre purchase discounted BS III trucks before the April deadline. Auto experts say CV demand will likely flatten out after April 1.
