CHENNAI: The   personnel were ‘teachers’, the road had been turned into an improptu çlass’ and the students were those caught for   on December 31 and January 1. 

 Atleast 300 revellers were made to stay for more than three hours and lectured on the dangers of driving while drunk. 
 
 Police booked 135 people for driving under the influence of alcohol. Besides being booked, people who were caught in drunk driving cases were also made to watch awareness videos, which showed pictures of accident scenes.
 
 These special camps were set up in areas like  ,  , Kamarajar Salai and East Coast Road. Police screened all bikers but mainly those riding high-end bikes who were trying to race. Many pleaded the policemen to spare them but police were not ready to look the other way.
 
 “We did not send them home immediately though many convinced us that they could ride the vehicle and reach home safely,” said R Sudhakar, joint commissioner, traffic (south). 
 
 According to data released by the ministry of road transport and highways, the intake of alcohol/drugs by drivers resulted in 14,894 road accidents (3.1%) and 6,131 fatalities (5.1%) in 2016. The total number of road accidents reported in the country was 4,80,652 causing injuries to 4,94,624 persons and claiming 1,50,785 lives.
 
 “Such data was shown to them to create awareness,” said the officer. While many promised to stop driving while drunk, a few were not in a position to understand what was being taught.
