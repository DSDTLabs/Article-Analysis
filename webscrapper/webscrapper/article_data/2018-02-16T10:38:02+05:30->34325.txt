BHOPAL: While   banned students seeking basic infrastructure on the campus from protesting, it has several newlyconstructed buildings that are lying unused. These buildings were constructed at a cost of over Rs 50 crore.

 The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) had unearthed financial discrepancies to the tune of Rs 12 crore in various works and purchases at the   (MANIT) between 2013 and 2015.
 
 MANIT witnessed construction of energy resource centre that cost Rs 48 crore, a new premises for the director’s office and its staff, shopping centre and new teaching block. But, only the new teaching block and part of the new director office is being used as of now.
 
 The then director Appu Kuttan sanctioned construction of energy resource centre that housed a library also. The centre, built on a cricket ground, has not been put to use till date. “Half of the MANIT campus, sprawled over 650 acres of land, is lying unused. What was the need to construct buildings that were never used,” said a teaching faculty.
 
 The shopping complex has several unoccupied shops. A new director office was opened, but was never used ever since Kuttan left.
 
  (planning and development) Prof MS   admitted several constructions, are left unused. “Energy resource centre could not be used after the contractor escalated the cost of construction beyond the estimated cost. It was supposed to be completed within the estimated cost of Rs 48 crore. However, the constructor claimed the building had cost him Rs 57 crore. Now, an arbitrator has been appointed to resolve the issue,” said  .
 
 About the director office, he said, “It will be used as committee room. Likewise, shops have come up, at shopping complex.”
