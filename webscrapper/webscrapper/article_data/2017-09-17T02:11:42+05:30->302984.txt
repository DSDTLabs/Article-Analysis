GHAZIABAD:   on Friday arrested an accused for the   of   manager  , whose bullet ridden body was found in his car in   area seven days ago.

 The accused Umesh Sharma is deceased’s brother-in-law and according to police both had planned to fake the loot and share the company’s money which Sonu was carrying. However, greed got better of him and Umesh shot Sonu while they were going to Sahibabad. He fled with six lakh rupees.
 
 “We found Sonu had taken a different route to bank on September 11. He regularly went to the bank to deposit the company’s money,” said Akash Tomar, superintendent of police (city). “We became almost certain after analysing the phone records that Sonu was involved in the loot and when we questioned other employees, we got to know of Umesh’s involvement,” added Tomar.
 
 Umesh was unemployed and was in dire need of money so he devised a plan of loot with Sonu. “As per the plan, on September 11, instead of going to the bank Sonu was to head to Sahibabad with the money in his Wagon R car and pick Umesh midway,” said Tomar. They had planned that Umesh would get down in city forest in Karhera, Sahibabad with the money and Sonu would later cook a story that he had been robbed.
 
 “On that day, he was carrying Rs 17 lakh, out of which Rs 11 lakh were in another bag which Umesh didn’t know about. While the duo were going, Umesh requested on some pretext to sit on the back seat. When they reached the forest, Umesh shot him twice and fled with the bag that had Rs 6 lakh,” said Tomar. “He didn’t notice the other bag in which Rs 11 lakh was kept,” added Tomar.
 
 “To deflect any suspicion, Umesh went to Sonu’s house when his body was found and grieved with the family, but we found conclusive proof of his involvement which finally led to his arrest,” said Tomar. The police have recovered the looted amount and also recovered the revolver used in the crime.
