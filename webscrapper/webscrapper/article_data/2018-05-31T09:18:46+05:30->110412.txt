CHENNAI: In a setback to former Union minister P Chidambaram’s immediate family members, the Madras high court on Wednesday refused to stay prosecution initiated against them by the income tax department under the   Act.

 On May 11, the I-T department filed a complaint against Chidambaram’s wife Nalini, a designated senior advocate, their son   and daughter-in-law Srinidhi for alleged non-disclosure of overseas assets in the special court for economic offences here.
 
 The complaints were filed under Section 50 of the Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act. According to the I-T department, Nalini, Karti and Srinidhi failed to disclose a property they jointly own in Cambridge, in the UK worth Rs 5.37 crore.
 
 Apart from this, the department has alleged that Karti had failed to disclose an overseas bank account he holds with Metro Bank in the UK and investments he had made in Nano Holdings LLC, USA. Karti has also failed to disclose investments made by Chess Global Advisory, a company co-owned by him which amounts to an offence under the Black Money Act, the department said in its complaint.
 
 Assailing the move, the three moved the high court seeking interim order staying the prosecution and to direct the department to provide a copy of the complaint to them.
 
 Senior counsel Satish Parasaran submitted that no offence under the Black Money Act could be made out against the petitioners since they had prima facie disclosed the foreign assets in their income tax returns. “Failure to disclose in the prescribed format would not amount to an offence. It was just a clerical error which was rectified through revised return which is legally permissible under IT Act,” he added.
 
 Refusing to pass any interim order, Justice S Baskaran recorded the submission of the department that the copies of sanction order for prosecution could not be furnished to the petitioners and directed it to file counter by June 5.
