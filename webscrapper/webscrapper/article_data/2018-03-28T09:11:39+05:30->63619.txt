BENGALURU: KPCC president G Parameshwara on Tuesday said the Congress is aware that overconfidence is a factor in the party, as is   in some constituencies, but was confident that the party would get the numbers to form the government on its own.

 In an interaction with the media here, Parameshwara said an independent survey done by the party had given the Congress the requisite numbers to return to power, but declined to reveal the findings. He ruled out the BJP getting a majority. “The BJP will get the numbers it won in 2013, add the six seats of KJP, BSR (Congress) and a few more,” he added.
 
 Parameshwara said the government, per se, was not facing an anti-incumbency factor. “There may be some unhappiness over some individuals or legislators for not working up to the people’s expectations, but on the whole, there is no substantial unhappiness against the Siddaramaiah government,” he said.
 
 On the state government’s decision to accord religious minority status to Veerashiava-Lingayats professing 12th century reformer Basavanna’s principles, Parameshwara said: “Religion is not something decided by a political party. The Congress will not involve itself in it as there are historians and learned people to do so. The government can only recommend to the Centre, and chief minister Siddaramaiah has done that by representing their issue.’’
