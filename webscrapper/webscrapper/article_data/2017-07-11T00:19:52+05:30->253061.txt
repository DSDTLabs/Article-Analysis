Kolhapur: Cut-off marks in science and commerce streams may fall this year, due to surprisingly low response, according to CAP committee officials.

 The centralised   process (CAP) committee started scrutinising class XI application forms on Sunday.
 
 An official from CAP committee, who wished to remain anonymous, said that this year the number of forms sold has declined by almost 2,000. However the number of forms submitted remained the same at around 12,000.
 
 “Take this for example, science stream which is highly sought after every year, saw the response fall by 2,000 less applications. This is a blessing in disguise for students who have applied as there will be less competition. It might result in a fall in the cut-off,” said the official.
 
 The official added that not only science, but even the commerce stream received 4,187 forms against 4,120 seats in city colleges offering commerce. According to the official, the condition is worst in arts as only 1,904 forms were submitted against 3,840 seats, which comes to less than 50% of total seats.
 
 The official said this year as many as 14,299 forms were sold and 12,359 forms have been collected for arts, science and commerce streams. The number is low, as the diversion of students is higher compared to 2015, when over 14,000 forms were submitted.
 
 “Students have started exploring other career options. Courses in polytechnic, industrial training, fine arts, and even distance education courses are available these days,” said the official.
 
 Education activist Sattappa Mohite said, “It is heartening to see many students opting for other career choices rather than going for the conventional education pattern.”
 
 The CAP committee official said the scrutiny of forms will be completed by July 16 and the merit list will be declared on July 17 at 3 pm.
