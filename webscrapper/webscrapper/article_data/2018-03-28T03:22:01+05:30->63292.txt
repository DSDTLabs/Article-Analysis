NEW DELHI: The   is investigating the allegations of Class XII economics paper   with officials saying the matter has also been passed on to the Delhi Police crime branch internally. The questions were allegedly hand-written and passed on to teachers and students a day before the exam. 

 Senior officials said they would rely on the police to trace the “leaked” paper through possible handwriting analysis. Cops, however, said they were unaware of any such movement by the board, though the matter could have been referred to them internally.
 
 TOI, on Tuesday, reported that the Class XII economics paper was allegedly circulated widely among teacher and student groups. Several teachers complained that while it seemed like a harmless sample paper in the beginning, only after the exam was over did they realise it had exactly the same questions as a particular set of the Monday paper. Teachers added that they saw students referring to the paper minutes before the exam, some even taking printouts of the “leaked” paper. 
 
 This is the second reported leak scare, after the Class XII accountancy paper was allegedly available even before the students wrote their exams. The matter is still with the police, and investigations are on.
