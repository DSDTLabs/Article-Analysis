SURAT: Western Railway’s (WR) technical team conducted a   for two newly installed escalators to facilitate passengers, especially senior citizens and disabled, to effortlessly reach platform numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 of Surat railway station on Tuesday. 

 Official sources said the newly installed escalators are likely to be dedicated to passengers in the second week of February. 
 
 The work of installing the escalators gained momentum following reports published in TOI in October 2017, highlighting the plight of senior citizens due to a non-functional escalator at the parcel office to reach platform number 1 for the last 18 months.
 
 Following the TOI reports, the WR terminated the earlier firm’s contract on charges of failing to install and commission the escalators at Surat. Hence, a new contractor was hired and awarded the work for installing the escalators.
 
 Railway Station Development Citizen’s Forum (RSDCF) member Rajesh Modi said, “At last, the WR has come to the rescue of passengers in the Diamond City as well as those coming from other places. The   is almost complete and trial run is going on. We hope that the escalators will be dedicated for public use soon.”
 
 “I have been continuously pursuing the issue of escalators with top authorities of WR since past many months. Earlier, the authorities told me that some construction parts of the escalators were yet to arrive. So, there was a delay. Later, they told me that RSDO is yet to give approval for operation of the escalators,” Modi said. 
 
 Area railway officer (ARO) C R Garuda told TOI, “Trial run for the two escalators connecting platform numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 is going on. There is some work pending for basement of the escalators. We plan to dedicate the escalators to the public in the next fortnight.”
