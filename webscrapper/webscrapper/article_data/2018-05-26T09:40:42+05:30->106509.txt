PANAJI: Though the average performance of students who cleared the Class X state board exams showed an improvement this year, the performance of students in mathematics and science continued to be below par. 

 With 7.7% students failing in science and 5.7% students unable to clear mathematics, this is the highest percentage of failure for any subjects. In a year when the   saw 91.3% students clear the Class X exam, the performance in these two subjects brought down the overall pass percentage.
 
 
  
 
 Goa Board chairperson   said that with 92.4% having cleared the science paper and 94.3% having cleared the mathematics paper, the performance can be termed as ‘good’.
 
 This, however, was the lowest pass percentage among the subjects. The pass percentage for languages stood between 99% to 100% and for social sciences, it stood at over 96%. 
 
 At the 2018 Class XII exam results, Goa Board statistics showed that one in five students who appeared for the mathematics paper in the science stream could not clear it. This failure ratio was the highest for any subject at the exams.
 
 Similarly, when the Goa Common Entrance Test (GCET) results were declared earlier this month, S S Major, the   coordinator from   Bombay, expressed concern over the poor performance of students in physics. Only 2% of over 4,000 students who answered the physics paper at GCET scored 55% or above.
 
 These performances, however, are consistent with the outcome of Goa students in the national achievement surveys where the state’s students fared poorly in science and mathematics and did well in languages.
