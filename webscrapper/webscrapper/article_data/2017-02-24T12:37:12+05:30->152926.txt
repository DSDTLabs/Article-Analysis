PATNA: Students studying in government middle and   in   under   sub-division are fed up with poor quality of   being served to them. The general refrain is that none of the government schools in Khagaul follow the government directives while serving meals to students as per the menu fixed for each day.

 A visit to these schools revealed that most of the schools do not have their separate kitchens to prepare meals. The cooks prepare midday meals under the trees. The condition of Kanya Vidyalaya at Chhoti Khagaul near Kacchi Talab is no different. “The school has no separate kitchen for preparation of midday meal. As a result, the cooks prepare food for us under the shade of a tree,” said a student of the school.
 
 The aggrieved students pointed out that the daily menu for meals was never followed in their schools. Even the cooks are not familiar with the menu. “Tuesday’s midday meal menu for government schools is ‘jeera rice’ and ‘soybean’. However, we are being served simple rice, cauliflower as vegetable and watery pulse,” they said.
 
 Even school in-charges or headmasters are not aware of the daily menu for midday meals. They order meals as per students’ attendance. Interestingly, the government either supplies raw materials to schools or gives money to them to purchase it, sources said .
 
 The government had launched midday meal scheme with an aim to increase students’ enrolment and check dropout rate in rural and semi-urban areas. “It would be better if the government gives meal quota of rice and pulse free of cost to parents of the students. This would check unnecessary expenditure being incurred in the name of midday meals at government schools and we would provide quality food to our children at home,” said a local.
 
 Danapur education officer Akhilesh Prasad Singh said he would look into the matter.
