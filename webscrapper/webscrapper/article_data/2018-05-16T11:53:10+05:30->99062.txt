ALWAR: The Jats, a dominant community in the   group on Tuesday came out openly against the demand of the Gujjars for bifurcation of the OBC quota. The Jats see it as a campaign to create hatred among the communities. Earlier the government created ill-will between Gujjars and  , recently SC/ST were pitted against the general communities, now the new idea is being mooted to divide the Jats and other 91 castes in the OBC group, the   leaders alleged. 

 Nem Singh, convener of Bharatpur-Dholpur   said the Jats are in favour of reservation to the Gujjars. The Gujjars are fighting for 5% separate quota for the last 10 years which the   had promised in the 2013 elections and included it in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution. But the government has been ill treating the Gujjars for all these years by not fulfilling this promise. They said if the government tries to categorize the OBC quota it would be resisted at all costs. 
 
 They said BJP had promised 5% reservation to the Gujjars and 14% reservation to the economically backward classes. The government had to fulfil that promise. The Jat community supports the demand of these communities for reservation. But the Gujjarsâ€™ demand for bifurcation of the OBC quota is unacceptable, said Jat leaders.
