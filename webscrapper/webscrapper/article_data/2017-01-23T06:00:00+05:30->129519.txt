Kuneru: Kuneru, a tiny little hamlet with barely 100 houses, is like any other typical tribal hamlet in north coastal Andhra. The village has a large population of Jatapu, a Scheduled Tribe.

 The village was once known for its weekly markets. It earned the dubious distinction of being a haven for PWG Maoists in the 1990s.
 
 In 2005 when it was still a Maoist stronghold, the hamlet and its residents were witness to a horrific train robbery by the Naxals. Three RPF personnel lost their lives and Rs 15 lakh was looted in the incident that took place on December 25, 2005.
 
 K Bheemayya, 50, a resident, recalled, “The attack on the train took place during noon. The train tragedy occurred around midnight. They have made our village infamous.”
 
 The only difference, however, is that while the midnight derailment may have been purely an accident, the robbery was planned by the naxals. However, locals and railway authorities said they cannot rule out sabotage as the village was once a Naxal hotspot.
 
 No one has thus far claimed responsibility for the mishap.
