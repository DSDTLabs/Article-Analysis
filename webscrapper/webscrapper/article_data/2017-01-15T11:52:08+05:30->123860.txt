BHOPAL: State   on Saturday gave photographic evidence of the connection between the Rs 500 crore   and minister of state Sanjay Pathak.

 Congress issued three photographs showing Satish Saraogi celebrating his birthday at Saina International School, which the party claimed belongs to the minister of state.
 
 Pradesh Congress Committee chief spokesman KK Mishra reacted sharply to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s statement that no one will be removed from the cabinet based on mere allegations. “After all the evidence, if the chief minister says that Sanjay Pathak will not be removed, it clearly reveals the limits of shamelessness,” Mishra said.
 
 “There is ample evidence to prove that Katni hawala accused Satish and Manish Saraogi work for Pathak. And yet the chief minister is hesitant to remove him. What would anyone think of this government?” Mishra asked.
 
 Mishra raised several questions on the transfer of SP   who was investigating the case. “Is it not true that that on January 9 Gaurav Tiwari nabbed a loading vehicle with 26 gunny bags full of files and documents belonging to SK Minerals and 26 other firms? The loading truck contained files of Anand Mining Corporation owned by minister of state Sanjay Pathak,” Congress said.
 
 Congress further asked, “Who are in the board of directors of the company named Neer Nidhi?”
 
 Mishra said that on January 12, the chief minister said that hawala investigation does not come under the jurisdiction of the state police and hence it would be handed over to the Enforcement Directorate. “And yet, after the transfer of Gaurav Tiwari, the chief minister now claims the case will be investigated by both police and enforcement directorate,” Mishra said.
 
 “What are the real compulsions that even after all the proof, the chief minister is unable to act on the hawala scam?” Mishra asked.
