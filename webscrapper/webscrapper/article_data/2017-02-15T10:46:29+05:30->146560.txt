BATHINDA: The women teachers of Government Adarsh  , Pacca village in Faridkot, started an indefinite protest outside   SSP’s office on Tuesday over the chairman of the school, Narinder Singh Randhawa, allegedly misbehaving with them and using lewd language.

 Though the school is owned by the government, its chairman belongs to a private firm,  , which had entered into a contract with the state government in 2016 to run selected government schools. The move was part of the government’s initiative to run its schools under the public-private partnership (PPP) model.
 
 Two of the teachers on protest, Geetanjali and Amandeep Kaur, said a report prepared by the district administration had indicted Randhawa for misbehaviour and transferring them unnecessarily, but police had not acted on the report. “We have decided to sit on indefinite protest till action against guilty is not taken,” they said.
 
 When contacted,   Nanak Singh told TOI that he had received the report on Tuesday. “We had sent to the DC for the school’s version. The DC has recommended action against the school management’s chairman. Police are taking action as per the report and an FIR is being registered,” he said.
 
 Earlier, the deputy commissioner has conducted the inquiry and sent it to Faridkot SSP, but the report was returned for remarks from the school.
 
 Faridkot district education officer Davinder Rajoria said the department was looking into the episode. Randhawa was not available for comment.
