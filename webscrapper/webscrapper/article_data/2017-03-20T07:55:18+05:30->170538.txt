ERODE: Promising to probe the alleged irregularities in the stone quarry in Sulur, state school education minister and senior leader in   faction of AIADMK K A   said   would not switch camps. 

 The minister who participated in an agricultural seminar at   in Erode district on Sunday told reporters that the news about   threatening to switch camps was factually wrong. "He has only sought the state government to probe into the alleged illegalities in the stone quarry. We would order an inquiry as per his demand,'' Sengottaiyan said in Erode. 
 
 "He will not switch to the rival faction. He would continue to stay with us and serve the people,'' Sengottaiyan said. Apparently, the party high command has deputed senior leaders in AIADMK to hold talks with Kanagaraj and pacify him.
