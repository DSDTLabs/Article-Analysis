CHANDIGARH: Tension enveloped   district’s Dubaldhan village on Wednesday over a proposed meeting of   MP Raj Kumar Saini on May 27. 

 The proposed meeting of Saini, who has in the past spoken against   demanding reservation, has divided the village into two, according to locals. While one side is trying to ensure the meeting’s success, the other is opposing it, saying it might affect the social fabric of the village and create law-and-order trouble. “Saini had been speaking against a particular community. His aim is to disturb peace. Except for a few handful, unscrupulous elements, whole village is opposing the meeting,” said  , a local.
 
 Jhajjar superintendent of police (SP) Pankaj Nain expressed ignorance over the meeting. “Nobody has approached us for a police clearance for the programme. Though, adequate steps will be taken. We are monitoring the situation,” he said.
