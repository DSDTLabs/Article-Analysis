MUMBAI:   police have started strictly implementing a ban on   on the north-bound   ( ) from 5pm-9pm daily. A circular was issued by the traffic department a year ago to reduce congestion. 

 “There were practical difficulties in implementing it. We are trying an experiment on the north-bound stretch for four hours since Monday. We will assess its impact, peripheral issues coming up and sort them out,” said joint commissioner (traffic) Amit-esh Kumar. 
 
 “We will soon come up with a comprehensive plan for movement of heavy vehicles in the city,” Kumar added. 
 
 WEH has bumper-to-bumper traffic for most part of the day, particularly after construction of Mumbai   started. Traffic police will divert north-bound heavy vehicles from Kalanagar junction in Bandra (E) to Eastern Express Highway via Sion. They can continue their journey using Ghodbunder Road in Thane.
