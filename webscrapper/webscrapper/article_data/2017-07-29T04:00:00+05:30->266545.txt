Chennai: South India’s largest cement maker by volume The India Cements Ltd., on Friday said its quarterly profits for April-June period plummeted to Rs 26.44 crore due to faux pas caused on account of GST implementation which resulted in no movement of cement. 

 The lack of availability of sand for construction in Tamil Nadu impacted the performance further. The company earned a net profit of Rs 43.98 crore for the corresponding quarter last year. The numbers are not comparable as the current quarter numbers are inclusive of merged subsidiaries while the year ago figures relate to stand alone numbers. “It was a tough quarter. We have managed to hold on. The worst appears behind us,” said N Srinivasan, vice chairman and MD of the company. Revenues for the quarter was Rs 1,466.75 crore on the back of overall cement sales and export of clinker at 26.56 lakh tonnes. Srinivasan said that demand remained subdued for the sixth year now impacting the capacity utilization. For the current quarter the plants ran at 67% of rated capacity as against 68% previously. The net plant realization for the current quarter was Rs 3,604 per tonne as against Rs 3,430 per tonne sequentially.
