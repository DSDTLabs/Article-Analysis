LUDHIANA: A significant number of property dealers, who deposited huge amount of unaccounted cash in their own bank accounts or their acquaintances post-demonetisation, has not been filing income tax returns for the past many years, the I-T department has revealed after scrutinizing financial transactions of property dealers in the region, who had made dubious transactions in the last over three months after November 8, 2016.

 Sources said the investigation wing of the income tax department has come across several property dealers based in Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Mohali and Amritsar, who have amassed wealth and commissions worth crores but have never paid taxes. What has baffled I-T sleuths is that some of them do not even have a PAN card.
 
 In a swoop down on such offenders, the I-T department teams led by joint director   cracked down on a Jalandhar-based property dealer who reportedly has not been filing income tax returns for the last seven years despite huge earnings through commissions in his business.
 
 The department conducted a raid at several premises of the property dealer on February 9.
 
 Sources said evidence of black money worth Rs 20 crores has been found during the in vestigation so far. It has also come out that the said broker had made investments in property himself, but never mentioned this to the I-T department ever.
 
 Further investigations are still on in this case. The exact amount of tax evaded will be known only when investigations are over.
 
 Sources disclosed that the department was keeping a tab on such offenders for quite some time. It has zeroed in on some of them after finding that they had deposited huge amount of money into their or their acquaintance's bank accounts post-demonetization.
