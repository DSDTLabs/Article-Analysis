The revenge story is also over and so, not much is left to explore as far as the track involving   ( ) and Yuvraj is concerned. The makers are planning a different track now and it will not require Yuvraj's character. He might return after some time, but as of now, his track is over.”
 
 On his part, Shaleen said, “I am happy that I worked with the production house. It was a good experience playing Yuvraj.”
