Bhartendu Harishchanderâ€™s 136-year-old classic   was staged at   on Friday. Adapted by Rangeen Sapney   and directed by  , the play had the 100-strong audience in splits throughout.
The 80-minute play was centred around typical conversations among everyday people about modern day society and politics interspersed with satirical comedy. The 30-odd characters, played by just 13 actors, took turns to question regressive corruption and unethical decisions by the censor board and politicians, leaving the common man in dire straits.
