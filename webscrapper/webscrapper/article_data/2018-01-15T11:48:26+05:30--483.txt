PANAJI: With the Tiswadi mamlatdar taking cognizance of farmers’ problems in the Neura-Carambolim   area and cancelling auction of fishing rights to five sluice gates, residents have demanded that the decision would be effective if the gates are locked to pre-empt illegal fishing.

 “Even the lease period is over. The operators (of sluice gates), supported by tenants association office bearers, are illegally casting nets and also threatening farmers and villagers,” Ramrao Wagh, convener of Khazan action committee (KAC), said.
 
 The stakes are high for sluice gate operators and flooding paddy fields help in increasing the catch. KAC alleged that operators are offering bribes to resort to illegal fishing activity.
 
 Villagers and farmers of  , Azossim-Mandur and   had formed KAC to fight against the sluice gate operators lobby and has initiated a drive to ensure that the breaches to bunds are repaired and the submerged field areas can be drained.
 
 In a few public meetings, they had tried to create awareness among farmers in a bid to revive agriculture. Recently, they had demanded that no auction to allot fishing rights should be held till the breaches to bunds are plugged.
 
 Tiswadi mamlatdar Sapna Bandodkar has directed the Ofla Dongzo, Neura-o-Grande, Cauja, Sao Matias and Dhamada khazan tenants associations not to hold auction to allot rights to operate sluice gates under Rule 10 of Goa,   & Diu Agricultural Tenancy Rules, 1975.
