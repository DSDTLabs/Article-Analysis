GURUGRAM: Commuters, particularly over 36,000 employees working in the special economic zone (SEZ) located on Old Delhi-Gurgaon  , are having a harrowing time passing through the stretch that has been dug up by the civic agency for construction of a concrete road.

 The ongoing construction work is not only leading to severe   pollution in the area, but the lack of an alternative route and thin police presence to man traffic on the road is leading to constant snarls, mainly at the Dundahera crossing, say commuters. To make matters worse, there is only one gate for all vehicles entering and exiting the SEZ.
 
 The worrying news is that this misery is unlikely to end anytime soon. This is because the MCG is also constructing a storm water drain on both sides of the road so that there is no waterlogging during monsoon. “We are trying to speed up the work and hope to finish it before monsoon,” said an MCG official. The commuters are, however, not willing to wait any longer.
 
 “The construction work started in August last year and is still going on. The road space is just adequate for one vehicle to pass through and the pedestrians are at the mercy of motorists as there is no space for them to walk. Everything should be done to finish the work within this month,” said  , who works in the SEZ.
 
 SEZ authorities said they have written to the SEZ commissioner in Noida, seeking permission to install one more gate. “The commissioner, in turn, has to seek the approval from the Union commerce ministry and only after we receive the permission, one more gate can be installed, which will ease the flow of traffic into the SEZ,” said an official.
 
 Traffic cops, on the other hand, said they are helpless. “We can only challan those who park their vehicles illegally on this road and most of them are cab drivers,” said an official.
