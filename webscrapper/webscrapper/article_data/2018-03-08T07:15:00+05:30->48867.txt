GURUGRAM: To mark International Women’s Day, National Highways Authority of India ( ) has decided to deploy an all-women toll staff for the day shift on at least one toll plaza in the vicinity of urban areas in all states and union territories. Following the order, all 23 lanes of the   toll plaza will be operated by women staff during the day shift (8am-4pm) on Thursday.

 T C Rao, chairman of  , the company that operates the toll plaza, said, “Women toll operators have been working at the Kherki Daula toll plaza for around a year and a half. But all 23 lanes will be managed by women today.” Prompt action has reduced the number of cases of harassment of women toll operators considerably over the last few months, according to Skylark. “We plan to give self defence training to women toll operators, so that they can defend themselves if harassed by commuters,” added Rao.
 
 The Kherki Daula toll has 40 women toll operators. They are paid a take home salary of Rs 12,000 per month. The women, whose work often brings them in contact with unwanted circumstances, said they need to be better protected at work. Divya Chaurasiya, who has been working at the toll plaza for a year, said, “Authorities should consider having a panic button to ensure safety of women employees. Often, commuters abuse us, fight with us and behave in an unruly manner. With a panic button, we could call for security if the situation got out of hand.”  , another operator who started work in August 2017, said, “The booths are fine but it would be better if they were made of unbreakable glass, so that no one is able to hurt us in a fit of rage.”
 
 As incentive to improve service and create a competitive environment, NHAI will now rank toll plazas based on various parameters that affect commuters, like electronic toll collection (ETC) adaptability, condition of ETC infrastructure and time taken in crossing a toll gate using FASTag.
