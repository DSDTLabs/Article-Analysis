BHUBANESWAR: Indian football showed its ugly face at the   on Thursday, when   and   shared six redcards in a tempestuous   quarterfinal. Both teams had to play the entire second half with eight players each with FC Goa eventually sealing the deal 5-1 to move into the semifinal.

 
 Goa, who were leading 1-0 at halftime through Brandon Fernandes’ 34th-minute strike, accomplished their mission with second-half goals from Ferran Corominas (69th minute penalty), Manvir Singh (77) and Hugo Boumous (78 and 89). Late substitute Ashim Biswas pulled one back for Jamshedpur FC (JFC) deep into stoppage-time.
 
 Goa, thus, set up a semifinal date with East Bengal on Monday. However, their progress was marked by a series of unsavoury incidents which included a ‘goal’ — first given and then disallowed — as well as a bust-up between players and officials of both teams inside the tunnel.
 
 Three players from each side — JFC goalkeeper  , defender Anas Edathodika and Haitian forward Kervens Belfort as well as FC Goa’s Brandon and two defenders, Spaniard Sergio Juste and Portuguese Bruno Pinheiro — were red carded before the two teams returned to the field. JFC’s goalkeeping coach Bobby Mimms was also expelled by the referee.
 
 It all started in the added-on time of first-half when JFC goalkeeper Paul denied Corominas with a brilliant goalline save for a corner. Brandon, who was lurking nearby, claimed to have kept the ball in play and volleyed it home.
