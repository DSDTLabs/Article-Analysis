PUNE: The   has granted a conditional interim protection to the   service company and his two aides in a case of criminal breach of trust and other offences registered by the company with the Nigdi police last year. 

 The company had alleged that the three suspects deactivated 44,544 of its set top boxes without the company’s knowledge and provided set top boxes of some other firm by entering into an agreement with that firm. The company also alleged the trio replaced 1,500 of its set top boxes and did not return them to it. 
 
 Justice P N Deshmukh of the high court directed the trio on April 6 to provide names of at least 100 customers to enable the investigating officer visit some of them and verify whether the company’s set top boxes were lying with them. The court adjourned the matter till April 19 after the public prosecutor sought two weeks’ time for completion of the verification process. 
 
 On December 26 last year, a sessions court in Pune had rejected the three suspects’ anticipatory bail plea following which they moved the Bombay HC for relief. Their lawyer made a specific statement that the deactivated set top boxes might be with the customers to whom they were provided. 
 
 The public prosecutor, on instructions from the investigating officer, then submitted that if the applicants provide a list of around 50 to 75 customers and cooperate with the probe, the investigators can visit some of such customers to verify whether the complainant’s set top boxes are lying in their houses. 
 
 The court ordered that in the event of their arrest, the three suspects be released on bail on their executing a personal release bond of Rs 25,000 each with one surety each of the like amount. It directed the trio to cooperate with the investigating officer.
