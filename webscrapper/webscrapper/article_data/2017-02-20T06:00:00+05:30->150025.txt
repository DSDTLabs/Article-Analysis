 enthusiasts turned up in large numbers to watch director Mala Pasha’s theatre production,  . An adaptation of   by   and  , the play explored various forms of abuse women face through five short stories. The staging began with the story of Shanti, an immigrant in Canada, who can barely speak English — a shortcoming that proves to be the biggest hurdle for her quest to return home. The next story was that of Maya, a lesbian who struggles with her sexuality. The next couple of stories put the spotlight on domestic abuse through two characters, Jaswinder and Fatima. While Jaswinder’s story of abuse by in-laws pans out in the form of letters exchanged between a mother and a daughter, Fatima’s story of spousal abuse explores a Muslim woman’s battle to find help and raise above her situation. 
“Through these plays, I wanted to sensitise people towards abuse, all forms of abuse. And the hope is that from that understanding, people will help each other out in overcoming their challenges and fighting battles against abuse, in a world that is largely insensitive,” said director   after the staging.
