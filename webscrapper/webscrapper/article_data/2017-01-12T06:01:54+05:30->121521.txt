 Andalamma was admitted in hospital on December 26 after she had a severe head injury. She was declared brain dead due to intracranial bleeding. “Andalamma was a ‘marginal donor’ for Suresh as she had been diabetic for 20 years and was older than the recipient. But we had to go ahead as there were no matching donors in his family,” said Dr Ch Madhusudhan,  , Maxcure Hospitals, who led a 15-doctor team during a 14-hour transplantation.
 
 Suresh was discharged on Wednesday. “I realised the importance of a cadaver organs when no matching donors were found in my family,” he said. His family got Rs 18 lakh from friends and CM’s relief fund for surgery.
 
 The average wait time for cadaver liver continues to be long due to poor awareness. “We plan to involve both cadaver organ donating families and recipients for increasing donations,” Dr G Swarnalatha, coordinator, Jeevandan, said.
