NEW DELHI: New models and strong demand helped car and SUV sales shrug off the post-GST blues and close 2017-18 with healthy numbers, though high fuel prices and fears of rise in interest rates may dampen the momentum in the current financial year.

 
 Top car makers such as Maruti  ,  , Mahindras and   reported a growth in sales in 2016-17, even though   and Ford failed to keep pace and slipped by around 2%. Models such as Maruti’s new Swift and   mini SUV, Hyundai’s Verna and Tata Motor’s Nexon fuelled demand.
 
 However, companies say 2018-19 may be challenging as some negative factors have been building up over the past few months. “The industry is on a positive on the strength of macro-economic factors, backed by stability in policies,” Rakesh Srivastava, director (sales & marketing) at Hyundai India said. “Hardening of interest rates and increase in fuel prices could challenge the growth rate, especially in the entry segment, where cost of acquisition and cost of operations are key factors for buyers.” Companies have also been complaining about GST rates on cars, and say these should be reduced to push demand.
 
 “There are headwinds in terms of impending increase in interest rates, crude prices, and inflation,” Ford India MD Anurag Mehrotra said.
 
 Maruti has been growing strongly and has increased share as it expands model lineup and retail presence. The company is getting new vehicles as parent Suzuki is ramping up Gujarat factory premises and investing in additional production lines.
 
 Sales of Tata Motors have grown 22% in 2017-18, led by new models as well as a low base. New cars such as Nexon, Hexa and Tigor have combined well with the Tiago compact.
