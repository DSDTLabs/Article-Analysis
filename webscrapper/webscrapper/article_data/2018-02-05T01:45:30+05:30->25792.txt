VIJAYAWADA: Although miffed with the  , TDP will continue to be part of NDA, for now. This was decided after Union home minister   called up Andhra CM N   on Sunday and urged him not to take any hasty decision. Singh also said he would make a statement in Parliament on the allocations earmarked for Andhra Pradesh.

 After a crucial TDP Parliamentary Party meeting, Union minister Y Satyanarayana Chowdary said, “The alliance is intact. We never said anything about snapping ties… it’s all speculation.”
 
 
 
 Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababau Naidu has denied calling up   chief   to discuss BJP’s neglect of its NDA allies. On Saturday, Sena sources had claimed in Mumbai that the two leaders had spoken over the phone.
 
 At a crucial TDP Parliamentary Party meeting on Sunday, some MPs asked Naidu about his reported conversation with Thackeray. “The CM made it clear to us that there was no such conversation and that TDP is firmly with BJP at this juncture,” an MP, pleading anonymity, said.
 
 TDP has 15   and four Rajya Sabha members.
 
 Giving details of Union home minister Rajnath Singh’s phone call to Naidu on Sunday, TDP sources said, “During the 16-minute conversation that the two leaders had, Singh told Naidu that he was calling at the behest of PM   and that BJP national president   would also talk to him soon. All grievances of TDP will be heard and addressed, Singh assured Naidu.”
 
 Indications are that Naidu will wait for Singh’s statement in Parliament before taking a call on the alliance. TDP sources said Naidu would also wait to hear from BJP chief Amit Shah.
