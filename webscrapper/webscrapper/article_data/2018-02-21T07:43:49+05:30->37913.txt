HYDERABAD: Days after gates constructed by a NGO, Dhruvansh, at the   were pulled down by local leaders, heaps of construction debris were found dumped inside the water body on Tuesday morning. Already struggling to keep pollution levels in check, this wastedumping practice, environmentalists fear, will bring to naught the restoration work being carried out over the last two years.

 Also, reopening the gates, is likely to spell doom for the python population residing in the lake, said green activists.
 
 While three pythons were crushed to   on the lane connecting the bund, between December and January, now more such cases are feared to be reported. “January to March is the breeding season for pythons. They usually come out of water at night and cross roads. The opening of gates might result in many more pythons being crushed,” said  , managing trustee of the NGO.
 
 Interestingly, while the permission to build the gate was sanctioned by the  , it was later pulled down as officials argued that there was no permission granted to close the gates. “It’s a ridiculous explanation. Why give permission to construct a gate if we can’t close it,” questioned Choudary.
 
 Lashing out at authorities, activists said how the lake had undergone tremendous improvement in recent time and also launched its biggest floating island (in the country) with over 2,500 saplings planted earlier in the month. But now again, things are heading back to square one , they rue pointing out how apart from debris, dumping of animal carcasses and domestic waste into the lake is also back.
 
 “Although we were applauded for fulfilling the chief minister’s wish of community involvement, we must get the required protection. By pulling down the gate, a   in has been opened up,” said Choudary.
