NEW DELHI: The Prime Ministers of India and   shared hearty guffaws this morning as the MC at their joint briefing requested both of them to "step down".

 At a joint briefing following a bilateral meeting during which they 
  ,   and Bangladesh's   did a ceremonial signing on stage in front of the press. After that, it was time for the two leaders to step off the elevated podium, so each could make their respective statements.
 
 That's when the MC sort of misspoke. 
 
 "May I request the two Prime Ministers to now please step down," he said.
 
  
  
 
 After just a beat, Modi started smiling and then outright laughing. He was joined by Hasina who also couldn't contain herself. They laughed like this for a whole minute. 
 
 If more joint briefings went this route, peace may well reign in the world.
