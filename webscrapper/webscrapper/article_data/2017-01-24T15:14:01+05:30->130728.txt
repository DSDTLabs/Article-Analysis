Actress Anupama Prameswaran has been successful with her projects in Telugu as soon as she marked her debut in Trivikram's 'A Aa'. She won applause for her role in 'Premam' opposite Naga Chaitanya and went on to bag a lead role alongside Sharwanand in 'Shatamanambhavati' which proved to be a Sankranthi hit. There was no stopping for the Malayali girl and the news that she would star opposite mega hero Ram Charan in director Sukumar's next did not surprise many. However, in an uneventful turn of things, it was officially mentioned that the actress is out of this fancy project, which is set to go on floors very soon. The actress also is denied another opportunity to play female lead in Nani's untitled flick.
