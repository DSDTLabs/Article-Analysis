CHANDIGARH: The Chandigarh bench of   (CAT) has issued notice to the UPSC, IAS officer Devinder Singh presently posted as ADC (Development), Nawanshahr,   and IAS officer   presently posted as additional principal secretary to the Punjab chief minister on a petition filed by PCS  , who is working as special secretary PWD, Punjab Civil Secretariat.

 The petition is with regard to the promotion of the petitioner from   (PCS) to Indian Administrative Services (IAS). It is demanded in the petition that direction should be given to convene a review selection committee meeting for her ACRs. The PCS officer moved the tribunal seeking promotion and induction to the   (IAS) against the vacancies from the state civil service quota. The matter will now come up for hearing on January 23.
 
 Kataria had earlier filed the petition for a direction to convene a review selection committee meeting in view for her ACRs pertaining to years 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15 from ‘good’ to ‘very good’ and from ‘very good’ to ‘outstanding’ thereby bringing in change in her service. The same is considered by the UPSC for promotion to IAS for years 2015 and 2016, having direct impact on her claim and to grant her promotion in the IAS cadre, especially so where her juniors have been considered and promoted with “consequential benefits”.
 
 The applicant further pleaded that once the state government had forwarded her case for convening of the review SMC as per a letter on December 6, 2017, and a detailed order was passed in this regard on December 14, the UPSC was duty bound to consider her promotion.
