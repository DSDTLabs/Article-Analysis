A repoll will be held on Monday at three polling stations in Karnataka: two in Kushtagi constituency of Koppal and one in Hebbal, Bengaluru. The repoll will be held from 7am to 6pm.

 The Hebbal repolling at station No. 2 located at Gandhi Vidyalaya, Kannada and Tamil Primary School of Lottegollahalli was necessitated due to the EVM developing a glitch.
 
 
 Poll officer Sanjiv Kumar said the Kushtagi repoll was necessitated because of a procedural error. As many as 275 voters were shifted from the booth No. 20 to 21, but their names continued to appear in the list for booth No. 20. The repolling will be held at both booths.
