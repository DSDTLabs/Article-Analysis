NEW DELHI: Prime Minister   chose to travel by the capital’s lifeline – Delhi   – on Friday to attend a public function.

 The Prime Minister boarded a metro train from the Lok Kalyan Marg metro station of the Yellow Line (HUDA City Centre-Samaypur Badli) in the evening and travelled to   station — a journey traversing 11 stations — that took about 20 minutes. 
 
 Modi took the metro to visit 26, Alipur Road, where he was scheduled to inaugurate the Dr Ambedkar National Memorial.
 
 Even as the entire travel and the coach in which the   travelled saw heavy security deployment, he talked to some co-passengers and even clicked selfies with some of them. Most passengers couldn’t believe that   was travelling with them. However, no one was allowed to stay for long near the PM by the Special Protection Group commandos.
 
 “The Prime Minister and his accompanying officials used tokens for the travel today from 5.41pm to 6.01pm,” said a   Rail Corporation (DMRC) spokesperson. “During his travel, services were running as per the normal schedule on Line 2 of Yellow Line,” he said.
