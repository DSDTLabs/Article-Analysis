BATHINDA: Moga district police have decided to start a campaign to contain drug abuse by involving local people. Police are forming area committees of local residents and will appoint drug abuse prevention officers (DAPO) from among them to reach out to drug addicts in their areas.

 The DAPOs will be provided relevant training to deal with addicts and prevail upon them to shun substance abuse. Such committees will be formed in every ward of towns and in villages of the district. These will be made to take oaths at subdivisions and district headquarters on Mach 23 on the martyrdom day of Bhagat Singh to contribute in making society free of drug abuse. Daulewala and Noorpur Hakima village are infamous for drug peddling in Moga. Nearly 70% households in Daulewala face cases under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act or Excise Act.
 
 Moga SSP Rajjit Singh said the district police had decided to make efforts to make the area drug abuse free and for that the participation of public had been sought. “The mission committee will be formed in every village and wards of towns by involving local people. Retired employees and prominent residents will be approached to be part of these committees. For every 15-20 houses, a group will be formed. A DAPO will be appointed from the area, who will visit the houses and counsel the drug addicts, if any,” he maintained.
 
 The SSP said that since March 16, 2017, Moga police had registered 609 cases under the NDPS Act, in which 691 persons had been arrested. “The police seized 7,889kg of poppy husk, 12.4kg opium, 1.5kg heroin, 180g smack, 23.6kg intoxicating powder, 2kg ganja, 6.78 lakh pills and 2,736 injections used as habit-forming drugs from those arrested in the past one year,” he said.
