LUCKNOW: Congress vice-president   is expected in the city on Tuesday. He is scheduled to meet top brass at the   (NHAI) to submit a memorandum on problems being faced by   in Jagdishpur, Ambedkarnagar and other parts of UP because of alleged irregularities in   for various   projects. 

 Rahul’s arrival comes close on the heels of party state president Raj Babbar’s ‘haq maango’ campaign in Ambedkar, wherein Babbar and other party workers joined farmers protesting against inadequate compensation for acquisition of land for highway.
 
 Though the two-day protest ended in Ambedkarnagar late Monday evening after local administration assured to revise the compensation being given to the farmers and put a bypass road project on hold till a formula of negotiations between farmers and district administration is arrived, the issue is not resolved yet.
 
 Talking about Rahul Gandhi’s visit, Congress leader in Vidhan Sabha, Ajay Singh said, “Rahul would be meeting officials at NHAI to discuss problems being faced by farmers and shop-keepers in the name of development.”
 
 Singh added that the Congress was not against NHAI’s effort to improve and build the much needed infrastructure in UP, he was against the way things were being executed. “We have specific examples to prove that farmer’s interest was being overlooked by the ruling party which is trying hard to create a pro-farmer image. Provisions of the Land Acquisition Act of 2013 were not being followed,” said Singh.
 
 Jagdishpur is under Rahul Gandhi’s parliamentary constituency Amethi. Here, some 1,500 farmers are affected by the NHAI’s project to widen National Highway 56. Party insiders said the compensation being given by NHAI was at a rate fixed five years ago while the commercial rate of the land had increased manifold in that time. Sources said Rahul may meet representatives of the National Students Union of India as well.
