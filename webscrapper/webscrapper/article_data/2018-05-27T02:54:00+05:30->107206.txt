Visakhapatnam: Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation ( ) commissioner M Hari Narayanan directed the officials to conclude the ongoing civil works of the Anna Canteens of the city at the earliest. 

 He visited severalunder construction canteens on Saturday, including in Vepagunta, Baji Junction, Gopalapatnam Rythu Bazar, Marripalem and others. He asked the officials to adhere to all the quality norms. 
 
 A total of 24 Anna Canteens were sanctioned to Vizag city. The GVMC has started construction works of all these canteens other than at one or two places due to land issues. These canteens are expected to be open to the public in the first half of June. These will offer lunch, dinner and breakfast each at Rs 5. Initially, the state government proposed constructing centralised kitchens on its own at some key locations of the city to supply food for the canteens. However, now the government has withdrawn the idea of constructing kitchens and has decided to rope in a private agency for the same purpose. Recently, the state government called tenders for developing external infrastructure at the Anna Canteens such as walls and others. Later, Hari Narayanan chaired a meeting with the residential welfare associations of the city.
