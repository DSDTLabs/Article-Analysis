BHOPAL: The state government may have initiated the   scheme to facilitate vehicle licensing for women, but on an average 25% of the applicants fail the test every day, sources in RTO said. 

 A licence department official requesting anonymity disclosed that every day around 70 applicants apply under the pink licence scheme. Of these, around 15 applicants fail the test, while around 40 of them just mange to scrape through. He added that most of the applicants are home-makers or those who have not even driven a two-wheeler ever in their life. Due to this, they are not aware of the traffic rules, signs and signals.
 
 Another RTO official said, "The question on which most of the applicants get stuck is the signs of railway crossings." He added,"There are two questions: one is of unguarded railway crossing which has a sign of an engine and the other one is of a guarded railway track which has a sign of a track. The pole of sign board has lines, in which single line represents 100 meters, while two lines represent 200 meters."
 
 "There is a list of 80 questions in the software at present of which every applicant has to answer any 10 random questions. We are planning to add some more questions in it, but we fear that if more questions will be added, then applicants would not be able to pass the test," said the official. 
 
 A girl who passed exam securing boundary marks said, "I just guessed the answers. Fortunately, I was able to answer six of them right." Ajit Rai, a license department official, said: "After an applicant fails, he or she can apply again after seven days. Applicants should study the traffic signal and sign chart to pass the test."
