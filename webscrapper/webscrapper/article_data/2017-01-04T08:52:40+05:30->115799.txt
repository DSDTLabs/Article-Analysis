KOLKATA: Even as the BJP office at   turned into a battleground on Tuesday evening, drama unfolded at the   CGO complex with the entire   trooping to the CBI office in a show of solidarity with their arrested compatriot   

 Led by education minister Partha Chatterjee and Rajya Sabha MP Derek O'Brien, six of them parked themselves on the staircase of the third floor demanding an audience with Bandyopadhyay, who was arrested by CBI earlier in the day. 
 
 The accused MP was finally brought out of the building under a heavy police protection shortly after 9.45 pm and whisked a way to the airport to take an 11.30 pm flight to Bhubaneswar, where he will be produced in court on Wednesday.
 
 On his way out, Bandyopadhyay told waiting newspersons that he was "paying the price for his good performance in Parliament".
 
 Soon after the MP's arrest, party chief and CM Mamata Banerjee asked all senior party leaders to lay a siege to the CBI office in Salt Lake. Partha Chatterjee, Derek O'Brien, Firhad Hakim, mayor Sovan Chatterjee, state president Subrata Bakshi, Salt Lake mayor Sabyasachi Dutta reached the CGO complex around 5.45pm and scurried up the stairs till they were stopped by CBI officers. They were soon joined by MPs Mukul Roy, Saugata Roy, Prasun Banerjee, irrigation minister Rajib Banerjee and a host of other leaders. "We have come here to meet Sudipda on the instruction of the chief minister," Chatterjee said adding that "Trinamool will not bow its head".
