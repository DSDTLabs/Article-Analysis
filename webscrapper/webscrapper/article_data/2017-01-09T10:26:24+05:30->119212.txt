 The electricity department, through   ( ), a   of the ministry of power, has begun replacing existing street compact fluorescent lights (CFLs) and high pressure sodium vapour (HPSV) lamps with   throughout the state.
 
  Of the existing 1.66 lakh streetlight fixtures, 35,000 have already been replaced with light-emitting diode (LED) lights. This move is expected to help the state save nearly 128 crore.
  
  The fixtures will be monitored through a separate centralized control and monitoring system (CCMS) which will ensure remote switching on and off of the lights. This will help unburden the electricity department that spends a considerable amount of time repairing streetlights.
  
  
  The department also plans to start selling LED bulbs in the upcoming months 75. These bulbs are currently being distributed free of cost under the ‘Jyotirmay Goa’ scheme. They also plan to encourage the use of LED tube lights and fans.
  
  The tentative cost of the project is 77.5 crore.
