MARGAO: All India Congress Committe secretary  , along with some residents of   and Gogol, have demanded that TCP minister Vijai   come clean over his plans of redeveloping the Borda multipurpose  .

 Chodankar pointed out that the ground was being used by youth for various social, cultural and sports activities, and that it is the only open ground in the city that has free access. 
 
 Expressing apprehensions that there could be plans of constructing a sports complex after demolishing the school building, Chodankar said that this would render the ground out of bounds for local children.
