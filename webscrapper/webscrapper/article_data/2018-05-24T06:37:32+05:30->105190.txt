AHMEDABAD: Market capitalization of five Gujarat-based companies has fallen below the Rs 10,000 crore-mark in last three months as their share prices declined amid overall volatility in stock markets.

Market players attribute volatility in markets to erosion on market-cap of these firmss. “Markets have remained volatile on account of rising crude oil, appreciating dollar against rupee and foreign institutional investors pulling out money from cash, derivative and debt segments,” said  , a city-based stock analyst.

This is now being reflected in its stock prices,” Kotak added.
 
 “Alembic Pharma share is down by around 20% since the start of May. The firm has been issued one observation for its   plant from  , which appears to be dragging the price down. Adani power’s price is going down after it reported disappointing third quarter earnings,” added  , another stock analyst.
