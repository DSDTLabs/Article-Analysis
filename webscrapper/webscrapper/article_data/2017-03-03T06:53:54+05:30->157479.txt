GHAZIABAD: Days after three-year-old twins fell into a washing machine in Delhi’s Rohini and died, a similar incident was reported from Loni in which a one-year-old toddler accidentally fell into a bucket of water and drowned.

 Azam, a TV mechanic’s son, crawled up a flight of stairs to the terrace where the bucket was kept and fell head-long into it. The house is in Loni’s  . Azam’s mother was busy with household chores and noticed the boy’s upended body in the bucket 15 minutes later.
 
 “My son was alone at home with his mother while his four elder siblings had gone out for tuition. My wife, Fatima, was busy with household chores and Azam somehow climbed up the stairs and reached the terrace where my wife had kept a bucket full of water,” said Musharaff, the boy’s father.
 
 “He probably stood up holding the edge of the bucket and fell head first while peeping inside it. After about 15 minutes, when my wife went upstairs looking for him, she found the body upside down in the bucket,” he added.
 
 Hearing the mother’s cries, neighbours reached the house and rushed the boy to a nearby private hospital, but he could not be revived. 
 
 “We instantly tried mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to clear the water that was clogging the boy’s breathing passageways and the lungs, but he could not be saved,” said a doctor from the hospital. Police have ruled out any foul play and are treating the case as an accident. 
 
 “We investigated the case and prima facie it appeared that the toddler accidentally fell into the bucket in which about 10 to 12 litres of water was stored and since he fell upside down there was very little he could have done to get himself out,” said OP Choudhary, SHO of Loni police station.
 
 Last Saturday, a pair of three year-old twins died after falling into a washing machine in their house at   housing complex, Rohini. The boys were found with their heads down in the tumbler of the machine.
