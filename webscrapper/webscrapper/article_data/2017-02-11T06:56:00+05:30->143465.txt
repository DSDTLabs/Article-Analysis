NOIDA: Various sector residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) in Noida, and the   umbrella body, Federation of   Residents Welfare Associations (FONRWA), have appealed to residents to come out in large numbers and vote on Saturday. The city’s residents have been urged to ensure an increased voting percentage of 75% in GB Nagar.

 The RWAs’ call came as the district magistrate, Nagendra Prasad Singh, drew the residents’ attention to an SMS facility set up by the Election Commission enabling them to know their booth by simply sending a text message. All one has to do is to type ‘epic’, followed by a space and then one’s voter identity card number and send it to 51969 or 166. Within a few minutes, they will receive a message containing details including the location of their polling booth.
 
 Alternatively, voters may also gather these details by visiting http://ceouttarpradesh.nic.in or downloading a mobile application on their smartphones. The district election office has developed the app, which allows users to locate their booths. The application, ‘know your booth’ works on the GPS and flashes out the designated booth with its complete address at a click. It can be downloaded from Google play store.
 
 N P Singh, FONRWA president, urged all eligible voters of Noida city to cast their vote for the assembly election on Saturday from 7am to 5pm, thereby choosing the most suitable candidate for Noida.
 
 Residents were also asked to contact the toll-free control room helpline number 1800-180-5326. “Along with photo voter slips, a booklet is also being delivered at your residence, which contains information regarding the process of voting,” said Vimal Sharma Sector 50 RWA president.
 
 The rationale behind the RWAs’ appeal was the fact that there have been times in the past when very few votes have made the huge difference.
