Coimbatore: Agro-based and art-based industries would soon be brought under the ambit of micro, small and medium industries (MSMEs) and the ministry of MSME would support them, principal director of MSME - Technology Development Centre in Agra R Panneerselvam said here on Wednesday.

 Speaking to reporters at the ‘Subcon 2018’ fair at Codissia Trade Fair Complex in the city, Panneerselvam said both handicrafts industry and performing arts such as dance and dramas would be treated as MSMEs and would be supported by the ministry. “Similarly, grassroot-level enterprises such as agricultural and rural industries would be supported by the MSME ministry. New schemes would be introduced for this,” he said.
 
 The centre had submitted proposals for several upgraded schemes to the ministry and was expecting its nod by the end of this month, the official said. “Also, technical incubation centres would be set up in all districts. If industries come up with innovative ideas, a support fund of Rs 1 crore would be given to them,” he said.
 
 “A national resource centre for MSMEs would be set up in Delhi, which would have its activities across the country till the village-level. Through this, industries could get several schemes from Chennai and would not have to travel to Delhi,” he added.
