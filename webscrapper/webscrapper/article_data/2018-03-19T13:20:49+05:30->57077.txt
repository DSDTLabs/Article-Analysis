SALIGAO:   works along the national highway near O'  junction at   could pose a risk to commuters, especially at night, as there is no signage indicating that the works are in progress. 

 Residents say there is no indication put up stating which authority is taking up the works and whether licence has been approved for undertaking the works. It was also noticed that an electricity lamp at the site indicating that the works are currently in progress is missing which could pose a risk to riders. Authorities have only barricaded the area. 
 
 Goacan convener   said, "The labourers at the site tell me that that the road digging is being done for a telephone company but there is no sign indicating who the contractor is or whose permission has been granted."
