BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh’s agriculture minister Gauri Shankar Bisen, known for his insensitive remarks, was at it again on Friday. Bisen lost his cool at a function in Narsinghpur on finding that the superintendent of police left the function without notice.

 Peeved at being ignored, Bisen admonished the   publicly during his address, to ensure protocol when ministers attend a programme in the district.
 
 “Who is senior than a minister? When two ministers are present at a programme, then it is the duty of the district collector and SP to be present throughout at the function,” Bisen rebuked the SP in the presence of crowd. 
 
 He justified his stand while talking to reporters after the programme. “SP is not a VIP. It is his duty to be present when in-charge minister is visiting the district. If he has to leave for any urgent work, he must pass on the duty to his subordinate,” said the minister.
 
 A day earlier, Bisen was embroiled in another controversy after he reprimanded a tehsildar in Chhindwara district for helping   workers. He had cautioned him saying, “I will send you back where from you have come, if you help any Congress leader.” Congress took an exception to this remark.
 
 Bisen during a programme in Balaghat had advised the Baiga tribe members not to go for ‘sterlisation’ campaigns. “Baigas need not go for family planning operations as they are endangered,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, state Congress on Saturday demanded the ouster of minister for agriculture development Gauri Shankar Bisen for openly threatening government employees with transfer if they “listened to Congress sarpanchs.”
 
 State Congress chief spokesman KK Mishra said. “Congress party demands the expulsion of this minister who is constantly in the news for controversies.”
