MOHALI: The Mohali district continued to put up a dismal show in Punjab school education board (PSEB) Class X results on Tuesday. So, why is   other districts? The educationists said the parents here prefer dummy schools over the regular schools. "Most of the parents here are against sending their wards to regular schools," said an educationist on the condition of anonymity. 

 
 According to the educationists, the parents here prefer sending their kids to special coaching institutions because they want their kids to score well in the competition examinations.
 
 "Most of the parents want overall development of their children. Some of Class IX students opt for coaching classes with an aim to crack the competitive exam. These students hardly bother about their Class X results," said Kunal, an educationist. A teacher on condition of anonymity said, "Our hands are tied. According to government rules, we will have to pass every student until Class IX. Due to this, the students take the board examination on a lighter note," he said. 
 
 However, small consolation came in the form of improvement in the pass percentage for Mohali district. With 66.94 % pass percentage, Mohali was adjudged as the 11th best performer district in the Class X results declared by PSEB. Meanwhile, this year not a single student from Mohali, has managed to find a place on the merit list of 401 students released by the board. 
 
 In the last three years, it has been noticed that either the students of the district manage to find a place in the merit list or the pass percentage of Mohali has improved. 
 
 Sharanjit Singh, district education officer, said, "I was posted six months back and I have tried a lot to improve the education system here. The   of the district has improved. The students studying in the rural regions like Zirakpur, Derabassi and Kharar were less focused as compared to Mohali students. This year, I will focus more on rural schools."
