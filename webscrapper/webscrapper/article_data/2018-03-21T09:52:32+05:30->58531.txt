MUMBAI: Even though the state cabinet last Thursday approved the environment department's proposal to ban plastic carry bags and certain other items in  , the   is yet to receive a notification about the same from the government. The civic body said that only following the same they would be able to chalk out their future course of action. 

 On Tuesday, a meeting to discuss the same was held by municipal commissioner  . Officials said that one of the first steps to be implemented would be to ban   from civic markets in the city.
 
  "While we are yet to get a notification from the government regarding the same, we are planning to start banning the plastic bags from civic markets. There are around 97 BMC markets from where we plan to start. The idea is to get Self Help Groups to provide cloth or jute bags at these markets which would come at a cost," said deputy civic chief  . Apart from this, the BMC is also considering to conduct awareness campaigns in civic schools on the menace of plastic .
