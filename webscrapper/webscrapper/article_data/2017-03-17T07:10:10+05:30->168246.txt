AHMEDABAD: Gujarat   on Thursday scrapped its rule by which non-practising lawyers, who are employed in services of court or other departments, are required to have minimum service experience of five years to apply for the post of   or  .

 In a big relief to LLB degree holders who are aspiring to join judiciary, a bench headed by Chief Justice R S Reddy struck down Rule 7(2)(b) of the   Rules, 2005, to an extent. Now LLB degree holders who are doing jobs are not required to show 5-year experience to join judiciary in a cadre of district or senior civil judge, and all such employees can apply directly, said one of the advocates in the litigation, Anshin Desai.
 
 After the high court began recruitment process for the posts of judges last year, many candidates approached the high court taking strong objection to the minimum service experience norm. They argued that if a fresh practising advocate can apply for the post, why LLB degree holders, who are engaged in court services or allied services, cannot be allowed to compete. Moreover, the upper age limit of 35 years further limits their chances, they said. They claimed the rule was discriminatory.
 
 The high court had earlier allowed these petitioners to take preliminary exams. Now by setting aside the norm, these candidates are permitted to take the final test, which is scheduled on March 19.
 
 The HC termed this provision as illegal, discriminatory and arbitrary. It observed that “it is coming in the way of preventing young talents to tap for judicial service at appropriate level. So long as there is no requirement of minimum practice for allowing the law graduates who are practising in the courts of law, there is no reason to insist for requirement of minimum experience for similar law graduates who are in service of courts and allied departments and seeking entry into judicial service”.
