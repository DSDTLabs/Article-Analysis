AHMEDABAD: In response to a petition by a   who wants to abort the 30-week fetus,   on Tuesday ordered a   at   to examine the teen and report to the court whether   is possible.

 The case involves a minor girl from Vijaynagar in Sabarkantha district. The HC ordered the rape survivor to be brought to Civil Hospital on Tuesday so that she could be examined at the earliest.
 
 Justice J B Pardiwala said, “Considering the age of the victim, the trauma she has suffered because of the sexual abuse and the agony she is going through at present, I am of the view that let the victim be examined once again by a panel of five doctors of Civil Hospital at Ahmedabad.” The court ordered that the panel consist of the heads of the departments of obstetrics & gynaecology, neurology, radiology, paediatrics and psychiatry. The HC sought their report by 2.30pm on Wednesday.
 
 The HC ordered re-examination of the survivor after two doctors in Himmatnagar expressed their view before the HC on Tuesday morning. They opined that the idea of abortion should be ruled out. They told the court that if the pregnancy has to be terminated, 99% chances are that the victim would deliver a pre-term baby. They planned to induce labour for a normal delivery and then they might go for caesarean. Performing a caesarean on a 14-year-old would be a huge risk for her.
 
 The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act prohibits abortion if the pregnancy is beyond 20 weeks. Three years ago, the Supreme Court granted permission to a 14-year old from Prantij in Sabarkantha district to terminate a pregnancy, which was more than 20 weeks old. Later, the high court granted such permission in various cases involving charges of rape.
