AMRITSAR: Nearly 13 months after Pakistani national   (58) had gone missing in India, his family members are arriving here to trace him. Devsi, a resident of Karachi, was part of the 43-member Hindu jatha (group of pilgrims) from Pakistan that had arrived in India via Attari border on January 2, 2017, on way to Delhi.

 According to his wife Lalita Devsi Makwana, Devsi stayed overnight at   in Amritsar. When they were to leave for their destination on January 3, the jatha members found him missing. “My husband went out of room to take some items, but didn’t return. We tried to trace him, but in vain. Then we lodged a complaint with police,” she said, adding that her husband was mentally abnormal and an epilepsy patient.
 
 A complaint of Devsi going missing was lodged at Sultanwind police station on January 4, 2017. Lalita, along with other members of jatha, left for Delhi on January 5. When they returned to Amritsar on January 13, she and other jatha members contacted police, but they got no clue about Devsi.
 
 His family members are arriving in India on Sunday. “I was compelled to leave India on January 15, 2017, since my visa had expired,” Lalita said, adding that she had also written to the citizen police liaison committee chief in Karachi, so that the issue of her missing husband could be taken up with Indian government through diplomatic channels.
 
 Sources are of the view that since Devsi’s mental condition was not normal, there was possibility that he either boarded the wrong train or could have gone to some other city on his own by bus. The Pakistani Hindu jatha had arrived India on the invitation of Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha (ABHM). When contacted, ABHM president   confirmed that the family of Devsi was arriving India on Sunday to trace him.
