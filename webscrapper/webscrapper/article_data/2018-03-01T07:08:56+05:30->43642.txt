Usage of whiteners while filling the OMR sheets, double bubbling etc are some of the violations cited by the petitioners.

According to advocate general D Prakash Reddy, the authorities had shortlisted 3,096 candidates on the basis of written examination results. This was in tune with the ratio of 1:3 as mentioned in the notification.
