SECUNDERABAD: The railways’ ambitious project, involving the redevelopement of railway stations in Telangana and  , is going for a toss, with the private agencies showing no interest to take it up on PPP mode.

 “Uncertainty looms over execution of the project in   (SCR). Private parties are not coming forward to take up the work,” an official said.
 
 Despite changes made to the original action plan, suggested by Mumbai-based architect Hafeez Contractor, but the project still hasn’t taken off in SCR zone. The lease period of stations, to the private agencies for commercial use, was also extended from 45 to 99 years, but to no avail.
 
 “Under PPP mode, private parties, will shell out money on redevelopment, and then take the station on lease. But it is not working out. Hence, redevelopment hasn’t yet begun at   and Vijayawada stations. Speculation is rife that other modes may be adopted,” said the official.
 
 As per the original plan mooted last year, railways would ramp up facilities, including concourse, parking bays, trolley paths, walkways, Wi-Fi and amenities for disabled, at 600 stations across the country, bringing the stations on par with airports. On surplus land, shopping malls would come up in the station premises. The cost estimated by Indian Railway Station Development Corporation Limited (IRSDC), was around ?70 crore per station.
 
 Station buildings at Hyderabad, Kacheguda, Tirupati, Guntur, Kazipet and Warangal, were set to be reinnovated to resemble well-known landmarks. Hafeez Contractor, and another firm, P K Das, signed up, pro bono, to redesign 19 stations across the country.
