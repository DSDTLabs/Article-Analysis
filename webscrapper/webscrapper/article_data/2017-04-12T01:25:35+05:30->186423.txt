NEW DELHI: The   student union has written to their vice chancellor calling for an immediate meeting of democratic bodies like the campus development committee (CDC) and inter-hall administration. The union has alleged that no meeting has been conducted over the last 6 months and yet policies like installation of CCTVs and curfew on some dhabas to stop service after 11pm have been imposed without student consultation.

 Bodies like CDC and inter-hall administration comprise student and administration representatives. Students say the bodies have been formed to ensure policy decisions are made keeping them in the loop. “However, the administration has been pushing rules on us without any consultation from these bodies and we just keep getting notices. There is little interaction with the administration,” said  , president of the student union.
