CHANDIGARH: It seems all is not well within   with as many as six claimants for the DGP's post. 

 The government on Monday revoked its two-day-old orders asking 1985-batch IPS officer   to join as DGP, home guards.
 
 The government stated that Mustafa will continue as DGP (human rights). He was to replace 1981-batch   G D Pandey.
 
 Sources in Punjab Police said Mustafa was upset that he was given a rough deal with a less important charge outside police headquarters despite not enjoying any plum posting during the 10-year rule of Akali Dal.
 
 The SAD government had kept Mustafa largely in one department - policy and rules for 10 years. Mustafa is one of the most decorated cops of the country with four gallantry medals, having played an exemplary role during 1980s and 1990s in flushing out terrorism He was being tipped to be the new DGP. However, new Congress government on March 15 decided that incumbent DGP Suresh Arora may continue even though he had sought central deputation on March 6, five days before Punjab assembly results.
 
 Also, sources in Punjab Police said another   officer Rakesh Chandra has been called by Arora on Tuesday over a dispute that he was given additional charge of the prestigious commando unit. Sources said Arora was not happy that Chandra, who was recently made ADGP (special operations group), was given charge of commando unit by the government without his approval. Chandra, a former counter terror cop, who had served as additional principal secretary to Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder in 2002-07 government, did not have any office or staff to operate from.
 
 Chandra has been one of the prominent officers of Punjab Police since 2002, handling key counter terror operations. In 2016, he had written a scathing note to Arora, saying he was being humiliated by the administration wing over his due promotion from IG rank to ADGP rank.
