NOIDA: A 30-year-old man was attacked by two bike-borne assailants near a   in Sector 18, who allegedly snatched his bag containing Rs 8.20 lakh cash. 

 The victim, Bipin Roy, working as an accountant at EBIX Software India Pvt Ltd Noida Phase II, told police that the cash was withdrawn by him from the company’s ICICI account to pay the salary of the staff. “I took an autorickshaw from office and reached the branch to carry out the transaction. After withdrawing Rs 8.20 lakh, I booked a cab around 11.48am through a mobile application and was waiting at the pick up point by the roadside when the duo attacked me,” Roy said. 
 
 According to the cops, Roy initially resisted the snatching bid but had to let go of the bag, containing the cash, as the pillion rider pushed him to the ground and fled towards Atta Peer. 
 
 “After falling down, for a few minutes I was in shock. I then dialled 100 and informed them about the attack,” Roy added. Following information, SSP Ajay Pal Sharma, SP City Arun Kumar Singh and circle officers reached the spot and started the investigation. 
 
 SSP Sharma told TOI that the statement of the victim and some shopkeepers was recorded at the spot. “An FIR has been registered under Section 392 (robbery) of the IPC against unidentified accused. We are scanning the footage of CCTV cameras installed near the crime spot to identify the accused,” Sharma said. 
 
 Sushil Kumar Jain, president of Sector 18 market association, said that security measures should be enhanced in Sector 18 market. “I reached the spot after getting information about the snatching. We have demanded more deployment of police personnel in the market. All the CCTV cameras installed on the premises should be checked and made functional,” he said. 
 
 Interestingly, the crime took place at the same spot where five people had faked a robbery of Rs 8 lakh on April 5. A week later, they were arrested for cooking up the story to deceive a co-owner of the call centre.
