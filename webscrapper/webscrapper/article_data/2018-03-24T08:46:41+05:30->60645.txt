Chennai: The   Federation of India (TTFI) on Friday suspended paddler   provisionally following allegations of rape against him by an ex-girlfriend.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “The Executive Board (EB) of the TTFI has placed Soumyajit under provisional suspension, pending final outcome of the police investigation and court verdict, if any, on the alleged rape charges against him by a teenager,” TTFI said in a statement.
 
 
 
 
 
 TTFI secretary MP Singh called an emergency EB meeting on Friday and took the decision to suspend the paddler after consulting its legal experts. The national body has also decided to issue a show cause notice to Soumyajit, asking him to explain his stand on the FIR lodged by the girl.
 
 “We saw the media reports and the FIR filed against Soumyajit and unanimously decided to suspend him. He won’t be able to participate in any tournament until the investigation is over,” Singh told TOI.
 
 Soumyajit’s suspension has made it difficult for TTFI to send a five-member team to the Commonwealth Games. As per the   rules, a replacement can only be sought if a selected player is injured or sick. TTFI has sent letter to the India Olympic Association (IOA) on Friday and requested the parent body to discuss the matter with the CWG Organizing Committee so that Sanil Shetty can be included as Soumyajit’s replacement.
 
 However, an IOA official said that there is no such provision and it would be impossible for CWG Organizing Committee to allot a replacement for Soumyajit.
 
 In the team event, Soumyajit was sure to play the doubles and was also very much in contention to play one of the four singles matches. “Now that he is off and we are reduced to a four-member team, the pressure will be much higher on Sharath Kamal, G Sathiyan, Anthony Amalraj and Harmeet Desai. It will not be possible for us to rotate a player in case somebody is short on form or suffers an injury,” a TTFI source said.
