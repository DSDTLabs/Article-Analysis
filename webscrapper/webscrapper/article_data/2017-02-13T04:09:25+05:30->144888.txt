CHENNAI: Girls and boys as young as six, held a   on Sunday to condemn the brutal   and murder of 7-year-old city girl earlier this month. Demanding justice, they also appealed to the government to make self-defence for girls and value education for boys compulsory in schools.

 About twenty children, aged between 6-14, from   Public School, Chinmaya Vidayalaya, Chettinadu Vidyashram and other city schools pledged to make the city safer for girls. Class I students S Rasikaa and Sai Vishruth, student activist and class VI student Kamakshi Athreya, Class VII student Vansh Jain and a few other kids addressed the media at the Chennai Press Club after the candlelight vigil.
 
 The children also condemned the abduction, gangrape and murder of a 16-year-old girl in Ariyalur last December. 
 
 The seven-year old girl was sexually abused and gagged to death by a 22-year old IT firm employee S Tashvanth on February 5. 
 
 Student activist Kamakshi said, “I don’t feel safe when I go out wearing short clothes. When I am walking on the road with my mother, I feel nervous. Random men on street pass comments.”
 
 She said, “Girls need to be taught how to identify a good touch from a bad touch.”
