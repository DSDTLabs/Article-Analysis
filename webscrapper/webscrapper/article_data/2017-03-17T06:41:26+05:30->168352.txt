Between 1995 and 2000, when   was finance minister, the revenue surplus turned into a massive revenue deficit of Rs 2,325 crore, fiscal deficit tripled and tax collection went up 50%. The situation was so alarming that S M Krishna, who took over as chief minister in 1999, presented a white paper on the state of the economy. That is history. The current five-year term is worse. Other than the personal achievement of having presented a record 12th Budget, Siddaramaiah has nothing of record to say in this Budget.

 Compared to the previous state   government, which raised additional borrowings of Rs 46,119.36 crore in five years, the Congress government is raising an unprecedented Rs 1,33,407 crore in five years, an increase of 290%, taking the total borrowings of the state to Rs 2,42,420 crore - in other words, debt of Rs 40,000 per head for six crore Kannadigas.
 
 The money is not used for  , which is obvious from the fact that capital outlay as a percentage of   has decreased from 4% in 2009-10 to 2.7% in 2015-16 - a matter of concern for the state.The government has not taken certain unavoidable committed expenditure like the liability arising out of prabhari promotion as per the latest Supreme court judgment (Rs 2,300 crore), the committed liability of the state government of Rs 2,000 crore arising out of joining the Centre's Uday scheme to address debt and losses of power distribution companies, and implementation of wage revision for state government employees (Rs 8,300 crore). All this would have increased expenditure and, in turn, liability by Rs 10,000 crore.
 
 In spite of facing chronic drought for three years, allocation to agriculture has gone up by only 7%. For education, the increase in allocation is less than 2%. It reflects how much this government cares for farmers and the future generations. The budget only stands out in pampering the vote bank.
