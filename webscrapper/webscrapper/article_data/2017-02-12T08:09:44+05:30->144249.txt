NEW DELHI: Days after the body of a 30-year-old man was found lying near an open drain, police on Friday arrested his wife for his murder with the help of her boyfriend and one of his friend. 

 Police said the body of Krishan Kumar Sharma, a taxi driver, was found early on Monday near a government school in Khajuri village. The face was taped and there were marks on the neck, police added.
 
 A case under Sections 302 (murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender) of the IPC was registered at the Khajuri Khas police station. 
 
 A team led by SHO Khajuri Khas, Yogesh Malhotra, was formed and during the course of the probe police scanned the   footage of the neighbourhood, said Ajit Kumar Singla, deputy commissioner of police (northeast). 
 
 Police spotted a suspicious Alto car in front of Sharma’s house in Karawal Nagar early on Monday. Also, a blanket cover found near the body was identified to be his wife’s. 
 
 Sharma’s wife told police that she had an affair with Praveen Verma. She was fed up with her   and wanted to get rid of him and therefore, asked Verma to help her kill Sharma.
 
 Police said that Om Dutt Sharma, Sharma’s father, was away to Bulandshaher to attend a wedding. Verma took advantage of the situation and asked the accused to keep the main gate of the house open at night. Praveen along with his friend came the same night and killed Sharma. They then wrapped the body in a woollen cover and dumped it nearby.
 
 Verma and his friend have been absconding since Monday and investigations are on to nab them, police said.
