PUDUCHERRY:   will extend all necessary cooperation in promoting good governance and efficient administration in the Union territory of Puducherry, Lt governor   on Saturday said.

 Bedi made her stance clear when a four-member delegation, including public works minister A Namassivayam and welfare minister  , met her in the presence of her secretary G Theva Neethi Dhas on Friday, seeking approval for a few schemes proposed by the government. Government whip R K R Anantharaman and DMK’s R Siva accompanied the ministers.
 
 Bedi told the government delegation that public officials in administration would continue to remain accountable even after they retire from service. The officials have to observe the rules, regulations and due procedures in the course of their duties, be it administrative, financial or otherwise, she told the delegation. “Hence all procurements, small or big, including the urgently needed ones, have to be done according to the due processes. It’s not a matter of choice but an essential duty of the official in-charge and of all who approve the proposal. Any public official who takes the risk of violating processes can be tracked even after retirement, money recovered, criminally charged and pensions held back. Officers may go, but the files remain. And they speak for themselves,” she said in a group message later.
 
 Besides, Bedi said, even the lt governor would not have the luxury of enjoying immunity from any such lapses, even after relinquishing from such responsibilities.
