NEW DELHI:   Jim Mattis’ two-day visit to India starting Tuesday will underscore India’s contribution towards Afghanistan’s stability and security and how it can be improved. The two sides are also likely to discuss ways to further improve defence trade.
 
  Mattis’ visit is meant to underscore the US commitment to India as a strategic partner. Mattis will meet PM Modi and defence minister   during his India tour, which ends on September 28.
  
  “The secretary (Mattis) will emphasise that the United States views India as a valued and influential partner, with broad mutual interests extending well beyond South Asia. The secretary will also express US appreciation for India’s important contributions toward Afghanistan’s democracy, stability, prosperity, and security,” reads a statement issued by the US Department of Defense.
  
  Last month, US President Trump had announced his   policy with focus on beefing up US military presence and pressing India towards helping in “economic assistance and development” of the nation.
  
  India has already extended $3-billion aid to Afghanistan and has a progressing bilateral trade with it. India could also be seen as an intermediary between Iran and Russia — with whom US has hostile relations — over influencing developments in Afghanistan. Mattis’s visit is also coinciding with the Indo-Afghan trade and investment show, which is being facilitated by the MEA and USAID.
  
  Mattis is also likely to discuss furthering defence trade with India during his visit here.
  
  According to a report submitted to the US Congress in July this year, US-India defence trade has continued to enhance the strategic partnership.
