BELAGAVI: Hooli village in Savadatti taluk is home to many ancient temples that date back to the  . The sculptures that adorn the temple walls attest to the amazing workmanship and skill of the sculptors of that period. However, most of these temples have fallen into a state of disrepair, owing largely to neglect.

 Although the   (ASI) took up restoration on the temples, the work was halted. With a large number of temples, ancient wells, inscriptions and other monuments, Hooli is a hotbed of archaeological activity, along with Badami and Aihole. The Panchalingeshwara temple in the village comes under the ambit of the ASI, which started restoration work on it, along with six other temples including the Agastheshwara temple two years ago.
 
 ASI hired workers from Badami to undertake work on restoring the temples at Hooli. The villagers were told that the structural integrity of the temples would remain unchanged. However, the workers used white stones and cement for restoration work, and worse, they left Hooli without completing the work.
 
 Historians alleged that restoration did not adhere to scientific principles. The use of cement detracts from the historical significance of the temples, they said. 
 
 Sources peg the cost of the restoration work undertaken at the Agastheshwara temple at Rs 62 lakh. Although experts assured historians that only the damaged parts of the temples would be restored. However, it was found that cement had been used for nearly 60% of the work.
 
 While experts have focussed on renovating the temple’s roof, they have ignored some of the stones at the base of the structure that are coming loose. “At some places, the stones can be removed with bare hands. There are also many cracks that have not been attended to,” said historian  .
