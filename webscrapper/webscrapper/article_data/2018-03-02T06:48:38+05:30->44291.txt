 N Anji Reddy told TOI, “The accused makes ganja kulfi during Sundays and festival days. He sells them at the rate of ?100. There are several students, particularly those from engineering and management colleges, addicted to it. He regularly makes kulfi and addscooked ganja powder to it. He then refrigerates it.
