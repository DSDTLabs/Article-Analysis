GREATER NOIDA: A 16-year-old girl returning from school was allegedly gang-raped last week by a classmate, a distant relative and another youth who had offered her a lift home as she had missed the bus.

 
 Although five days have passed since the alleged rape, police are yet to make any arrests. The girl has apparently told police that though she remembers the distant relative and the unidentified youth assaulting her, she is not sure if her classmate was involved too as she had passed out by then.
 
 The girl, a student of Class XI of a   school, is believed to have told police that she was walking home around 2.30pm when the trio came in a car and offered to drop her home in Kasna area. But they allegedly took turns to rape her inside the car and roamed the city for the entire day before dumping her near   area around 1am.
 
 Police found the girl loitering aimlessly and informed her parents. The girl has got her statement recorded before a magistrate under Section 164 of the CrPC.
 
 “One of them was a distant relative who had come from   while another was her classmate. Since she knew the boys, she decided to accompany them in the car. Bu they allegedly held her captive and forced themselves upon her one by one,” Greater Noida station officer   said.
 
 The girl’s family had tried looking for her when she did not return home in the evening, but to no avail.
 
 Around 1am, the girl was reportedly found loitering near   area, where she had been dumped. “Police handed over the girl to the family,” the officer said.
 
 An FIR has been lodged under IPC Sections 376D (gang-rape), 363 (kidnapping) and provisions of the POCSO ( Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act against the accused relative from Palwal and the other two youngsters.
