HYDERABAD: Even the   order seems to have failed to put vehicles with tinted glass completely out of city roads, as cars with opaque screens are still being used in Hyderabad.

 In the year 2017, a total of 271 cars were caught using tinted films in Hyderabad, of which 41 cases have been booked against offenders in the first two months of the year.
 
 Traffic police said that awareness has been created on the issue through special drives and other programmes and opined that not many people are using tinted films in the city now.
 
 "The cars with tinted glasses, which we are seeing now in the city, are mostly not the films pasted on the glasses. If anyone wants to apply any tint to their vehicles, most of them are following the SC rules and are getting their glasses changed with required   (visible light transmission levels)," said V  , joint commissioner of police (Traffic), Hyderabad.
 
 However, the banned tinted film is still easily available in the market as many car decor shops across the city are fitting it to cars for amount ranging between 1500 to 2500.
 
 "The cost of the tinted film depends on the quality and if a car owner wants a full tinted one with good quality, we can fix the film on the glass for2000 on an sedan or hatchback," said an owner of car decor shop in Abids.
 
 In the case of tinted glass, the supreme   guidelines specified that they must have at least 70% visibility in front and rear and at least 50% visibility on the sides and the allowed VLT has to come in the glass from the manufacturer
 
 In 2015, a total of 456 offenders were caught using tinted glasses. The number was shot up to 726 in 2016.
