Saligao: The public works department (PWD) has erected several speedbreakers on the Chogm road, but has neither painted them nor erected warning signboards.

 The Chogm road witnesses a huge flow of traffic as a number of tourists and locals use it to travel to the coastal areas of Calangute, Baga, Candolim and also to Mapusa, Panaji and the villages of Saligao and Sangolda. TOI observed that warning signboards indicating speedbreakers were not put up on the stretch to alert motorists. “The speedbreakers pose danger, especially, when they are not painted, as drivers can’t identify them at nights. Also, the shoddy work on the speedbreakers damages vehicles and could cause fatal accidents,” said a local resident, requesting anonymity. When contacted, PWD assistant engineer Satyendra Bhobe of works division XIII (roads), PWD, Mapusa, said the road widening works and also painting of speedbreakers on the entire Chogm Road stretch were undertaken by Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC), but since GSIDC had a problem with land acquisition for roadwidening, they asked the PWD to complete the pending works. “We have prepared and submitted a proposal to the government to do the road widening and also paint the speedbreakers at an estimated cost of over Rs 2 crore. Once the proposal is approved, we will take up the works,” said Bhobe.
