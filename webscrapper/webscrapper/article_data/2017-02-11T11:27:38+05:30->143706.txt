KOLHAPUR: The   of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation ( ) has taken various measures to reduce the number of   and has managed to cut it down by 32% in six years — from 176 cases in 2011 to 176 in 2016.

 The Kolhapur division of MSRTC comprises 12 taluka level depots of which sixe are located in the ghat regions. As per the information provided by the Kolhapur division, the division operates around 800 buses on a daily basis.
 
 Sharing details, divisional controller of Kolhapur division   said, “The cases of accidents have come down since the last few years after we have adopted several measures. Regular training and guidance from our counsellors have helped to a great extent.”
 
 The division is facing shortage of around 200 drivers and during the recent recruitment drive, Kolhapur division did not get any new driver. The shortage of manpower adds unnecessary pressure on the existing staff and could lead to accidents.
 
 A driver, on condition of anonymity, said, “The shortage of drivers and conductors put additional pressure on us. We also need to follow arrival and departure deadline that also adds to it. Late night duties, insufficient sleep and double shifts also become cause of accidents.”
 
 An MSRTC official said, “A major part of Kolhapur falls in Sahyadri mountain ranges. The roads are not straight and driving becomes difficult in such terrain. The roads are also narrow in rural areas. The lack of reflectors on both sides of roads in ghat areas leads to accidents. The government should increase the road size in rural areas where the percentage of accidents is higher.”
