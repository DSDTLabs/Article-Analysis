KOLKATA: A day after it became the first hospital in Kolkata to receive permission to conduct heart transplants, RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) on Friday drew up an action plan to host the first such procedure. It is also taking an initiative to identify potential recipients and educate patients and their kin about heart transplants.
“Launching a heart transplant program begins with identifying patients with advanced heart failure, in whom transplant is the only available option to extend their life span. These patients belong to all age groups. To support this, we have a specialized team of cardiologists, cardiac surgeons and cardiac anesthetists having training and experience in medical, surgical and peri-operative care of heart failure patients. You also need the necessary infrastructure such as hybrid operation theaters, intensive care, advance laboratory services and support requirements,” said R Ventakesh – zonal director – east,  . 
 
 Recently the state government has conducted workshops in healthcare facilities and have authorized a committee of clinical personnel in various hospitals for declaration of brain dead. Every hospital has been instructed to maintain a list of potential recipients and update the same with the directorate of health services on a regular basis. “Once a person is declared brain dead the option of donating organs lie with the family. The deceased can also pledge to donate organs after his death when he is alive. So, now it is even more important to promote awareness among the masses about organ donations. Awareness drives also help to identify and register people who are willing to donate their organs after their demise. When one person is made aware of donation, they in turn should educate their families and friends. The awareness should clear a lot of myths and emphasize on the importance of giving a new lease of life to so many,” added Venkatesh.
