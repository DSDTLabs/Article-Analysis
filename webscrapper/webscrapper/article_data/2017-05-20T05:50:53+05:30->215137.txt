HYDERABAD: Even as the   is hearing the Bhongir love case in which the boy disappeared and the girl committed suicide, the rivalfamilies have unleashed a media war by levelling allegations and counter allegations. 

 Amboju Naresh, belonging to a BC community, and   from the Reddy community, fell in love. Fearing opposition by the girl's father,  , they eloped to Mumbai and got married there. However, Sreenivas Reddy lured them to Bhongir on May 2, following which the boy disappeared. Subsequently, Swathi allegedly committed suicide.
 
 While the boy's father,  , moved high court with the charge that his son was murdered by the girl's father, the latter lodged a complaint with Bhongir police alleging that his daughter was harassed for dowry. Since then, WhatsApp videos have surfaced in which both families are claiming innocence. 
 
 On Friday, Naresh's elder sister, Neela, a resident of Sholapur in Maharashtra, through a video appealed to Sreenivas Reddy not to harm Naresh and declare his whereabouts. 
 
 "Neither my brother nor my parents asked for dowry, as is being alleged by the girl's family," she said. 
 
 Earlier, after returning to Hyderabad from Mumbai, Swati had left behind a video on her mobile phone blaming Naresh and his parents for her death. She also gave a clean chit to her parents. Further, she said: "Few days after the marriage, Naresh asked me how much property my family owned and how much dowry my father gave at the time of my sister's wedding. Naresh told me he was expecting 50 lakh as dowry,'' Swati said. 
 
 This contradicts what Swati had said earlier. On March 25, she lodged a complaint with Antop Hill police station in Mumbai stating that she feared for her life from her father for having married Naresh .
 
 A few hand-written notes allegedly written by Swati surfaced in the media where she said, "All that Naresh expects is that her father should not harm him.'' The case is slated to be heard by HC on June 1.
