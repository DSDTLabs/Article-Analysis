Ludhiana: In a setback for city industrialists, transporters plan to announce a 10% hike in freight rates to overcome the “sharp rise” in diesel prices in the past 6 months. 

 Transporters are yet to final the date by which the hike in rates will become effective. GT Road-based NPC Transport Union president Harjinder Singh Sandhu said transporters had already been suffering losses, so the increase in prices was unavoidable. “Diesel rates have shot up 18% in six months. We have not hiked rates as we wanmt our clients to adjust the prices of their products accordingly,” he said.
 
 A city-based transporter, Rohit Kapoor, said the government would have waive some taxes in order to control fuel prices. “We request the Centre government and the GST council to work in this direction and save transport industry,” he said. 
 
 Avtar Singh Grover of DS Transport said the rate of diesel rose by more than Rs 9 a litre in six months. “For us, fuel is a raw material; it has increased our cost of operations by 15%. Still, we have proposed a hike of only 10%; we do not want to burden our clients. The government must do something to control rising fuel prices,” he said.
