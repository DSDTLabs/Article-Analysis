NEW DELHI: Sprint legend   has become the latest sportsperson to resign from the positions of national observer and member of the   (TOP) scheme. Usha, appointed observer for athletics, has stepped down from the twin posts to avoid possible 'conflict of interest' charge, resulting out of her involvement in running an academy -   - in Kozhikode.

 According to a sports ministry official, two of India's leading women sprinters -   and   - train at her academy in Kerala and are regulars in the Indian athletics contingent at the international meets. It's learnt that 16 other promising track and field athletes, who are knocking on the doors of India selection, also train at her academy.
 
 When TOI contacted Usha for her reaction, she confirmed she had resigned in the last week of December. However, Usha will continue to be on the advisory panel of the   (AICS) - whose chairman is veteran administrator   - and also remain a member of the 'Khelo India' project.
