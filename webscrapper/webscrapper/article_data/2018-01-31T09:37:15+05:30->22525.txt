SHILLONG: The   ( ) on Tuesday took a potshot at   president   after he was seen wearing a black jacket, costing nearly Rs 70,000.

 The BJP spent no time and its Meghalaya unit highlighted it on the Twitter with a photo of Gandhi donning the jacket at a music event in Shillong on Tuesday.
 
 "So @OfficeOfRG , soot(pun intended!)-boot ki sarkar with 'black' money fleeced from Meghalayan State exchequer by rampant corruption? Instead of singing away our woes, you could have given a report card of your inefficient govt in Meghalaya! Your indifference mocks us!" wrote Meghalaya BJP below the picture which was paired with the jacket's original photo and price.
 
  
  
 
 The jacket is two-in-one down puffer jacket from Burberry, which is a British luxury fashion brand. On the Bloomingdales website, the cost of the jacket was listed as Rs 68,145.

 The base price of the suit at an auction was Rs 11 lakh, and it was sold for Rs 4.31 crore.
 
 The Congress president was in Shillong to kick off the election campaign of the party in poll-bound Meghalaya.
 
 The polling for the 60-member state assembly will take place on February 27 along with Nagaland. The results will be declared on March 3.
