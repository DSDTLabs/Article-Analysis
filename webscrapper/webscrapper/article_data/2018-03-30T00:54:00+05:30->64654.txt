Coimbatore: City corporation commissioner K Vijayakarthikeyan inaugurated a cricket training programme titled   for champions at CS Academy International CBSE School at Kovai Pudur here on Thursday.

 Speaking at the event, he said girls should also take up sports. “There is a conception that sports and studies don’t go hand in hand. They are thought of as substitutes for each other. But that is not the case. They supplement each other,” Vijayakarthikeyan said.
 
 Recalling his childhood days, the corporation commissioner said when he was young he did not have enough facilities to practise sports. “But kids today have better opportunities. They should make use of it,” he said.
 
 Cricketers Konda Bhaskar Arun Karthik, who played for Royal Challengers Bangalore, and Rajagopal Sathish, captain of India XI in the Indian Cricket League, were present at the event. Cricket coach K R Sivaprakash also participated.
 
 Under the programme, skill-based coaching would be imparted to the students based on their interest in batting, bowling and fielding. “Students will be shown video footages and given complete video analysis reports of matches. Cricketers Arun Karthik and Rajagopal Satish will offer professional insights to the students,” said a release.
