NEW DELHI: The southwest   has begun to withdraw from the country, some two weeks later than normal. With just three days to go for the official end of India’s rainy season, it is now fairly certain that this year’s monsoon will end in the below-normal zone.

 The   announced on Wednesday that the monsoon had retreated from the western parts of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, as well as the northwestern tip of Gujarat.
 
 “We expect the monsoon to withdraw completely from northwest India and adjoining parts of central India in the next two-three days. Dry weather is forecast in the region and there’s a substantial drop in moisture levels, making conditions favourable for the retreat,” said M Mohapatra, head of services at IMD.
 
 He said south India, eastern coast and the northeast will continue to get rain over the next few days. The monsoon’s performance so far has been below normal, with the countrywide rain deficit currently at 5.5%. The figure is unlikely to change much in the next three days, when the monsoon season (June to September) ends. This means that the monsoon is most likely to finish in the below-normal range (90-96% of long period average).
 
 That would be a rather disappointing end to the season that had begun with expectations of normal rains. In April, IMD had forecast monsoon to be 96% of normal. It had subsequently updated the prediction to 98% of normal in June. Both forecasts had 4% error margin.
