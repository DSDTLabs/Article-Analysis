NAVI MUMBAI: The road adjacent to a Shiv Sena office in sector 12 of   has been submerged by overflowing  . The sewage line developed leakage as a result of irregular cleaning. This road connects Vashi-Koparkhairane arterial road and Mini Seashore road. 

 Motorists and pedestrians have been forced to wade through ankle-deep sewage water since Tuesday night. Also, a stretch of the road has developed potholes and commuters are unable to fathom the depth of the craters.
 
 “Civic officials must address such problem areas which may lead to water-borne ailments,” said a resident, Mahesh Vichare. Vashi ward officer Mahendrasingh Thoke said, “Nobody has complained yet. But I will send the concerned staff to clear the area.”
