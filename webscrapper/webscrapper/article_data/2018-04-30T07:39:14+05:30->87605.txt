PATNA: At least eight people were feared drowned when a fishing boat carrying 15 people, all members of a marriage party, capsized in the   river in Bihar's Bhagalpur district around 3.30pm on Sunday. 

 Naugachia superintendent of police (SP)   said a search and rescue operation by   (SDRF) personnel was under way. "Seven persons have so far been rescued. They are undergoing treatment at the   in Naugachia," the SP added. Locals, however, alleged that   personnel began the rescue operation almost four hours after the incident. 
 
 "Many lives could have been saved had the SDRF launched the operation on time," a local said. Naugachia circle officer Uday Kumar Yadav, however, refuted the charge. 
 
  "The SDRF swung into action soon after receiving information," he claimed. 
 
  The SP said that the boat, which was clearly overcrowded, capsized hardly 400 metres away from a pontoon bridge on the river. 
 
  "Those on board the ill-fated boat were returning from a village in Purnia after attending a marriage ceremony. They had used the pontoon bridge while going to the village. However, while returning, they boarded the small boat, which is used only for fishing," the SP added. 
 
 Not even a single body was recovered till the time of going to the press.
