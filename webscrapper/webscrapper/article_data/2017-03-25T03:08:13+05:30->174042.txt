GURUGRAM: Civic body,   and the city police joined hands on Friday to bring down roadside kiosks and penalise violators for parking illegally on the bustling  . 

 As many as 260 vehicle owners were penalised and 80 vehicles were towed away on the mall mile, as it is known, keeping with MCG’s ‘smart road’ project to give back road space to pedestrians.
 
 The massive drive that was launched on Friday aims to make the arterial roads in the city clutter-free and will be undertaken in various parts of   in the coming days.
 
 For long, residents and shoppers on MG Road have been complaining about lack of space to walk on the stretch that is usually occupied by roadside eateries and other kiosks and haphazardly parked vehicles. The authorities will sustain the drive for the next few days to ensure the usual choas does not return on the road. “Usually, these encroachments are back soon after the authorities raze them down. Therefore, we will carry out this anti-encroachment drive in a sustained manner for the next 15-20 days in the area. We will also be launching similar campaigns on other arterial roads which have been encroached upon by illegal kiosks and haphazard parking,” said an   official.
 
 The authorities hope that people will start parking vehicles inside the parking space provided by the malls in the area, which people refrain from using due to steep fee charged. However, if mall owners rationalise the fee or even abolish it altogether — they could provide free basement parking and will longer have to pay property tax for the area.
 
 The official said, “We want all main roads to become ‘smart’ so that pedestrians have space to walk on the footpaths. We will take strict action against all encroachers.”
