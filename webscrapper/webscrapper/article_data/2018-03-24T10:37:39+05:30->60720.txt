Guwahati: In the next three months, the   will see the installation of about 30 bio-toilets in different locations. These toilets will be able to break down human excreta into usable water and gas through a zero-waste biodigester. "To meet the growing demand of a sustainable and hygienic sanitation system, prevention of open defecation and pollution of water bodies as also to promote the safety and dignity of women, the installation of smart bio-toilets has been proposed under the   in Guwahati," said the managing director of the  , M Angamuthu.

 The toilets would be electronically operated with the help of a coin, biodegradable, fitted with   ( ) approved digesters and have remote monitoring systems at strategic locations. Each toilet would have the capacity of 200 defecations per day.

Regarding the choice of locations, he said they were selected on the basis of footfall, water and power connectivity. Explaining the functioning of the facilities, he said the digesters would be using psychrotrophic bacteria like clostridium and methanosarcina to help break down human excreta into methane and water through a series of steps of anaerobic digestion-hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis and methanogenesis. 
 
 Eram Scientific Solutions Private Limited, Thiruvananthapuram, will be designing, constructing, operating and maintaining the smart toilets for a year. The approximate cost of the project would be Rs 9.53 crore.
