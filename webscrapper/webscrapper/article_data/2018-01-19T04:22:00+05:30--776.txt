Vadodara: Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) finance committee member Jayesh Verma resigned from the panel in a huff on Thursday. 

 Verma was upset as he wasn’t getting the documents and details required to be discussed in the finance committee’s meeting. His resignation will now be taken up in the managing committee for discussion. 
 
 This is the second resignation within last few days as legal committee member Kamal Pandya too had resigned due to differences with the management. He though withdrew his resignation later. 
 
 Sources in BCA said that the last meeting of BCA’s finance committee was held in July last year and Verma had been seeking financial details to be studied and discussed for the next meet. “But BCA treasurer Amul Jikar wasn’t furnishing the details and it led to differences within the committee. So Verma sent a mail announcing his resignation from the finance committee on Thursday,” said a BCA official. 
 
 When contacted, Jikar told TOI, “All the important documents, especially related to finance, are kept in the office and as per the directions of the managing committee officials can come to the office to study them. To send copies of such documents online is cumbersome as well. We have requested Verma to reconsider his decision to resign. Our office staff will cooperate with him.”
 
 BCA secretary (in-charge), Snehal Parikh confirmed that Verma has resigned but added, “The treasurer or finance committee chairman can provide more details.” The finance committee met on Thursday to discuss the financial details of the association.
