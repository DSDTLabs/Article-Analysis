MUMBAI: That West Zone could muster only 140-9 against South Zone in their   T20   league game on Thursday was largely due to the rash shots played by some of their top-order batsmen. South Zone for their part, riding on opener  's 70, chased down the target with five wickets and 2.2 overs to spare.

 South Zone won the toss and, as is the trend in this tournament, opted to field first to exploit early morning conditions. And like the rest of the teams, their decision paid off instantly. West Zone opening batsman Sheldon Jackson, who went on to make 23, was handed a reprieve by South Zone stand-in skipper (R   didn't take the field due to an injury) Vijay Shankar at mid-off when he was still on 10. But the skipper made amends when he ran back about fifteen yards from cover to deep cover, to pouch his opposite number,  .
 
 Patel, who was on 10, holed out to Shankar off a short Rahil Shah delivery. After that, West Zone never really got a partnership going thereafter. Aditya Tare, who came in at the fall of Parthiv, played some lusty strokes and added 33runs for the second wicket with Jackson. But Jackson perished in an attempt to dispatch Murugan Ashwin over long on.
