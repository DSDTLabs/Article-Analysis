CHANDIGARH: Panjab   syndicate on Friday accepted an enquiry   related to the the   office employees who were found guilty of corruption. The syndicate has recommended widening the purview of the inquiry since involvement of more officials of the construction office is suspected. A report in this regard would be sent to the senate.

 An inquiry committee had earlier pointed out discrepancies in the purchases of 200 wooden beds with boxes and 200 PVC chairs with arms. The boxes and chairs were purchased for Rs 13. 24 lakh and 154 steel almirahas at Rs 14. 93 lakh.
 
 The members discussed that the role of people involved in this corruption should be checked and the punishment should be decided accordingly. It was discussed that the least punishment in this case could be to recover the losses from the employees involved in the corruption.
 
 Interestingly, the members are also suspicious over the involvement of a top-level person, who countersigns bills. The enquiry report found out that the material supplied was not as per specification as mentioned in the tender notice and the same was wrongly recorded in the measurement books that were signed.
 
 The committee also found out that the inspection was not done properly. The measuring gauge used for the inspection was the same, which was provided by the supplier without proper specification.
 
 It was also alleged that the items required were similar in nature and supplied by common vendors, therefore the tender should have been one tender instead of two, however, this charge could not be proved.
 
 It was also alleged that the suppliers were not asked to deposit security or any performance guarantee/ bank guarantee.
 
 This matter was also taken up at the syndicate meeting held on November 19, where the syndicate had asked the registrar office to seek more details of the material supplied and persons involved in the matter.
