Known for playing negative roles on television,   is all set to be seen as a wicked and conspiring queen in 'Chandrakanta'. The actress says that she loves "being hated by people". "People love watching negative characters, and I like the fact that the audience loves to hate me! It means that I have played those negative roles perfectly to make the audience believe that those characters exist. I never thought I would play a negative character - I didn't know it was written all over my face that I can play those roles," says Urvashi, who hopes to be as popular as   (a villain in   that aired on Doordarshan).

  The actress says that she has got a chance to work with some of the "most popular vamps" in film and TV industry. â€œEarlier, we had actresses like Manorama ji and   ji who were popular for playing negative characters. Both were excellent actors and I had an opportunity to work with both of them," says Urvashi.
 
  Urvashi has been working as an actor since her childhood. Talking about the changes that have come in the TV industry over years, she says that the biggest change is the investment. "The grand and larger than life sets and concepts on TV require a big budget. These mega-budget shows are a great platform for actors, but it creates a lot of pressure. When actors know that a huge amount is being pumped in, there is a lot of pressure and responsibility to do their best and make those shows work," says Urvashi.
 
  The actress was in Delhi for a day and the only thing on her mind was to eat chhole bhature. "I came to Delhi in a 'pre-Metro era', so it's been really long. I have been craving for chhole bhature and every time someone told me in Mumbai that they were coming to Delhi, I would ask them to get me chhole bhature, but no one got it for me," says Urvashi.
