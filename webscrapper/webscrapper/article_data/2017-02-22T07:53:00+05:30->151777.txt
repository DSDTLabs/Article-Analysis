Gurgaon: As ceiling prices for   stents have been fixed, manufacturers have been instructed to keep the food and drug administration ( ) in the loop about the   they are producing and their prices. 

 Teams set up by the Haryana food and drugs department carried out inspections at hospitals in Gurgaon, Sonipat and Panchkula on Monday to ensure that the order to fix the stent prices was being followed and at the same time there was no shortage in supply or overpricing taking place at any level. 
 
 In Gurgaon, an FDA official told TOI that they are in touch with hospitals —  ,  ,  ,   and   — in a bid to keep a vigil on the demand of the coronary stents. 
 
 “As on date, there is ample stock of stents but if anyone faces any problem, be it shortage or overcharging, they can inform the state FDA,” said Amandeep Chauhan, food and drugs control officer in Gurgaon. 
 
 According to an order by the national pharmaceutical pricing authority (NPPA), the government has fixed the prices of the basic coronary stents and drug eluting stents between Rs 7,260 and Rs 29,600. 
 
 Notably, the manufacturers will submit a price list of the stents manufactured to state drug controllers. While the medical institutions will have to mention the price and brand of the stent in the patient’s bill, the manufacturers can only add local taxes in the final MRP. Any manufacturer or medical institution who will be found overcharging than the ceiling price will have to deposit the overcharged amount along with the interest to the FDA.
