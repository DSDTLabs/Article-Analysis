PATNA: Political heat is soaring in the state ahead of Makar Sankranti. While, unlike in the past, opposition RJD and Congress will not hold ‘dahi-chura’ feasts, all the four constituents of the ruling NDA – JD (U), BJP, LJP and RLSP – are gearing up to celebrate the festival in a big way.

 It’s after a gap of five years that BJP functionaries and workers will participate in the ‘dahi-chura’   organised by JD (U)’s state president Bashishtha Narayan Singh. While RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s family will not be organising the feast, CM Nitish Kumar has been invited for the event at LJP’s state headquarters here.
 
 “It is for the first time that a grand ‘dahi-chura’ feast is being organised at LJP state headquarters on Airport Road. Party president Ram Vilas Paswan will be present in the feast along with senior functionaries from all parties, including CM Nitish Kumar,” LJP state president Pashupati Kumar Paras said.
 
 Another keenly awaited ‘dahi-chura’ feast will be organised by JD (U) state president Singh at his 36, Hardinge Road residence on Sunday. The CM is also likely to participate in the feast along with several Union ministers from BJP. The last time BJP functionaries participated in ‘dahi-chura’ feast at Singh’s residence was in 2013, when JD (U) and BJP were running the NDA-II government in the state.
 
 “Makar Sankranti is a community festival, which unites people. Apart from functionaries of JD (U) and BJP, we have also sent invitations to several Union ministers for the feast,” Singh said. JD (U) sources said party workers from across the state would bring curd, beaten rice, tilkut and other items for the feast.
 
 While BJP will not organise any party-level event on Makar Sankranti, its MLC Rajnish Kumar will hold a feast at his Patna residence on January 14. “I have invited all state ministers and the CM for the feast in which more than 500 people will participate,” Kumar said.
