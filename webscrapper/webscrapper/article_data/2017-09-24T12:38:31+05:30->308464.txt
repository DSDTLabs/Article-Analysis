 This is the third eviction by the corporation in a span of three weeks after the evictions in Nerkundram and Aminjikarai. The civic body is aiming at removing as many settlements as they can before the   strikes the city.
 
 On Friday, following the eviction drive, the civic body began the demolition of the houses of those evicted. 
 
 “Remaining 20-odd families from this stretch would be evicted on Monday. The fifteen families who have been evicted have been resettled at Slum Clearance Board tenements in Perumbakkam,” said a corporation official but did not explain why the evicted were not housed in the Nochikuppam tenements that are at Marina Beach next to the Light House.
 
 The corporation is focusing on the dismantling of settlements across waterways such as Cooum River ahead of the monsoon thereby wreaking havoc among the people settled on the banks of these rivers.
 
 Settlers of Srinivasapuram have, in the past, resisted eviction as they are a group that depends on fishing to earn a living.
