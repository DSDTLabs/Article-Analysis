NEW DELHI: With the   population evolving into a critical votebank and the municipal elections likely in April, the AAP-led Delhi government has made plans to woo such voters by adding new   for   Puja this year.

 The flood and irrigation department, in a meeting with MLAs in February, will zero in on locations where new ghats can be created and also chalk out plans for refurbishing and improving the existing ones.
 
 Minister Gopal Rai said that a committee will prepare a proposal based on which the financial requirements will be made. He indicated that this plan may require budgetary allocation as a separate head in the 2017-18 budget.
 
  The number of Chhath ghats had increased from 69 in 2014 to over 208 in 2016. Earlier, when TOI had asked water minister   if the increase in ghats were aimed at winning over a critical constituency, he had sidestepped a direct answer.
