 For the uninitiated, one of Siddharth's friends, Somi Saxena had posted a message on Facebook, which was later deleted, seeking help to look for Siddharth.
 
 She has written in her post, “You guys remember him Siddharth Sagar aka selfie Mausi urf Naseer this guy is missing since 4 months last seen on 18 November 2017. Nobody knows where he is. He is my very good friend please help me find him spread this as much as u can.”
 
 According to a portal, Siddharth's friend was quoted saying that since she wanted to pressurize Siddharth's mother to let her talk to him, that's why she had put up the post. She finally managed to speak to him and Siddharth informed her that he is fine and will meet her in two days.
 
 While his mother stated that Siddharth was out of the limelight because he was suffering from Dengue, his father had denied that statement.
