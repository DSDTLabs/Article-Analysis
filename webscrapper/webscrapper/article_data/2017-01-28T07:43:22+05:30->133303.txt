CHENNAI:   (DRI) officials on Friday arrested at   a passenger who was carrying the equivalent of 77 lakh in foreign currency notes . 

 Two of the bundles were tightly packed and wrapped with tape and hidden in his rectum. Other bundles were in his baggage.
 
 The passenger, identified as Yousuf Shahul Hameed, was scheduled to travel to Singapore by Scoot Airlines flight TZ501, DRI officials said. He was carrying an assortment of foreign currency notes, including Australian dollars, US dollars, Canada dollars, euros, pounds, francs, Singapore dollars, Malaysian ringgits, Saudi and Qatari riyals.
 
 The DRI officials had received specific information about currency notes being smuggled from Chennai to Singapore and Malaysia and had been keeping a close watch on suspicious movements. Concealing pouches in body cavities is a common tactic used by couriers, officials said. But the wide variety of currency notes that the courier caught on Friday had been carrying came as a big surprise, they added.
 
 A DRI official said that Hameed could not produce any documents for legal purchase and possession of the foreign currency and as the amount was above the permitted limit, it was seized and he was arrested under the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962 and the Baggage Rules, 2016 read with Foreign Exchange Management (Import and Export of Currency) Regulations, 2015.
 
 Further investigation is on to find out if he was acting alone or was part of an organised racket.
