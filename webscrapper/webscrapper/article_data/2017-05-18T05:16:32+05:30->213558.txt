MUMBAI: As construction work for Mumbai’s Metro-III commences on Thursday, brace for traffic congestions on important road junctions in the coming days. Traffic police officials have issued diversions and curbs which will come into effect from Thursday till phase-1 work is completed. The long-haul curbs and an impending monsoon are likely to wreak havoc on Mumbai’s already congested roads.

 Deputy commissioner of police (western-traffic) Sanjay Jadhav said that temporary arrangements have been made and they will come into effect from Thursday till phase-1 is completed for smooth flow of traffic movement.
 
 The Metro work notification says that construction of Hutatma Chowk station on DN Road; Kalbadevi and Girgaum stations on JSS Road; MIDC station in Andheri; and Worli station on Dr Annie Besant Road will be done in phase-1. Lane-shifting work on Dnyaneshwar Marg in BKC and at international and domestic airports will also be carried out in the first phase.
