 For Rajnath Singh, it appears it was Nizamabad and not the princely state of Hyderabad that was liberated on this day 69 years ago. In his speech at the Sankalp Diwas public meeting, he kept saying it was the people of Nizamabad who wanted to be liberated from the tyranny of the Nizams.“Nizamabad people wanted merger with India. But some forces in Nizamabad wanted it to be a separate country or be merged with Pakistan,“ he said.
