BHUBANESWAR:   emerged the latest giantkillers from the North-East region in the ongoing Super Cup, overcoming a two-goal deficit to stun   3-2 here on Friday.

 
 David James’ Blasters were in cruise control, comfortably sitting on a two-goal advantage until the final 20 minutes of the game. Neroca completely altered the complexion of the game scoring three goals in a span of 12 minutes and joined fellow I-League teams Aizawl FC and Lajong FC in the last-8 stage. Only two ISL teams have made it to the quarterfinals.
 
 Neroca will take on Bengaluru FC in the final quarterfinal, scheduled to be played here on April 13.
 
 During the pre-match press conference, Neroca FC coach Gift Raikhan had urged his players to go a giant-killing act, insisting that Aizawl and Lajong’s progress had put the team under pressure. 
 
 And Neroca’s fascinating fightback was straight from the book of Lajong, who similarly came from 0-2 down to beat FC Pune City 3-2. On Friday, it all started with Man-of-the-Match Jean Joachim’s goal in the 70th minute when the Frenchman fired home in a goalmouth melee following Pritam Singh’s corner.
 
 Sethu FC continue winning streak: Sethu FC continued their rich vein of form in the Indian Women's Football League as they defeated Indira Gandhi Academy for Sports and Education 3-1 at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Shillong, Meghalaya on Friday. Indumathi’s 27th minute strike and Bangladesh international Sabina Khatun's brace helped Sethu FC gather three points after Pradeepa Sekar had pulled a goal back in the 35th minute.
