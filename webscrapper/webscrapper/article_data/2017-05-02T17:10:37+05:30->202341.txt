AGRA: A five-foot-long   was rescued by the   after it was found entangled in a synthetic net outside a nursery in Geeta Nagar located near Itmad daulah, Agra. The snake was released back into its natural habitat shortly.

 Workers from a nursery in Geeta Nagar were shocked to find a large rat snake, inextricably tangled in a net fence. The distressed snake was attempting to extricate itself from the synthetic mesh but without much success. The startled workers rushed to inform the staff, who in turn contacted the Wildlife SOS Rapid Response Unit on their 24-hour rescue helpline (9917109666).
 
 A three-member team was promptly dispatched to the location and upon arrival requested the staff to maintain a safe distance from the agitated snake so as to avoid any unnecessary accidents. After 30 minutes, they managed to successfully extricate the five foot long snake with utmost care and transferred in to a safety container.
 
  
 
 
 Baiju Raj MV, director conservation projects, Wildlife SOS, said, “Rat snakes are a highly adaptable species. Being a non-venomous snake species, they are harmless to human beings and they mostly feed on rodents, lizards, birds and small mammals. The rising temperatures often force snakes to move out of their natural habitat to find reprieve from the heat and exhaustion.”
 
 After an examination from the veterinarians it was found to be fit for release and therefore was released back in its natural habitat shortly after.
 
 Geeta Seshamani, co-founder of Wildlife SOS, said, "Synthetic netting in gardens, swimming pools and football fields cause thousands of fatalities to wildlife. Unsuspecting reptiles, birds and small mammals often get entangled and trapped and choke to death. Our team had to be extremely careful while untangling the snake so as to avoid causing any further stress to the reptile.”
