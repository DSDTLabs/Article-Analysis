CHANDIGARH: A local court has sentenced a sweeper to one-year imprisonment for filming a doctor while she was changing her clothes in   ( ), Sector 32, around three years ago.

 The matter dates back to May 30, 2015 when a police compliant was lodged by the hospital administration regarding the use of a mobile phone video camera for recording in the female changing room of the hospital. According to the complaint, the mobile phone was kept in a used linen basket, which was noticed by a doctor on duty, when she went to the changing room. The camera was found to be in a recording mode and had recorded more than two hours of footage. The doctor spotted the phone and informed the authorities. Later, it was found that the mobile phone belonged to sweeper Nirmal Lal. He was arrested later and booked under Sections 354 B, 354 C and 511 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 67 of IT Act.
 
 The defence counsel argued he was falsely implicated in the case. But after the arguments, the court held him guilty.
