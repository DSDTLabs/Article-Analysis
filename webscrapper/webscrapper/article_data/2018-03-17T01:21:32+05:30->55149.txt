MUMBAI: The   has recorded a 450% jump in use of online civic services.

 The civic body said that citizens’ use of   for renewing shop licences, procuring health   or fire NOCs in the current financial year of 2017-18 till February shot up to 4.1 lakh from 74,511 in 2016-17. 
 
 The revenue collections through online services have multiplied to Rs 353 crore from Rs 8 crore in the previous financial year.
 
 The BMC put up 28 of its services online, including procuring licences for shops and establishments, water connection, marriage registration, permissions for festivals such as Navratri and Ganpati, among others, three years ago. The move was aimed at improving its ranking in the   Survey for ease of doing business. 
 
 The city plays a key role in setting new benchmarks for investor-friendly initiatives given that the World Bank study is based on the indices here and in Delhi. 
 
 In the 2017 report, the country witnessed a significant jump in its ranking to 100th from 130th last year. The study assesses almost 190 world economies based on parameters such as starting a business, dealing with permits, registering a property and paying taxes. In the last week of February, ahead of World Bank rankings for investor-friendly destinations, municipal chief Ajoy Mehta was called by the Prime Minister’s Office ( ) in New Delhi to list out measures the BMC had taken under the ease of doing business policy. 
 
 A senior civic official, though, said the sole aim of putting up civic services online was to reduce the number of citizens heading to BMC offices. “We wanted to cut any kind of human interference and ensure that citizens do everything online. Many a times, citizens too have complained of harassment and having to shift from one table to another. With the dramatic rise in the number of citizens who use online services, we hope that they also benefit of it,” said the official.
