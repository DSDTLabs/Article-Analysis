DHANBAD: The   division of Dhanbad has launched an online grievance management system "Suvidha" for its employees, wherein they can register their complaints and grievances such as discrepancy in salary, increments,   issues, transfers and promotions. The new system was welcomed by the 22,000 employees of Dhanbad division, who otherwise had to come from distant places like Singrauli or Chopan to report any trouble. 

 The problems will be addressed by the   and the complainant will be updated about the status of the complaint on the website. The employees will be able to check the status of their grievances with the help of an unique registration number sent to their personal number.
 
 Employees who are unable to use the online system will have to submit their grievances in the Suvidha Kendra of the divisional office. Those using smart phones can also register their grievances on Facebook id Srdpodhnecr or tweet to @SrDpodhanbad. An email id personneldepttdhn@gmail.com has also been generated by the personnel department to serve the purpose.
 
 Public relation officer (PRO) Sanjay Prasad told TOI that the division receives hundreds of grievances every month and its manual submission is a very tedious process. He added that employees of distant posts were forced to take leave to register their complaints. The new system will prove to be beneficial for them, he said.
 
 Central organising secretary of East Central   (ECRKU) Rajesh Kumar said the demand of an online system was pending for the last 3 years. "In the era of Facebook and WhatsApp, there is no point using the manual system," Kumar said.
