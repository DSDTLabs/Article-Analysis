NEW DELHI: A day after high-decibel rhetoric dominated the airwaves between African diplomats and MEA over the recent attacks on African students in  , silence prevailed on Tuesday with both sides stepping back from the public glare to allow diplomacy and law enforcement to do their job. 

  The government believes it has been able to contain the protests and their political fallout, after a detailed but somewhat stern press statement on Monday. While several African countries pleaded ignorance about the press statement by the dean of African missions (in this case, the ambassador of  ) threatening to take India to the  , the fact that a group representing African students echoed the call to condemn India in international fora is a matter of concern for India going forward. 
 
  Ultimately, sources said, its not only a law and order problem. There is a need to develop greater sensitivity among Indian communities about foreigners of a different skin colour and cultural backgrounds living in their midst. Equally, there is a need to sensitise African students about the communities they live in, with a greater involvement of law enforcement agencies. 
 
  In the last couple of mon- ths, India has had high level exchanges with African countries, with the King of  , PM of   and vice-president of   visiting India, while Indian leaders have travelled to Uganda, Rwa- nda, Nigeria, Mali, Ghana etc.
