HYDERABAD: Hyderabad has lost its natural capacity to drain rainwater. The stagnation of rainwater in many places in recent pre-monsoon thunderstorm showed that natural channels that convey the rainwater into river   or lakes have either been encroached upon or wiped out. Even places close to river Musi or mega lakes like   could not drain even 4 cm of rainfall spread over two to three hours.

 
 Scientific analysis and satellite imagery revealed the disturbance to natural system of drainage of rainfall in the city last week. Amberpet received the maximum rainfall of 4.88 cm on May 17, but the rainwater could not be drained, though the locality sits right on the banks of river Musi. The roads in many localities were flooded and it took several hours for the rainwater to gradually recede into Musi.
 
 
  
 
  received 4.20 cm of rainfall. Narayanaguda forms part of the catchment of river Musi through the outfall channel of Hussainsagar lake. But, the area was also inundated, thanks to the city losing the natural ability to drain rainwater.
 
 Khairatabad sits on the banks of Hussainsagar and   stream. The area received 4.13 cm rainfall, but neither Balkapur stream nor Hussainsagar lake could help prevent inundation of areas in Khairatabad. The reason being several encroachments have come up on Balkapur stream and the topography of the area has changed after formation of Necklace Road and construction of structures.
 
 Nampally is part of the Hussainsagar catchment. A little more than 4 cm rainfall could not be drained into the lake. Musheerabad, which falls under Musi catchment, could not withstand a rainfall of 3.58 cm.
 
 Interestingly, all the major localities that received heavy rainfall on May 17 fall under either Musi catchment or a major lake. The entire rainfall runoff could have been taken up by the water bodies.
