GURUGRAM: Residents of   and  , two societies in Sector 49, took the protest path on Wednesday against a CNG bunk that is likely to be set up in a green belt on   near  .

 Armed with banners and placards, around 60 people came out on the road in the morning and shouted slogans against Huda, which reportedly allotted a 3000sqm plot for setting up a   near Sispal Vihar. They demanded that the proposed fuel bunk be shifted away from the residential area. 
 
 “According to norms, a CNG pump cannot be set up within a 100-metre diameter of a residential or a commercial complex. It is completely illegal as the distance between the proposed station and swimming pool of our society is not even 10 metre. It is a threat to the safety of residents,” said Ved Yadav, a resident of South City-II, a plotted residential colony.
 
 Pratibha Sharma, who has been living in South City-II for 12 years, said: “We had bought the property here because of the greenery surrounding the area. However, over the years, green belts have been destroyed. Now, a CNG pump is coming up. The area will become non-livable.”
 
 Shilpa Goyal, a resident of Sispal Vihar, said, “The approaching road to our colony is already so congested. The CNG pump will make the road inaccessible.”
 
 The residents submitted a memorandum to the DC and warned of a massive protest if the CNG station was set up in the area. “We went to meet the DC and he has promised that the pump location will be changed,” KK Singh from South City-II RWA said.
 
 “The land has been allocated as per law. However, we can look into the matter if there is any complaint,” said a Huda official.
