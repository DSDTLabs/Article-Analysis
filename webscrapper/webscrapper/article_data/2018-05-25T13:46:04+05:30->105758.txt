RAJKOT:A Rajkot based industrialist is facing family court’s ire for not paying extra alimony to his second wife as per court’s order. 

 
 Court on Wednesday seized industrialist Vinod Jagani’s (63) car for not obeying its order and paying extra alimony money to his wife Meenaxi (54).
 
 According to case details, Janagi’s first wife   died in 1997 after 20 years of marriage due to some illness. Jasmina’s family members got Jasmina’s cousin Meenaxi to marry   but no formal function was held. Meenaxi claimed that she lived with Jagani for three years but returned to her maternal house alleging physical and mental harassment. 
 
 Jagani had a son from his first marriage who died in an accident few years back and the son’s wife and daughter shifted to Mumbai.
 
 Meenaxi approached the court seeking alimony from Jagani. The court ordered Jagani to pay Meenaxi Rs 8,500 per month. 
 
 Meenaxi’s advocate Tarun Kothari told TOI that “Jagani filed a family suit in 2012 claiming that Meenaxi was not his wife as he had never married her. So we moved an application requesting court to order him to pay interim alimony and advocate’s fees. 
 
 Court ordered him to pay Rs 5,000 more but Jagani defaulted on it and approached high court challenging the family court order. He however withdrew the petition. Currently Rs 2.55 lakh payment is outstanding from Jagani. So when he did not pay the amount ordered by court, it seized his car.”
 
 Jagani owns a bungalow on   and has office on old   in Rajkot city.
