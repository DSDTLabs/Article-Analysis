BENGALURU: If a creative writing programme is only as good as its teachers, then the masterclass with   worth giving a shot. Starting as an intern at Feminist Press, Hook has grown to become senior editor of the New Yorkbased educational nonprofit organization.

 In her years at Feminist Press, Hook as an editor has acquired fiction titles in translation from Equatorial Guinea, Thailand, Poland, Uruguay, Mexico, and  , among others. She also edits FP’s lead fiction titles, including the queer imprint Amethyst Editions and winners of the Louise Meriwether  , FP’s annual debut writing prize for women and nonbinary writers of colour.
 
 
 Feminist writing is going to be the focus of Hook’s masterclass titled Writing For Women. She said, “I am excited to be participating in the Times LitFest. It’s crucial for publishers from around the world to meet and learn from one another. Only in this way can we overcome cultural silos and uplift the most necessary voices to effect change.” Hook will be assisted by literary agent Helen Mangham.
