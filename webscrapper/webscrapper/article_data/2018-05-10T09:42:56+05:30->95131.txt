HYDERABAD: Worried that over 3.50 lakh taps receiving Godavari water might go dry in certain areas of Hyderabad city, Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) officials said they will install emergency pumps near   barrage to tap the river’s water for fresh supplies to Hyderabad.

 
  officials are particularly worried about parts of KPHB, Qutubullapur, Alwal and Malkakgiri   peripheral circles.
 
 This is the second time that the Water Board is installing emergency pumping station after 2016 at Yellampally.
 
 Godavari Drinking Water Supply Project phase-I, was commissioned in 2015 supplying 85 million gallons of water per day (MGD). At present, its supplying 132 MGD to the city and four GHMC peripheral circles.
 
 “Out of 132 MGD, water board is supplying 38 MGD to enroute villages under ‘Mission Bhagiratha, and 94 MGD is supplied to areas located in Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Divisions-VI, IX, XII and XIII on alternate days,” a HMWS&SB source said.
 
 The board has a provision to supply 172 MGD water (assured quantity), but keeping in view huge monthly power bills they are receiving from  , supplies will be restricted for 132 to 140 MGD.
 
 Director, Transmission at HMWS&SB, B Vijay Kumar Reddy said, “Last year today, the water level was 472 meters. By the end of this month, the water level may go down further, but depend upon the withdrawls.”
 
 The Water Board is making arrangements for installing emergency pumping at Puttamgandi (Nalgonda district), tapping point for Krishna water, after water levels dipped at Nagarjunasagar reservoir. Officials are also gearing up to set up emergency pumping on similar lines at Puttamgandi at Yellapally barrage to draw Godavari water.
 
 “There should be no interruption in Godavari water supplies to city and GHMC periphery. Consumers need not worry,” Reddy said.
