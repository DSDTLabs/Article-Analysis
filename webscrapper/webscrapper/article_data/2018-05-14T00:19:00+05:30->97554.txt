Visakhapatnam: Arrangements are in place to conduct intermediate theory supplementary examinations from May 14, said regional inspection officer of Board of Intermediate Education, P Nagesh Kumar. 

 Speaking to journalists here on Sunday, Nagesh Kumar said that about 38,000 students, from both first and second year, will take the supplementary exams. “We have set up a total of 67 examination centres in the district, including 46 in the urban area, 14 in the rural area and seven in the Agency area. The exams would be conducted under closed-circuit camera surveillance. Three flying squads and six sitting squads will be deputed for the exams,” said Nagesh Kumar.
 
 He further added that they have provided drinking water and medical aid facility at all the examination centres.
 
  “Even the ORS sachets were made available at the exam centres. We have requested the Discom to provide 24x7 electricity to these centres. 
 
 “We have selected exam centres in such a manner that even heavy rain would not impact the examination proceedings,” said Nagesh Kumar.
 
 Nagesh Kumar advised the students to reach the examination centres half an hour early to avoid last minute chaos.
 
  “The students, who did not pay the fee for supplementary examinations or want to change their subjects, can even now pay the fees and get immediate hall tickets,” added Nagesh Kumar.
