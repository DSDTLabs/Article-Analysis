CHENNAI: The Madras   on Tuesday granted conditional anticipatory bail to disqualified AIADMK legislators P Vetrivel and Thanga Tamil Selvan who apprehended arrest in connection with a case registered against them for allegedly preventing police from discharging their duties at the secretariat on March 1.

 While allowing the applications moved by the two, Justice A D Jagadish Chandra directed them to appear before the Tallakulam police in Madurai daily for two weeks.
 
 According to the petitioners, after the internal split in the AIADMK, they joined the faction led by V K Sasikala and T T V Dinakaran, due to which they were disqualified as MLAs. On March 1, they visited the secretariat to meet government officials in connection with the alleged irregularities in awarding tenders for major road projects in the state.
 
 “When Selvan went inside the secretariat, Vetrivel was surrounded by the media present near the main gate of the secretariat. As he was attempting to address the media regarding his visit, two inspectors posted at the gate rushed towards him, abused him in filthy language and physically manhandled him. Vetrivel tried to convince the police personnel that he was only doing his lawful duty but his attempt did not bear any fruit. Selvan was not present near the gate throughout the incident,” counsel for the petitioners said.
