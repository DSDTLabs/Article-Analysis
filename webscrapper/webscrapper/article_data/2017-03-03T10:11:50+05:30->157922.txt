PUNE: In a big relief to Camp residents, the Pune Cantonment Board ( ) has approved a resolution to increase the   (FSI) from 1 to 2 for civil areas.

 The decision was passed in a special board session and covered in the list the Mundhwa industrial area which also generates huge revenue for PCB. However, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and Defence Estates department would take the final call on the FSI limits.
 
 Changing the limits has been a long-standing issue. Many were unable to adequately renovate their houses due to the norms. Locals and elected members said that a number of residents had moved out of Cantonment areas due to the problem.
 
 Some respite arrived in the past year with defence minister Manohar Parrikar approving retroactive FSI for pre-1984 house owners. But the demand of an increased FSI was left hanging, despite assurances.
 
 “The existing limits are outdated. People who want to renovate their ageing residences are unable to do so as per the original dimensions. If the new limits are approved, it will be a great relief,” said a senior PCB official.
 
 The proposal has come in less than a month before the new Cantonment building byelaws come into effect. However, according to sources in the Defence Estates department, a decision finalising the FSI limits may not be expected from the MoD in a month’s time.
 
 “The   process is tedious and will involve examination by senior MoD officials. Thus, the decision won’t come through before the new byelaws come into play. This clause can be added later to the byelaws with an amendment,” said a senior defence estates official of the Southern Command.
 
 The official added that the government would decide the final FSI limit.
 
 “It is agreed upon that the FSI needs to change, especially in the Pune Cantonment, due to its burgeoning population. The board has fixed it at 2.0. But, it can also be 1.50 or 1.75 for the civil areas. It depends on the Centre’s assessment of the situation,” he said.
