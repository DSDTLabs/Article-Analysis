NEW DELHI: Soon after Karnataka reached the final of the   after beating Maharashtra on Saturday the management got a message from one of their teammates from South Africa. It was   asking if he could play in the final. He then shared his travel details with the team management after the selection panel approved his name.

 
 Around seven on Monday morning, Rahul landed in Bangalore from Cape Town via Dubai, spent a couple of hours at home and then took a 4 pm flight to Delhi to join his state team in the evening. Such commitment isn’t new to cricket but the fact that it still exists, adds value to the game.
 
 This isn’t the only story from Karnataka camp. Their opener and 2018 domestic season’s run machine,  , who has crossed 2000 runs this season, didn’t figure in the Indian team for the Sri Lankan tri-series, despite several big players having been given rest. But Mayank seemed unaffected by it on Monday – smiling, enjoying the net session and focused on the big final against Saurashtra.
