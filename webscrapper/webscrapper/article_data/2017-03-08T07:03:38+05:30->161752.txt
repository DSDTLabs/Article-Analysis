AHMEDABAD: ‘That short dress isn’t meant for your thunder thighs!’ ‘Why do you want a fitted t-shirt, find something loose to hide your curves!’ ‘You’re plus size, dress accordingly!’ – These are among the many comments that pull women down for being  . With the notion that lean and skinny models with flat tummies, pert butts and slim thighs are the ideal of ‘desirable’ and ‘beautiful’ in the industry, the city’s   are set to break stereotypes and blaze new trends in plus-size fashion.

 “One has to be comfortable in their own skin and the key is accepting yourself the way you are. I wasn’t this positive about it either, I had my share of setbacks and experiences during my teenage year, in addition to observing those of others,” says 42-year-old Falguni Vasavada-Oza, a professor who recently began her microblog on plus-size fashion.
 
 “As I read and interacted more on this, I could do away with pre-conceived notions to become ‘body-positive’ from being body shy. Ever since, I’ve been vocal about it at various forums. The idea was to raise the happiness quotient by making a style statement no matter what your size is, instead of being depressed about it,” said Oza.
 
 With the prevailing mindsets of flawless female bodies with narrow waistlines, body shaming has become rampant, especially on social media. Even popular singer, Adele, was not spared and was criticized time and again for not having a the narrowest of waists. Along with women activists, bloggers in Ahmedabad are also out to push the boundaries.
 
 Another fashion blogger, Falguni Patel, said, “I’ve been writing on fashion for eight years largely driven by personal experiences and those of friends. I despise body shaming and the idea is to make women and others understand that their size and shape doesn’t limit them from experimenting. If fashion shows can celebrate, plus-sized and even pregnant women on the ramp, it calls for embracing the change.”
